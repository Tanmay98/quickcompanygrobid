Madhav Pawar and accused No.28 Pandurang s/o. Maroti

Being aggrieved by the Judgment and Order dated 30 th 

June, 2011 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, 

Nilanga in Sessions Case No. 14/2008, three separate 

Appeal are filed by the convicted accused, by the State and 

the original complainant. 

7] 
The learned counsel appearing for the 

appellants in Criminal Appeal No.414/2011, submitted 

that, the Court below has not at all properly appreciated the 

evidence on record causing miscarriage of justice. It is 

submitted that, the prosecution has miserably failed to 

prove its case against the appellants beyond reasonable 

doubt. It is submitted that, it is doubtful if the so called eye 

witnesses could discern the overt acts in the darkness. 

There are manifold contradictions and omissions which 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:38 ::: 


414.11crapl 
19 

completely demolished the evidence of the socalled eye 

witnesses. It is further submitted that, the injuries on the 

deceased were not possible by the weapons allegedly used. 

This is demonstrated from the evidence of the Doctor. It is 

also submitted that, blood group on the clothes of accused 

and weapons do not tally with the blood group of the 

injured. The blood group on the sword seized from accused 

-Shivaji and on the clothes is "O". Shivaji did not assault 

PW25 Vijaykumar, whose blood group is "A". It is further 

submitted that, the weapons allegedly used have not been 

seized. Blood group of deceased is "O' but blood of group 

"O" is not detected on the soil seized from the spot. 

8] 
The learned counsel appearing for the 

appellants submits that, in fact, it was not possible for the 

alleged eye witnesses to watch accused and his overt acts 

since according to the prosecution case, mob of 40 accused 

gathered at the alleged spot of the incident. According to 

the prosecution case, 39 accused formed unlawful assembly 

and villagers from the village also gathered near the spot of 

incident. It is submitted that, the trial Court was not 

correct in placing reliance on the version of the prosecution 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:38 ::: 


414.11crapl 
20 

witnesses since there are inherent omissions, contradictions 

and exaggeration. It is submitted that, the complainant has 

not attributed any overt act to accused Namdeo, and 

therefore, he deserves to be given benefit of doubt. It is 

submitted that, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of 

Masalti vs. State of Uttar Pradesh 1 held that, when the 

prosecution alleges unlawful assembly of more than 5 

persons, in such a case it would be unsafe to place reliance 

on the evidence of one witness, but there should be more 

than two witnesses for incident. It is submitted that, the 

prosecution case suffers from inherent contradictions, 

omissions and improvements, and therefore, the benefit of 

doubt deserves to be given to the appellants. The learned 

counsel invited our attention to the evidence of prosecution 

witnesses, and also the medical evidence and submits that, 

the evidence of prosecution witnesses if examined in the 

light of the admissions given in their cross examinations, 

and the portion marked in police statement, it unequivocally 

indicates that, the presence of the appellants was doubtful, 

and also there are no corresponding injuries traced out in 

the medical evidence so as to sustain conviction of the 

1 AIR 1965 SC 202;

appellants. It is submitted that, if the version of the 

prosecution witnesses about accused -Vilas is carefully 

perused, the overt act attributed to him by his alleged 

assault by stick, there are no corresponding injuries as it is 

evident from the evidence of PW28 Medical Officer. 

Therefore, the learned counsel appearing for the appellants 

relying upon the grounds taken in the appeal memo, 

relevant provisions of Indian Penal Code and the Evidence 

Act and also notes of evidence would submit that, the 

appellants deserve to be acquitted. 

9] 
The learned counsel appearing for the appellant 

submits that, it has come in the evidence of prosecution 

witnesses [PW22Shahuraj] injured eye witness that, Vilas 

Kadaji had assaulted Shahuraj Pawar by stick on his left 

shoulder and stomach. However, the injury certificate at 

Exh. 301 of said injured Shahuraj Pawar does not at all 

show any injury on the left shoulder and stomach of injured 

Shahuraj Pawar. Moreover, the injuries shown is 'incised 

wound penetrating' by hard and sharp weapon. Manifestly, 

the stick is not hard and sharp weapon. It is also submitted 

that, it has come in the evidence of prosecution witnesses

414.11crapl

[PW25 Vijaykumar] injured eye witness that, Vilas Kadaji 

had assaulted Vijaykumar by stick on his head. However, 

the injury certificate [Exh.303] of said injured Vijaykumar, 

does not at all show any injury by stick on the head of the 

said Vijaykumar. The injuries caused to him are all 'Incised 

penetrating wounds' caused by hard and sharp weapon, and 

none are on the head. 
Considering above mentioned 

medical certificates, the prosecution evidence of injured eye 

witnesses PW22 and 25 in respect of accused No.11 -Vilas 

is clearly falsified by the medical evidence i.e. Injury 

certificates. 

10] 
The learned counsel appearing for the 

respondent -accused in Criminal Appeal No.602/2012 

submits that, it has come in the evidence of prosecution 

witnesses / injured eye witnesses that, Ashok Kadaji had 

assaulted Sheshrao Pawar by 'Katti' on the right leg shin of 

Sheshrao Pawar. However, the injury certificate of said 

injured Sheshrao Pawar, does not at all show any injury on 

the leg of injured Sheshrao Pawar. It is further submitted 

that, it has come in the evidence of prosecution witnesses / 

injured eye witnesses that, Prakash Kadaji had assaulted

414.11crapl

Shahuraj Pawar by iron rod on his back. However, the 

injury certificate of said injured Shahuraj Pawar does not at 

all show any injury by iron rod on the back of the said 

Shahuraj Pawar. The injury caused to him is incised wound 

caused by hard and sharp weapon. Considering above 

mentioned medical certificates, the prosecution evidence of 

injured eye witnesses in respect of accused Nos. 12 and 30 

is clearly falsified by the medical evidence i.e. injury 

certificates. 

11] 
The learned counsel Mr. R.S. Shinde appearing 

for the respondent -original accused Nos.4, 12, 30 & 34 

further submitted that, if the entire evidence on record is 

considered, the presence of the accused Nos.4, 12, 30 & 34 

is doubtful, and therefore, they deserves to be given benefit 

of doubt. 

12] 
The learned counsel Mr. T.M.Venjane appearing 

for the respondent -accused Nos. 2, 5 to 10, 15, 16, 19, 21 

to 24, 26 to 28, 33 and 35 submits that, none of the 

witnesses have named these accused in their deposition 

before the Court. It is further submitted that, the presence 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:38 ::: 


414.11crapl 
24 

of these accused persons is not established by the 

prosecution at the spot of occurrence. 
It is further 

submitted that, when the presence itself is not established, 

further question of any overt act on behalf of the said 

accused would not arise. Therefore, he submits that, the 

order of acquittal passed by the trial Court, giving benefit of 

doubt deserves no interference. 

13] 
The learned counsel Mrs. M.A. Kulkarni 

appearing for the accused -respondent Nos. 3, 14, 17, 18, 

20, 25, 29, 31 and 32 submits that, the trial Court after 

appreciating the entire evidence on record, reached to the 

correct conclusion and acquitted the accused. The view 

taken by the trial Court is possible, and therefore, this 

Court may not interfere in the acquittal order. 
It is 

submitted that, evidence of the prosecution witnesses is not 

consistent with each other, and also suffers from the 

inherent contradictions, omissions and improvements, and 

therefore, same deserves to be discarded. It is submitted 

that, the complainant has not named all the accused in the 

complaint, and therefore, said aspect is also required to be 

considered by this Court. 
It is submitted that, the 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:38 ::: 


414.11crapl 
25 

supplementary statement of the complainant was not 

considered by the trial Court, and same was not read in the 

evidence, and therefore, this Court may not rely upon the 

said supplementary statement. 
Therefore, the learned 

counsel submits that, the Appeal filed by the State and also 

the complainant may be dismissed. 

14] 
Upon careful perusal of the findings recorded by 

the trial Court, it appears that, trial Court compared 

statements of the prosecution witnesses under Section 161 

with their depositions before the Court. It further appears 

that, trial Court instead of giving importance and due 

weightage to the substantive evidence in the nature of eye 

witnesses coupled with the medical evidence chose to acquit 

accused Vimalbai holding that the recovery of the weapon 

from her is not believable. In the present case, there is 

evidence of 11 eye witnesses and out of said witnesses, as 

many as 6 witnesses i.e. P.W. 22 to 26 sustained injuries. 

The injured witnesses Vijaykumar, Sanjay and Sheshrao, 

sustained grievous injuries, and in particular Vijaykumar 

sustained as many as 7 injuries, which could have caused 

his death in case he would not have got timely treatment.

Upon perusal of the Judgment of the trial Court, it appears 

that, trial Court totally ignored the prosecution case that, 

the accused more than 5 in numbers went to the house of 

the complainant Baburao with the deadly weapons. They 

were aggressors. They were giving slogans. Sum and 

substance of their slogans was that, they will see that, not 

even a single member of the family of the complainant is left 

alive. In furtherance of their common object to cause 

grievous hurt to the members of complainant's family, 

accused went to his house entered in the courtyard with 

deadly weapons committed criminal trespass with afore 

mentioned object and actually committed various offences. 

Therefore, it was the duty of the trial Court to address all 

the issues -points arose before it, and render the findings 

thereupon. However, as already observed, the trial Court 

even did not make an attempt to find out that, whether the 

accused persons gathered together with deadly weapons, 

they were more than 5 in numbers, they were aggressors 

inasmuch as they all went to the house of the complainant 

in the evening, they were giving slogans that, they will 

ensure that, not a single member from the family of the 

complainant is left alive. The accused had knowledge that,

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:38 ::: 


414.11crapl 
27 

such deadly weapons carried by some of the accused, would 

be used for commission of offence, which would result into 

grievous injuries, and also death and as a matter of fact, 

Gyandeo died during attack, and 6 persons were injured.

under Section 386 of Criminal Procedure Code, which reads 

thus:

Since we are deciding three Appeals, one filed by 

the convicted accused No.1 Shivaji, accused No.11 Vilas and

against the acquittal of the remaining accused and for 

enhancement of the sentence of the three convicted 

accused, and the original complainant has filed statutory 

Appeal under Section 372 of Criminal Procedure Code, and 

therefore, in view of the provisions of Section 386 of 

Criminal Procedure Code it is permissible for this Court to 

appreciate the entire evidence on record and pass the 

appropriate order as permissible within the ambit and scope 

of Section 386 of Criminal Procedure Code.

submissions advanced by the learned counsel appearing for

assistance of the learned counsel, we have carefully perused 

the entire evidence, relevant provisions and also Judgments

These Appeals raise various points for consideration

circumstances prior to occurrence of incident, which laid to

correct.

The prosecution has examined Dnyanoba Kadaji 

Sagare as PW14, who acted as panch. He stated in his 

evidence before the Court that, he came to know about 

murder of Gyandeo and then came to Jamga. Police had 

called him for panchanama at the house of Baburao Pawar. 

Baburao, Dilip, Chandrakant, Kamlakar Jadhav etc. were 

present. Baburao showed them the spot of incident. At the 

spot of incident, 5 sticks and 2 iron rods were noticed. 

There were plates, smallplates and the pot having cooked 

Mutton. One bulb was in the roof of courtyard. There was 

also bulb in the shop which part of the house. Near the 

shop by the side of road, there was bulb on electric pole. At 

two places on the earth, blood was noticed. Police collected 

blood mixed earth in two bags. Lables bearing signature of 

PW14 and another panch were affixed on the sticks and 

iron rod. Police had brought with them cameraman and he

snapped photographs of the place of incident. 
Police 

prepared panchnama at the spot and obtained his 

signature. Panchnama now shown to him is the same. It 

bears his signature. Panchnama is at Exh.225. Sticks, iron 

rods shown to him are the same, which bears their 

signatures lables. Those are articles 2 and 3. 

This witness was cross examined on behalf of 

accused Nos. 3 and 29. Through his cross examination 

defence tried to bring it on record that, this witness is 

relative of the complainant Baburao. It is true that, this 

witness has admitted that, the complainant is his brother in 

law. However, he specifically stated that, panchnama was 

effected from 7.30 to 8.30 a.m. on 10 th January, 2008. 

Place of incident is a plot admeasuring 95 x 75 sq. ft. The 

plot is located in the land of Baburao. The construction is 

at two places in that plot. Incident took place in the portion 

on backside of shop and front side of the house. The said 

vacant portion where incident took place admeasuring 25 x 

18 sq. ft. Pot containing cooked Mutton was inside the 

house. There was only one pot. There were ten dinner 

plates and 10 small plates. He has specifically denied the

suggestion that, blood lying on the earth was of crock. He 

further stated that, Police collected blood mixed earth only. 

He also stated that, he noticed sticks, also iron rods, 

however, he does not know length of such sticks and iron 

rod. In his crossexamination, he reiterated his version in 

examination in chief that, the spot panchanama is prepared 

in his presence and he has signed the same. 

According to the prosecution case, the incident 

had taken place after 7.00 p.m. and there was sufficient 

light to witness the incident, and according to defence, there 

was dark. 
Prosecution did examine PW8 Shailesh 

Narayanrao Patil, who was working as Junior Engineer with 

MSEDCL, Nilanga, Unit Rural 2 at the relevant time. In his 

examination in chief, he stated that, he is serving since 

1999. He is attached to Nilanga Unit as Junior Engineer 

since 2006. 
Police had addressed one letter dated 

29.02.2008 to his office. It is the same, shown to him. It is 

his signature on that letter. It is at Exhibit 156. He had 

given reply to that letter. It is the same shown to him. It 

bears his signature. It is at Exhibit 157. He did bring the 

Daily Load Record Register. He has given reply to the letter

of Police after referring the entry in DLR Register. In DLR 

Register there are entries of existence of electricity on 

09.01.2008. He has brought the attested copy of entry in 

DLR Register dated 09.01.2008, which is as per original, 

and which is at Exhibit 160. 

In his cross examination, nothing has been 

brought on record by the defence so as to disbelieve his 

evidence. Therefore, prosecution has proved that, there was 

electric supply available on the date of incident at the 

relevant time. To that effect Exhibit 157 has been proved by 

the prosecution through PW8. The evidence brought on 

record unequivocally indicates that, on the date of incident 

there was electric supply and as a matter of fact, at the time 

of incident, there was sufficient light, and therefore, the 

witnesses had sufficient opportunity to watch the incident 

and also to see the accused persons. As per the prosecution 

case, panel supported by accused persons did loose in the 

Gram Panchayat elections inasmuch as they could not get 

the requisite strength of elected members to have their 

control. There was an attempt on the part of the accused 

even on earlier occasions to create dispute, and as a matter

of fact threats were extended by them that, they will not 

allow to hold Gram Sabha. It has come on record through 

the prosecution witnesses that, though the election of the 

post of Sarpanch was scheduled to be held on 23.11.2007, 

however, it was postponed on next day i.e. on 24.11.2007 

due to tense situation created by the accused persons not 

allowing to hold the election on scheduled date. It is also 

relevant to mention that, accused persons are resident of 

the same village, and therefore, the witnesses knew them. 

Therefore, the question of holding identification parade for 

identifying them was not necessary, when the witnesses had 

sufficient opportunity to see the accused persons on the 

spot. 

21] 
The prosecution examined Dattatraya Narayan 

Gosavi as PW9, who was working as Gramsevak at village 

Jamga at the relevant time. His evidence is at Exhibit 168. 

He stated that, he was called by the Police in the Court on 

28 th March, 2008. The complaint was read over to him. The 

complaint was relating to the incident occurred in the village 

Jamga. Police demanded Form No. VIII regarding house of 

Baburao Bhagwan Pawar. Accordingly, he issued extract to

the Police. He stated that, the extract shown to him is the 

same, which is at Exhibit 169. He specifically denied the 

suggestion in the cross examination that, he did not issue 

VIIIA extract, as per the original to the Police. He further 

stated that, at the relevant time daughter in law of the 

complainant was Sarpanch of the village Jamga. Therefore, 

the prosecution has proved that, the house where incident 

had taken place is belonging to the complainant Baburao. 

22] 
The inquest panchanama of dead body of 

Gyandeo is at Exhibit62. The said inquest panchanama 

has been proved by the prosecution by examining Rajendra 

Pandu More as PW1, whose evidence is at Exhibit61. In 

his evidence, he stated before the Court that, on 

10.01.2008, he had been to Nilanga. On 09.01.2008 at 

11.00 p.m. he received telephonic call that, there was an 

attack on the house of his relative, and the relatives had 

come to Nilanga, and so, he came to Nilanga. He came to 

Nilanga on 10.01.2008 at Sub District Hospital at Nilanga. 

He was called by Police at 7.30 a.m. for panchanama, as he 

was relative of the complainant. The other panch Shahuraj 

Patil was also called by police. They both panch witnesses

went near the dead body of the deceased Gyandeo @ 

Dnyanoba. They saw the dead body and injuries on the 

dead body. 

23] 
He further stated that, he saw the injuries on 

the head below left ear. It was cut injury admeasuring 2 

inch. He saw the hair at the backside of the head were 

smeared with blood. He saw that, the eyes and the mouth 

of the deceased were halfopened, and there was saliva 

coming from the mouth. He saw injury on the left side of 

the chest, and it was 2 Â½ inch in the length and 0.75 inch 

deep. It was bleeding injury. He saw 2 injuries on the 

stomach. Each injury was of 1 inch. He saw the back of 

the deceased, and there were 2 injuries on the back, and 

those injuries were 1 inch length and depth. The private 

part of the deceased was intact and there was no bleeding or 

semen. There was abrasion on the shoulder. There was 

abrasion on right knee. 

24] 
He further stated that, the panchnama was 

written in their presence. It was read over to them. The 

photographs of the dead body were taken by the 

photographer. Then he himself, Shahuraj Patil signed said

panchnama. The panchnama shown to him is the same. 

The panchnama was completed between the period 7.30 

a.m. to 8.30 a.m. The contents of the panchanama are 

correct, which is at Exhibit 62. 

Upon perusal of his cross examination, it 

appears that, defence tried to bring on record that, he is 

close relative of the complainant except said admission, 

nothing useful to the defence has been brought on record by 

the prosecution so as to disbelieve evidence of said witness. 

The inquest panchnama is also proved by the prosecution 

through Investigating Officer and Shahurao Baburao Patil. 

25] 
It appears that, clothes of the deceased Gyandeo 

were seized on 10.01.2010. The panchanama to that effect 

has been prepared. The said is given Exhibit65. It appears 

that, Tanaji Nagorao Gade and Satyanarayan Pandurang 

Dapake were the panchas for the said seizure panchanama. 

Rajeshwar Dhondiba Hampalle was examined as PW3. His 

evidence is at Exhibit 94. He stated that, on 10.01.2008, he 

was present in Sub District Hospital, Nilanga when there 

was post mortem of deceased Gyandeo. He has taken the

clothes on the person of deceased in his custody after the 

post mortem. The clothes were bunian, pant, sweater, 

nicker, and one white big handkerchief. Those clothes were 

in Aurad Police Station. He submitted report to that effect 

to the Police Station. He identified the contents of the said 

report before the Court and also his signature. He stated 

that, the contents of the said report are true and correct. 

Nothing useful to the defence has been brought on record so 

as to disbelieve the evidence of this witness before the 

Court. 

26] 
It appears that, Tanhaji Nagorao Kale who was 

panch to the seizure of the clothes on the person of the 

deceased Gyandeo and was examined as PW4. However, he 

stated before the Court that, the clothes of Vilas Kadaji 

Pawar, Ashok Kadaji Pawar, Shivaji Kadaji Pawar were not 

seized in his presence. However, he has not stated that, 

clothes on the person of Gyandeo were not seized in his 

presence. It appears that, clothes of the deceased Gyandeo, 

which were seized were sent to the Regional Forensic 

Science Laboratory, State of Maharashtra, Old Nizam 

Bungalow Cantonment, Aurangabad. The description of the

The result of the analysis of the said article A1 to A3 is 

those were soaked with blood. It further appears that, in 

presence of PW2 Govind Keshavrao Birajdar the Police 

seized clothes on the person of the accused. This witness in 

his evidence stated that, on 10 th January, 2008, he had 

been to attend funeral of the deceased son of the 

complainant. The Police called him at Aurad Shahajani 

Police Station so as to seize clothes on the person of 

accused. He himself and Hanmant Sagre had been to the 

said Police Station. They reached at the Police Station at

for accused Nos. 1, 4, 11, 12, 13, 30, 18, 20, 32, 25, 31, 17 

and 34. It appears that, some questions were asked to him 

about who contested the Grampanchayat elections. 

However, nothing useful to defence was brought on record 

from the said information about elections. It further appears 

that, the defence did ask certain questions about 

preparation of the application which was submitted to the 

Police Station. It appears that, this witness has stated that, 

names of the accused mentioned in the said application 

were as per his say. It appears that, the defence did ask the

Gram Sabha were incorporated in the said application or 

not. However, nothing useful to the defence has been 

brought on record by asking such questions by the defence. 

It is pertinent to mention that, PW16 who was under 

tremendous mental stress on that relevant night, was not

entered the house of the complainant and by use of deadly

evidence that, some of the accused pelted stones at his 

house. It has also come on record that, because of hearing 

of noise of the accused persons, villagers did not dare to

were present at the spot of incident so as to achieve 

common object of assaulting / causing grievous hurt to the 

family members of the complainant.

Shivaji Pawar was holding sword like Jamibya, Ashok Kadaji 

Pawar was holding Katti, Vimalbai Shivaji Pawar was

eye witnesses. 

49] 
Upon careful perusal of his examination in 

cross, his evidence in the examination in chief has not been 

shattered in slightest manner, on the contrary, he has 

reiterated his assertions in the examination in chief during 

his cross examination. 
Nothing substantial has been 

brought on record by the defence useful to accused to 

disbelieve his version in the examination in chief. However, 

fact remains that, though the prosecution has named as 

many as 39 accused. He has not named all 39 accused in 

his evidence. In his cross examination in para No.10, he 

has stated that, Komal Maruti Pawar has no concerned with 

the incident in question. He has specifically stated that, the 

names of the accused mentioned in para No.10 of his cross 

examination have no concerned with the incident. 

Therefore, upon considering the evidence of PW 

16 complainant, we find that, his evidence is fully 

trustworthy, reliable, truthful and not shaken in the cross 

examination. His evidence on all points -aspects is truthful 

and deserves acceptance.

Vilas and accused No.13 Namdeo, submitted that, so far 

Namdeo is concerned, his name is not mentioned in the 

First Information Report, and he deserves to be given benefit 

of doubt, cannot be accepted. The First Information Report 

is not an encyclopedia. In his evidence before the Court, 

PW16 has named Namdeo and also specific overt act is 

attributed to him. It appears that, he was one of the main 

assailant, who inflicted blows by sword on the deceased 

Gyandeo and also other injured persons.

The prosecution witness Nos.22 to 26 are 

injured witnesses. Their evidence assumes significance

which would have caused their death, if timely treatment

Pawar inflicted stick blow on his head. Udhav Pawar 

inflicted iron blow on his left shoulder. Hari Pawar inflicted 

iron blow on back of this witness.

It appears from his evidence that he sustained 

bleeding injuries, intestines were pierced out of his 

stomach. He has specifically pointed out accused persons, 

who were present in the court, and identified them, who 

assaulted him and Gyandeo. It appears from the medical 

evidence brought on record by the prosecution and the 

evidence of the Medical Officers P.W.27 Dr.Pralhad Solanke

and P.W.28 Dr. Shivanand Biradar supports the version of 

this witness. The version of this witness corresponds with 

the injuries stated in the injury certificate of Gyandeo and 

also other six injured persons. Therefore, the evidence of 

P.W.25 corresponds with the medical evidence. 
His 

evidence is fully trustworthy, reliable, truthful and not 

shaken in any manner in his crossexamination and the 

same can safely be accepted on all the points including 

forming an unlawful assembly by the accused persons, who 

are named in his evidence, in furtherance of their common 

object to assault / cause grievous hurt to the family 

members of the complainant in order to finish every member 

of family of P.W.16 Baburao. The evidence of this witness 

corroborates with the evidence of the complainant in all 

material particulars. The evidence of the complainant and 

also P.W.25 Vijaykumar corroborates each other and also 

gets corroboration from medical evidence led by P.W.27 

Dr.Pralhad Solanke and P.W.28 Dr. Shivanand Biradar.

The learned Counsel for the accused Shivaji 

Kadaji Pawar, Namdeo Shivaji Pawar and Vilas Kadaji Pawar 

was at pains to argue that, in view of the judgment of the

Supreme Court in the case of Masalti (supra), where 

factions prevail in villagers and murders are committed as a 

result of enmity between such factions, criminal Courts 

have to deal with evidence of a partisan type. The learned 

Counsel for the accused relied on the observations of the 

Supreme Court in paragraph 16 of the judgment in case of 

Masalti (supra) and argued that where the criminal Court 

has to deal with the evidence pertaining to commission of an 

offence involving a large number of offenders and a large 

number of victims, it is usual to adopt the test that the 

conviction could be sustained only if it is supported by two 

or three or more witnesses who give a consistent account of 

the incident. In a sense, the test may be described as 

mechanical; but it cannot be treated as irrational or 

unreasonable. Therefore, in his submission, in the present 

case, though evidence of P.W.25 Vijaykumar does not suffer 

from omissions, contradictions and improvements, the 

evidence of other prosecution witnesses, including the 

complainant, suffers from contradictions, omissions and 

improvements and, therefore, the evidence of P.W.25 

Vijaykumar alone is not sufficient so as to sustain the 

conviction of the accused.

As 
already 
observed, 
evidence 
of 
the 

complainant P.W.16 Baburao and P.W.25 Vijaykumar 

corroborates 
with each other and lends support from 

medical evidence and therefore,the evidence of the P.W.16 

Baburao complainant and also the P.W.25 Vijaykumar is 

fully trustworthy, reliable, truthful and has not been 

shaken, in any manner, in the crossexamination. There is 

also evidence of other nine eye witnesses.

The prosecution examined Shahuraj Baburao 

Pawar as PW22, his evidence is at Exhibit278. In his

another by Shivaji Pawar. Panel of his father was elected in

Tahsildar. On 24.11.2007, Tahsildar conducted election for 

the post of Sarpanch in Police Bandobast, and in that 

election, his wife was elected as Sarpanch. Since then there 

are strained relations between complainant's group and 

group of Shivaji Pawar. Persons from the side of Shivaji 

Pawar used to threat to kill the complainant's persons and 

they will not allow to conduct the work. He further stated 

that, deceased Gyandeo was his real brother. Incident 

occurred on 09.01.2008. It was next day of Vel Amawasya.

Vijaykumar, Sheshrao, Sanjay, Bhagwat also 

sustained bleeding injuries. Then the injured were admitted 

in Nilanga Hospital. Vijaykumar, Sanjay and he himself 

were referred to Latur Hospital for further treatment. They 

learnt at Latur that, Gyandeo is dead. Police recorded his 

statement twice. [Emphasis supplied].

He was cross examined by Advocate Shri 

T.V.Jamdar. He stated that, post of Sarpanch was reserved 

for woman. In Gram Panchayat elections, in all 3 women 

were elected. Sushilabai Gaikwad, Usha Dinkar Katekar 

and his wife were elected. He has specifically denied the 

suggestion that, there was no panel headed by Shivaji in the 

said election. This witness stated in his examination in 

cross that, he was taken to the Hospital at Nilanga for 

treatment. He received first blow by stick on left shoulder 

and last blow by sword on the back. Upon perusal of his 

evidence in cross examination, nothing useful to the defence

appearing for the accused Shivaji, Namdeo and Vilas invited 

our attention to the portion marked 'A', 'B' and 'C' from the 

statement of this witness under Section 161 of I.P. Code and 

submitted that, this witness in the police station has not 

named Namdeo or no overt act is attributed to him, and 

therefore, Namdeo is entitled for benefit of doubt. In our 

opinion, he has specifically stated in his examination in 

chief that, Namdeo Shivaji Pawar inflicted sword blow on 

above the navel of Gyandeo. Aforesaid version about 

Namdeo gets corroboration from the evidence of other 

prosecution witnesses and also from the medical evidence, 

and therefore, contention of the learned Counsel Mr. 

Chatterji cannot be accepted that accused Namdeo deserves 

to be acquitted.

examination nothing useful to the defence has been brought 

on record by the defence.

abusing of the mob. Mob came in his courtyard and 

persons from the mob pelted stone. Some persons from the 

mob were holding sticks, iron rods, swords, Jambiya, 

Gyandeo and Vijaykumar came out of house in the 

courtyard. He further stated that, others followed them in 

the courtyard. Satish Vaijinath Pawar, Tukaram Pawar and 

Udhav Pawar caught hold Gyandeo, and Shivaji Pawar

stated that, Shivaji Pawar inflicted 3 blows by sword on his 

left hand wrist. Ashok Pawar inflicted katti blow on left leg. 

About 16 to 17 persons in the mob assaulted Vijaykumar, 

Bhagwat, Shahuraj, Baburao, Dilip, Sanjay.

injured were referred to Latur Hospital for further 

treatment. On the next day morning, Doctor informed them 

that, Gyandeo is dead. Police recorded his statement. 

He was cross examined by Advocate Shri 

T.V.Jamdar. Relying upon his statement that, the portion 

marked 'A' read over to him, during his cross examination 

was not stated before the Police. The learned counsel Mr. 

Chatterji submitted that, when he did not state before the 

Police that, Shivaji actually assaulted by sword on chest and 

when this witness further stated that, he has not named 

Namdeo, both of them are entitled for benefit of doubt. As 

already observed, there is overwhelming evidence led by the 

prosecution in the nature of 11 eye witnesses before the 

Court naming accused Shivaji, Namdeo and also Vilas and 

attributing specific role to them and also there are 

corresponding injuries. The evidence of PW25 remained 

unshaken and gets corroboration from the evidence of other 

eye witnesses, and also from the medical evidence, and 

therefore, the contention of Advocate Shri Chatterji stands 

rejected.

of Gyandeo, Namdeo Shivaji Pawar had inflicted sword blow 

near navel of Gyandeo and Madhav Shivaji Pawar assaulted

he cannot assign any reason why above facts are not 

recorded by police in his statement. Relying upon the

be canvassed that, his evidence suffers from omissions and 

contradictions. However, in our opinion, the said argument

Advocate of Accused Nos.2, 5 to 10, 15, 16, 19, 21 to 24, 26 

to 28, 33 and 35. During his crossexamination by the 

Advocate of aforesaid accused, he stated that accused 

Komalbai Maroti Pawar has no concern with the incident. 

He was further crossexamined on behalf of the accused 

Nos.3, 14 and 29 wherein he stated that Haridas Manik 

Pawar is known to him. There were 30 to 40 persons in the 

mob. He specifically denied the suggestion that he was not

that out of 37 accused persons, he identified 10 to 12 

persons on the day of the incident and remaining persons 

were unknown to him and he could not identify those

accused who were pelting stones. 
He has reiterated his 

assertion in his examinationinchief about the manner in 

which the accused came to the house of Baburao, giving 

slogans with deadly weapons, fully prepared and formed an 

unlawful assembly with an object to cause grievous hurt in 

order to finish the entire family of the complainant Baburao. 

His evidence in the examinationinchief is not shattered in 

his crossexamination, in any manner.

The learned Counsel Mr.Chatterji appearing for 

the accused Shivaji Kadaji Pawar, Namdeo Shivaji Pawar 

and Vilas Kadaji Pawar criticized the evidence of P.W.17 

Chandrakant Solanke on the ground that there are 

contradictions in his evidence inasmuch as, the manner in 

which he stated overtacts of the accused, has no 

corroboration from the other evidence. He invited our 

attention to the portion marked as "A" from his police 

statement and submitted that accused Namdeo is not 

named by him in his police statement. 

Upon appreciating the evidence of P.W.17 

Chandrakant in its entirety, as already observed, his

evidence remained unshaken. 
It appears from his 

statement that, police have narrated his version in the 

police statement u/s 161 of Cr.P.C. not in the manner in 

which he stated about the incident and, therefore, portion 

marked in his police statement cannot be considered as an 

omission. His substantive evidence before the court gets 

corroboration from the evidence of complainant and also 

from the evidence of P.W.25 Vijaykumar and all other eye 

witnesses to the incident, coupled with medical evidence 

and therefore, in our opinion, there is no substance in the 

contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the accused 

Namdeo that, Namdeo could have been given benefit of 

doubt since this witness has not named Namdeo Shivaji 

Pawar and not attributed any overtacts in his police 

statement. 
Therefore, evidence of P.W.17 Chandrakant 

Solanke on all aspects is reliable, trustworthy and truthful. 

67] 
Prosecution has examined Dilip Bhagwanrao 

Pawar as PW18 who is an eye witness. His evidence is 

at Exhibit -269. In his examination in chief, he stated 

that, he is brother of the complainant Baburao. They all 

are three brothers. Vijaykumar is their third brother.

reason why police recorded so in his statement. He 

further stated that, he did not state the portion mark B

suggestion that, he is deposing falsely that, accused 

assaulted deceased and other injured by weapons. 

70] 
Mr. Joydeep Chatterji, the learned counsel 

invited our attention to Portion Mark at `A', `B', `C' from 

his (PW18) statement under Section 161 before the 

Police and tried to submit that, his evidence before the 

Court is contradictory to his statement before the 

Police. We have carefully perused the evidence of PW 

18, in his examinationinchief and also his cross 

examination, he has deposed about incident in minute 

details. His evidence is consistent and finds 

corroboration from other eye witnesses and also 

medical evidence. The statement before the police 

officer and the statement in the evidence before the 

Court are not so inconsistent or irreconcilable with 

each other that both of them cannot coexist, and 

therefore, submission of learned counsel deserves no 

consideration. In our opinion, his evidence is not 

shaken in any manner. It appears from his evidence

414.11crapl

that, he wanted to convey that, the manner in which he 

stated before the Police about each accused and overt 

act attributed to them has not been recorded properly. 

However, the said portion marked cannot be taken to 

mean that, same are omissions. Therefore, his evidence 

is reliable, trustworthy, appears to be truthful and 

deserves acceptance. 

71] 
Prosecution examined Maroti Dhanaji 

Jadhav as PW19, whose evidence is at Exhibit -272. 

In his evidence he stated that, he was invited for dinner 

by complainant Baburao on the date of incident. He 

went there. At about 7 to 7.15 p.m. they were about to 

sit for dinner, at that time, from the outside of house of 

Baburao, they heard noise of abuses and there was 

stone pelting on the house of the complainant. Then 

they came out of room in the court yard. Gyandeo went 

ahead. Gyandeo, Vijaykumar, Sanjay, Sheshrao, 

Bhagwat, Baburao, Chandrakant and this witness and 

family members in the house came in the court yard.

All of sudden, 30 to 40 persons from outside came in 

the court yard of Baburao. 2 to 3 persons caught hold 

hands of Gyandeo. Shivaji Pawar then inflicted sword 

blow on the chest of Gyandeo. Two other persons came 

there. One person from them inflicted sword blow on 

the right side of navel of Gyandeo. Another person 

inflicted sword blow on the left side of navel of 

Gyandeo. Then wife of Shivaji Pawar inflicted knife 

blow on the above side of waist (ribs) of Gyandeo. 

Gyandeo sustained bleeding injuries and he fell down. 

Then Vijaykumar was assaulted by the mob. Three 

persons had caught hold Vijaykumar. Sword blow was 

given on the stomach of Vijaykumar. One more person 

gave sword blow on the stomach of Vijaykumar. Other 

persons were also beating Vijaykumar. Sanjkumar was 

inflicted sword blow on the stomach and ribs. This 

witness again said that, one blow was given to him by 

Jambiya and another blow was given by sword. Then 

some persons rushed on the person of Shahuraj. He 

was given sword blow by the side of waist. Then

Sheshrao was assaulted. Three blows were given on the 

hand of Sheshrao. A stick blow was given to Bhagwat. 

Injured sustained bleeding injuries and they collapsed 

in the courtyard. Injured were thereafter shifted to 

Nilanga hospital. 

72] 
This witness was crossexamined by 

Advocate Mr. T.V. Jamdar on behalf of some of the 

accused. It appears that, defence crossexamined him 

on the aspect that, he is close relative of the 

complainant -Baburao. He stated in his cross 

examination that, Varsha is the daughter of his cousin 

brother, who is daughterinlaw of complainant 

Baburao. He stated in his crossexamination that, it is 

true to say that, he was deposing for the first time 

today before the Court that, Shivaji Pawar assaulted 

Gyandeo by sword, however, in our opinion, it is quite 

possible that, this witness, who is relative of the 

complainant from some other village, did not know 

about the name of all the accused, and therefore,

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
131 

merely because first time he stated before the Court 

that, Shivaji Pawar assaulted Gyandeo by sword would 

not affect credibility of his evidence. Therefore, his 

evidence also appears to be trustworthy. His evidence is 

clear, cogent and does not suffer from any omissions, 

contradictions or improvements and defence has not 

brought anything on record so as to disbelieve his 

evidence before the Court. 

73] 
The prosecution examined Varsha Shahuraj 

Pawar as PW20. Her evidence is at Exhibit -273. In 

her examination in chief, she stated that, complainant 

Baburao is her fatherinlaw. She know accused. They 

are from her village. She is Sarpanch of village Jamga. 

She was elected three years before. In the election, 

panel of her fatherinlaw was elected. On the day of 

election, Shivaji Pawar and his persons had assaulted. 

Two months after the election, she was elected for the 

post of Sarpanch. On the day of election for Sarpanch, 

Shivaji Pawar and his persons obstructed in the Gram

Panchayat office and said that, they will not allow to 

hold election. Therefore, the meeting could not be held 

and they went in Tahsil office and informed Tahsildar 

about it. On the next day, Tahsildar, his colleagues and 

police came in the village and conducted election for 

Sarpanch. On 24 th election was over and she was 

elected as Sarpanch. Shivaji Pawar and his companions 

were threatening them not to allow to work in the Gram 

Panchayat office and they will ruin heritage of their 

family. 

She further stated that, incident took place 

on 09.01.2008. It was next day of Vel Amawasya 

festival. Incident took place at about 7.00 to 7.15 p.m. 

On that day, there was nonvegetarian dinner at their 

house. Maroti Jadhav, Chandrakant Solanke and 

villagers Waman Pawar, Anant Pawar, Bhingole 

Tatyarao were also invited for dinner at their house. 

Persons from the house and guests were about to sit for 

dinner, at that time, stone pelting started and abuses

started from outside of their house. Then mob and 

shout raising persons about 30 to 40 came in their 

court yard. Gyandeo went ahead of all. Thereafter, 

Vijaykumar, Sanjay, Shahuraj, Sheshrao, Bhagwat, 

Baburao, this witness and other females came in the 

court yard. Guests who had came for dinner also came 

in the court yard. Gyandeo was caught hold by 3 

persons amongst mob. Those were Satish Pawar, 

Tukaram Pawar and Udhav Pawar. Shivaji Kadaji 

Pawar inflicted sword blow on the chest of Gyandeo. 

Namdeo Pawar inflicted sword blow near navel of 

Gyandeo. Mahadeo Shivaji Pawar inflicted Jambiya 

blow on the right side stomach of Gyandeo. Accused 

Vimalbai gave knife blow on the back side ribs left side 

of Gyandeo. Dayanand Bhingole inflicted sword blow on 

the left side back portion of Gyandeo. Gyandeo had 

sustained bleeding injuries and felled down. Then 

Waman Dadarao Pawar inflicted stick blow on her 

back. Then she did not understand what happened 

thereafter. Persons from the mob then assaulted

Injured were taken to Nilanga Hospital for treatment. 

Doctor advised to shift three injured to Latur for further 

treatment. Gyandeo, Bhagwat and Sheshrao were 

retained at Nilanga for treatment. Gyandeo died during 

the course of treatment. 

This witness was crossexamined by 

Advocate T.V. Jamdar for some of the accused. In her 

crossexamination, she reiterated her version in her 

examinationinchief about the manner in which 

incident had taken place and also prelude about the 

incident. 

74] 
Mr. Joydeep Chatterji, the learned counsel 

invited our attention to portion mark `A', `B' from the 

evidence of this witness and tried to submit that, this 

witness has not named Namdeo in the said portion 

mark, and therefore, Namdeo is entitled for benefit of 

doubt. Upon perusal of the evidence of this witness, in 

examinationinchief and also in crossexamination,

414.11crapl

she has named Namdeo Pawar and also overt act is 

attributed to him that, he inflicted sword blow near 

navel of Gyandeo, and therefore, when her evidence 

finds corroboration from evidence of other prosecution 

witnesses and medical evidence, there is no reason to 

disbelieve her evidence.

One Mahadeo S/o Sheshrao Pawar was 

examined as PW21. His evidence is at Exhibit -274. In 

his examinationinchief, he stated that, Baburao is his 

grandfather.

Solanke, Maroti Jahdav and villagers Waman Pawar, 

Anant and Tatyarao Bhingole were invited. While they 

were sitting for dinner, mob came in the court yard and 

were saying that, they will ruin their heritage, they will 

cut them into pieces and the mob then started stone 

pelting. About 30 to 40 persons were in the mob. Then 

persons in the house came outside in the courtyard. 

Gyandeo came ahead of all. Thereafter, Vijaykumar and 

other persons came in the court yard. Satish Vaijinath 

Pawar, Udhav Shivaji Pawar and Tukaram Pawar 

caught hold Gyandeo. Shivaji Pawar inflicted sword 

blow on the chest of Gyandeo. Mahadeo Shivaji Pawar 

inflicted Jambiya blow on the right side stomach of 

Gyandeo. Namdeo Shivaji Pawar inflicted sword blow 

on the left side of navel of Gyandeo. Vimalbai Pawar 

inflicted knife blow on the back of Gyandeo. Dayanand

Venkat Vaijinath Pawar caught hold Vijaykumar. 

Madhav Shivaji Pawar inflicted three blows by sword on 

the face of Vijaykumar. Other persons also inflicted 

blows on Vijaykumar. Vijaykumar also sustained 

bleeding injuries and he also felled down. Shahuraj was 

also assaulted on the back by Madhav Pawar by 

Jambiya. Shahuraj, Sheshrao, Bhagwat were also 

assaulted. Then injured were taken to Nilanga Hospital. 

Doctor told in the hospital that, Gyandeo was dead. 

This witness was cross examined by 

Advocate Mr. T.V. Jamdar on behalf of some of the 

accused. This witness stated that, he did not state 

portion mark `A' read over to him from his police 

statement. Portion mark `B' read over to him from his 

statement is not stated by him before the Police and 

that, he cannot assign any reason why police recorded 

the said portion in his statement. Though the 

Investigating Officer has stated that, the said portion 

mark `A' and `B' was stated by this witness, that is to 

the effect that, Gyandeo was caught hold by Govind

Shahapure, Dhondiram Raosaheb Pawar, Ashok 

Vishwanath Pawar and Shivaji Kadaji Pawar assaulted 

Gyandeo by sword. Another portion mark `B' is PW21 

does not know, who assaulted. From these portion 

marks `A' and `B', in our opinion, nothing useful to the 

defence has been brought on record. On the contrary 

this witness has reiterated his version in his 

examinationinchief even in cross examination. It 

appears that, the Investigating Officer stated in his 

crossexamination that, this witness has not stated 

before him the facts read over to him from para 3 of his 

chiefexamination, lines no. 1 to 14. In fact there are no 

third paragraph in his examinationinchief. In our 

opinion, trial Court was not correct in allowing such 

crossexamination. 

76] 
At this juncture, it would be relevant to 

observe that, the trial Court while marking portions 

from the statements of the witnesses before Police 

under section 161 of Code of Criminal Procedure, has

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 :::

not adhered to the procedure. The trial Court has not 

properly appreciated, keeping in view the judgment of 

the Supreme Court in the case of Tahsildar Singh 

and another V/s State of U.P. 2 , what amounts to 

omissions, contradictions and improvements. The 

Supreme Court in the case of Tahsildar Singh and 

another (supra) held that, the contradiction, under the 

section, should be between what a witness asserted in 

the witnessbox and what he stated before the police 

officer, and not between what he said he had stated 

before the policeofficer and what he actually made 

before him. In such a case the question could not be 

put at all: only questions to contradict can be put and 

the question here posed does not contradict; it leads to 

an answer which is contradicted by the police 

statement. Section 145 of the Evidence Act indicates 

the manner in which contradiction is brought out. The 

crossexamining Counsel shall put the part or parts of 

the statement which affirms the contrary to what is 

2 AIR 1959 SC 1012

stated in evidence. This indicates that there is 

something in writing which can be set against another 

statement made in evidence. If the statement before the 

policeofficer and the statement in the evidence before 

the Court are so inconsistent or irreconcilable with 

each other that both of them cannot coexist, it may be 

said that one contradicts the other. It is further 

observed by the Supreme Court in paras 26 and 27 of 

the said judgment that, it is for the trial Judge to 

decide in each case, after comparing the part or parts of 

the statement recorded by the police with that made in 

the witnessbox, to give a ruling, having regard to the 

aforesaid principles, whether the recital intended to be 

used for contradiction satisfies the requirements of law.

evidence led by the prosecution. 

In our opinion, course adopted by the trial 

Court to allow defence to confront the witness by 

asking question about whole paragraph without 

specifying particular portion, was not proper. Keeping 

in view relevant procedure, provisions and the 

judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of 

Tahsildar Singh and anr (Supra), the Trial Court 

ought to have considered omissions, contradictions or 

improvements.

panch were affixed on seized weapons. Then due to his

Nothing useful to the defence has been brought on record 

from his cross examination.

received investigation in Crime No.02/2008 on 20.06.2008 

from API Kendre. He had arrested accused Nagnath Pawar, 

Vimalbai Pawar and Komalbai Pawar. Arrest panchnamas

PW31. Thereafter, he submitted the charge sheet against 

above referred accused. 

93] 
We have discussed the entire evidence on 

record. There is overwhelming direct evidence in the nature 

of eleven eye witnesses to the incident. The main criticism 

by the defence qua the evidence of eye witnesses is that 

they are partisan or interested witnesses inasmuch as, they 

are in blood relation with the complainant. In this respect, 

at this juncture, it would be apt to make reference to the 

judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Masalti 

(supra). The Supreme Court in the case of Masalti (supra) 

has made it clear that it is, no doubt, the quality of the 

evidence that matters and not the number of witnesses who 

give evidence. The Supreme Court in para 14 of the 

judgment in case of Masalti (supra) observed, thus: 

"14. Mr. Sawhney has then argued that where 
witnesses giving evidence in a murder trial like the 
present are shown to belong to the faction of victims, 
their evidence should not be accepted, because they 
are prone to involve falsely members of the rival 
faction out of enmity and partisan feeling. There is no 
doubt that when a criminal Court has to appreciate 
evidence given by witnesses who are partisan or 
interested, it has to be very careful in weighing such 
evidence. 51 S.C.IO 146 Whether or not there are 
discrepancies in the evidence; whether or not the

414.11crapl 
163 

evidence strikes the Court as genuine; whether or not 
the story disclosed by the evidence is probable, are all 
matters which must be taken into account. But it 
would, we think, be unreasonable to contend that 
evidence given by witnesses should be discarded only 
on the ground that it is evidence of partisan or 
interested witnesses. Often enough, where factions 
prevail in villages and murders are committed as a 
result of enmity between such factions, criminal 
Courts have to deal with evidence of a partisan type. 
The mechanical rejection of such evidence on the sole 
ground that it is partisan would invariably lead to 
failure of justice. No hard and fast rule can be laid 
down as to how much evidence should be appreciated. 
Judicial approach has to be cautious in dealing with 
such evidence; but the plea that such evidence should 
be rejected because it is partisan cannot be accepted 
as correct." 

94] 
In the light of the observations of the Supreme 

Court in paragraph 14 quoted above, we have discussed the 

evidence of all eye witnesses. Therefore, in our opinion, 

merely because the eye witnesses are in blood relation with 

the complainant, is no ground to disbelieve their evidence. 

The prosecution has placed on record satisfactory evidence 

showing the involvement of accused persons in commission 

of offence. There is overwhelming medical evidence which 

would unequivocally suggest that, the deceased Gyandeo 

was brutally murdered by the accused persons by using 

deadly weapons like sword, knife and also stick and iron

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl

rod. There are six injured witnesses who were examined by 

the medical officer P.W.28 Dr. Shivanand Biradar. Out of 

six injured witnesses, three injured witnesses i.e. 

Vijaykumar, Shahuraj and Sanjay, were examined by the 

Medical Officer, and the evidence of the Medical Officer 

suggests that nature of injuries sustained was grievous and 

dangerous to life. It is not that other five witnesses were not 

assaulted by the mob but, it is stated by the complainant in 

his evidence before the Court, that their injuries were not 

visible and, therefore, medical officer did not examine them. 

Another criticism by the defence is that names 

of some of the accused are not mentioned in the first 

information report or supplementary statement of the 

complainant Baburao. The Supreme Court in the case of 

Ranjit Singh and Ors v. State of M.P. 3 in para 9 held that 

in case the informant fails to name a particular accused in 

the FIR, and the said accused is named at the earliest 

opportunity, when the statements of witnesses are recorded, 

it cannot tilt the balance in favour of the accused. 

Further argument advanced by the defence is 

3 AIR 2011 SC 255; 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
165 

that, the prosecution has not placed on record satisfactory 

evidence to prove that the accused persons did form an 

unlawful assembly either prior to commission of offence or 

at the time of commission of offence. 
It is common 

contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the accused 

that the ingredients of sections 141, 142 and 149 of the IPC 

are not attracted in the light of evidence brought on record 

and, therefore, it cannot be held that the accused persons 

formed an unlawful assembly in furtherance of their 

common object to assault / cause grievous hurt in order to 

kill every member of the family of the complainant as alleged 

by the prosecution. In this respect, at this juncture it would 

be apt once again to make reference to the exposition of the 

Supreme Court in case of Masalti (supra) wherein the 

Supreme Court while explaining scope of sections 141 to 

149 of IPC and also section 302 r/w 149 of IPC, in 

paragraphs 16, 17 and 20 held, thus: 

"16. Mr. Sawhney also urged that the test applied by 
the High Court in convicting the appellants is 
mechanical. He argues that under the Indian 
Evidence Act, trustworthy evidence given by a single 
witness would be enough to convict an accused 
person, whereas evidence given by half a dozen 
witnesses which is not trustworthy would not be 
enough to sustain the conviction. That, no doubt is 
true; but where a criminal court has to deal with 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
166 

evidence pertaining to the commission of an offence 
involving a large number of offenders and a large 
number of victims, it is usual to adopt the test that 
the conviction could be sustained only if it is 
supported by two or three or more witnesses who give 
a consistent account of the incident. In a sense, the 
test may be described as mechanical; but it is difficult 
to see how it can be treated as irrational or 
unreasonable. Therefore, we do not think that any 
grievance can be made by the appellants against the 
adoption of this test. If at all the prosecution may be 
entitled to say that the seven accused persons were 
acquitted because their cases did not satisfy the 
mechanical test of four witnesses, and if the said test 
had not been applied, they might as well have been 
convicted. It is, no doubt, the quality of the evidence 
that matters and not the number of witnesses who 
give such evidence. But, sometimes it is useful to 
adopt a test like the one which the High Court has 
adopted in dealing with the present case. 

17. 
Mr. Sawhney then attempted to argue that the 
High Court failed to give effect to the principles 
enunciated by this Court in the case of Baladin v. 
State of Uttar Pradesh (S) AIR 1956 SC 181. In that 
case, it was observed by Sinha, J., who spoke for the 
Court, that it is wellsettled that mere presence in an 
assembly does not make a person, who is present, a 
member of an unlawful assembly unless it is shown 
that he had done something or omitted to do 
something which would make him a member of an 
unlawful assembly, or unless the case falls under 
s.142, I.P.C. The argument is (1) A.I.R. 1956 S.C. 181 
148 that evidence adduced by the prosecution in the 
present case does not assign any specific part to most 
of the accused persons in relation to any overt act, 
and so, the High Court was in error in holding that 
the appellants were members of an unlawful 
assembly. The observation of which Mr. Sawhney 
relies, prima facie, does seem to support his 
contention; but, with respect, we ought to add that 
the said observation cannot be read as laying down a 
general proposition of law that unless an overt act is 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
167 

proved against a person who is alleged to be a 
member of an unlawful assembly, it cannot be said 
that he is a member of such an unlawful assembly. In 
appreciating the effect of the relevant observation on 
which Mr. Sawhney has built his argument, we must 
bear in mind the facts which were found in that case. 
It appears that in the case of Baladin (S) AIR 1956 SC 
181, the members of the family of the appellants and 
other residents of the village had assembled together; 
some of them shared the common object of the 
unlawful assembly, while others were merely passive 
witnesses. Dealing with such an assembly, this Court 
observed that the presence of a person in an assembly 
of that kind would not necessarily show that he was a 
member of an unlawful assembly. What has to be 
proved against a person who is alleged to be a 
member of an unlawful assembly is that he was one of 
the persons constituting the assembly ,and he 
entertained along with the other members of the 
assembly the common object as defined by s.141, 
I.P.C. Section 142 provides that whoever, being aware 
of facts which render any assembly an unlawful 
assembly, intentionally joins that assembly, or 
continues in it, is said to be a member of an unlawful 
assembly. In other words, an assembly of five or more 
persons actuated by, and entertaining one or more of 
the common objects specified by the five clauses of s. 
141, is an unlawful assembly. The crucial question to 
determine in such a case is whether the assembly 
consisted of five or more persons and whether the said 
persons entertained one or more of the common 
objects as specified by S.141. While determining this 
question, it becomes relevant....to consider whether 
the assembly consisted of some persons.....who were 
merely passive witnesses and had (1) A.I.R. 1956 S.C. 
181 I49 joined the assembly as a matter of idle 
curiosity without intending to entertain the common 
object of the assembly. It is in that context that the 
observations made by this Court in the case of 
Baladin (S) AIR 1956 SC 181 assume significance; 
otherwise, in law, it would not be correct to say that 
before a person is held to be a member of an unlawful 
assembly, it must be shown that he had committed 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
168 

some illegal overt act or had been guilty of some illegal 
omission in pursuance of the common object of the 
assembly. In fact, s.149 makes it clear that if an 
offence is committed by any member of an unlawful 
assembly in prosecution of the common object of that 
assembly, or such as the members of that assembly 
knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of 
that object, every person who, at the time of the 
committing of that offence. is a member of the same 
assembly, is guilty of that offence; and that 
emphatically brings out the principle that the 
punishment prescribed by s.149 is in a sense 
vicarious and does not always proceed on the basis 
that the offence has been actually committed by every 
member of the unlawful assembly. Therefore, we are 
satisfied that the observations made in the case of 
Baladin(l) must be read in the context of the special 
facts of that case and cannot be treated as laying 
down an unqualified proposition of law such as Mr. 
Sawhney suggests. 

20. That leaves one question still to be considered 
and that has relation to the sentence of death 
imposed on 10 persons. Mr. Sawhney argues that in 
confirming the sentences of death imposed by the trial 
Court on 10 accused persons in this case, the High 
Court has adopted a mechanical rule. The High Court 
has held that the 10 persons who carried fire arms 
should be ordered to be hanged, whereas others who 
have also been convicted under s. 302/149, should be 
sentenced to imprisonment for life. It is true that 
except for Laxmi Prasad, the charge under s. 302/149 
rests against the other accused persons on the ground 
that five murders have been committed by some 
members of the unlawful assembly of which they were 
members, and the argument is that unless it is shown 
that a particular accused person has himself 
committed the murder of one or the other of the 
victims, the sentence of death should not be imposed 
on him. In other words, the contention is that if a 
person is found guilty of murder under s. 302/149 
and it is not shown that he himself committed the 
murder in question, he is not liable to be sentenced to

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
169 

death. In support of this argument, Mr. Sawhney has 
relied on certain observations made by Bose J. who 
spoke for the Court in Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab 
AIR 1953 SC 64. In that case, what this Court 
observed was that the power to enhance a sentence 
from transportation to death should very rarely be 
exercised and only for the strongest reasons; and it 
was added that it is not enough for the appellate court 
to say or think that if left to itself it would have 
awarded the....greater penalty because the discretion 
does ,not belong to the..appellate court but to the trial 
Judge, and the only ground on which the appellate 
court can interfere is that the discretion has been 
improperly exercised. These observations have no 
relevance in the present case, because we are not 
dealing With a case where the High Court has 
enhanced the sentence imposed by the trial Judge at 
all. In fact, both the trial Court and the High Court 
are agreed that the sentences of death imposed on 10 
persons are justified by the circumstances of the case 
and by the requirements (1) (1954] S.C.R. 145 151 of 
justice. As a mere proposition of law, it should be 
difficult to accept the argument that the sentence of 
death can be legitimately imposed only where an 
accused person is found to have committed the 
murder himself. Whether or not sentences of death 
should be imposed on persons who are found to be 
guilty not because they themselves committed the 
murder, but because they were members of an 
unlawful assembly and the offence of murder was 
committed by one or more of the members of such an 
assembly in pursuance of the common object of that 
assembly, is a matter which had to be decided on the 
facts and circumstances of each case. In the present 
case, it is clear that the whole group of persons 
belonged to Laxmi Prasad's faction, joined together 
armed with deadly weapons and they were inspired by 
the common object of exterminating the male 
members in the family of Gayadin, 10 of these persons 
were armed with firearms and the others with several 
other deadly weapons, and evidence shows that five 
murders by shooting were committed by the members 
of this unlawful assembly. The conduct of the

::: on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
170 

members of the unlawful assembly both before and 
after the commission of the offence has been 
considered by the courts below and it has been held 
that in order to suppress such fantastic criminal 
conduct on the part of villagers it is necessary to 
impose the sentences of death on 10 members of the 
unlawful assembly who were armed with firearms. It 
cannot be said that discretion in the matter has been 
improperly exercised either by the trial Court or by 
the High Court. Therefore we see no reason to accept 
the argument urged by Mr. Sawhney that the test 
adopted by the High Court in dealing with the 
question 
of 
sentence 
is 
mechanical 
and 
unreasonable." 

95] 
While considering various provisions of IPC and 

in particular, sections 148, 149 and 302 IPC, the Supreme 

Court, in case of Ranjit Singh (supra), in paragraph 22 

held, thus: 

"22. Thus, from the above, the law on the issue 
remains that in a case involving an unlawful assembly 
with a very large number of persons, there is no rule 
of law that states that there cannot be any conviction 
on the testimony of a sole eyewitness, unless that the 
court is of the view that the testimony of such sole 
eyewitness is not reliable. Though, generally it is a 
rule of prudence followed by the courts that a 
conviction may not be sustained if it is not supported 
by two or more witnesses who give a consistent 
account of the incident in a fit case the court may 
believe a reliable sole eyewitness if in his testimony 
he makes specific reference to the identity of the 
individual and his specific overt acts in the incident. 
The rule of requirement of more than one witness 
applies only in a case where a witness deposes in a 
general and vague manner, or in the case of a riot."

As already observed, we have discussed the 

evidence of the eye witnesses in detail. It is true that the 

trial Court has convicted the accused Shivaji Kadaji Pawar 

and Namdeo Shivaji Pawar for the offence punishable under 

Section 302 of IPC and the accused Shivaji Kadaji Pawar, 

Vilas s/o Kadaji Pawar and Namdeo Shivaji Pawar 
have 

been convicted for the offence punishable under Section 452 

and 324 of IPC and sentenced them as stated herein above. 

In all 35 accused faced the trial; out of which, accused 

Dayanand Maruti Bhingole and Mahadeo Shivaji Pawar 

absconded and their trial is separated by the trial Court. 

The State and also the original complainant have filed two 

separate appeals against acquittal of other accused and also 

for enhancement of sentence of three accused who are 

convicted by the trial Court. Since we are exercising our 

appellate jurisdiction under Section 386 of Cr.P.C., it was 

incumbent upon us to reappreciate the entire evidence in 

minute details, since there are three appeals, one against 

conviction and two against acquittal of the remaining 

accused. The common argument advanced on behalf of the 

acquitted accused is that in view of their acquittal by the 

trial Court, their innocence is reinforced and therefore, this

414.11crapl 
172 

Court may not interfere in their acquittal order. In that 

respect, it would be worthwhile to refer the observations of 

the Supreme Court in case of State of U.P. vs. Babu & 

Ors. 4 , in paragraph 10 of the judgment which reads, thus: 

"10. Recently in State of Punjab v. Karnail Singh 
(2003 AIR SCW 4065) it was observed that there is no 
embargo on the Appellate Court reviewing the 
evidence upon which an order of acquittal is based. 
Generally, the order of acquittal shall not be interfered 
with because the presumption of innocence of the 
accused is further strengthened by acquittal. The 
golden thread which runs through the web of 
administration of justice in criminal cases is that if 
two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the 
case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the 
other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to 
the accused should be adopted. The paramount 
consideration of the Court is to ensure that 
miscarriage of justice is prevented. A miscarriage of 
justice which may arise from acquittal of the guilty is 
no less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a 
case where admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is 
cast upon the Appellate Court to reappreciate the 
evidence even where the accused has been acquitted, 
for the purpose of ascertaining as to whether any of 
the accused committed any offence or not. [See 
Bhagwan Singh and others v. State of Madhya 
Pradesh (2002 (3) JT (SC) 387). The principle to be 
followed by appellate Court considering the appeal 
against the judgment of acquittal is to interfere only 
when there are compelling and substantial reasons for 
doing so. If the impugned judgment is clearly 
unreasonable, it is a compelling reason for 
interference. These aspects were highlighted by this 
Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade and another v. 
State of Maharashtra (1973 (2) SCC 793), Ramesh 
Babulal Doshi v. State of Gujarat (1996 (9) SCC 225) 

4 2003 ALL MR(Cri) 2356 (S.C.);

and Jaswant Singh v. State of Haryana (2000 (4) JT 
(SC) 114)." 

Therefore, the paramount consideration of this 

Court while exercising the jurisdiction under Section 386 

Cr.P.C. is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is prevented. 

As observed by the Supreme Court, miscarriage of justice 

which may arise from acquittal of the guilty is no less than 

from the conviction of an innocent. 
In a case where 

admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is cast upon the 

Appellate Court to reappreciate the evidence even where 

the accused has been acquitted, for the purpose of 

ascertaining as to whether any of the accused committed 

any offence or not. 
Therefore, in the light of these 

observations of the Supreme Court, as already observed, we 

have reappreciated the entire evidence brought on record 

by the prosecution.

After discussing the evidence of the eye 

witnesses, medical evidence, spot panchanama, inquest 

panchanama and other evidence placed on record by the 

prosecution, we are of the opinion that, the prosecution did 

firmly establish that the incident had taken place in the

414.11crapl 
174 

courtyard of the house of complainant Baburao. It has 

come in the evidence of P.W.16 Baburao and also evidence 

of other prosecution witnesses that in the Gram Panchayat 

election of the village Jamga, complainant's panel secured 

majority and rival panel, headed by accused Shivaji Kadaji 

Pawar lost the elections of Gram Panchayat. Thereafter, 

prosecution has brought on record that at the time of 

election of Sarpanch, there was obstruction at the hands of 

rival group headed by Shivaji Kadaji Pawar, as a result of 

which, election of Sarpanch was postponed to next day of 

the scheduled date and complainant's daughterinlaw got 

elected as Sarpanch. The complainant has also stated in 

his evidence that threats were extended that the elected 

body would not be allowed to carry on their functions or to 

hold Gram Sabha. In the present case, there are as many 

as eleven eye witnesses; out of which, six are injured 

witnesses, three of which sustained grievous injuries, 

dangerous to their lives and though the other eye witnesses, 

according to the prosecution, were assaulted, their injuries 

were not visible. Therefore, in such a case, where there is 

direct evidence in the nature of eye witnesses, the motive 

loses its importance. We have already discussed in detail

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl

the evidence of each witness and the position which 

emerges from the evidence of complainant and some of the 

eye witnesses i.e. PW22, PW18, PW17, PW21, PW22, 

PW25 etc. is that, the mob of more than 30 -40 persons, 

with deadly weapons like swords, knife, Katti and also 

sticks, iron rods came to the house of the complainant in 

between 7 to 7.30 p.m. The fact that some members of the 

said group were armed with swords and also knife and 

other sharp weapons, is a clear indication that using such 

weapons would certainly result into grievous injuries and 

death and, with such knowledge, the members of the said 

group participated, they were aggressors inasmuch as, a 

group of 30 -40 persons proceeded to the house of the 

complainant Baburao, they entered in the house and 

committed murder of Gyandeo son of the complainant. 

And caused grievous injury to Shahuraj, Vijaykumar and 

Sanjay whereas, simple injuries to other three witnesses. 

There cannot be a room for doubt that the members of the 

said assembly had knowledge that use of such weapons 

would certainly result into casualties. The behaviour of the 

assembly while proceeding towards the house of 

complainant, as stated by the witnesses, was certainly

414.11crapl 
176 

violent, some of them were giving slogans that they would 

ensure that no member of the complainant's family is left 

alive. 
Apart from that, they were instigating and 

encouraging each other for commission of offence. 

Therefore, if the evidence of the complainant and other 

witnesses is considered in its entirety, an inevitable 

conclusion is that each member of the unlawful assembly 

had knowledge that there would be commission of offence / 

casualties. The members knew that weapons which were 

carried by some of the members of the assembly, if used, 

certainly would result into death or grievous injuries and 

therefore, behaviour of the assembly prior to the incident 

and at the time of incident and the fact that deadly weapons 

were used, leads to only conclusion that they formed an 

unlawful assembly in furtherance of their common object to 

assault / cause grievous hurt, in order to kill every member 

of the family of complainant Baburao, and in furtherance of 

that common object, as a matter of fact, Gyandeo was 

assaulted with swords and other weapons and as a result, 

he died. Out of eleven eye witnesses, six are injured 

witnesses; three of them suffered grievous injuries, 

dangerous to their lives. 
The overwhelming medical

evidence clearly corroborates the version / evidence of the 

eye witnesses. P.W.27 Dr.Pralhad Solanke and P.W.28 Dr. 

Shivanand Biradar were the medical officers examined by 

the prosecution and we have already discussed their 

evidence in detail in para 37 to 41. Therefore, it is not 

necessary to repeat the same once again. In order to hold 

that the assembly was unlawful, it is necessary to meet the 

ingredients of sections 141 and 142 of IPC. In the present 

case, the prosecution has established beyond doubt that 

there was assembly of more than five persons and the case 

in hand would be covered by the provisions of section 141 of 

IPC. Section 141 of IPC reads, thus: 

" 141. Unlawful assembly.An assembly of five or 
more persons is designated an "unlawful assembly", if 
the common object of the persons composing that 
assembly is 

First.To overawe by criminal force, or show of 
criminal force, or the Central or any State 
Government or Parliament or the Legislature of any 
State, or any public servant in the exercise of the 
lawful power of such public servant; or 

Second.To resist the execution of any law, or of any 
legal process; or 

Third.To commit any mischief or criminal trespass, 
or other offence; or 

Fourth.By means of criminal force, or show of 
criminal force, to any person to take or obtain 
possession of any property, or to deprive any person

of the enjoyment of a right of way, or of the use of 
water or other incorporeal right of which he is in 
possession or enjoyment, or to enforce any right or 
supposed right; or 

Fifth.By means of criminal force, or show of criminal 
force, to compel any person to do what he is not 
legally bound to do, or to omit to do what he is legally 
entitled to do. Explanation.An assembly which was 
not unlawful when it assembled, may subsequently 
become an unlawful assembly." 

98] 
Upon careful perusal of the provisions of section 

141 of IPC, the present case is covered under "Clause 

Third". 
The assembly entered in the house of the 

complainant and thereby committed criminal trespass. 

They have also committed offence and therefore, ingredients 

of section 141 are met in the present case. The accused 

persons more than five in number, in furtherance of 

common object to assault / cause grievous hurt to members 

of complainant's family, so as to kill every member of the 

family of complainant Baburao, proceeded to the house of 

the complainant with deadly weapons, their behaviour prior 

to commission of offence and at the time of commission of 

offence was certainly in furtherance of common object. 

Their involvement was not passive. They knew the result of 

forming such an unlawful assembly. As a matter of fact, the

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
179 

members of the unlawful assembly who are named and 

overt act attributed to them, actually participated in 

commission of murder of Gyandeo and injured other eye 

witnesses. 

99] Section 142 of IPC reads, thus: 

" 142. Being member of unlawful assembly.Whoever, 
being aware of facts which render any assembly an 
unlawful assembly, intentionally joins that assembly, 
or continues in it, is said to be a member of an 
unlawful assembly." 

As already observed, members of the unlawful 

assembly were aware as to for what purpose they have 

assembled and were proceeding to the house of Baburao, 

they were aggressors, they formed an unlawful assembly 

knowing the object, joined the assembly and they continued 

their association till the actual offence was committed. 

Therefore, in the present case, the prosecution has proved 

that in furtherance of the common object, the accused 

persons formed an unlawful assembly and they proceeded 

to the house of the complainant Baburao so as to assault / 

cause grievous hurt, to finish every member of his family 

and succeeded in killing his son Gyandeo and injuring other 

six eye witnesses from his blood relation. 
The other

414.11crapl 
180 

witnesses have also received injuries but, those were not 

visible and the medical officer has not examined them. 

100] 
At this juncture, it would be relevant to refer the 

provisions of section 149 of IPC which read. Thus: 

"149. Every member of unlawful assembly guilty 
of offence committed in prosecution of common 
object.If an offence is committed by any 
member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution 
of the common object of that assembly, or such 
as the members of that assembly knew to be 
likely to be committed in prosecution of that 
object, every person who, at the time of the 
committing of that offence, is a member of the 
same assembly, is guilty of that offence." 

101] 
By applying the test / criteria laid down in the 

case of Masalti (supra) that in case of mob attack, in order 

to ascertain whether there was actual participation of each 

accused, the Court should ensure that two or more than 

two witnesses have actually deposed about the involvement 

of accused in commission of offence. If said test is applied 

in respect of accused Shivaji Kadaji Pawar, P.W.25 

Vijaykumar, P.W.21 Mahadev, P.W.22 Shahuraj and P.W.16 

Baburao i.e. complainant have in clear words stated his 

involvement and overtacts. 
He assaulted deceased 

Gyandeo with sword on chest and to that effect, there is 

corroboration through medical evidence. 
All other eye

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
181 

witnesses have also deposed that accused Shivaji assaulted 

Gyandeo with sword. After assaulting Gyandeo, he even 

assaulted other eye witnesses i.e. P.W.22 Shahuraj and 

other witnesses. Therefore, so far as Shivaji Kadaji Pawar is 

concerned, the evidence of prosecution witnesses is 

consistent and gets corroboration from the medical 

evidence. As already observed, P.W.27 Dr.Pralhad Solanke 

and P.W.28 Dr. Shivanand Biradar were examined as 

medical officers and they have deposed in their evidence 

about the injuries sustained by the deceased Gyandeo and 

other eye witnesses. 

As far as accused Shivaji Kadaji Pawar is 

concerned, the eye witnesses namely, P.W.16, P.W.17, 

P.W.18, P.W.19, P.W.20, P.W.21, P.W.22, P.W.23, P.W.24, 

P.W.25, P.W.26, attributed overtacts to Shivaji stating that 

he inflicted sword blows on the person of deceased Gyandeo, 

injured Sheshrao and Shahuraj. 

102] 
So far as accused Namdeo Shivaji Pawar is 

concerned, again the evidence of 
P.W.25 Vijaykumar, 

P.W.21 Mahadev, P.W.22 Shahuraj and P.W.16 Baburao i.e. 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
182 

complainant is consistent that Namdeo assaulted with a 

sword not only to the deceased Gyandeo but, even to other 

witnesses. Since the evidence of all the witnesses have been 

already discussed in detail, it is not necessary to repeat the 

same. Suffice it to say that, as regards accused Namdeo 

Shivaji Pawar is concerned, eye witnesses namely, P.W.16, 

P.W.17, P.W.18, attributed overtacts to accused Namdeo 

that he inflicted Jambiya blows to Gyandeo deceased and 

Vijaykumar -injured, P.W.20 attributed that he inflicted 

Jambiya blow to Gyandeo P.W.21 stated that he gave 

Jambiya blow to 
Shahuraj, P.W.22, P.W.23, P.W.24, 

P.W.25, P.W.26 attributed overtacts to accused Namdeo 

that he gave Jambiya blow to deceased Gyandeo. P.W.25 

also attributed overtacts to Namdeo that he gave Jambiya 

blow him i.e. P.W.25 Vijaykumar. 

Suffice it to say that by applying the test in the 

case of Masalti (supra), there is overwhelming evidence 

regarding involvement of Namdeo Shivaji Pawar in the 

commission of offence. 
The eye witness account gets 

corroboration from the medical evidence. The other eye 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
183 

witnesses have also stated about his involvement. Though 

it was argued by the learned Counsel for the accused that 

Namdeo is not named in the FIR or complaint, FIR is not an 

encyclopedia and evidence of eleven eye witnesses is before 

us and involvement of Namdeo is proved by the prosecution 

beyond reasonable doubt. The eye witness account gets 

corroboration from medical evidence and other evidence on 

record. 

103] 
P.W.25 Vijaykumar, P.W.21 Mahadev, P.W.22 

Shahuraj and P.W.16 Baburao i.e. complainant and almost 

all eye witnesses have stated about presence of Vimalbai 

Pawar in the unlawful assembly. Not only that, a specific 

overtact has been attributed to her that she assaulted on 

the ribs of Gyandeo with a knife. If medical evidence is 

perused carefully and in particular, Injury No.5 sustained 

by deceased Gyandeo, the evidence of prosecution witnesses 

about the overtact played by Vimalbai Pawar gets 

corroboration from medical evidence. 

As far as accused Vimalbai Pawar is concerned, 

P.W.16, P.W.18, P.W.20, P.W.21, P.W.22, P.W.23, P.W.24, 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
184 

P.W.25, P.W.26 attributed overtacts to accused Vimalbai 

that she inflicted knife blow on the back of deceased 

Gyandeo. 

The trial Court acquitted her on the ground that 

there is no proper recovery of knife from her. In our 

opinion, it appears that the trial Court failed in its duty to 

take into consideration the substantive piece of evidence in 

the nature of eye witnesses and also the medical evidence. 

Merely because, there is no proper recovery of knife, that by 

itself cannot be a ground to ignore the evidence of eleven eye 

witnesses, which gets corroboration from the medical 

evidence and, therefore, her involvement as a member of the 

unlawful assembly and actual commission of offence has 

been proved by the prosecution mainly through the evidence 

of P.W.25 Vijaykumar, P.W.21 Mahadev, P.W.22 Shahuraj 

and P.W.16 Baburao i.e. complainant and other eye 

witnesses. 

104] 
Therefore, if the test in the case of Masalti 

(supra) is applied, the prosecution case against the accused 

Shivaji Kadaji Pawar, Namdeo Shivaji Pawar and Vimalbai 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015

414.11crapl 
185 

Shivaji Pawar is fully established. It is relevant to mention 

at this juncture that P.W.25 Vijaykumar was seriously 

injured and he sustained injuries dangerous to his life. 

Therefore, his evidence assumes importance and his 

evidence does not suffer from any contradictions, omissions 

or improvements. Like in the same manner, evidence of 

P.W.21 Mahadeo, so far the above three accused are 

concerned, does not suffer from any contradictions, 

omissions or improvements. 

105] 
P.W.25 Vijaykumar, P.W.21 Mahadev, P.W.22 

Shahuraj and P.W.16 Baburao i.e. complainant, all of them 

have stated that the persons from the mob were pelting 

stones, then mob came in the courtyard, mob was 

comprising of 30 -40 persons, on hearing shouts Gyandeo 

came outside first and P.W.25 Vijaykumar followed him. 

Other persons in the house also came in the courtyard. 

Accused Satish Vaijinath Pawar, Udhav Shivaji Pawar and 

Tukaram Pawar caught hold Gyandeo and at that time, 

Shivaji Kadaji Pawar inflicted sword blow on left chest of 

Gyandeo. 
Almost all eye witnesses including P.W.25 

Vijaykumar, P.W.21 Mahadev, P.W.22 Shahuraj and P.W.16

414.11crapl 
186 

Baburao i.e. complainant are consistent in their deposition 

that the above mentioned three accused caught hold 

Gyandeo and then Shivaji Pawar inflicted sword blow on left 

chest of Gyandeo. Therefore, involvement of these three 

accused in caught holding Gyandeo facilitated accused 

persons and in particular, Shivaji Pawar to give blow with 

sword on the chest of Gyandeo and also to other accused to 

assault Gyandeo and Vijaykumar. The other witnesses have 

also stated that after Gyandeo fell down, Satish Baburao 

Pawar, Vaijinath Pawar, Venkat Vaijinath Pawar caught 

hold P.W.25 Vijaykumar. Therefore, involvement of Satish 

Baburao Pawar, Vaijinath Pawar, Venkat Vaijinath Pawar in 

caught holding P.W.25 Vijaykumar is also stated by the 

prosecution witnesses. 

As regards accused Uddhav Shivaji Pawar, 

Satish Vaijinath Pawar and Tukaram Shivaji Pawar, 

P.WS.16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26 attributed 

overtacts to these accused that they caught hold Gyandeo 

thereby facilitating other accused to assault him. 

P.Ws.16, 17, 18 and 25 also attributed overt 

acts to accused Uddhav that he assaulted Vijaykumar by 

iron rod. P.Ws.21 and 25 attributed overtacts to Satish

414.11crapl

that he caught hold Vijaykumar. 

As regards accused Vilas Shivaji Pawar, P.Ws.16 

& 18 attributed overtacts to Vilas stating that assaulted 

Vijaykumar and Shahuraj by stick, P.WS.17 & 25 stated 

that he assaulted with stick to Vijaykumar, P.W.22 stated 

that Vilas assaulted with stick to Shahuraj. 

As regards accused Ashok Kadaji Pawar, 

P.Ws.16, 17, 18 and 24 attributed overtacts to Ashok that 

he assaulted injured Sheshrao with Katti. 

As regards accused Waman Dadarao Pawar, 

P.Ws.16, and 17 attributed overtacts to Waman that he 

assaulted Baburao with stick on back and P.W.18 

attributed overtacts to Waman that he assaulted Varsha 

with stick. 

As regards accused Dayanand Maroti Bhingole 

(absconding), P.Ws.16, 17, 18, 20 to 26 attributed overtacts 

to Dayanand that he assaulted deceased Gyandeo with 

sword. 

As regards accused Madhav Shivaji Pawar 

(absconding), P.Ws.16. 21 & 25 stated that Madahv inflicted 

sword/Jambiya blow to Gyandeo and Vijaykumar, P.Ws.17

414.11crapl

& 18 attributed overtacts to accused Madhav that he 

assaulted injured Gyandeo, Vijaykumar and Sanjay with 

sword like Jambiya. P.W.26 stated that accused Madhav 

assaulted Gyandeo and Sanjay with sword -Jambiya. 

P.Ws.20, 22, 23, 24 attributed overtacts to accused 

Madhav that he assaulted Gyandeo with sword. 

As regards accused Haridas Manik Pawar, 

P.Ws.17 & 25 attributed overtacts to accused Haridas that 

he assaulted injured Vijaykumar with iron rod. 

As regards accused Devidas Pralhad Pawar, 

P.Ws.16, 17, 18 and 23 attributed overtacts to accused 

Devidas that he assaulted injured Bhagwat with stick. 

As regards accused Venkat Vaijinath Pawar, 

P.Ws.21 & 25 attributed overtacts to accused Venkat that 

he caught hold injured Vijaykumar. 

As regards accused Vaijinath Vithal Pawar, 

P.Ws.21 & 25 attributed overtacts to accused Vaijinath that 

he caught hold injured Vijaykumar. 

As regards accused Satish Baburao Pawar, 

P.W.21 Mahadeo Pawar attributed overtact to accused 

Satish Baburao Pawar stating that along with other accused 

::: Uploaded on -23/02/2015 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:53:39 ::: 


414.11crapl 
189 

he caught hold Vijaykumar. Even, P.W.25 Vijaykumar 

stated that Satish Pawar caught hold him. Vijaykumar 

identified the accused Satish Baburao Pawar along with 

other accused present in the court. 

As regards accused Prakash Kadaji Pawar, 

P.Ws.16,17, 18, 22 attributed overtacts to accused Prakash 

that he assaulted injured Shahuraj with iron rod. 

Therefore, their presence in the unlawful 

assembly and their overtacts has been stated by the 

prosecution witnesses, which facilitated other accused to 

assault Gyandeo and also P.W.25 Vijaykumar. We have 

also observed that the mob formed an unlawful assembly in 

furtherance of their common object to finish the members of 

complainant's family and, therefore, the provisions of 

section 149 of IPC are very much attracted and, therefore, 

each member of the unlawful assembly is equally 

responsible being part of the unlawful assembly. Therefore, 

the proselcution has proved beyond reasonable doubt 

involvement of Satish Vaijinath Pawar, Udhav Shivaji Pawar 

and Tukaram Pawar who caught hold Gyandeo and Satish 

Baburao Pawar, Venkat Vaijinath Pawar and Vaijinath 

Pawar caught hold Vijaykumar, which facilitated other

accused to inflict blows with their weapons. 

106] 
So far as accused Ashok Kadaji Pawar is 

concerned, there is evidence of P.W.21 that he was holding 

Katti and assaulted injured witness Shesherao. P.W.16 has 

also assigned specific role to him. Some of other witnesses 

have also deposed to that effect. 

107] 
In case of accused Venkat Pawar, the P.W.25 

Vijaykumar attributed overtact to accused Venkat that he 

along other accused caught hold this witness while Madhav 

Shivaji Pawar and Namdeo Pawar inflicted sword blows to 

him. So also P.W.21 Mahadeo also attributed overtact to 

accused Venkat that he caught hold Vijaykumar and 

facilitated inflicting of sword blows by by Madhav Shivaji 

Pawar. 

108] 
So far as accused Haridas Manik Pawar is 

concerned, P.W.25 Vijaykumar in his evidence stated that 

he assaulted by iron rod on his back. Likewise, accused 

Prakash Kadaji Pawar assaulted P.W.22 by iron rod. The 

said fact is deposed by P.W.16 Baburao and also P.W.22

and also other eye witnesses. So far as accused Devidas 

Pralhad Pawar is concerned, P.W.16 Baburao has deposed 

that Devidas assaulted Bhagwat Pawar with stick. So far as 

accused Satish Baburao Pawar is concerned, P.W.21 stated 

that he caught hold P.W.25 Vijaykumar and also P.W.25 

deposed to that effect. Other witnesses have also stated 

that Satish Pawar caught hold Vijaykumar.

conclusion is that 
above mentioned accused persons 

named by witnesses formed an unlawful assembly, they 

were aggressors, they had knowledge, they went to the 

house of the complainant, some of them gave slogans that 

they will see that no member of the family of the 

complainant is left alive 
and in furtherance of their 

common object to assault / cause grievous hurt to members 

of complainant's family so as to finish entire family, accused 

entered in the house of the complainant and in courtyard, 

they killed Gyandeo and injured Vijaykumar, Sanjay and 

Shahuraj grievously and three others with simple injuries. 

So far other family members of the family complainant are 

concerned, it is deposed by the complainant that other 

members were also assaulted, their injuries were not visible 

and therefore, they were not examined by the Medical 

Officer. 

At this stage, learned counsel Mr. R.S. Shinde

submitted that, as per the evidence of prosecution 

witnesses, injury inflicted by accused no.12 assured 

Sheshrao Pawar by Katti on the right leg shin and by 

accused No. 30 Prakash by iron rod on the back of 

Shahuraj. However, the version of the prosecution 

witnesses about overt act of causing injuries attributed 

to accused nos. 12 and 30 do not get corroboration 

from the medical evidence. In our opinion, when 

prosecution has alleged formation of unlawful 

assembly, and more than five accused assaulting by 

deadly weapons on Gyandeo, and also other witnesses 

were assaulted with common object to cause grievous 

hurt to the members of the family of the complainant 

Baburao, each member of the unlawful assembly 

irrespective of any overt act attributed to him/her, if 

prosecution has established his/her presence at the 

spot, and their participation is with the knowledge that, 

such deadly weapons carried either by the coaccused 

or by himself/herself in furtherance of common object, 

is sufficient to hold responsible such accused for

commission of all the offences in view of the provisions 

of Sections 141, 142 and 149 of I.P. Code. The evidence 

of PW16, PW25 and other eye witnesses corroborates 

with each other in material particulars about formation 

of unlawful assembly by the accused persons and in 

furtherance of common object to assault / cause 

grievous hurt to the family members of the 

complainant, each member of said unlawful assembly 

is equally responsible for death of Gyandeo and injuries 

inflicted on the prosecution witnesses, and therefore, it 

becomes wholly irrelevant which member of unlawful 

assembly had assaulted by which weapon, and whether 

there is corresponding injuries found on the body of the 

victims because of blow given by the accused. 

Therefore, arguments of Advocate Mr. R.S. Shinde for 

accused deserves no consideration and same stands 

rejected.

In our opinion, punishment should be related to 

the gravity of the offence. The Supreme Court in the case of

Jai Kumar vs. State of M.P. 5 while considering various 

theories of punishment, observed that Justice is supreme 

and justice ought to be beneficial for the society so that the 

society is placed in a better off situation. Law courts exist 

for the society and ought to rise up to the occasion to do the 

needful in the matter, and as such ought to act in a manner 

so as to subserve the basic requirement of the society. It is 

a requirement of the society and the law must respond to its 

need. The greatest virtue of law is its flexibility and its 

adaptability, it must change from time to time so that it 

answers the cry of the people, the need of the hour and the 

order of the day. 

In the light of observations of the Supreme 

Court in case of Jai Kumar (supra), it is our duty to award 

appropriate sentence to the accused persons who were 

members of unlawful assembly and in furtherance of their 

common object, indeed they participated in the commission 

of offence and their overtacts are spelled out by as many as 

eleven eye witnesses examined by the prosecution. The 

Supreme Court in the case of K.C. Mathew and others vs 

5 (1999) 5 SCC 1;

State of TravancoreCochin 6 , while explaining section 149 

and 300 IPC, held that section 149 applies not only to 

offences actually committed in pursuance of the common 

object but also to offences that members of the assembly 

know are likely to be committed. 

Yet, in another judgment in the case of Lalji and 

others v. State of U.P., 7 the Supreme Court held that the 

members of unlawful assembly cannot be acquitted for lack 

of corroboration as to their participation in the offence. 

While explaining scope of section 149 of IPC, it is held that 

said section makes every member of an unlawful assembly 

at the time of committing offence guilty of that offence. 

Section created a constructive or vicarious liability of the 

members of the unlawful assembly for the unlawful acts 

committed pursuant to the common object by any other 

member of that assembly. 

Yet, in another judgment in the case of State of A.P. 

V Thakkidiram Reddy 8 , the Supreme Court held in para 

17, thus: 

"17. From the above judgments of this Court it is

evident that to ascertain whether a particular person 
shared the common object of the unlawful assembly it 
is not essential to prove that he committed some 
illegal overt act or had been guilty of some illegal 
omission in pursuance of the common object. Once it 
is demonstrated from all the facts an d circumstances 
of a given case that he shared the common object of 
the unlawful assembly in furtherance of which some 
offence was committed or he knew was likely to be 
committed by any other person, he would be guilty 
of that offence. Undoubtedly, commission of an overt 
act by such a person would be one of the tests to 
prove that he shared the common object, but it is not 
the sole test. Coming now to the present case, the fact 
that at the dead of night a mob of persons armed with 
various weapons forcibly trespassed into the house of 
the deceased after breaking open the door, clearly 
indicates that they had formed an unlawful assembly 
with a common object to commit some offence and 
each of them would be liable for the offence committed 
or knew likely to be committed by any of the members 
of the mob. To ascertain what was the common object 
of the above unlawful assembly, we will advert later. 
Suffice it to say, at this stage, that in the facts and 
circumstances of this case the six accused (with 
whom only we are concerned in these appeals) would 
be guilty for the offence committed by any other 
member of the mob, in furtherance of the common 
object, without proof of any overt act committed by 
them. We do not, however, wish to dilate on this 
aspect of the matter any further as we find the second 
ground canvassed by the High Court that the ocular 
evidence regarding overt acts committed by A2 to A5 
and A9 is not supported by medical evidence, is 
factually incorrect."

In case of Dani Singh and others vs. State of 

Bihar 9 , the Supreme Court, relying upon the judgment in 

the case of Masalti (supra) and also other judgments, in 

9 (2004) 13 SCC 203;

para 19 held that, where parties go with a common purpose 

to execute a common object, each and every person 

becomes responsible for the act of each and every other in 

execution and furtherance of their common purpose; as the 

purpose is common, so must be the responsibility. 

113] 
Recently, the Supreme Court in case of State of 

U.P. vs. Chandrika 10 , in the facts of that case held that, 

there was prompt lodging of F.I.R. common object of 

unlawful assembly armed with Gun was to commit murder. 

Testimonies of injured witnesses present at spot could not 

be doubted being corroborated with eye witnesses as well as 

medical evidence. Finding of acquittal recorded by trial 

Court ignoring materials on record oral as well as 

documentary evidence fully supported by medical evidence. 

Acquittal of accused found to be based basically on dying 

declaration whose maker was alive. Said statement was not 

admissible in evidence. On appraisal of evidence on record it 

was amply clear that prosecution had fully proved its case 

beyond doubts. Judgment and order of acquittal reversed 

and all the accused were convicted by allowing government

appeal. 

In case of Phodol vs. State of C.G. 11 , Chhattisgarh 

High Court, in the facts of that case, held that injuries 

found over bodies of deceased were incised wounds, 

lacerated wounds and depressed fracture of head. 

Appellants were holding battleaxe and other weapons and 

they had caused homicidal death of three persons and also 

caused fatal injuries to prosecution witness by battleaxe 

and other weapons. 
Evidence adduced on behalf of 

prosecution and defence taken by appellants were sufficient 

to establish fact that appellants had formed unlawful 

assembly having its common object to commit murder of 

deceased and in furtherance of common object of assembly, 

they were armed with deadly weapons. Therefore, 

Chhattisgarh High Court maintained order of conviction of 

the accused therein. 

In case of Manilal vs. State of Kerala, 12 the Kerala 

High Court while explaining scope of section 149 of IPC, 

held that even if the identity of some of the accused forming 

part of the unlawful assembly is not established or even if

one or more of the accused are acquitted granting benefit of 

doubt, that does not absolve the other accused from being 

proceeded against under Section 149 of the Indian Penal 

Code. 

The facts in the case in hand and those in case of Om 

Prakash vs. State of Haryana, 13 are almost similar. In 

the said case, the Supreme Court, while considering the 

provisions of Section 141, 142, 148 and 149 and also 

sections 302 and 319 of IPC, held that there was no delay in 

lodging FIR. 
Ocular testimony gets corroborated from 

medical evidence. All accused persons came together armed 

with lathis and gun. 
Eye witnesses who are natural 

witnesses, being brothers, have deposed in unequivocal 

manner about assault by all accused persons. Common 

object is clearly evident. In such situation, attribution of 

specific individual overt act has no role to play. All requisite 

tests to attract section 149 established by prosecution and 

the contentions raised by appellants therein were rejected 

and the Supreme Court upheld the order of conviction 

passed by the High Court. If the evidence in the present 

case is considered in the light of the judgment of the

Supreme Court in case of Kuldeep Yadav and Ors. vs. 

State of Bihar, 14 that there is cogent, trustworthy, 

clinching and reliable evidence of the eye witnesses. Out of 

eleven eye witnesses, six are injured witnesses, out of 

which, three suffered grievous injuries, dangerous to their 

lives. These witnesses have attributed overtacts to afore 

mentioned 15 accused persons. Therefore, evidence led by 

the prosecution in the present case satisfy the tests laid 

down in the case of Kuldeep Yadav (supra). However, it 

would be relevant to mention at this juncture that, it 

appears that the judgment in case of Masalti (supra), which 

is by the larger Bench consisting four Honourable Judges, 

was not brought to the notice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

in case of Kuldeep Yadav (supra).

paragraphs, we are of the considered view that the judgment
