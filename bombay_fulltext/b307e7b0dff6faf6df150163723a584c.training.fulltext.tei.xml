<p>1.<lb/>
 Heard Shri V.G. Pradhan &amp; Shri R.S. Mhamane the learned<lb/>
 Special Public Prosecutors appearing for CBI. I have also heard Shri<lb/>
 Kale, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No.1 and<lb/>
 Shri Tiwari, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of accused No.2.<lb/>
 I<lb/>
</p>


<p>2.<lb/>
 In the present case, the complaint dated 02/06/1993 was filed<lb/>
 by Shri V. Sethumadhavan, Chief Vigilance Officer of the Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank. Initially, the complaint was filed for the offence punishable<lb/>
 under section 120-B read with section 420 of the Indian Penal code<lb/>
 and section 13(1) (d) read with section 13(2) of the Prevention of<lb/>
 Corruption Act against one R Sundaresan, the then Divisional<lb/>
 Manager, Syndicate Bank, FIM Division, Bombay and Directors and<lb/>
 Office bearers of M/s Fair Growth Investments Ltd. (FGIL) and M/s<lb/>
 Fair Growth Financial Services Ltd. (FGFSL). In the said complaint, it<lb/>
 was alleged that Shri R. Sundaresan was in-charge of FIM Division of<lb/>
 the Syndicate Bank at Bombay and Portfolio Management Services<lb/>
 transactions were conducted at his instance without specific<lb/>
 authorization from the Head Office and that these transactions were<lb/>
 entered into pursuant to the criminal conspiracy which was entered<lb/>
 into with an object of cheating the Syndicate Bank and that the said R.<lb/>
 Sundaresan and others abused their position to cause wrongful gain to<lb/>
 other accused and corresponding wrongful loss to the Syndicate Bank.<lb/>
 After the offence was registered, CBI made an investigation and<lb/>
 charge-sheet came to be filed against R.S. Pai, the Executive Director of<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank, accused No.1 herein and K.R.N. Shenoy, Managing<lb/>
 Director of Mis Fair Growth Investments Ltd., accused No.2 herein. R.<lb/>
 Sundaresan who was initially named as an accused in the complaint<lb/>
 was dropped from the array of accused and in the charge-sheet it was<lb/>
 alleged that Shri R.S. Pai, Executive Director of the Syndicate Bank and<lb/>
 Shri K.R.N. Shenoy had entered into a conspiracy with an object of<lb/>
 committing criminal breach of trust of the funds placed with the<lb/>
 Portfolio Management Scheme of the Syndicate Bank by Oil Industries<lb/>
 Development Board (hereinafter referred to as &quot;OIDB&quot;). Four charges<lb/>
 were framed against both the accused. In the first charge, it was<lb/>
 alleged that during the period from October 1991 to May 1992,<lb/>
 accused Nos. 1 and 2 had entered into criminal conspiracy for<lb/>
 siphoning off funds and providing and investing these funds in the<lb/>
 Portfolio Management Scheme of the Syndicate Bank and, therefore,<lb/>
 they had committed an offence punishable under section 120-B read<lb/>
 with section 409 of the lndian Penal Code. The second charge which<lb/>
 was levelled against accused N o.1 was that he misused his official<lb/>
 position as an Executive Director of a Nationalized Bank i.e the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank to place with the<lb/>
 Ponfolio Management Scheme<lb/>
 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;PMS&quot;) of the Syndicate Bank an amount of<lb/>
 Rs 132.33 crores. He was also charged that seven remittances of<lb/>
 various amounts during the period from 02/04/1992 and 30/05/1992<lb/>
 which were remitted by OIDB were invested in PMS activity of the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank in violation of directions/guidelines contained in the<lb/>
 letters sent by the Syndicate Bank and also in violation of RBI&apos;s<lb/>
 Circular dated 18/01/1991. The accused No.l was further charged for<lb/>
 illegally investing the said amount in the Company of accused No.2 in<lb/>
 order to enable him and his Company to make a wrongful gain and,<lb/>
 therefore, it was alleged that accused No.1 committed an offence<lb/>
 punishable under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code.<lb/>
</p>

<p>3.<lb/>
 The third charge which was framed against the accused No.l<lb/>
 was that as a motive and/or reward for causing aforesaid wrongful<lb/>
 gain to accused No.2, he got transferred 62000 shares from the<lb/>
 promoters&apos; quota of M/s Fair Growth Investment Ltd (FGIL) and its<lb/>
 sister concern the Fair Growth Financial Services Ltd., in his name and<lb/>
 he thereby committed an offence punishable under section 13(1)(d)<lb/>
 .<lb/>
</p>

<p>read with section 13(2) and section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption<lb/>
 Act. The fourth charge which was framed against accused N o.2 was<lb/>
 that he had instigated and abetted accused No.1 by transferring the<lb/>
 said 62,000 shares in favour of accused No.I in order to enable FGIL to<lb/>
 make wrongful gain of Rs 93,17,77,925/-.<lb/>
</p>

<p>4.<lb/>
 Both the accused pleaded not guilty to the said charge.<lb/>
 Prosecution examined 16 witnesses and has brought on record number<lb/>
 of documents in support of its case.<lb/>
</p>

 FACTS, FINDINGS &amp; CONCLUSION:<lb/>
</item>

<p>7.<lb/>
 Before taking into consideration the rival submissions, it would<lb/>
 be relevant to briefly take into consideration the chronology of events<lb/>
 and facts and circumstances of this case.<lb/>
</p>

<p>8.<lb/>
 Accused No.1 -R. S. Pai was the Executive Director of Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank and was stationed at Manipal, Kamataka and was posted at Head<lb/>
 Office of Syndicate Bank. OIDB is a Government Organization having<lb/>
 its Head Office at Delhi. OIDB had number of surplus funds at its<lb/>
 disposal which were lying idle and they wanted to invest the said<lb/>
 amount for a period of one year in order to ensure that it would earn<lb/>
 higher profit on the said funds. Syndicate Bank had taken a policy<lb/>
 decision of promoting its PMS and had given offer to all the<lb/>
 Companies, Government Corporations, individuals, to invest their<lb/>
 money in PMS. Accordingly, offer letters were issued by Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank to various Companies. One such offer letter was also sent to<lb/>
 OIDB. The Reserve Bank of India also had revised its guidelines in<lb/>
 respect of investments which were to be received by the Nationalized<lb/>
 Banks in their PMS. Copies of these letters were also sent to OIDB.<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank had informed the OIDB that it would get a tentative<lb/>
 return of 18.25o/o on its investments.<lb/>
 OIDB, through vanous<lb/>
 remittances, sent an amount of rs 132.22 crores to the Syndicate Bank,<lb/>
 Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch, New Delhi. This amount, in tum, was<lb/>
 sent to the FIM Department of the Syndicate Bank at Bombay, who, in<lb/>
 tum, invested these amounts in shares of Private Companies. The<lb/>
 remittances were sent by OIDB between the period from 02/04/1992<lb/>
 to 30/05/1992.<lb/>
</p>

<p>9.<lb/>
 It is the case of the prosecution that OIDB had specifically<lb/>
 instructed the Syndicate Bank to invest the amount remitted by it in<lb/>
 Government Securities, Government Bonds only and not in shares of<lb/>
 Private Companies. It is the case of the prosecution that the Officials<lb/>
 of OIDB were kept in dark and these funds which were remitted for the<lb/>
 purpose of being invested in Government Securities were, in fact,<lb/>
 diverted in favour of accused No.2 -K. R. N. Shenoy in order to enable<lb/>
 him to invest the said amount in his own Company. On the other<lb/>
 hand, it is the case of the Syndicate Bank in its letters and<lb/>
 correspondence between the parties that OIDB was aware that the<lb/>
 amount which was remitted in PMS was always at the risk of the<lb/>
 investors and that these remittances were invested in shares of blue<lb/>
 -chip private •companies.<lb/>
 Prosecution case, therefore, is that the<lb/>
 accused No. l, who was the Executive Director of Syndicate Bank was,<lb/>
 therefore, directly responsible for the investments which were made by<lb/>
 FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay<lb/>
 in Private<lb/>
 Companies, contrary to the specific instructions which were given by<lb/>
 OIDB and contrary to the guidelines which were given by RBI.<lb/>
 Prosecution case further is that, as a return for the favo ur given by<lb/>
 accused No.1 to accused No.2, 62000 shares were transferred in the<lb/>
 name of accused No.1 from the promoters&apos; quota of Mis Fair Growth<lb/>
 Investments Ltd. (FGIL) and its sister concern M/s Fairgrowth<lb/>
 Financial Services Ltd. and, accordingly, a complaint was lodged on<lb/>
 02/06/ 1993 by Shri V. Sethumadhavan, Chief Vigilance Officer,<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank, Head Office, Manipal with the Central Bureau of<lb/>
 Investigation, Mumabi under section 120B read •with section 420 of<lb/>
 the Indian Penal Code and under section 13(2) read with section<lb/>
 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption •Act, 1988 against Shri R.<lb/>
 Sundaresan, the then Divisional Manager, Syndicate Bank, FIM<lb/>
 Division, Bombay and Directors and Office bearers of M/s Fair Growth<lb/>
 Investments Ltd. (FGIL) and its sister concern M/s. Fair Growth<lb/>
 Financial Services Ltd. (FGFSL)<lb/>
</p>

<p>10. On 24/07 /1997, a charge-sheet was filed by the Central Bureau<lb/>
 of Investigation, Bank Securities &amp; Fraud Cell, Bombay in the Special<lb/>
 Court constituted under the Special Courts (Trial of Offences Relating<lb/>
 to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992 at Bombay against Shri R.S.<lb/>
 Pai, the then Executive Director, Syndicate Bank, the accused No.1 and<lb/>
 Shri<lb/>
 K. R. N. Shenoy, Managing Director of M/s Fair Growth<lb/>
 Investments Ltd., the accused No.2<lb/>
 and the charge-sheet was<lb/>
 registered as Special Case No.3 of 1997 in the Special Court at<lb/>
 Bombay.<lb/>
</p>

<p>11. Both the accused filed discharge applications and during the<lb/>
 course of hearing of these discharge applications, the Counsel for the<lb/>
 prosecution thought it necessary to file additional documents and<lb/>
 additional statements in addition to the charge-sheet which was<lb/>
 already filed. Accordingly CBI filed Misc. Application No.338 of 2000<lb/>
 under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 26/07 /2000,<lb/>
 seeking permission of the Court to place on record (i) list of 15<lb/>
 additional witnesses and their respective statements recorded under<lb/>
 section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, (ii) list of all the 67<lb/>
 persons whose statements were recorded under section 161 of the<lb/>
 Code of Criminal Procedure, (iii) list of all search/seizure receipt<lb/>
 memos under which all documents have been seized by CBI and (iv)<lb/>
 additional list of documents with the CBI on which reliance was placed<lb/>
 by CBI.<lb/>
 This application was rejected by the Special Court on<lb/>
 26/07 /2000.<lb/>
</p>

<p>12. CBI preferred an appeal in the Apex Court against the said order<lb/>
 and the appeal was allowed by the Apex Court on 03/04/2002 and the<lb/>
 order passed by the Special Court was set aside and the permission was<lb/>
 granted to CBI for production of additional documents. Thereafter,<lb/>
 again, discharge applications filed by the accused were heard and<lb/>
 were dismissed. Charge was framed against the accused, after they<lb/>
 pleaded not guilty to the offence with which they were charged.<lb/>
 Prosecution, in support of its case, examined 16 witnesses and brought<lb/>
 on record number of documents.<lb/>
</p>

<p>13. After having gone through the oral and documentary evidence<lb/>
 which is brought on record, in my view, the prosecution has not<lb/>
 established that accused No.1 committed an offence punishable under<lb/>
 section 120B read with section 409 of the Indian Pen a l Code or has<lb/>
 committed an offence punishable under section 13(1)(d) read with<lb/>
 section 13(2) read with section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act,<lb/>
 1988. Prosecution also has not established that the accused No.2 has<lb/>
 aided or abetted accused No. l for commission of the offence<lb/>
 punishable under section 409 of the Indian Penal code or for the<lb/>
 offence punishable under section 13(1)(d) read with section 13(2)<lb/>
 read with section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.<lb/>
 Prosecution has not established that accused Nos. 1 and 2 had entered<lb/>
 into criminal conspiracy of diverting funds remitted by OIDB to the<lb/>
 Private Company of accused No.2 in oder to cause wrongful gain to<lb/>
 accused No.2 and wrongful loss to OIDB.<lb/>
</p>

<p>14. I have come to the above conclusion for the following reasons.<lb/>
</p>

<p>15. The first point which falls for consideration is : whether the<lb/>
 prosecution has established that accused No.1 and accused No.2 had<lb/>
 entered into conspiracy to misappropriate the funds which were sent<lb/>
 by OIDB?<lb/>
</p>

<p>16. In the present case, admitted position is that the funds which .<lb/>
 were remitted by OIDB were sent directly to Syndicate Bank, Delhi<lb/>
 Branch and, thereafter, Delhi Branch of Syndicate Bank had sent these<lb/>
 • amounts to FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank at Bombay and,<lb/>
 thereafter, Syndicate Bank, Bombay Branch, had remitted these<lb/>
 amounts to accused No.2 for the purpose of investing it in the<lb/>
 Companies. Prosecution has not been in a position to establish any<lb/>
 direct link with accused No. l who was the Executive Director of<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank and was stationed at Manipal, Kamataka State where<lb/>
 the Syndicate Bank has its Head Office. Neither the witnesses who<lb/>
 were examined from OIDB nor the witnesses who have been examined<lb/>
 from the Syndicate Bank have stated that. these funds were given to<lb/>
 accused No.2 on the instructions of accused No. l. On the contrary,<lb/>
 there is a documentary evidence on record to indicate that OIDB<lb/>
 Officers had, in tum, stated in their letter that they had no concern<lb/>
 with the PIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank at Bombay and that they<lb/>
 were concerned directly with the Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank<lb/>
 since the remittances were made through the Delhi Branch of the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank.<lb/>
</p>

<p>17.<lb/>
 In order to establish the offence of conspiracy, prosecution has to<lb/>
 bring on record either direct or indirect evidence for the purpose of<lb/>
 establishing that there was meeting of minds on the part of the accused<lb/>
 to commit an illegal act by illegal means. It is normally not possible to<lb/>
 get direct evidence to establish the offence of criminal conspiracy and,<lb/>
 in large number of cases, prosecution has established criminal<lb/>
 conspiracy on the basis of circumstantial evidence. Law in respect of<lb/>
 criminal conspiracy has been laid down in several judgments of the<lb/>
 Apex Court and this Court. In the recent judgment in the case of Ram<lb/>
 Narayan Popli Vs. CBI reported in (2003) 3 SCC 641, arising out of<lb/>
 Special Courts (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities)<lb/>
 Act, 1992 the Apex Court has made the following observations.<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;342. It would be appropriate to deal with the<lb/>
 question of conspiracy. Section 120-B IPC is the<lb/>
 provision which provides for punishment for<lb/>
 criminal conspiracy.<lb/>
 Definition of &quot;criminal.<lb/>
 conspiracy&quot; given in Section 120-A reads as<lb/>
 follows:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;120-A. When two or more persons agree to<lb/>
 do, or cause to be done,-<lb/>
(l)an illegal act, or<lb/>
 (2)an act which is not illegal by illegal means,<lb/>
 such an agreement is designated a criminal<lb/>
 conspiracy:<lb/>
 Provided that no agreement except an<lb/>
 agreement to commit an offence shall<lb/>
 amount to a criminal conspiracy unless<lb/>
 some act besides the agreement is done by<lb/>
 one or more parties to such agreement in<lb/>
 pursuance thereof.&quot;<lb/>
 The elements of a criminal conspiracy have<lb/>
 been stated to be : (a) an object to be<lb/>
 accomplished, (b)a plan or scheme embodying<lb/>
 means to accomplish that object, (c)an<lb/>
 agreement or understanding between two or<lb/>
 more of the accused persons whereby, they<lb/>
 become definitely committed to cooperate for<lb/>
 the accomplishment of the object by the means<lb/>
 embodied in the agreement, or by any effectual<lb/>
 means, and ( d)in the jurisdiction where the<lb/>
 statute required to overt act. The essence of a<lb/>
 criminal<lb/>
 conspiracy<lb/>
 is<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 unlawful<lb/>
 combination and ordinarily the offence is<lb/>
 complete when the combination is framed.<lb/>
 From this, it necessarily follows that unless the<lb/>
 statute so requires, no overt act need be done<lb/>
 in furtherance of the conspiracy, and that the<lb/>
 object of the combination need not be<lb/>
 accomplished, in order to constitute an<lb/>
 indictable offence. Law making conspiracy a<lb/>
 crime is designed to curb immoderate power to<lb/>
 do mischief which is gained by a combination<lb/>
 of the means. The encouragement and support<lb/>
 which co-conspirators give to one another<lb/>
 rendering enterprises possible which, if left to<lb/>
 individual effort, would have been impossible,<lb/>
 furnish the ground for visiting conspirators and<lb/>
 abettors with condign punishment.<lb/>
 The<lb/>
 Conspiracy is held to be continued and<lb/>
 renewed as to all its members wherever and<lb/>
 whenever any member of the conspiracy acts in<lb/>
 furtherance of the common design (See:<lb/>
 American Jurisprudence, Vol. II, Sec. 23, p.559)<lb/>
 For an offence punishable under section 120-B,<lb/>
 the prosecution need not necessarily prove that<lb/>
 the perpetrators expressly agree to do or cause<lb/>
 to be done illegal act; the agreement may be<lb/>
 proved by necessary implication. Offence of<lb/>
 criminal conspiracy has its foundation in an<lb/>
 agreement to commit an offence. A conspiracy<lb/>
 consists not merely in the intention of two mor<lb/>
 more, but in the agreement of two or more to<lb/>
 do an unlawful act by unlawful means. So long<lb/>
 as such a design rests in intention only, it is not<lb/>
 indictable. When two agree to carry it into<lb/>
 effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and an<lb/>
 act of •each of the parties, promise against<lb/>
 promise actus contra actum, capable of being<lb/>
 enforced, if lawful, punishable if for a criminal<lb/>
 object or for use of criminal menas.<lb/>
</item>

<item>343. No doubt, in the case of conspiracy there<lb/>
 cannot be any direct evidence. The ingredients of<lb/>
 offence are that there should be an agreement<lb/>
 between persons who are alleged to conspire and<lb/>
 the said agreement should be for doing an illegal<lb/>
 act or for doing by illegal means an act which<lb/>
 itself may not be illegal. Therefore, the essence of<lb/>
 criminal conspiracy is an agreement to do an<lb/>
 illegal act and such an agreement can be proved<lb/>
 either by direct evidence or by circumstantial<lb/>
 evidence or by both, and it is a matter of common<lb/>
 experience that<lb/>
 direct evidence to prove<lb/>
 conspiracy is rarely available.<lb/>
 Therefore, the<lb/>
 circumstances proved before, during and after the<lb/>
 occurrence have to be considered to decide about<lb/>
 the complicity of the accused.<lb/>
</item>

<item>344.<lb/>
 In Halsbury&apos;s Laws of England (vide<lb/>
 4th<lb/>
 Edn., Vol.II, p.44, para 58), the English law as to<lb/>
 conspiracy has been stated thus:-<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;</item>

<item>58. Conspiracy consists in the agreement of<lb/>
 two or more persons to do an unlawful act,<lb/>
 or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. It<lb/>
 is an indictable offence at common law, the<lb/>
 punishment for which is imprisonment or<lb/>
 fine or both in the discretion of the court.<lb/>
 The essence of the offence of conspiracy<lb/>
 is the fact of combination by agreement.<lb/>
 The agreement may be express or implied, or<lb/>
 in part express and in part implied. The<lb/>
 conspiracy<lb/>
 arises<lb/>
 and the<lb/>
 offence<lb/>
 is<lb/>
 committed as soon as the agreement<lb/>
 is<lb/>
 made; and the offence continues to be<lb/>
 committed so long as the combination<lb/>
 persists, that is until the conspiratorial<lb/>
 agreement is terminated by completion of its<lb/>
 performance<lb/>
 or<lb/>
 by<lb/>
 abandonment<lb/>
 or<lb/>
 frustration or however it may be. The actus<lb/>
reus in a conspiracy is the agreement to<lb/>
 execute the illegal conduct, J?,Ot the<lb/>
 execution of it. It is not enough that two or<lb/>
 more persons pursued the same unlawful<lb/>
 object at the same time or in the same place;<lb/>
 it is necessary to show a meeting of minds, a<lb/>
 consensus to effect an unlawful purpose. It<lb/>
 is not, however, necessary that each<lb/>
 conspirator<lb/>
 should<lb/>
 have<lb/>
 been<lb/>
 in<lb/>
 communication with every other.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>345. There is no difference between the mode<lb/>
 of proof of the offence of conspiracy and that of<lb/>
 any other offence. It can be established by direct<lb/>
 or circumstantial evidence. [See: Bhagwan<lb/>
 Swarup Lal Bishan Lal v. State of Maharashtra<lb/>
 [AIR 1965 SC 682] (AIR at p.686) .]<lb/>
</item>

<item>346.<lb/>
 It was held that the expression &quot;in<lb/>
 reference to their common intention&quot; in Section<lb/>
 10 is very comprehensive and it appears to have<lb/>
 been designedly used to give it a wider scope<lb/>
 than the words &quot;in furtherance of, in the English<lb/>
 law; with the result, anything said, done or<lb/>
 written by a co-conspirator, after the conspiracy<lb/>
 was formed, will be evidence against the other<lb/>
 before he entered the field of conspiracy or after<lb/>
 he left it. Anything said, done or written is a<lb/>
 relevant fact only.<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;<lb/>
 as against each of the persons<lb/>
 believed to be so conspiring as well for the<lb/>
 purpose of showing that any such person<lb/>
 was a party to it&apos;. . .. In short, the section<lb/>
 can be analysed as follows: (1) There shall<lb/>
 be a prima facie evidence eff ording a<lb/>
 reasonable ground for a court to believe<lb/>
 that two or more persons are members of<lb/>
 a conspiracy; (2) if the said condition is<lb/>
 fulfilled, anything said, done or written by<lb/>
 any one of them in reference to their<lb/>
 common intention will be evidence against<lb/>
 the other, (3) anything said, done or<lb/>
 written by him should have been said,<lb/>
 done or written by him after the intention<lb/>
 was formed by any one of them; (4) it<lb/>
 would also be relevant for the said<lb/>
 purpose against another who entered the<lb/>
 conspiracy whether it was said, done or<lb/>
 written before he entered the conspiracy<lb/>
 or after he left it; and (5) it can only be<lb/>
 used against a co-conspirator and not in<lb/>
 his favour.&quot; (AIR p.687, para 8)<lb/>
 We are aware of the fact that direct<lb/>
 independent evidence of criminal conspiracy<lb/>
 is generally not available and its existence is a<lb/>
 matter of inference.<lb/>
 The inferences are<lb/>
 normally deduced from acts of parties in<lb/>
 pursuance of a purpose in common between<lb/>
 the conspirators. This Court in V.C. Shukla v.<lb/>
 State (Delhi Admn.) [(1980) 2 SCC 665] held<lb/>
 that to prove criminal conspiracy, there must<lb/>
 be a meeting of minds resulting in ultimate<lb/>
 decision taken by the conspirators regarding<lb/>
 the commission of an offence and where the<lb/>
 factum of conspiracy is sought to be inferred<lb/>
 from circumstances, the prosecution has to<lb/>
 show that the circumstances give rise to a<lb/>
 conclusive or irresistable inference of an<lb/>
 agreement between two or more persons to<lb/>
 commit an offence. As in all other criminal<lb/>
 offences, the prosecution has to discharge its<lb/>
 onus of proving the case against the accused<lb/>
 beyond reasonable doubt. The circumstances<lb/>
 in a case, when taken together on their face<lb/>
 value1 should indicate the meeting of minds<lb/>
 between the conspirators for the intended<lb/>
 object of committing an illegal act or an act<lb/>
 which is not illegal1 by illegal means. A Jew<lb/>
 bits here here and a few bits there on which<lb/>
 the prosecution relies cannot be held to be<lb/>
 adequate for connecting the accused with the<lb/>
</item>

<item>comm1ss10n<lb/>
 of<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 crime<lb/>
 of<lb/>
 criminal<lb/>
 conspiracy. It has to be shown that all means<lb/>
 adopted and illegal acts done were in<lb/>
 furtherance of the object of conspiracy<lb/>
 hatched.<lb/>
 The circumstances relied for the<lb/>
 purposes of drawing an inference should be<lb/>
 prior in time than the actual commission of<lb/>
 the offence in furtherance of the alleged<lb/>
 conspiracy.<lb/>
</item>

<item>347.<lb/>
 Privacy and secrecy are more<lb/>
 characteristics of a conspiracy, than of a loud<lb/>
 discussion in an elevated place open to public<lb/>
 view.<lb/>
 Direct<lb/>
 evidence in proof of<lb/>
 a<lb/>
 conspiracy is seldom available; offence of<lb/>
 conspiracy can be proved by either direct or<lb/>
 circumstantial evidence.<lb/>
 It is not always<lb/>
 possible to give affirmative evidence about the<lb/>
 date of the formation of the criminal<lb/>
 conspiracy, about the persons who took part<lb/>
 in the formation of the conspiracy, about the<lb/>
 object<lb/>
 which<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 objectors<lb/>
 set before<lb/>
 themselves as the object of conspiracy, and<lb/>
 about the manner in which the object of<lb/>
 conspiracy is to be carried out, all this is<lb/>
 necessarily a matter of inference.<lb/>
</item>

<item>348. The provision of Sections 120-A and<lb/>
 120-B IPC have brought the law of conspiracy<lb/>
 in Jndia in line with the English law by<lb/>
 making the overt act unessential when the<lb/>
 conspiracy is to commit any punishable<lb/>
 offence. The English law on this matter is<lb/>
 well settled.<lb/>
 Russell on Crime (12t h Edn.<lb/>
 Vol.1.,p.202) may be usefully noted:<lb/>
 &quot;The gist of the offence of conspiracy then<lb/>
 lies, not in doing the act, or effecting the<lb/>
 purpose for which the conspiracy is formed,<lb/>
 nor in attempting to do them, nor in inciting<lb/>
 others to do them, but in the forming of the<lb/>
 scheme or agreement between the parties,<lb/>
 agreement is essential. Mere knowledge, or<lb/>
 even discussion, of the plan is not per se,<lb/>
 enough.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>349.<lb/>
 Glanville Williams in Criminal Law (2&quot;d<lb/>
 Edn., p. 382) states:<lb/>
 &quot;The question arose in Iowa case, but it<lb/>
 was discussed in terms of conspiracy<lb/>
 rather than of accessoryship. D , who had a<lb/>
 grievance against P, told E that if he would<lb/>
 whip P someone would pay his fine. E<lb/>
 replied that he did not want anyone to pay<lb/>
 his fine, that he had a grievance of his own<lb/>
 against P and that he would whip him at<lb/>
 the first opportunity. E whipped P. D was<lb/>
 acquitted of conspiracy because there was<lb/>
 no agreement for &apos;concert of action&apos;, no<lb/>
 agreement to &apos;cooperate&apos;.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>350. Coleridge, J. while summing up the<lb/>
 case to the jury in R. v. Murphy [(1837)<lb/>
 173 ER 502] (ER ar p.508) states:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;.... I am bound to tell you, that<lb/>
 although the common design is the root<lb/>
 of the charge, it is not necessary to<lb/>
 prove that these two parties came<lb/>
 together and actually agreed in terms to<lb/>
 have this common design, and to pursue<lb/>
 it by common means, and so to carry it<lb/>
 into execution. This is not necessary,<lb/>
 because in many cases of the most<lb/>
 clearly established conspiracies there are<lb/>
 no means of proving any such thing, and<lb/>
 neither law nor common sense requires<lb/>
 that it should be proved . Jf you find that<lb/>
 these two persons pursued by their acts<lb/>
 the same object, often by the same<lb/>
 means, one performing one part of an<lb/>
 act, and the other another part of the<lb/>
 same act, so as to complete it, with a<lb/>
 view to the attainment of the object<lb/>
 which they were pursuing , you will be<lb/>
 at liberty to draw the conclusion that<lb/>
 they have been engaged in a conspiracy<lb/>
 to effect that object. The question you<lb/>
 have to ask yourselves is, &apos; had they this<lb/>
 common design, and did they pursue it<lb/>
 by these common means -the design<lb/>
 being unlawful?&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>351.<lb/>
 As noted above, the essential<lb/>
 ingredient of the offence of criminal<lb/>
 conspiracy is the agreement to commit<lb/>
 an offence.<lb/>
 In a case where the<lb/>
 agreement is for accomplishment of an<lb/>
 act which they itself constitutes an<lb/>
 offence, then in that event no overt act<lb/>
 is necessazy to be proved by the<lb/>
 prosecution because in such a situation,<lb/>
 criminal conspiracy is established by<lb/>
 proving such an agreement. Where the<lb/>
 conspiracy alleged is with regard to<lb/>
 commission of a serious crime of the<lb/>
 nature as contemplated in Section 120-B<lb/>
 read with the proviso to sub-section (2)<lb/>
 of section 120-A, then in that event<lb/>
 mere proof of an agreement between<lb/>
 the accused for commission of such a<lb/>
 crime alone is enough to bring about a<lb/>
 conviction under Section 120-B and the<lb/>
 proof of any overt act by the accused or<lb/>
 by any one of them would not be<lb/>
necessary.<lb/>
 The provisions, in such a<lb/>
 situation, do not require that each and<lb/>
 every person who is a party to the<lb/>
 conspiracy must do some overt act<lb/>
 towards the fulfilment of the object of<lb/>
 conspiracy, the essential ingredient<lb/>
 being<lb/>
 an<lb/>
 agreement between<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 conspirators to commit the crime and if<lb/>
 these requirements and ingredients are<lb/>
 established, the act would fall within the<lb/>
 trappings of the provisions contained in<lb/>
 Section 120-B (See: Suresh Chandra<lb/>
 Bahri v. State of Bihar [1995 Supp (1)<lb/>
 sec soJ<lb/>
</item>

<item>352. The conspiracies are not hatched<lb/>
 in the open, by their nature, they are<lb/>
 secretly planned, they can be proved<lb/>
 even by circumstantial evidence, the<lb/>
 lack of direct evidence relating to<lb/>
 conspiracy has no consequence. (See :<lb/>
</item>

<item>E.K. Chandrasenan v. State of Kerala<lb/>
 [(1995) 2 sec 99])<lb/>
</item>

<item>353. In Kehar Singh v. State (Delhi<lb/>
 Admn.) [(1988) 3 sec 609] (AIR at p.<lb/>
</item>

<item>1954), this Court observed: (SCC pp.<lb/>
 732-33, para 275).<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;275.<lb/>
 Generally, a conspiracy is<lb/>
 hatched in secrecy and it may be<lb/>
 difficult to adduce direct evidence of<lb/>
 the same. The prosecution will often<lb/>
 rely on evidence of acts of various<lb/>
 parties to inf er that they were done in<lb/>
 reference to their common intention.<lb/>
 The prosecution will also more often<lb/>
 rely upon circumstantial evidence.<lb/>
 The conspiracy can be undoubtedly<lb/>
 proved by such evidence direct or<lb/>
 circumstantial.<lb/>
 But he court must<lb/>
 enquire whether the two persons are<lb/>
 independently pursing the same end<lb/>
 or they have come together to the<lb/>
 pursuit of unlawful object.<lb/>
 The<lb/>
 former<lb/>
 does<lb/>
 not<lb/>
 render<lb/>
 them<lb/>
 conspirators, but the latter does. It is,<lb/>
 however, essential that the offence of<lb/>
 conspiracy requires some<lb/>
 kind of<lb/>
 physical fanifestation of agreement.<lb/>
 The express agreement, however,<lb/>
 need not be proved.<lb/>
 Nor actual<lb/>
 meeting of two persons is necessary.<lb/>
 Nor it is necessary to prove the actual<lb/>
 words of communication.<lb/>
 The<lb/>
 evidence as to tansm1ss1on of<lb/>
 thoughts sharing the unlawful design<lb/>
 may be sufficient.&quot;<lb/>
 &quot;Conspiracy can be proved by<lb/>
 circumstances and other materials.&quot;<lb/>
 (See: State of Bihar v. Paramhans<lb/>
 Yadav [1986 Pat LJR 688 (HC) )<lb/>
 : [T]o establish a charge of<lb/>
 conspiracy<lb/>
 knowledge<lb/>
 about<lb/>
 indulgence in either an illegal act or a<lb/>
 legal act by illegal<lb/>
 means is<lb/>
 necessary. In some cases, intent of<lb/>
 unlawful use being made of the goods<lb/>
 or services in question<lb/>
 may be<lb/>
 inferred from the knowledge itself.<lb/>
 This apart, the prosecution has not<lb/>
 establish that a particular unlawful<lb/>
 use was intended, so long as the<lb/>
 goods or service in question could not<lb/>
 be put to any lawful use. Finally,<lb/>
 when the ultimate offence consists of<lb/>
 a chain of actions, it would not be<lb/>
 necessary for the prosecution to<lb/>
 establish, to bring home the charge of<lb/>
 conspiracy<lb/>
 that<lb/>
 each<lb/>
 of<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 conspirators had the knowledge of<lb/>
 what the collaborator would do, so<lb/>
 long as it is known that the<lb/>
 collaborator would put the goods or<lb/>
 service to an unlawful use.&quot; (See:<lb/>
 State of Maharashtra v. Som Nath<lb/>
 Thapa [(1996) 4 sec 659]), sec p.<lb/>

</item>

<item>354.<lb/>
 It<lb/>
 was noticed that Section<lb/>
 120-A and 120-B IPC have brought<lb/>
 the law of conspiracy in India in line<lb/>
 with the English law by making an<lb/>
 overt<lb/>
 act<lb/>
 inessential<lb/>
 when<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 conspiracy<lb/>
 is<lb/>
 to<lb/>
 commit<lb/>
 any<lb/>
 punishable<lb/>
 offence.<lb/>
 The<lb/>
 most<lb/>
 important ingredient of the offence<lb/>
 being the agreement between two or<lb/>
 more persons to do an illegal act. In<lb/>
 a case where criminal conspiracy is<lb/>
 alleged, the court must inquire<lb/>
 whether<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 two<lb/>
 persons<lb/>
 are<lb/>
 independently pursuing the same end<lb/>
 or they have come together to pursue<lb/>
 the unlawful object. The former does<lb/>
 not render them conspirators but the<lb/>
 latter does.<lb/>
 For the offence of<lb/>
 conspiracy, some kind of physical<lb/>
 manifestation<lb/>
 of<lb/>
 agreement<lb/>
 1s<lb/>
 required to be established.<lb/>
 The<lb/>
 express agreement need not be<lb/>
 proved.<lb/>
 The<lb/>
 evidence<lb/>
 as<lb/>
 to<lb/>
 transmission of thoughts sharing the<lb/>
 unlawful act is not sufficient.<lb/>
</item>

<item>A<lb/>
 conspiracy is a continuing offence<lb/>
 which continues to subsist till it is<lb/>
 executed or rescinded or frustrated by &apos;<lb/>
 choice of necessity.<lb/>
 During its<lb/>
 subsistence, whenever any one of the<lb/>
 conspirators does an act or series of<lb/>
 acts, he would be held guilty under<lb/>
 Section 120-B of the Indian Penal<lb/>
 Code.<lb/>
</item>

<item>355.<lb/>
 I may usefully refer to Ajay<lb/>
 Aggarwal v. Union of India, [(1993) 3<lb/>
 SCC 609]. It was held : (SCC p.617,<lb/>
 para 8-9)<lb/>
 •<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;8. . .... It is not necessary that each<lb/>
 conspirator must lmow all the details<lb/>
 of the scheme nor be a participant at<lb/>
 every stage. It is necessary that they<lb/>
 should agree for design or object of<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 conspiracy.<lb/>
 Conspiracy<lb/>
 is<lb/>
 conceived as having three elements:<lb/>
</item>

<item>(1) agreement; (2) between two or<lb/>
 more<lb/>
 persons<lb/>
 by<lb/>
 whom<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 agreement is effected; and (3) a<lb/>
 criminal object, which may be either<lb/>
 the ultimate aim of the agreement, or<lb/>
 may constitute means, or one of the<lb/>
 means by which that aim is to be<lb/>
 accomplished.<lb/>
 It is immaterial<lb/>
 whether this is found in the ultimate<lb/>
 objects. The common law definition<lb/>
 of &apos; criminal conspiracy&apos; was stated<lb/>
 first by Lord Denman in Jones case<lb/>
 [ R. v. Jones, 1832 B &amp; Ad 345] that<lb/>
 an indictment for conspiracy must<lb/>
 &apos; charge a conspiracy to do an<lb/>
 unlawful act by unlawful means&apos; and<lb/>
 was elaborated by Willies, J. on<lb/>
 behalf of the Judges while referring<lb/>
 the question to the House of Lords in<lb/>
 Mulcahy v. R [(1868) 3 HL 306] and<lb/>
 the House of Lords in unanimous<lb/>
 decision reiterated in<lb/>
 Quinn v.<lb/>
 Leathern (1901 AC 495]:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&apos;A conspiracy consists not merely<lb/>
 in the intention of two or more, but<lb/>
 in the agreement of two or more, to<lb/>
 do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful<lb/>
 act by unlawful means. So long as<lb/>
 such a design rests in intention only,<lb/>
 it is not indictable. When two agree<lb/>
 to carry it into effect, the very plot is<lb/>
 an act in itself, and the act of each of<lb/>
 the parties, promise against promise,<lb/>
 actus contra actum, capable of being<lb/>
 enforced, if lawful: and punishable if<lb/>
 for a criminal object, or for the use of<lb/>
 criminal means.&apos;<lb/>
</item>

<item>9. This Court in E.G. Barsay v. State<lb/>
 of Bombay [AIR 1961 SC 1762] held:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&apos;The gist of the offence is an<lb/>
 agreement to break the law. The<lb/>
 parties to such an agreement will be<lb/>
 guilty of criminal conspiracy, though<lb/>
 the illegal act agreed to be done has<lb/>
 not been done.<lb/>
 So too, it is an<lb/>
 ingredient of the offence that all the<lb/>
 parties should agree to do a single<lb/>
 illegal act. • It may comprise the<lb/>
 commission of a number of acts.<lb/>
 Under Section 43 of the Indian Penal<lb/>
 Code, an act would be illegal if it is<lb/>
 an offence or if it is prohibited by<lb/>
 law.&apos;<lb/>
 In Yash Pal Mittal v. State of Punjab<lb/>
 [(1977) 4 sec 540] the rule was laid as<lb/>
 follows : (SCC p. 543, para 9)<lb/>
 &apos; ... The very agreement, concert or<lb/>
 league is the ingredient of the<lb/>
 offence. It is not necessary that all the<lb/>
 conspirators must know each and<lb/>
 every detail of the conspiracy as long<lb/>
 as they are co-participators in he<lb/>
 main object of the conspiracy. There<lb/>
 may be so many devices and<lb/>
 techniques adopted to achieve the<lb/>
 common goal of the conspiracy and<lb/>
 there<lb/>
 may<lb/>
 be<lb/>
 division<lb/>
 of<lb/>
 performances in the chain of actions<lb/>
 with one object to achieve the real<lb/>
 end of which every collaborator must<lb/>
 be aware and in which each one of<lb/>
 them must be interested. There must<lb/>
 be unity of object or purpose but<lb/>
 there may be plurality of means<lb/>
 sometimes even unknown to one<lb/>
 another, amongst the conspirators.<lb/>
</item>

<item>In achieving the goal several offences<lb/>
 may be committed by some of the<lb/>
 conspirators even unknown to the<lb/>
 others. The only relevant factor is<lb/>
 that all means adopted and illegal<lb/>
 acts done must be and purported to<lb/>
 be in furtherance of the object of the<lb/>
 conspiracy even though there may be<lb/>
 sometimes misfire or overshooting<lb/>
 by some of the conspirators.&apos;<lb/>
</item>

<item>10. In Mohd. Usman Mohd. Hussain<lb/>
 Maiyar v. State of Maharashtra<lb/>
 ((1981) 2 sec 443] it was held that<lb/>
 for an offence under Section 120-B<lb/>
 IPC,<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 prosecution<lb/>
 need<lb/>
 not<lb/>
 necessarily<lb/>
 prove<lb/>
 that<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 conspirators expressly agreed to do or<lb/>
 cause to be done the illegal act, the<lb/>
 agreement<lb/>
 may<lb/>
 be<lb/>
 proved<lb/>
 by<lb/>
 necessary implication.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>356.<lb/>
 After referring to some<lb/>
 judgments of the United States<lb/>
 Supreme Court and of this Court in<lb/>
 Yash Pal Mittal v. State of Punjab<lb/>
 [(1977) 4 sec 540] and Ajay<lb/>
 Aggarwal v. Union of India [ [1993) 3<lb/>
 SCC 609] the Court in State of<lb/>
 Maharashtra v. Som Nath Thapa<lb/>
 [(1996) 4 sec 659] summarized the<lb/>
 position of law and the requirements<lb/>
 to establish the charge of conspiracy,<lb/>
 as under: (SCC p. 668, para 24)<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;24. The aforesaid decisions,<lb/>
 weighty as they are, lead us to<lb/>
 conclude that to establish a charge of<lb/>
 conspiracy<lb/>
</item>

<item>. knowledge<lb/>
 about<lb/>
 indulgence in either an illegal act or a<lb/>
 legal<lb/>
 act<lb/>
 by<lb/>
 illegal<lb/>
 means<lb/>
 1s<lb/>
</item>

<item>necessary. In some cases, intent of<lb/>
 unlawful use being made of the<lb/>
 goods or services in question may be<lb/>
 inferred from the knowledge itself.<lb/>
 This apart, the prosecution has not to<lb/>
 establish that a particular unlawful<lb/>
 use was intended, so long as the<lb/>
 goods or service in question could not<lb/>
 be put to any lawful use. Finally,<lb/>
 when the ultimate offence consists of<lb/>

 State of Kerala v. P. Sugathan [(2000)<lb/>
 8 SCC 203] (SCC p. 212, para 14)]&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>18. Keeping in view the aforesaid principle laid down by the Apex<lb/>
 Court, it has to be seen whether the prosecution has established the<lb/>
 case of criminal conspiracy against accused Nos. 1 and 2. It has to be<lb/>
 noted here that, initially, the complaint was lodged by<lb/>
 Shri V.<lb/>
 Sethumadhavan against Shri R. Sundaresan. In the said complaint, it<lb/>
 is specifically alleged that Shri R. Sundaresan who was the then<lb/>
 Divisional Manager of FIM Branch of Syndicate Bank at Bombay was<lb/>
 responsible for misappropriation and for diverting the funds which<lb/>
 were remitted from the Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank to FIM<lb/>
 Branch of Syndicate Bank at Bombay. However, surprisingly, charges<lb/>
 against the said Shri R. Sundaresan were dropped when the charge<lb/>
 sheet was filed and this person who was named as accused was, later<lb/>
 on, examined as a witness by the prosecution.<lb/>
 No explanation has<lb/>
 been given by the prosecution as to why and for what reason the<lb/>
 Investigating Officer felt that it was not necessary to make the said R.<lb/>
 Sundaresan as an accused and in his place accused No.1 -R.S. Pai who<lb/>
 was stationed at Manipal, Kamataka State, was made an accused in<lb/>
 this case. When a query was made by this Court whether there was<lb/>
 any direct or indirect evidence against accused No.1 for the purpose of<lb/>
 proving that accused Nos. 1 and 2 conspired together, Mr. V.G.<lb/>
 Pradhan, the learned Special Public Prosecutor, very candidly stated<lb/>
 that no such documentary or oral evidence is available which could<lb/>
 establish that accused No.1 -R.S. Pai had entered into conspiracy with<lb/>
 accused No.2 -K. R. N. Shenoy. Prosecution has examined in all 16<lb/>
 witnesses.<lb/>
</p>

<p>19.<lb/>
 P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh, at the relevant time, was working as an<lb/>
 accountant in OIDB. It is pertinent to note that questions were asked<lb/>
 by Mr. Pradhan, the learned Special Public Prosecutor, to this witness<lb/>
 without declaring the said witness as hostile. Thereafter, after the<lb/>
 witness was cross-examined by the Counsel appearing for accused Nos.<lb/>
</p>

<p>1 and 2, permission was sought by Mr. V.G. Pradhan, the learned<lb/>
 Special Public Prosecutor appearing for CBI to re-examine this witness.<lb/>
 Though the objection was raised by the Counsel appearing on behalf of<lb/>
 the accused, this objection was overruled for the reasons stated in the<lb/>
 order and Mr. Pradhan was permitted to re-examine this witness.<lb/>
 Liberty, however, was given for the accused to cross-examine him since<lb/>
 certain new documents were sought to be brought on record. This<lb/>
 witness, however, did not make himself available for further cross<lb/>
 examination and though several dates were taken by the prosecution<lb/>
 to produce the said witness for further cross-examination, he did not<lb/>
 remain present and, therefore, ultimately, order had to be passed by<lb/>
 this Court after a lapse of almost 8 months to delete the re<lb/>
 examination which was taken by Mr. V.G. Pradhan, Special Public<lb/>
 Prosecutor for CBI.<lb/>
 P.W. 2 -Arvind Kaushal was working as Financial Adviser and<lb/>
 Chief Accounts Officer for a period from October, 1991 to May, 1992.<lb/>
</p>

<p>P. W. 1 was also working in the same Department and he was<lb/>
 subordinate to P. W. 2.<lb/>
</p>

<p>P.W 3 -R. Sundaresan was working as Divisional Manager of<lb/>
 FIM Division Branch of Syndicate Bank at Bombay. A complaint was<lb/>
 lodged against him by Shri V. Sethumadhavan of the Vigilance Branch<lb/>
 of the Syndicate Bank. However, his name was dropped and in his<lb/>
 place the name of R.S. Pai was included and R. Sundaresan was<lb/>
 examined as the witness on behalf of the prosecution.<lb/>
 P.W. 4 -E.R. Seshadri was working as Deputy General Manager<lb/>
 of Syndicate Bank at Delhi Zonal Office.<lb/>
 P. W 5 -R. Kalyanasundaram was working in the Syndicate Bank<lb/>
 in its Funds and Investment Management Department (FIM) during<lb/>
 the relevant period.<lb/>
 P.W 6 -Shreyas Morakhia and P.W. 7 -Sharad Jamnadas Shah<lb/>
 were carrying on business in the Stock Exchange at the relevant time.<lb/>
 However, they did not support the prosecution case.<lb/>
 P.W. 8 -Ameet Dalal was a stock broker at Bombay Stock<lb/>
 Exchange at the relevant time. He has brought on record the contract<lb/>
 note signed by him at Exhibit-119.<lb/>
 P.W. 9 -M. Damodaran was a Joint Secretary, Ministry of<lb/>
 Finance at the relevant time and he had given sanction to prosecute<lb/>
 accused No.I.<lb/>
 P.W. 10 -K. P. Suresh Prabhu was posted at Syndicate Bank,<lb/>
 PIM Branch, Fort, Bombay during the relevant period.<lb/>
 P.W. 11 -Jayant Rege was holding the post of Assistant General<lb/>
 Manager in the Syndicate Bank and he has brought on record<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank Officer Employees&apos; (Conduct) Regulations, 1976 and<lb/>
 also companion regulation i.e. Syndicate Bank Officer Employees&apos;<lb/>
 (Discipline &amp; Appeal) Regulations, 1976 at Exhibit 125 collectively.<lb/>
 P.W. 12 -Prasanna Shenoy was, at the relevant time, posted as<lb/>
 Assistant Vice President, Fairgrowth Investments Ltd at Bombay.<lb/>
 P.W. 13 -Dattapal Neroy was working as a Manager of<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank from 1972 to January 1992 and, thereafter, he was<lb/>
 working in Fairgrowth Investments Pvt. Ltd.<lb/>
 P.W. 14 -V. Sethumadhavan was working with Reserve Bank of<lb/>
 India and he was sent on deputation to Syndicate Bank from 1991 to<lb/>
 1994 as Chief Vigilance Officer.<lb/>
 P.W. 15 -Sushil Prasad Singh was working as Inspector of Police<lb/>
 in the CBI Bank Securities Cell, Bombay in June, 1992 and a written<lb/>
 complaint was received by him from V. Sethumadhavan, Chief<lb/>
 Vigilance Officer, Syndicate Bank in the last week of May, 1993 and it<lb/>
 was registered by him on 02/06/1993. He has stated that, initially,<lb/>
 the case was investigated by Mr. Pradeep Kumar, Inspector of Police<lb/>
 and that the said Pradeep Kumar was repatriated to his Parent Branch<lb/>
 in Kerala on 13/04/1996 and, thereafter, the case was transferred to<lb/>
 him.<lb/>
 P.W. 16 -Pradip Kumar was the Investigating Officer who<lb/>
 carried out the investigation after the complaint was lodged on<lb/>
 02/06/1993 till 1996 when he handed over the investigation to P.W<lb/>
</p>

<p>15 -Sushil Prasad Singh.<lb/>
</p>

<p>20. The accused have not examined any witness. Prosecution has<lb/>
 brought on record number of documents. Since the charge levelled<lb/>
 against accused Nos. 1 and 2 is of conspiracy to commit offence<lb/>
 punishable under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code, substantive<lb/>
 charge under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code is also framed<lb/>
 against accused No. I and charge of abetment to commit offence under<lb/>
 section 409 is leve lled against accused No.2. It would be appropriate if<lb/>
 the entire evidence on record is examined to see whether the aforesaid<lb/>
 charges have been proved against accused Nos. 1 and 2. In this<lb/>
 context, it will be necessary first to see what is the evidence against<lb/>
 accused No.1.<lb/>
</p>

<p>21. In a nutshell, the evidence which is brought on record is to the<lb/>
 effect that OIDB had surplus funds at its disposal. Inquiries were made<lb/>
 by OIDB with the Nationalized Bank, informing them about its<lb/>
 intention of investing these surplus funds. Counter offers were made<lb/>
 by the Nationalized Banks to OJDB. Syndicate Bank had made an offer<lb/>
 to OIDB, asking them to invest their surplus funds in PMS services for a<lb/>
 period of one year and had assured the OIDB of expected return of<lb/>
 18.25°/o interest per annum. The offer document sent to OIDB clearly<lb/>
 disclosed that the moneys parked with the Syndicate Bank under PMS<lb/>
 activities would be invested in the capital market instruments and<lb/>
 would be at the risk of constituents and that the expected returns<lb/>
 would be about 18.25°/o per annum.<lb/>
 Though these letters were<lb/>
 received by OIDB, an initial amount of Rs 20 crores (approx.) was sent<lb/>
 by OIDB to the Syndicate Bank Delhi Branch as first remittance on<lb/>
 03/04/1992 and at that time there was no contract or agreement<lb/>
 between the OIDB and Syndicate bank. Subsequently, five more<lb/>
 remittances of various amounts were sent during 02/04/1992 and<lb/>
 30/05/ 1992 aggregating to Rs 132.22 crores.<lb/>
 Though OIDB has<lb/>
 asserted that it had informed the Syndicate Bank about the guidelines<lb/>
 and directions for the investments of the said amounts in its six letters<lb/>
 dated<lb/>
 21/04/1992,<lb/>
 29/04/1992,<lb/>
 01/05/1992,<lb/>
 04/05/1992,<lb/>
 12/05/1992 and 14/05/1992, the admitted position is that when the<lb/>
 first remittance was sent on 03/04/1992 for an amount of Rs 20 crores<lb/>
 (approx.), no such directions were issued. After the scam broke out in<lb/>
 April 1992, the OIDB appears to have written letters to Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank, asking them to invest the amounts remitted by them only in<lb/>
 Government Securities. However, when the Syndicate Bank informed<lb/>
 the OIDB Officers that the expected returns of 18.25°/o interest per<lb/>
 annum would be achieved only because of investments made in PMS<lb/>
 which, in tum, meant that the amounts would be invested by<lb/>
 purchasing shares in the capital market of Blue-chip<lb/>
 Companies.<lb/>
 Thereafter, OIDB issued a clarification to its earlier letters by adding<lb/>
 the word &quot;etc.&quot; to directions contained in six letters. Prosecution has<lb/>
 proved remittances which have been made by OIDB between<lb/>
 02/04/ 1992 and 30/05/ 1992 in favour of Syndicate Bank, Kasturba<lb/>
 Gandhi Marg Branch, New Delhi.<lb/>
 Prosecution has also proved<lb/>
 remittances of. the amount from Syndicate Bank, Kasturba Gandhi<lb/>
 Marg Branch, New Delhi to the FIM Branch of Syndicate Bank, Fort,<lb/>
 Bombay through interbank advice notes. Prosecution also has proved<lb/>
 that this amount was used for the purpose of purchasing shares in the<lb/>
 open market and these shares were purchased in the name of OIDB.<lb/>
 The brokers in the Stock Exchange who have been examined have<lb/>
 identified the contract notes for the purchase of shares out of the said<lb/>
 amount remitted to FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay.<lb/>
 The evidence on record and particularly the evidence of P.W. 1 -V.P.<lb/>
 Chugh and P.W 2 -Arvind Kaushal, on close scrutiny, clearly indicates<lb/>
 that the officials of OIDB had tried to salvage the position of their<lb/>
 investment in PMS activity by writing various letters to Delhi Branch of<lb/>
 the Syndicate Bank, seeking their explanation about investments made<lb/>
 by Syndicate Bank, after the amount was remitted by OIDB to<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank, Delhi Branch. Though the prosecution has brought on<lb/>
 record documents to prove the remittances from OIDB to the Delhi<lb/>
 Branch of the Syndicate Bank and from Delhi Branch of the Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank to FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay, it has not<lb/>
 been in a position to establish the manner in which the accused No. l<lb/>
 who was the Executive Director of the Syndicate Bank and who was<lb/>
 stationed at Manipal, Kamataka State is involved in the entire episode<lb/>
 of investment of the funds sent by OIDB in various shares in the capital<lb/>
 market. Though an an attempt has been made by the prosecution by<lb/>
 examining P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan and other witnesses from the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank to suggest that it was under the oral instructions of<lb/>
 R.S. Pai -accused No. l that the said investments were made in the<lb/>
 capital market, there is no documentary evidence on record and except<lb/>
 the bare words of P.W. 3, there is no vital evidence to indicate<lb/>
 involvement of accused No.I in the entire episode. P.W 3 -R.<lb/>
 Sundaresan has stated in his evi dence that he had met R. S. Pai in<lb/>
 Hongkong and on the request made by him to R. S. Pai, he was<lb/>
 brought to FIM Branch of Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay. Prosecution<lb/>
 has further brought on record statements of witnesses working in the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank. In March, 1992 a meeting was conveyed by R.S. Pai -<lb/>
accused No. l in which he has stated that the profitability of the Bank<lb/>
 had to be increased and suggested that for that purpose PMS should be<lb/>
 increased and efforts should be made for the purpose of mobilization<lb/>
 of fu nds from various Companies so that these could be invested in<lb/>
 PMS services and, as a result, higher margin of profit could be earned<lb/>
 through PMS activities. P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan has stated that he had<lb/>
 orally directed him to engage accused No.2 for the purpose of<lb/>
 investment of moneys collected from his customers in the capital<lb/>
 market instruments. Though P.W. 3 has tried to suggest that it was at<lb/>
 the behest of accused No. l these investments were made, his testimony<lb/>
 has not been supported by the other witnesses who were examined<lb/>
 through the Syndicate Bank who have stated in their evidence that a<lb/>
 Committee was formed and FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort,<lb/>
 Bombay would decide the amounts which would be invested in the<lb/>
 capital market. The time and the scrips and other particulars would be<lb/>
 decided by the said Committee. Admittedly, accused No.1 -R.S. Pai<lb/>
 was not the member of this Committee. There is, therefore, a clear<lb/>
 contradiction in the evidence of P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan and other<lb/>
 witnesses from the Syndicate Bank. Though P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan<lb/>
 has stated that they had acted as per the oral instructions of accused<lb/>
 No.1 -R.S. Pai, the other witnesses have stated that decision to make<lb/>
 investments was made by the Committee consisting of four members of<lb/>
 which P.W. 3 was one of the members. Further, the evidence which is<lb/>
 brought on record also clearly indicates that the funds of the OIDB<lb/>
 were entrusted to the Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch of the Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank at New Delhi, which, in tum, had entrusted these amounts to the<lb/>
 FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay. There is thus no<lb/>
 evidence on record to show that the funds of OIDB were entrusted to<lb/>
 R.S. Pai who was stationed at Manipal, Kamataka State or that the<lb/>
 funds were routed through the Head Office to the Bombay Office. On<lb/>
 the contrary, when the letter was written by FIM Branch of the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay to OIDB, a reply was sent by the off icials<lb/>
 of OIDB stating that they were not concerned with the FIM Division of<lb/>
 the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay as they had dealt only with the<lb/>
 Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch of the Syndicate Bank at New Delhi.<lb/>
 This clearly indicates that there was no entrustment of funds to<lb/>
 accused No.l and, therefore the principal ingredient for the offence<lb/>
 punishable under section 409 is clearly absent as the entrustment of<lb/>
 funds by the OIDB to accused No.1 has not been establish ed. Further,<lb/>
 though accused No.2 has been charged for the offence of conspiracy of<lb/>
 committing criminal breach of trust, the documentary evidence on<lb/>
 record indicates that the amounts which were remitted by the Kasturba<lb/>
 Gandhi Marg Branch of the Syndicate Bank at New Delhi to the FIM<lb/>
 Division of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay were not invested in the<lb/>
 Companies owned by accused No.2 and the amount of Rs 93 crores<lb/>
 was invested in shares in the capital market which were purchased in<lb/>
 the name of OIDB. This indicates that there was actual purchase of<lb/>
 shares in favour of OIDB and the transaction in question was not an<lb/>
 ostensible purchase or sale transaction of shares.<lb/>
</p>

<p>22.<lb/>
 Now it will be appropriate to examine the evidence which is<lb/>
 brought on record by the prosecution and to see whether the said<lb/>
 evidence is sufficient for the purpose of establishing the case against<lb/>
 accused Nos. 1 and 2.<lb/>
</p>

<p>23.<lb/>
 P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh has deposed that the Oil Industry<lb/>
 Development Board was constituted under the Oil Industry<lb/>
 Development Act, 1974. The Government levied cess under section 15<lb/>
 of the said Act. P.W. 2 -Arvind Kaushal has stated that OIDB was<lb/>
 constituted under the statute and, therefore, was an autonomous body<lb/>
 and the Government levied cess on oil and the proceeds were credited<lb/>
 to the consolidated funds of India and, therefore, from time to time,<lb/>
 the amounts were transferred to its statutory organizations. The funds<lb/>
 which were given to OIDB from the consolidated funds were spent on<lb/>
 research and development and the funds were also given to various oil<lb/>
 sector companies for the purpose of development. P.W. 1 has fu rther<lb/>
 OIDB still had surplus funds at its disposal and these funds were<lb/>
 deposited with the Nationalized Banks only and some amounts were<lb/>
 invested in Saving Bank Accounts kept in Fixed Deposits and for a<lb/>
 short time in Government Securities. He has stated that during the<lb/>
 period from October, 1991 to May, 1992, OIDB had accounts with the<lb/>
 Indian Overseas Bank, State Bank of India and number of other<lb/>
 Nationalized Banks. P.W. 2 -Arvind Kaushal has further stated in his<lb/>
 evidence that the guidelines were laid down regarding the manner in<lb/>
 which these surplus funds were to be utilized or invested by the OIDB.<lb/>
 He has further stated that the Syndicate Bank was one such Bank with<lb/>
 whom the OIDB had transaction between the period from October,<lb/>
 1991 to May, 1992. P.W. 1 has stated that investment decisions were<lb/>
 taken by making endorsement on the file. He has stated that the offers<lb/>
 which came from the Bank were in writing and the accountant was to<lb/>
 ascertain the number of investments which were made at the time of<lb/>
 maturity of the fixed deposits and other instruments and to find out<lb/>
 about the over all situation in respect of such investments. P.W. 2<lb/>
 fu rther has deposed that the proposal would be tabulated by the<lb/>
 accountant and P.W. 1 would examine the offers which were received<lb/>
 and make specific recommendations to the Financial Adviser. He has<lb/>
 stated that the Chairman of the Board used to be the Minister in charge<lb/>
 of Petroleum and Natural Gas who had directed that all the<lb/>
 investments would require his approval. He has stated that, initially,<lb/>
 Shri Malviya was the Minister of the Portfolio and, thereafter, he was<lb/>
 replaced by Shri B. Shankaranand and that during this period the<lb/>
 express approva l of the Hon&apos;ble Minister was taken and, after the<lb/>
 approval was obtained from the competent authority, the concerned<lb/>
 Bank would be informed about the amount which was to be invested<lb/>
 and the manner in which it was to be invested. He has specifically<lb/>
 stated that the approval was obtained from the Minister to invest the<lb/>
 surplus fund s in other securities since the higher ra te of interest was<lb/>
 given if investment was made in Portfolio Management Servi ces and<lb/>
 investment advisory services. P.W. 2 has stated that the Officers of the<lb/>
 OIDB had informed the Secretary that there •was no possibility of<lb/>
 getting a firm commi tment regard ing fixed returns in terms of interest.<lb/>
 He has stated that, however, the Bank informed to the Secretary of the<lb/>
 Board that they would ensu re that there would be fixed higher rate of<lb/>
 interest. It is relevant to note the statements made by P.W. 1 in his<lb/>
 deposition on page Nos.4 and 5 of the notes of evidence in respect of<lb/>
 the funds entrusted with OIDB which read as und er:-<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;During the relevant period, the Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank was entrusted with the funds of OIDB<lb/>
 under the PMS. The Syndicate Bank also had<lb/>
 given offer to us for investment in PMS. During<lb/>
 the relevant period, we were dealing with<lb/>
 offices of Syndicate Bank and letters were<lb/>
 received from Bombay, Delhi, and DGM of<lb/>
 their bank also had correspondence with us.<lb/>
 Some letters were addressed to Chairman,<lb/>
 OIDB while some letters were addressed to me .<lb/>
 as DCFAO and some were addressed to the<lb/>
 accountant. If the offer was accepted, these<lb/>
 banks would be informed the period for which<lb/>
 their offer<lb/>
 was accepted and the amount<lb/>
 which was to be invested and the rate of<lb/>
 interest which was accepted by the OIDB and<lb/>
 also the period for which the amount was<lb/>
 invested. As soon as we accepted their offer,<lb/>
 we would inform them that the amount had to<lb/>
 be invested in securities, bonds, and units of<lb/>
 UTI and also the lock in period and the rate of<lb/>
 interest. These conditions were intimated to<lb/>
 them in writing and also these conditions were<lb/>
 personally discussed with the officer of bank<lb/>
 that these amounts would be invested as stated<lb/>
 hereinabove. It was also clarified to them that<lb/>
 this amount would not be invested in Private<lb/>
 Sector Bonds.<lb/>
 These conditions were<lb/>
 intimated to them in order to ensure that our<lb/>
 fu nds are not lost since PMS depends on<lb/>
 market fluctuations at the time of investment<lb/>
 and at the time of disinvestment also. No<lb/>
 person from the Syndicate Bank came to me<lb/>
 for the purpose of discussing the matter of<lb/>
 investment. The letters which were sent by<lb/>
 these banks were kept in a file.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>At the same time P.W. 2 in his evidence has stated about the funds<lb/>
 which were deployed in Syndicate Bank.<lb/>
 He has stated in his<lb/>
 deposition on pages Nos. 29 and 30 of the notes of ev idence as under:-<lb/>
&quot;During the rele vant pe riod, surplus funds<lb/>
 were deployed in the Syndicate Bank. Dur ing<lb/>
 this period, the investment were not made in<lb/>
 one bul k amount but were made in different<lb/>
 installments. Roughly, I could say that in four<lb/>
 to five installment investment was made. It is<lb/>
 possible that it could be more or less<lb/>
 installments. The OIDB dealt with the ban ks<lb/>
 only through their offices and branches in New<lb/>
 Delhi.<lb/>
 The mode of investment in these<lb/>
 branches in New Delhi was that either the<lb/>
 represe ntative of the bank would come to the<lb/>
 board and collect the cheque or the officer of<lb/>
 the board would come to the board and collect<lb/>
 the cheque or the officer of the board would<lb/>
 go to the bank and deliver the cheque and<lb/>
 letter.<lb/>
 The covering letter which was sent<lb/>
 alongwith the cheque gave specific directions<lb/>
 to the bank regarding amount to be invested,<lb/>
 securities, the peri od of investment and lastly<lb/>
 the manner of deployment of those funds.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>24.<lb/>
 In this context, in entire evidence of P.W. 1 and P .W. 2, no<lb/>
 reference at all has bee n made to accused No.1 -R.S. Pai. It has never<lb/>
 been stated by both the witnesses that the funds were entrusted to R.S.<lb/>
 Pai or that he had, on telephone or orally made any commit me nt for<lb/>
 fixed return of the investments made by OIDB with the Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank. On the contrary, the letter which is written by the Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank clearl y indicates that they had offered tentative interest rates and<lb/>
 no firm commitment was made by them. The only evidence which is<lb/>
 sought to be brought on record against accused No.I -R.S. Pai is the<lb/>
 statement of P.W. 5 -R. Kalyanasundaram who has stated that R. S.<lb/>
 Pai -accused No.l and K. R. N. Shenoy -accused No.2 were known to<lb/>
 each othe r and both had worked together in Syndicate Bank and that<lb/>
 K. R. N. Shenoy -accused No.2 has re signed as Assistant General<lb/>
 Manager in Syndicate Bank and, thereafter, joine d the FGIL. The<lb/>
 accused Nos. 1 and 2 have not disbursed the remittance s which were<lb/>
 made by OIDB to the Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank or further<lb/>
 remittances made by Delhi Branch of Syndicate Bank to the FIM<lb/>
 Division of Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay. Only other evidence which<lb/>
 is brought on record against accused No. I is through. the evidence of<lb/>
 P.W. 4 -E.R. Seshadri, P.W. S -R. Kalyansundaram, P.W. 3 -R.<lb/>
 Sundaresan, Divisional Manager of Sy ndicate Bank at Bombay. P.W. 3<lb/>
 -R. Sundaresan has stated in his deposition on page 55 of the notes of<lb/>
 evidence as under: -<lb/>
&quot;I say that the head office of the Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank is at Manipal, Kamataka. I say that<lb/>
 Shri R.S. Pai was operating from the he ad<lb/>
 office at Mani pal. I say that Mr. Shenoy<lb/>
 was working at Bombay.&quot;<lb/>
 Similarly P.W. 4 -E.R. Sheshadri has stated in his deposition on page<lb/>
 94 of the notes of evidence as under: -<lb/>
&quot;I say that I know Shri R.S. Pai. He was<lb/>
 Executive Director in the Syndicate Bank<lb/>
 and was posted at Mani pal.,<lb/>
 ,<lb/>
 And P.W. 5 -R. Kalyanasundaram has stated in his deposition on page<lb/>
 No.109 of the notes of evidence as under:-<lb/>
&quot;I say that at that time Shri R.S. Pai was an<lb/>
 Executive Director of the Syndicate Bank. I<lb/>
 say that Shri R.S. Pai&apos;s office was situated<lb/>
 at Manipal, South Kamataka.&quot;<lb/>
 Further, P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan in his evidence has stated that he had<lb/>
 met accused No.1 -R.S. Pai when he visited Hongkong and he had<lb/>
 stated that R.S. Pai expressed his concern about the deteriorating<lb/>
 condition of the Bank. P. W. 3 in his deposition on page Nos. 51 and<lb/>
 52 of the notes of evidence has stated as under: -<lb/>
&quot;I say that I have met R.S. Pai in Hongkong<lb/>
 when he had come there in a capacity as<lb/>
 Chairman of the Board of Directors in the<lb/>
 year 1991. In Syndicate Bank, he was a<lb/>
 Executive Director.<lb/>
 During this period<lb/>
 when Mr. Pai visited Hongkong, we did<lb/>
 discuss about the financial health of<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank.<lb/>
 At that time, he<lb/>
 expressed<lb/>
 his<lb/>
 concern<lb/>
 about<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 deteriorating condition of the bank and<lb/>
 that something had to be done to improve<lb/>
 the said condition. I say that at that time, I<lb/>
 had discussed with him that I was due to<lb/>
 return to India and he suggested that he<lb/>
 would try to get the posting in Bombay in<lb/>
 the Merchant Banking Division.&quot;<lb/>
 The other evidence against accused No.I has come through P.W. 3 -R.<lb/>
 Sundaresan. He has stated that a meeting was held in March, 1992<lb/>
 and R.S. Pai had made an appeal to all the Executives to mobilize<lb/>
 funds. P.W. 3 in his deposition on page Nos. 53 and 54 of the notes of<lb/>
 evidence has stated as under:-<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;In the first week of March 1992, the<lb/>
 meeting was held at Zonal Off ice and in<lb/>
 the said meeting, Mr. R.S. Pai discussed<lb/>
 many issues and more particularly issues<lb/>
 concerning the profitability in general and<lb/>
 he also announced that FIM would soon<lb/>
 start the Portfolio Management Services.<lb/>
 He also informed us this was in addition to<lb/>
 the Nariman Point Branch where this<lb/>
 activity had already started. He made an<lb/>
 appeal to all the executives who were<lb/>
 present there to keep this in mind and<lb/>
 accordingly, mobilise funds. I say that<lb/>
 most of the senior executives and zonal<lb/>
 heads from Delhi and other branches were<lb/>
 present. I say that Mr. Sheshadri who was<lb/>
 a DGM of Delhi zone was also present. He<lb/>
 welcomed his idea and he assured us that<lb/>
 with his contacts in Delhi, he would be in<lb/>
 a position to mobilise funds for that<lb/>
 purpose.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>P.W. 4 -E. R. Sheshadri has further stated in his deposition on page<lb/>
 Nos. 95 and 96 of the notes of evidence as under:-<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;Some time in March, 1992, the<lb/>
 Zonal Office had convened meeting of all<lb/>
 Zonal Managers in order to discuss<lb/>
 strategies of the Bank for the next<lb/>
 financial year. This meeting was held for<lb/>
 the purpose of discussing strategies of<lb/>
 growth development and management of<lb/>
 the Bank and its various branches. I was<lb/>
 present at the said meeting which was<lb/>
 held at Pune. Shri R.S. Pai was presiding<lb/>
 over the said meeting which was held at<lb/>
 Pune.<lb/>
 I remember that during this<lb/>
 relevant period I had a colleague by name<lb/>
 Shri Sundaresan Prabhu. He was, at the<lb/>
 relevant time, Funds Investment Manager<lb/>
 and was posted at Bombay. I say that<lb/>
 another colleague namely Shri P.S.<lb/>
 Prabhu was also posted at Bombay. I say<lb/>
 that he was Assistant General Manager at<lb/>
 that time. l do not remember whether<lb/>
 Shri Sundaresan Prabhu and Shri P.S.<lb/>
 Prabhu were present in the meeting which<lb/>
 was held at Pune.<lb/>
</item>

<item>I say that in this meeting Shri R.S.<lb/>
 Pai informed us that the Bank was earning<lb/>
 less profits and he, therefore, suggested<lb/>
 various ways and methods for overcoming<lb/>
 difficult situation which was faced by the<lb/>
</item>

<item>Bank. He, therefore, suggested that the<lb/>
 Bank had Investment Department which<lb/>
 had ability to invest surplus funds of their<lb/>
 bank. Similarly, Investment Department<lb/>
 was also in a position to invest surplus<lb/>
 funds of the Syndicate Bank. I say that<lb/>
 expectation of Shri R.S. Pai as Head of the<lb/>
 organization was that all the branches and<lb/>
 Zonal Offices should generate good profits<lb/>
 for the Bank.<lb/>
 I say that about 20<lb/>
 members were present at the said<lb/>
 meeting.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>25. From the aforesaid evidence, apart from bare words of P.W. 3 -<lb/>
R. Sundaresan that he was acting on the oral instructions of R.S. Pai,<lb/>
 there is no other evidence on record to suggest that R.S. Pai -accused<lb/>
 No. l was monitoring the entire transaction. The entire evidence of<lb/>
 these witnesses, as stated hereinabove, does not even remotely connect<lb/>
 the accused No.1 with the investments made by OIDB with the Delhi<lb/>
 Branch of the Syndicate Bank nor with the investments made by FIM<lb/>
 Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay. On the other hand, the<lb/>
 entire correspondence with the OIDB has been made either through<lb/>
 the Delhi Branch of Syndicate Bank or by Shri R. Sundaresan as<lb/>
 Divisional Manager of Syndicate Bank, FIM Branch, Fort, Bombay. It<lb/>
 has to be noted here, as observed hereinabove, that P.W. 1 -V.P.<lb/>
 Chugh was permitted to be re-examined and he was further cross-<lb/>
examined by the Counsel for the accused. P.W. 1, however, thereafter,<lb/>
 did not make himself available for further cross-examination after his<lb/>
 re-examination was taken by Mr. V.G. Pradhan, the learned Special<lb/>
 Public Prosecutor. As a result, an objection was taken by the learned<lb/>
 Counsel appearing on behalf of the accused that the entire re<lb/>
 examination of V.P. Ch ugh, therefore, be struck off from the record<lb/>
 and, accordingly, I had passed an order, directing that the said entire<lb/>
 re-examination be struck off from the record. The documents which<lb/>
 were exhibited by P.W. 1 in the re-examination, therefore, also were<lb/>
 not permitted to be read in evidence. No application was made by the<lb/>
 prosecution for recalling the said order. Thereafter, at no time, P.W. 1<lb/>
 -V.P. Chugh was made available for further cross-examination. Even<lb/>
 otherwise, therefore, an adverse inference will have to be drawn<lb/>
 against the prosecution for not making V.P. Chugh available for cross<lb/>
 examination. An adverse inference will have to be drawn that V.P.<lb/>
 Chugh was not permitted to be cross-examined because the<lb/>
 prosecution was afraid that he may not support the prosecution case.<lb/>
 In fact, on earlier occasion, Mr. V.G. Pradhan had sought leave of this<lb/>
 Court to cross-examine V.P. Chugh without declaring him hostile.<lb/>
 P.W. 1 fur ther has, in his evidence, stated that he was not aware of the<lb/>
 guidelines laid by the Reserve Bank of India and/or SEBI. The entire<lb/>
 evidence of P.W. 1, therefore, even otherwise, becomes completely<lb/>
 unreliable and atleast his evidence 1s of no assistance to the<lb/>
 prosecution for establishing the case against accused Nos. 1 and 2.<lb/>
 Same is the case of evidence given by P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan.<lb/>
 Initially, he was nruned as accused in a complaint which was filed by V.<lb/>
 Sethumadhavan, Vigilance Officer of the Syndicate Bank. For a period<lb/>
 of one month after the complaint was filed, P.W. 16 -Pradip Kumar<lb/>
 who was the Investigating Officer did not even care to record the<lb/>
 statement of P.W. 3. All the correspondence is made and directions<lb/>
 have been given by P.W. 3 under his signature. There is absolutely no<lb/>
 evidence to show that he was under direct control of ac• cused No.I -<lb/>
R.S. Pai, except his bare word that he was acting under his<lb/>
 instructions. His evidence has not been corroborated by any other<lb/>
 witness or by any qocumentary evidence on record. Prosecution also<lb/>
 •<lb/>
 has not been in a position to give any plausible explanation as to why<lb/>
 the prosecution chose to drop him as an accused and examined him as<lb/>
 a witness on behalf of the prosecution. Evidence of P.W. 2 -Arvind<lb/>
 Kaushal also indicates that all the correspondence was made by him<lb/>
 after the scam was broke out and the letters written by him appear to<lb/>
 be an afterthought to salvage the damage caused to OIDB. It has come<lb/>
 on record that the first remittance which was made by OIDB was<lb/>
 without entering into any formal document between the OlDB and the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank and it is only on the basis of offer letters which were<lb/>
 sent by either party, OIDB is trying to make out a case that it had<lb/>
 remitted the amount for investing it only in Government Securities,<lb/>
 though the first remittance of Rs 20 crores (approx) was made even<lb/>
 without giving any intimation to the Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch of<lb/>
 the Syndicate Bank at New Delhi. To that extent, therefore, evidence<lb/>
 of P.W. 2 -Arvind Kaushal also does not establish any nexus between<lb/>
 the accused Nos. 1 and 2 and the remittances which were made by the<lb/>
 Officials of the OIDB.<lb/>
</p>

<p>26. For the aforesaid reasons, I am of the view that the prosecution<lb/>
 has not established that there was a conspiracy between accused Nos.<lb/>
</p>

<p>1 and 2 for utilizing the funds of OIDB or that the accused No. l had<lb/>
 persuaded the Officials of the OIDB to park their fu nds with the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank with an assurance of fixed returns. Similarly, the<lb/>
 entrustment of money by OIDB to R.S. Pai alsso has not been<lb/>
 estabHshed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>27.<lb/>
 Having seen the oral evidence against accused Nos. 1 and 2, it<lb/>
 will have to be examined whether from the documentary evidence<lb/>
 which is brought on record, any case is made out against both the<lb/>
 accused. For that purpose, it is necessary to see the chronology of<lb/>
 events. I have already stated that from 02/04/1992 to 30/05/1992<lb/>
 various remittances were made by the OIDB in the Kasturba Gandhi<lb/>
 Marg Branch of the Syndicate Bank at New Delhi for an amount of<lb/>
 Rs 93,17,77,925/-and this amount, in tum, was invested by accused<lb/>
 No.I and the said amount was remitted to accused No.2 through five<lb/>
 remittances of various amounts during the period 07 /05/1992 to<lb/>
 29/06/1992. Now, it will have to be seen the manner in which the<lb/>
 amounts were paid and the correspondence between the parties before<lb/>
 and after the remittances were made in order to appreciate the rival<lb/>
 contentions.<lb/>
</p>

<p>28. According to the prosecution, a meeting was arranged by accused<lb/>
 No.1 in March, 1992 wherein he has urged all his Executives to<lb/>
 mobilize funds from individual clients, so that these funds could be<lb/>
 invested in the PMS services. At this stage, it would be relevant to take<lb/>
 into consideration the RBI guidelines which have been issued. The<lb/>
 Reserve Bank of India issued guidelines which have been brought on<lb/>
 record at Exhibit-14. The said circular was communicated to the<lb/>
 Chairman/Chief Executive of all Scheduled, Commercial Banks. All<lb/>
 this was in relation to Portfolio Management Scheme on behalf of<lb/>
 clients. In para 2 of the said guidelines, it has been stated as under:-<lb/>
</p>



<item>&quot;2.<lb/>
 Our scrutiny of &apos;portfolio management<lb/>
 services&apos; provided •by some banks, however,<lb/>
 has disclosed certain disquieting features as<lb/>
 under :<lb/>
</item>

<item>(i) Banks have been accepting short term<lb/>
 funds, i.e. for a period less than one year, for<lb/>
 portfolio management.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(ii)<lb/>
 Banks have been accepting funds for<lb/>
 portfolio<lb/>
 management<lb/>
 and<lb/>
 instead<lb/>
 of<lb/>
 managing such funds themselves, placed<lb/>
 such<lb/>
 funds<lb/>
 with<lb/>
 other<lb/>
 banks<lb/>
 for<lb/>
 management.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(iii)<lb/>
 Banks have been deploying portfolio<lb/>
 funds in call money market and bills market.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(iv)<lb/>
 Banks have not been maintaining<lb/>
 client-wise records of funds accepted for<lb/>
 portfolio management and investments made<lb/>
</item>

<p>thereagainst. They have been using portfolio<lb/>
 funds for their own purposes. They have also<lb/>
 been mixing their own investments with<lb/>
 those of their clients.&quot;<lb/>
 It was under these circumstances, the Reserve Bank of India issued<lb/>
 guidelines to Banks. Clause (iv) of para 3 of the said guidelines is as<lb/>
 follows :-<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;</item>

<item>3.<lb/>
 It has, therefore, been considered<lb/>
 necessary to issue further guidelines to<lb/>
 banks on this matter. Portfolio management<lb/>
 services (PMS) may be provided by<lb/>
 banks/their subsidiaries to their clients<lb/>
 henceforth, subject strictly to the following<lb/>
 revised guidelines :<lb/>
 (i) .................................................... .<lb/>
</item>

<item>(ii) ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••<lb/>
</item>

<item>(iii) ................................................... .<lb/>
</item>

<item>(iv)<lb/>
 The funds accepted for portfolio<lb/>
 management are essentially expected to be<lb/>
 deployed in capital market instruments such<lb/>
 as shares, debentures, bonds, securities etc.<lb/>
 In any case, portfolio funds should not be<lb/>
 deployed for lending in call money /bill<lb/>
 market and lending to/placement with<lb/>
 corporate bodies.<lb/>
</item>

<p>( v) ................................................... .<lb/>
</p>

<item>(vi) ............................ ......................... .<lb/>
</item>

<item>(vii).................................................... .<lb/>
</item>


<p><lb/>
 The Reserve Bank of India, therefore, had clearly indicated in its<lb/>
 guidelines that funds which were placed with the Nationalized Bank<lb/>
 under PMS are essentially expected to be invested in capital market<lb/>
 instruments such as shares, debentures, bonds, securities etc. The<lb/>
 restrictions, however, were placed in order to ensure that these<lb/>
 investments are not made for short term below one year and the<lb/>
 minimum period of investment should be one year. A restriction was<lb/>
 also imposed by the RBI that this money should not be deployed for<lb/>
 lending in call money/bills market and lending to/placement with<lb/>
 corporate bodies. The RBI guidelines, therefore, dearly stipulated that<lb/>
 when funds were deployed with the Nationalized Banks in the PMS,<lb/>
 these funds were essentially to be used for the purpose of investment<lb/>
 in capital market instruments. In this background, it has to be seen<lb/>
 from the documentary evidence i.e the contents of correspondence as<lb/>
 to what had transpired between the OIDB and the Syndicate Bank.<lb/>
 The Accountant of OIDB Shri B.S. Sharma had issued a letter dated<lb/>
 21/03/1992 to all the Banks, a list of which is attached to the said<lb/>
 letter which is brought on record at Exhibit-13.<lb/>
 It would be<lb/>
 worthwhile to see the relevant contents of the said letter at Exhibit-13,<lb/>
 which reads as under:-<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;Sub: Investment of funds in Portfolio<lb/>
 Management Scheme for a period<lb/>
 of one year.<lb/>
 We propose to invest a part of our surplus funds in<lb/>
 the Portfolio Management Scheme for a period of one<lb/>
 year. You are requested to make your best offer for the<lb/>
 same positively by 23.3.1992. The offer may please be<lb/>
 made after consulting higher management with a view<lb/>
 to giving best possible rate and avoiding any subsequent<lb/>
 revision thereto.&quot;<lb/>
</item>
<p>

	Copy of this letter was also addressed to the Syndicate Bank alongwirh<lb/>
	all other Nationalized Banks which is evident from the list annexed to<lb/>
	Exhibit-13. From the aforesaid letter, it is evident that the OIDB was<lb/>
	very clear in its mind of investing its funds in the Portfolio<lb/>
	Management Scheme (PMS).<lb/>
</p>

<p>29. The Syndicate Bank also had .written a letter dated 21/03/1992<lb/>
 to the OIDB. This letter is sent by the Assistant General Manager of<lb/>
 the Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch of the Syndicate Bank, New Delhi.<lb/>
 In this letter, it has been stated that Syndicate Bank had learnt that the<lb/>
 surplus funds with the OIDB were to be invested and an offer was<lb/>
 made by the Bank to invest these . funds in the PMS. It would be<lb/>
 relevant, therefore, to see exactly what was the offer made by the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank. The relevant portion of the said letter at Exhibit-7,<lb/>
 reads as under.<lb/></p>
 <item>
 &quot;Dear Sir &apos;<lb/>
 Re : Investment of your funds with us<lb/>
 under Portfolio Management Scheme.<lb/>
 We learn that you have surplus funds meant for investment.<lb/>
 In this connection, we would like to offer our expertise<lb/>
 services to you for management of your funds, that may be<lb/>
 placed with our Bank, by you, under Portfolio Management<lb/>
 Scheme, so as to enable you to get the maximum possible<lb/>
 returns.<lb/>
 In the past, we have been successful in getting a return of<lb/>
 around 18°/o to our existing portfolio clients and we hope<lb/>
 to achieve near about the same level of return to you also.<lb/>
 However, the indicate yie ld for yo u would be about<lb/>
 18.250/o p. a. [Emphasis supplied]<lb/>
</item>

<item>
 Such funds placed with us by you will be managed by us as<lb/>
 per the guidelines issued by R.Bl/SEBI in the matter.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>30. At this juncture, it would also be relevant to consider another<lb/>
 guideline which was issued by the R.Bl in its guidelines at Exhibit-14<lb/>
 ln clause (ii) of para 3 of Exhibit-14, it is stated as under:-<lb/>
</p><item>&quot;3 (ii)<lb/>
 &apos;PMS&apos; should be in the nature<lb/>
 of investment<lb/>
 consultancy /management, for a fee, entirely at the<lb/>
 customer&apos;s risk, without guaranteeing, either directly or<lb/>
 indirectly, a pre-determined return.<lb/>
 The bank should<lb/>
 charge a definite fee for the services rendered independent<lb/>
 of the return to the client.&quot;<lb/></item><p>
 From the letter which is referred to at Exhibit-7, it is clear that the<lb/>
 Assistant Manager of the Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch of the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank, New Delhi had clearly stated that the yield was<lb/>
 indicative only to the extent of 18.25°/o . This is relevant because in the<lb/>
 subsequent correspondence between the OIDB Officials and the Bank,<lb/>
 much emphasis has been laid by the prosecution on these letters to<lb/>
 indicate that the Syndicate Bank had promised and assured OIDB that<lb/>
 it would give them the assured returns. The above letter at Exhibit-7<lb/>
 which is written prior in point of time to the first investment which is<lb/>
 made, clearly states that the only indicative yield of the interest has<lb/>
 been mentioned. Officials of the OIDB, therefore, were clearly aware<lb/>
 that what was the promise given by the Syndicate Bank and i.e only<lb/>
 the indicative yield of the investments which were made in the PMS.<lb/>
 The subsequent correspondence between the Officials of the OIDB with<lb/>
 the Syndicate Bank clearly is after the scam broke out and as I would<lb/>
 presently point out, obviously, this was in order to save their own skin<lb/>
 from the possible fa llout of the investments made at their behest with<lb/>
 the Syndicate Bank. The documents which I am presently dealing with<lb/>
 clearly suggest that the Officials of the OIDB were aware that the<lb/>
 investments were being made in PMS and that the yield would only an<lb/>
 indicative yield.<lb/>
 However, the subsequent correspondence which<lb/>
 strangely has begun after 21/4/1992 clearly suggests that the Officials<lb/>
 of the OIDB have tried to put a wool over their eyes or atleast suggest<lb/>
 that they were not aware that the investments were made in the PMS<lb/>
 which clearly was meant for investments which were essentially to be<lb/>
 made in the capital market instruments as indicated hereinabove in the<lb/>
 RBI guidelines. Syndicate Bank also had in the letter written to the<lb/>
 F.A &amp; C.A.0. of OIDB, New Delhi i.e. P.W. 1 dated 16/04/ 1992 given<lb/>
 details of PMS. This has become necessaiy to point out the details<lb/>
 which have been given by the Deputy General Manager, New Delhi<lb/>
 Branch of the Syndicate Bank. In this letter which is at Exhibit-15,<lb/>
 categorically, the following information was given:-<lb/>
</p><item>
&quot; Dear Sir,<lb/>

 Reserve Bank of India from time to time.<lb/>
 We shall be thankful to receive your funds for<lb/>

 supplied]<lb/>
</item>

<p>
This letter has been received by OIDB and there is a stamp of<lb/>
acknowledgment and the letter has been received on the same day and<lb/>
 F .A &amp; C.A.O. of OIDB has put his initials acknowledging receipt of this<lb/>
 letter. This letter assumes importance for two reasons. Later on, the<lb/>
 Officials of OIDB in their correspondence fe igned ignorance about the<lb/>
 invesnnents which were made by the Syndicate Bank in the capital<lb/>
 market instruments and have stated that specific directions were given<lb/>
 by the OIDB to invest their funds only in Government Securities. It is<lb/>
 imponant to note that when the first remittance was sent on<lb/>
 03/04/1992, the said amount was remitted to the Delhi Branch of the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank even before the formal agreement was executed<lb/>
 between the parties and after receipt of this letter at Exhibit-IS.<lb/>
 Therefore, there is no manner of doubt that the Syndicate Bank clearly<lb/>
 indicated that the funds which were invested in PMS were meant to be<lb/>
 invested in capital market instruments and that the risk was entirely of<lb/>
 the constituents and 1°/o &quot;Back-end,, service charges would be paid to<lb/>
 the Bank. The subsequent correspondence reveals that P.W. 2 has<lb/>
 produced one of the letters wherein he has expressed his surprise as to<lb/>
 how an amount of Rs 33 lacs (approximately) was charged as service<lb/>
 fee by the Syndicate Bank. The subsequent correspondence, therefore,<lb/>
 is clearly contrary to what the Syndicate Bank had clearly informed the<lb/>
 F.A. &amp; C.A.O. of OIDB, New Delhi. I shall refer to the said letter at<lb/>
 later stage. The stand taken by the OIDB, therefore, is clearly contrary<lb/>
 to the documents which are on record. In fact, the documents which<lb/>
 have been brought on record clearly falsifies the case of the<lb/>
 prosecution. It is surprising as to how the CBI did not make any<lb/>
 investigation in respect of Officials of OIDB who were equally<lb/>
 responsible for making these investments with the Syndicate Bank<lb/>
 when they were fully aware about the nature of the inve stments and<lb/>
 the indicative yield of the said investments as also the risk involved in<lb/>
 making these investments under PMS. The correspondence clearly<lb/>
 indicates that the Officers of OIDB had jumped the wagoner to make a<lb/>
 quick money and put at risk the funds which were at its disposal and<lb/>
 which were sent to OIDB from the consolidated funds of India.<lb/>
 Though the matter was of such a serious nature, the evidence of P.W.<lb/>
</p>

<p>15 and 16 who were Investigating Officers shows the manner in which<lb/>
 the investigation had been earned out. It clearly reveals that an<lb/>
 attempt has been made to protect the Officials of the OIDB and to let<lb/>
 go the persons who were directly responsible for the entire episode. A<lb/>
 complaint was filed by Shri V. Sethumadhavan who was the Chief<lb/>
 Vigilance Officer against Shri R. Sundaresan. No explanation has been<lb/>
 given as to why no case was filed against him and later on he was<lb/>
 examined as prosecution witness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>31. In the backdrop of these documents, now it has to be seen as to<lb/>
 how the Officials of OIDB have later on tried to give twist to the entire<lb/>
 episode which was obviously meant for the purpose of saving their<lb/>
 own skin. After this letter at Exhibit-15 was received by F.A. &amp; C.A.0.<lb/>
 of the OIDB, New Delhi and acknowledgment to that effect was given<lb/>
 it is thereafter he addressed a letter • to the Chief Manager of the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank dated 21/4/1992 which is at Exhibit-5. P.W. 1 in this<lb/>
 letter states as under:-<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;We have parked funds to the extent of Rs<lb/>
 20.09 crores with you as per acknowledgment<lb/>
 received from your bank vide your letter<lb/>
 No.216, DZO DGMS F-20,92 dated 18.4.92 for<lb/>
 their proper management under &apos;Portfo lio<lb/>
 Investment&apos;.<lb/>
 Your<lb/>
 acknowledgment<lb/>
 of<lb/>
 deployment of our funds in Govt. Securities,<lb/>
 Units of UTI and Public Sector Bonds, Safe<lb/>
 Custody of securities giving return as contained<lb/>
 in<lb/>
 your<lb/>
 letter<lb/>
 No. 788/9005/92,<lb/>
 dated<lb/>
 25/26.3.1992 is awaited which may please be<lb/>
 expedited.&quot; [Emphasis supplied]<lb/>
</item>

<p>Since the reference is made to the letter dated 25/03/ 1992, it has to<lb/>
 be seen what was mentioned in the said letter which is at Exhibit-6<lb/>
 dated 25/03/1992. It is stated by the Divisional Manager of the New<lb/>
 Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank that yield on the investment made<lb/>
 by the OIDB would not be less that 18.250/o . P.W. 1, therefore, does<lb/>
 not make any reference to the letter received by him dated<lb/>
 16/04/1992 in which details of the PMS was given. He, however,<lb/>
 makes a reference to letter dated 25/26.03.1992. P.W. 1, therefore<lb/>
 fe igned ignorance about receipt of the letter dated 16/04/ 1992. This<lb/>
 clearly indicates that though P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh was very well aware<lb/>
 that the funds parked with the Syndicate Bank were to be deployed<lb/>
 under PMS with all its attending risk involved, he . fe igned ignorance<lb/>
 about this letter and makes a stray reference to the letter dated<lb/>
 25/26.03.1992. It has to be noted that the letter dated 25/26.03.1992<lb/>
 has been written with reference to the letter written by the Assistant<lb/>
 General Manager of the Syndicate Bank to the OIDB dated<lb/>
 21/03/1992. The said letter appears to be a confirmation of what is<lb/>
 stated in letter dated 21/03/1992. In this context, therefore, it will be<lb/>
 necessary to see the relevant contents of the said letter which is at<lb/>
 Exhibit-6 dated 25/26.03.1992 which read as under:-<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;Further to our letter of offer vide ref.<lb/>
 No.PMS/269/5037 /HKS/92 dated 21.3. 1992,<lb/>
 this is to confirm that the yield on your<lb/>
 investment would be not less than 18.25°/o p.a.<lb/>
 on the investment made by you with our Bank<lb/>
 upto Rs 140 crores (Rupees One hundred forty<lb/>
 crores) for one year.&quot;<lb/>
</item>
<p>
 This letter, therefore, was in addition to what was mentioned in<lb/>
 Exhibit-7. In the letter at Exhibit-7 dated 21/03/1992, it has been<lb/>
 clearly mentioned that the indicative yield of 18.25% 1 per annum<lb/>
 would be available on the funds placed with the Syndicate Bank. A<lb/>
reference also has been made to the guidelines issued by RBl/SEBI in<lb/>
 the said letter. P.W. 1, instead of making reference to letter dated<lb/>
 21/03/1992 at Exhibit-7 and further letter which was written dated<lb/>
 16/04/1992 at Exhibit-15 giving complete details of PMS, chooses to<lb/>
 make a reference only to letter dated 25/26.3.1992 at Exhibit-6. This<lb/>
 clearly shows the dishonesty on the part of the prosecution witnesses<lb/>
 and that a dishonest stand was taken by the Officials of OIDB even<lb/>
 before the investments were made. This further indicates that they<lb/>
 were very well aware that the said investments were made contrary to<lb/>
 the regulations which were laid down by the Central Government and<lb/>
 the guidelines and the resolutions passed by the OIDB in its internal<lb/>
 meetings. However, in their correspondence, Officials of OIDB have<lb/>
 fe igned ignorance about the information given by the Syndicate Bank<lb/>
 to them. These documents, therefore, clearly falsify the stand taken by<lb/>
 the OIDB&apos;s Officials. As I have already indicated that an adverse<lb/>
 inference has to be drawn against the prosecution, particularly because<lb/>
 of the conduct of P.W. 1 in not making himself available for further<lb/>
 cross-examination. Prosecution though had an ample opportunity to<lb/>
 get this witness, did not take any steps whatsoever for making him<lb/>
 available for further cross-examination.<lb/>
</p>

<p>32.<lb/>
 The above discussion dearly reveals that the Investigating<lb/>
 Agency acted in a totally sloppy manner though facts and the<lb/>
 documents clearly speak for themselves.<lb/>
 On the one hand, no<lb/>
 explanation is given by the Investigating Officers P.W. 15 and 16 why<lb/>
 no investigation was made at the OIDB end though they had an ample<lb/>
 opportunity to do so.<lb/>
 On the other • hand, though the entire<lb/>
 documentary evidence dearly suggests that the correspondence was<lb/>
 essentially between the OIDB&apos;s officials and the Officers of New Delhi<lb/>
 Branch of the Syndicate Bank and the FIM Branch of the Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank, Fon, Bombay, further investigation has not been made after<lb/>
 these documents were made available • to the prosecution.<lb/>
</p>

<p>33. The subsequent correspondence reveals that P.W. 1 in his<lb/>
 subsequent correspondence has maintained his stand that the funds in<lb/>
 the PMS were to be invested in Government Securities. Letter dated<lb/>
 29/04/1992 at Exhibit-8 is written by P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh to the Chief<lb/>
 Manager, Syndicate Bank, Bhagwan Das Ro ad, New Delhi records that<lb/>
 fo ur cheques, all dated 29/04/1992 drawn on State Bank of India, K.G.<lb/>
 Marg, New Delhi were sent for deployment under Portfolio<lb/>
 Management Scheme with effect from 29/04/1992 @ 19.51°/o . The<lb/>
 amount of the said cheques was Rs 81,68,50,924.65. It is interesting<lb/>
 to note that in para 3 of this letter he has stated as under:-<lb/></p><item>
&quot;3. The funds have been parked with you for<lb/>
 their proper management as &quot;Portfolio<lb/>
 Investment&quot; in Government Securities Units of<lb/>
 UTI &amp; Public Sector Bonds in accordance with<lb/>
 RBI guidelines.&quot;<lb/></item><p>
 In this connection, it will also be relevant to note the following<lb/>
 correspondence between S.K. Pujari, the Accountant of OIDB and P.W.<lb/>
 3 -R. Sundaresan, Divisional Manager of the Syndicate Bank. In the<lb/>
 letter at Exhibit-19 dated 18/06/1993, S.K. Pujari has informed the<lb/>
 Divisional Manager as under:-<lb/></p><item>
&quot;Sub: Investment of funds under P.M.S<lb/>
 Ref : Your letter No.1212/FIM/PMS/93, dated<lb/>
 June 7, 1993.<lb/>
 Sir,<lb/>
 The Oil Industry Development Board has<lb/>
 made no investment with your branch. Whatever<lb/>
 investments the Board has made these have been<lb/>
 made with the Bank&apos;s office/branch located at New<lb/>
 Delhi. Therefore, no cognizance can be taken of<lb/>
 your above mentioned communication. You are<lb/>
 advised to take up the matter with the DGM,<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank, New Delhi and your headquarters<lb/>
 at Manipal.&quot;<lb/></item><p>
 The second letter is dated 03/06/ 1992 written by P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh<lb/>
 to the Assistant General Manager of the Syndicate Bank which is at<lb/>
 Exhibit-24 in which he has stated that the Bombay Office in its letter<lb/>
 dated12/05/1992 has sent an acknowledgment regarding receipt of<lb/>
 funds amounting to Rs 61.43 crores from OIDB through your K.G.<lb/>
 Branch Office for placement in Portfolio Management. He has stated<lb/>
 that since the entire funds of Rs 198.38 crores have been given to Delhi<lb/>
 Office only, there was no occasion for Bombay Office to write the said<lb/>
 letter.<lb/>
 Again, P.W. 1 wrote a letter which is at Exhibit-26 dated<lb/>
 03/08/1992 in which he has made a reference to the letter dated July<lb/>
 18, 1992 from the Bombay Office regarding confirmation of investment<lb/>
 of funds. In para 2 of the said letter dated 3/8/ 1992 at Exhibit-26, he<lb/>
 has mentioned as under:-<lb/></p><item>
&quot;Your Bombay Office vide its letter dated<lb/>
 July 1 8, 1992 has sent confirmation regarding<lb/>
 investment of funds and holding securitie s. This<lb/>
 is inexplicable since the funds have been placed<lb/>
 with your bank on the basis of offe r rece ive d<lb/>
 from your office.&quot;<lb/></item><p>
 So, on the one hand, OIDB has later on taken a sta nd that it was not<lb/>
 concerned with any othe r Office and that it had deploye d the funds<lb/>
 on ly with the K.G. Marg Branch of the Syndicate Bank, New Delhi. No<lb/>
 refe rence was made to any communication made by accused No.l -<lb/>
R.S. Pai. This clearly establishes that the funds were entrusted by<lb/>
 OIDB even according to P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 with the Delhi Branch of<lb/>
 the Syndicate Bank and not eve n with the FIM Branch of the Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank, Fort, Bombay, much less with R.S. Pai who was the Executive<lb/>
 Director and who was stationed at Manipal, Karna taka.<lb/>
 The<lb/>
 correspondence also indicates that though Officials of OIDB were very<lb/>
 well aware about the lette r dated 16/04/1992 at Exhibit-15 and the<lb/>
 other letter dated 21/4/1992, they had fe igned ignorance about the<lb/>
 same and in their letters have stated that the funds were deployed for<lb/>
 the purpose of investment in Government Securities on ly and the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank Officers at Delhi Branch had assured them of fixed<lb/>
 returns of ab ove 18°/o and, later on, in the subsequent correspondence,<lb/>
 they have maintaine d that the fund were deployed for investment at<lb/>
 19.SlO /o per annum. This is clearly contrary to the correspondence<lb/>
 between the Assistant General Manager, Syndicate Bank and the OIDB.<lb/>
 In the letter dated 27 /04/ 1992 at Exhibit-17, the Assistant General<lb/>
 manager of the Syndicate Bank has again stated that the indicative<lb/>
 yield on the investment under PMS was 19.51°/0 per annum. The said<lb/>
 letter at Exhibit-17 reads as under:-<lb/>
&quot;Further to our earlier letter to you on the<lb/>
 subject offering an in dicative yi eld of 18.50°/o<lb/>
 for<lb/>
 your<lb/>
 investment<lb/>
 under<lb/>
 Portfolio<lb/>
 Management Scheme with us we are now<lb/>
 pleased to offer you an indicative yield of<lb/>
 19.51 % (Nineteen point five one percent<lb/>
 p.a.)&quot; [Emphasis supplied]<lb/>
 and yet P.W. 1 in his letter which is written two days after the letter at<lb/>
 Exhibit-17, states that the investment of Rs 81,68,50,924.65 under<lb/>
 PMS has been made with effect from 29/04/1992 @ 19.Slo/ o . All this<lb/>
 correspondence clearly reveals that on the one hand officials of the<lb/>
 OIDB were very well aware of the risk which was involved in investing<lb/>
 their surplus funds in PMS and, on the other hand, for the purpose of<lb/>
 creating record in its office, in the correspondence they have shown<lb/>
 audacity of stating that the funds were to be given for deployment in<lb/>
 Government Securities for a assured sum of interest, though in each<lb/>
 -••<lb/>
 -<lb/>
--<lb/>
letter sent by the Officers of the Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank,<lb/>
 they were at pains to point out that the yield was only an indicative<lb/>
 yield. Apart from this , it is evident that neither P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh<lb/>
 nor P.W. 2 -Arvind Kaushal have made any reference to either Mr. R.S.<lb/>
 Pai -accused No. l or Mr. K. R. N. Shenoy -accused No.2. Therefore,<lb/>
 entrustment of funds with accused No. I has not at all been established.<lb/>
 A boogie has been raised by the Officials of the OIDB that they were<lb/>
 not aware that their surplus funds were being invested in PMS under<lb/>
 their own risk , though they were specifically informed by the Officers<lb/>
 of the Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank and the CBI has turned a<lb/>
 blind eye towards the OIDB Officials which is reflected from the<lb/>
 evidence of P.W. 15 and 16 who were the Investigating Officers who<lb/>
 have clearly stated in their cross-examination that though involvement<lb/>
 of OIDB Officials also appears to be eminent from these documents, no<lb/>
 investigation was made by the CBI on that front. The attempt made by<lb/>
 the OIDB Officials to play hide-and-seek at the same time is reflected<lb/>
 from the following letter which is at Exhibit-9 and this letter is written<lb/>
 by Mr. S.K. Pujari.<lb/>
 Mr. S.K. Puj ari writes a letter to the Chief<lb/>
 Manager, Syndicate Bank in which he states as under:-<lb/></p><item>
&quot;Sir &apos;<lb/>
 The following amendment may please be<lb/>
 made under the investment No.4 of our letter<lb/>
 dated 29.4.92.<lb/>
 S.No.4<lb/>
 Read<lb/>
 S.No.4<lb/>
 Portfolio Management Scheme for a<lb/>
 period of one year.<lb/>
 Portfolio Management Scheme for a<lb/>
 period of one year. Investments in<lb/>
 Units, Bonds of Public Sector Units,<lb/>
 Certificates of Deposit, Commercial<lb/>
 paper of Government, Companies,<lb/>
 Govt. Securities, etc.&quot;<lb/></item><p>
 This letter obviously has been written after it was pointed out by the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank Officials that the PMS pertains only to investments in<lb/>
 capital market. The Officials of the OIDB, therefore, clearly made an<lb/>
 attempt to hide this fact from the higher Offi cials of the OIDB and the<lb/>
 Central Gove rnment.<lb/>
 Unfortunately, though this is clearly evident<lb/>
 from these documents, no steps have been taken by CBI to probe into<lb/>
 this aspect at all, though the funds came from the consolidated fund of<lb/>
 India and under section 15 of the Oil Industry Development Act, 1974<lb/>
 the Government had levied cess and, thereafter had transferred these<lb/>
 funds to OIDB for various purposes.<lb/>
 In view of this documentary<lb/>
 evidence, therefore, I am clearly of the view that, in any case, there is<lb/>
 no connection between the investment of funds by the OIDB either<lb/>
 with accused No. l or accused No.2. Therefore, point Nos. 1 and 2 are<lb/>
 answered in the negative.<lb/>
</p>

<p>34.<lb/>
 Prosecution has also proved the remittances of money from<lb/>
 Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank to its Bombay Branch through<lb/>
 inter-bank credit advise note since these documents are not disputed.<lb/>
 Even if the said documents are accepted, as I have indicated earlier,<lb/>
 nothing turns on the said documents of transf�r of money from the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank, New Delhi Branch to the FIM Branch of the Syndicate<lb/>
 Bank at Fort, Bombay and the further amount which has been sent to<lb/>
 FGIL. An attempt has been made by the prosecution to show that<lb/>
 accused No.1 knew accused No.2 while he was working in the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank and further an attempt is made to show that P.W. 3 -R<lb/>
 Sundaresan was brought from Hongkong to the FIM Branch of the<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank at Fort, Bombay.<lb/>
 It is also said by some of the<lb/>
 witnesses that because Mr. Prabhu did not agree with Mr R.S. Pai -<lb/>
accused No.l, he was suddenly transferred and in his place Mr. R.<lb/>
 Sundaresan was posted as Divisional Manager. It is the further case of<lb/>
 prosecution and it is so stated by P.W. 3 and P.W. 5 that on account of<lb/>
 suggestion made by R.S. Pai -accused No.1 that accused No.2 was<lb/>
 appointed for the purpose of making investments in the capital market<lb/>
 instruments. The second limb of the prosecution case therefore is that<lb/>
 Mr. R.S. Pai had persuaded OIDB Officials to invest its money in<lb/>
 Syndicate Bank and, on the other hand, the said money was siphoned<lb/>
 off in favour of FGIL and it&apos;s sister concern the Fairgrowth Financial<lb/>
 Services Ltd since the said company of which accused No.2 was a<lb/>
 Managing Director was under liquidity crunch and, therefore, accused<lb/>
 No.2 and his Company had wrongfully gained from the transfer of<lb/>
 fu nds to it and wrongful loss was caused to OIDB.<lb/>
</p>

<p>35.<lb/>
 First of all , it is pertinent to note here th.at though original<lb/>
 complaint which was filed by V. Sethumadhavan and an FIR was<lb/>
 lodged which is at Exhibit-130, it was alleged that P.W. 3 -R.<lb/>
 Sundaresan had cheated the Bank and there was wrongful loss caused<lb/>
 to OIDB and wrongful gain to accused No.2.<lb/>
 Later on, when the<lb/>
 charge-sheet was filed, a charge of cheating was dropped. No charges<lb/>
 were levelled against P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan who was named as an<lb/>
 accused in the original complaint and the charge was levelled against<lb/>
 accused No.1 -R.S. Pai for the substantive offence of criminal breach<lb/>
 of trust under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code and conspiracy<lb/>
 along with the offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act.<lb/>
 Though, it has been charged that the entire amount was transferred in<lb/>
 the name of Company of accused No.2, it is a matter of record that the<lb/>
 actual shares to the tune of Rs 93 crores approximately were purchased<lb/>
 in the name of OIDB. The decision to make investment was taken by<lb/>
 the Committee of four persons in which accused No.1 was not a<lb/>
 member and, on the other hand, P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan was the<lb/>
 member of the Committee alongwith three other persons. This falsifies<lb/>
 the case of the prosecution that the investments were made in FGIL<lb/>
 and its sister concern the Fairgrowth Financial Services Ltd of which<lb/>
 the accused No.2 was the Managing Director at the instance of Mr. R.S.<lb/>
 Pai -accused No.1. This decision was taken by the Committee of fo ur<lb/>
 persons which decided the date and the manner which the investments<lb/>
 were to be made.<lb/>
 This clearly indicates that the transaction of<lb/>
 investment in shares from the PMS of the client was not an ostensible<lb/>
 share transaction but was an actual share transaction. It is interesting<lb/>
 to note that the prosecution has not stated whether actual loss was<lb/>
 caused to the OIDB as a result of investment made. No such complaint<lb/>
 has been made either by V. Sethumadhavan who lodged a complaint or<lb/>
 by Officials of OIDB that the said funds of Rs 132.22 crores which were<lb/>
 deployed were lost or not repaid. Prosecution ought to have produced<lb/>
 the said fact on record as• to what happened thereafter in order to<lb/>
 _j<lb/>
 make the record straight.<lb/>
 Obvious inference therefore has to be<lb/>
 drawn. It is a matter of record that the entire amount was repaid to<lb/>
 OIDB alongwith interest and, as such, no loss was caused to the OIDB.<lb/>
 None of the witnesses who was examined from the Syndicate Bank<lb/>
 stated that any loss was caused to the Syndicate Bank. Prosecution,<lb/>
 therefore, has miserably failed in establishing the charge of criminal<lb/>
 conspiracy to commit an offence of criminal breach of trust by accused<lb/>
 No.l and accused No.2 or the substantive charge of criminal breach of<lb/>
 trust against accused No.1 Accordingly, point Nos. 1 and 2 are<lb/>
 answered in the negative.<lb/>
</p>

<p>36.<lb/>
 So far as 3rd and 4th charge is concerned, prosecution has not<lb/>
 proved that 62000 shares from the promoters&apos; quota of FGIL and its<lb/>
 sister concern M/s Fair Growth Financial Services Ltd were transferred<lb/>
 in the name of accused No.1 or in the name of his family members.<lb/>
 The 3rd and 4th charge read as under:-<lb/></p><item>
&quot;THIRDLY,<lb/>
 that in pursuance to the said<lb/>
 conspiracy you Accused No.l, as a motive<lb/>
 and/ or reward for causing the aforesaid<lb/>
 wrongful gain to accused No.2 and/or his said<lb/>
 company, dishonestly obtained in your name<lb/>
 and in the name of your fa mily members of<lb/>
 62,000 shares from promoters&apos; quota of the<lb/>
 FGIL and its sister concern the Fairgrowth<lb/>
 Financial Services Ltd., and you have thereby<lb/>
 committed offences punishable under sections<lb/>
 13(1) (d) read with section 13(2) and section 7<lb/>
 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;FOURTHLY, that you Accused No.2 instigated<lb/>
 and abetted accused No.1 in obtaining the said<lb/>
 62000 shares by way of motive/reward for<lb/>
 enabling you and/or your said company to<lb/>
 make the aforesaid wrongful gain of Rs<lb/>
 93,17,77,925/-<lb/>
and<lb/>
 you<lb/>
 have<lb/>
 thereby<lb/>
 committed an offence punishable under section<lb/>
 12, Prevention of Conuption Act, 1988.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>37.<lb/>
 In order to establish that accused Nos. 1 and 2 had committed an<lb/>
 offence as charged under 3<lb/>
 rd<lb/>
 and<lb/>
 4rh<lb/>
 charge, it was necessaiy to<lb/>
 establish that the FGIL and its sister concern M/s. Fair Growth<lb/>
 Financial Services Ltd had transferred the aforesaid 62000 shares from<lb/>
 its promoters&apos; quota in favour of accused No. I and his family members .<lb/>
 Unfortunately, prosecution has miserably failed in establishing the said<lb/>
 charge since it has not been proved that the said shares were, in fact,<lb/>
 transferred in the name of accused No.1 or his family members. All<lb/>
 those documents which were marked as X-1 to X-14 have not been<lb/>
 proved and, therefore, these documents could not be exhibited. The<lb/>
 relevant witness who could prove the contents of the said documents<lb/>
 and who was the author of the said documents was not examined by<lb/>
 the prosecution. Prosecution witness viz Investigating Officer who had<lb/>
 produced these documents in the search conducted as per search<lb/>
 warrant dated 05/04/ 1994, did not identify the signatures and<lb/>
 handwriting of the said persons who prepared the documents and, as a<lb/>
 result, though the search warrant was brought on record alongwith<lb/>
 these documents, the relevant documents were not proved and,<lb/>
 therefore, are not the part of the record. Prosecution, therefore, is not<lb/>
 in a position to establish that these shares which were seized pursuant<lb/>
 to the search warrant which was issued were, in fact, transferred in the<lb/>
 name of accused No. I or his family members. That being the position,<lb/>
 the 3rd and 4 th charge has not been established by the prosecution and<lb/>
 the accused Nos. 1 and 2, therefore, have to be acquitted of the said<lb/>
 charge which is levelled against them. It has to be noted here that,<lb/>
 though ample opportunity was given to the prosecution to examine the<lb/>
 said witness, in spite of diligent efforts being made by the prosecution,<lb/>
 they were unable to examine the said witness. Points Nos. 3 and 4<lb/>
 are, therefore, answered in the negative.<lb/>
</p>

<p>38.<lb/>
 I have already indicated hereinabove that documents which<lb/>
 are marked at X-1 to X-14 for identification, though it was a very<lb/>
 important piece of evidence for the purpose of showing that certain<lb/>
 favours were received by accused No.1 and to that extent to show his<lb/>
 involvement in the said matter, have not been proved at all. As a<lb/>
 result, documents at marked at X-1 to X-14 cannot be read in evidence.<lb/>
 The search warrant dated 04/05/1994 has been proved and is at<lb/>
 Exhibit-134 and 135. However, the documents which were seized and<lb/>
 are at serial Nos. 1 to 18 in the report, however, could not be proved<lb/>
 as P.W. 15 -Sushil Prasad Singh who has made the panchanama has<lb/>
 stated that certain documents were seized by S.S. Nair, Deputy<lb/>
 Superintendent of Police from the residence of accused No.1. He has<lb/>
 stated that when these documents were seized, he was not connected<lb/>
 with the investigation of the case. He has further stated that when<lb/>
 these documents were seized during the course of investigation and D-<lb/>
52 to D-57 were signed by the witnesses. He has stated that, however,<lb/>
 he was not in a position to identify the signatures of these witnesses.<lb/>
 He has also stated that he cannot identify the signature of Vineet<lb/>
 Suchanti. The documents 0-52 to D-57 were seized during the search<lb/>
 of residence of accused No.1 at Bangalore on 06/05/1994.<lb/>
 Prosecution has neither examined the author of these documents<lb/>
 which are marked as X-1 to X-14, nor have they examined any person<lb/>
 who could identify the signature of the various signatories. As a result,<lb/>
 all these documents not being proved, no inference can be drawn that<lb/>
 shares of FGIL were transferred in favour of accused No.1 and the<lb/>
 members of his family as a motive or reward and, therefore, I have<lb/>
 already held that point Nos. 3 and 4 have not been proved by the<lb/>
 prosecution.<lb/>
</p>

<p>39.<lb/>
 As a result of the above discussion, it is clear that no case has<lb/>
 been made out against the present accused and the accused are liable<lb/>
 to be acquitted.<lb/>
</p>

<item>40.<lb/> At this stage, it would be appropriate to make a reference to the<lb/>
 assistance which is given to this Court by the Special Public Prosecutors<lb/>
 Mr. V.G. Pradhan and Mr. R.S. Mhamane who have taken great efforts<lb/>
 to put up the case of the prosecution and without their assistance, it<lb/>
 would not have been possible for this Court to decide this case.<lb/>
</item>

<p>41.<lb/>
 Accordingly, the fo llowing order is passed:-<lb/>
ORDER<lb/>
 In the result, both the accused are acquitted of the offences<lb/>
 with which they were charged. Their bails bonds stand cancelled.<lb/>
