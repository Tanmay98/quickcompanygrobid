			HON&apos;BLE MS. JUSTICE SANGITA DHINGRA SEHGAL
			<lb />
			G.S. SISTANI, J. (ORAL)
			<lb />
			CM APPL 42806/2018 (exemption)
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			Exemption is allowed, subject to all just exception.

			<lb />
			The application stands disposed of.

			3.
			<lb />
			Challenge in this appeal is to the order dated 24.09.2018 passed by the
			<lb />
			Family Court, by which a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu
			<lb />
			Marriage Act seeking restitution of conjugal rights has been rejected
			<lb />
			on the ground of territorial jurisdiction. The impugned order dated
			<lb />
			24.09.2018, reads as under:
			<lb />
			&quot;Ms. Rajkotia submits that this court has wrongly taken
			<lb />
			a view in another previously filed petition, between the present
			<lb />
			parties bearing No.794/17, that territorial jurisdiction does not
			<lb />
			lie in this court.

			However, the present being a petition under section 9
			<lb />
			of HMA, the court may assume the jurisdiction for the reason
			<lb />
			that respondent in her WS in the previous petition, in para 13
			<lb />
			had pleaded that she is ready to join the company of the
			<lb />
			petitioner. It is argued that the aforesaid pleading of the
			<lb />
			respondent indicate that she is willing to join the company of
			<lb />
			the petitioner at Delhi, therefore, the matrimonial home was
			<lb />
			Delhi. Ms. Rajkotia, therefore, submits that this court has the
			<lb />
			territorial jurisdiction to entertain the petition.
			<lb />
			I have given my thoughtful consideration to the
			<lb />
			submission made by Ms. Rajkotia. However, the court still
			<lb />
			holds the view which it has expressed in order dated
			<lb />
			18.07.2018, while allowing the application under Order 7 Rule
			<lb />
			11 CPC in HMA No.794/17. This court, therefore, does not
			<lb />
			have the territorial jurisdiction.
			<lb />
			The petition is rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC.
			<lb />
			File be consigned to record room.&quot;
			<lb />
			4.
			<lb />
			Learned counsel for the appellant submits that, in fact, both the parties
			<lb />
			are interested in residing together, i.e., both the parties wish to seek
			<lb />
			restoration of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage
			<lb />
			Act. It is contended that since the appellant resides in Delhi, he has
			<lb />
			invoked the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.
			<lb />
			5.
			<lb />
			The reasons for rejecting the petition finds mentioned in an earlier
			<lb />
			order between the same parties dated 18.07.2018. Paras 5, 6, 7 and 8
			<lb />
			read as under:
			<lb />
			&quot;5. I have heard ld. Counsels for both the parties and with
			<lb />
			their assistance, I have perused the record and the
			<lb />
			statement of the petitioner.
			<lb />
			6. From the statement of the petitioner, which is recorded on
			<lb />
			oath, it can be gather that both the parties were working at

			different stations and had not made up mind for a
			<lb />
			particular place to be their matrimonial home. None of
			<lb />
			them had planned to seek transfer to the place of posting
			<lb />
			of the other. Respondent visited the husband for the first
			<lb />
			time in February 2017, after about 2 months of marriage,
			<lb />
			when they both went to Haridwar, Uttarakhand.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, respondent visited Delhi in March 2017 to sit
			<lb />
			for a competitive exam. Both of these visits can not be
			<lb />
			held to be for the purpose of residing or living together.
			<lb />
			In her first visit, they had both gone to Haridwar,
			<lb />
			Uttarakhand together and the second visit was for taking
			<lb />
			an exam.
			<lb />
			7. It is respondent&apos;s last visit from 27.04.2017 to
			<lb />
			03.05.2017, on which petitioner invokes the jurisdiction
			<lb />
			of this court. In his statement, petitioner has stated that
			<lb />
			she had stayed with him after taking leave from the
			<lb />
			office. It is, therefore, not his case that respondent had
			<lb />
			shifted base, to start living with him. For a party to
			<lb />
			invoke jurisdiction u/sec.19 (iii) of the HMD, it has to be
			<lb />
			established that the parties resided together with the
			<lb />
			intention of giving the place some semblance of
			<lb />
			permanency. Short visit, after taking leave of the office
			<lb />
			would only qualify to be a casual visit. This 5-6 days
			<lb />
			long visit, which was the first by the respondent to the
			<lb />
			house of petitioner would not clothe this court with the
			<lb />
			territorial jurisdiction, when no permanency was sought
			<lb />
			to be attached to this place of visit. It is not the case of
			<lb />
			the petitioner that respondent intended to seek a job in
			<lb />
			Delhi or a transfer in Delhi or that she intended to take a
			<lb />
			long leave from her office. This court is, therefore, of the
			<lb />
			opinion that petitioner can not invoke the round of &apos;last
			<lb />
			resided together&apos; as provided for u/sec.19(iii) of the HMA
			<lb />
			to invoke territorial jurisdiction of this court.
			<lb />
			8. In the aforesaid facts &amp; circumstances, application u/o 7
			<lb />
			Rule 11 CPC is allowed. Present petition is, thus not
			<lb />
			maintainable before this court. The same is rejected
			<lb />
			exercising power u/o 7 Rule 11 CPC with liberty to the
			<lb />

			petitioner to file the same before the court of competent
			<lb />
			jurisdiction.&quot;
			<lb />
			6.
			<lb />
			At this stage, learned counsel for the appellant submits that the parties
			<lb />
			are interested to stay together and the appellant would approach the
			<lb />
			respondent and, therefore, no further orders are required to be passed
			<lb />
			in this appeal.
			<lb />
			7.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed as not pressed.
