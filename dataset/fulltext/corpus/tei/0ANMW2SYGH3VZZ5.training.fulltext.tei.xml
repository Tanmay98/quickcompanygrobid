			<p>
				1. By way of the present petition filed under Section 482 of the Code
				<lb />
				of Criminal Procedure, 1973, petitioners seek quashing of FIR
				<lb />
				No.60/2012 registered at Police Station Pandav Nagar, Delhi, for the
				<lb />
				offences punishable under Sections 498A/406/34 of the IPC and the
				<lb />
				consequential proceedings emanating therefrom against them.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				2. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submit that
				<lb />
				the aforesaid case was registered on the complaint of respondent No.2,
				<lb />
				namely, Dr. Eema Choudhary, consequent upon certain matrimonial and

				<lb />
				respondent No.2 and the petitioners have amicably settled their disputes
				<lb />
				before Mahila Court , Karkardoom Courts , Delhi vide
				<lb />
				settlement/agreement dated 23.08.2014. Consequent thereto, marriage
				<lb />
				between petitioner no. 1 and respondent no. 2 has been dissolved vide
				<lb />
				decree of divorce dated 7.07.2015. As per the settlement, petitioners
				<lb />
				agreed to pay a sum of Rs.4,25,000/-as full and final settlement. Out of
				<lb />
				which two instalments of Rs.1,50,000/-each were paid at the time of
				<lb />
				recording of statements for first and second motion petitions and the
				<lb />
				balance amount of Rs.1,25,000/-has been paid today in the Court by way
				<lb />
				of bankers cheque being no. 586561 dated 25.01.2016 drawn on State
				<lb />
				bank of India. In addition to aforesaid amount, respondent no. 2 has also
				<lb />
				received one gold chain, one diamond ring, one set of gold ear ring and
				<lb />
				one necklace. Thus, she does not want to pursue the case further against
				<lb />
				the petitioners.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				3. Respondent No.2 is personally present in the Court. For her
				<lb />
				identification, she has produced her driving licence being no.
				<lb />
				DL-0720020065764. (Original seen and returned to her). Respondent
				<lb />
				no. 2 does not dispute the submissions made by learned counsel for the
				<lb />
				petitioners and submits that the present matter has been amicably settled,
				<lb />
				marriage between her and petitioner No.1 has been dissolved vide decree
				<lb />
				of divorce dated 07.07.2015. She has received the entire agreed amount
				<lb />
				and other articles as per the settlement has no complaints whatsoever
				<lb />
				against the petitioner No.1 and his family members. Affidavit of
				<lb />
				respondent No.2 is at page No. 85 of the petition. Respondent No.2
				<lb />
				states that now no dispute with petitioners survives and so, the
				<lb />
				proceedings arising out of the FIR in question may be brought to an end.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				4. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing on behalf of the
				<lb />
				State submits that after investigation, police has filed the chargesheet,
				<lb />
				however, the charges are yet to be framed. He further submits that the
				<lb />
				present matter is a matrimonial one and since the respondent No.2 does
				<lb />
				not wish to pursue the case further against petitioners, no purpose would
				<lb />
				be served if the petitioners are directed to face trial. Therefore, the State
				<lb />
				has no objection, if the present petition is allowed.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				5. Under the circumstances and looking to the decision of the
				<lb />
				Supreme Court in the case of Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab and
				<lb />
				Another (2012) 10 SCC 303, wherein the Apex Court has referred to a
				<lb />
				number of matters for the proposition that even a non-compoundable
				<lb />
				offence can also be quashed on the ground of a settlement agreement
				<lb />
				between the offender and the victim, if the circumstances so warrant; by
				<lb />
				observing as under:
				<lb />
			</p>
			 
				<item>
				&quot;58.
				<lb />
				....However,
				<lb />
				certain
				<lb />
				offences
				<lb />
				which
				<lb />
				overwhelmingly and predominantly bear civil flavour
				<lb />
				having arisen out of civil, mercantile, commercial,
				<lb />
				financial, partnership or such like transactions or the
				<lb />
				offences arising out of matrimony, particularly relating
				<lb />
				to dowry, etc. or the family dispute, where the wrong is
				<lb />
				basically to the victim and the offender and the victim
				<lb />
				have settled all disputes between them amicably,
				<lb />
				irrespective of the fact that such offences have not been
				<lb />
				made compoundable, the High Court may within the
				<lb />
				framework of its inherent power, quash the criminal
				<lb />
				proceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it is satisfied
				<lb />
				that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly any
				<lb />
				likelihood of the offender being convicted and by not
				<lb />
				quashing the criminal proceedings, justice shall be
				<lb />
				casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated.&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			  

			<p>
				6. While recognizing the need of amicable resolution of disputes in
				<lb />
				cases like the instant one, the aforesaid dictum has been affirmed by the
				<lb />
				Apex Court in a recent judgment in Narinder Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. State of
				<lb />
				Punjab &amp; Anr. 2014 6 SCC 466. The pertinent observations of the Apex
				<lb />
				Court are as under:-
				<lb />
				</p>
				 
					<item>
				29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and
				<lb />
				lay down the following principles by which the High
				<lb />
				Court would be guided in giving adequate treatment to
				<lb />
				the settlement between the parties and exercising its
				<lb />
				power under Section 482 of the Code while accepting the
				<lb />
				settlement and quashing the proceedings or refusing to
				<lb />
				accept the settlement with direction to continue with the
				<lb />
				criminal proceedings:
				<lb /></item>
				<item>
				29.1 Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is
				<lb />
				to be distinguished from the power which lies in the
				<lb />
				Court to compound the offences under Section 320 of the
				<lb />
				Code. No doubt, under Section 482 of the Code, the High
				<lb />
				Court has inherent power to quash the criminal
				<lb />
				proceedings even in those cases which are not
				<lb />
				compoundable, where the parties have settled the matter
				<lb />
				between themselves. However, this power is to be
				<lb />
				exercised sparingly and with caution.
				<lb /></item>
				<item>
				29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and
				<lb />
				on that basis petition for quashing the criminal
				<lb />
				proceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases
				<lb />
				would be to secure:
				<lb />
				(i) ends of justice, or
				<lb />
				(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court.
				<lb />
				While exercising the power the High Court is to form an
				<lb />
				opinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives.
				<lb /></item>
				<item>
				29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised in those
				<lb />
				prosecutions which involve heinous and serious offences
				<lb />
				of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
				<lb />
				dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and
				<lb />
				have a serious impact on society. Similarly, for the
				<lb />
				offences alleged to have been committed under special
				<lb />
				statute like the Prevention of Corruption Act or the
				<lb />
				offences committed by public servants while working in
				<lb />
				that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis
				<lb />
				of compromise between the victim and the offender.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having
				<lb />
				overwhelmingly and predominantly civil character,
				<lb />
				particularly those arising out of commercial transactions
				<lb />
				or arising out of matrimonial relationship or family
				<lb />
				disputes should be quashed when the parties have
				<lb />
				resolved their entire disputes among themselves.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to
				<lb />
				examine as to whether the possibility of conviction is
				<lb />
				remote and bleak and continuation of criminal cases
				<lb />
				would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice
				<lb />
				and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
				<lb />
				quashing the criminal cases.
				<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
				29.6. Offences under Section 307 IPC would fall in the
				<lb />
				category of heinous and serious offences and therefore
				<lb />
				are to be generally treated as crime against the society
				<lb />
				and not against the individual alone. However, the High
				<lb />
				Court would not rest its decision merely because there is
				<lb />
				a mention of Section 307 IPC in the FIR or the charge is
				<lb />
				framed under this provision. It would be open to the
				<lb />
				High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of
				<lb />
				Section 307 IPC is there for the sake of it or the
				<lb />
				prosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if
				<lb />
				proved, would lead to proving the charge under Section
				<lb />
				307 IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High
				<lb />
				Court to go by the nature of injury sustained, whether
				<lb />
				such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate parts of the
				<lb />
				body, nature of weapons used, etc. Medical report in
				<lb />
				respect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be
				<lb />
				the guiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie
				<lb />
				analysis, the High Court can examine as to whether
				<lb />
				there is a strong possibility of conviction or the chances
				<lb />
				of conviction are remote and bleak. In the former case it
				<lb />
				can refuse to accept the settlement and quash the
				<lb />
				criminal proceedings whereas in the latter case it would
				<lb />
				be permissible for the High Court to accept the plea
				<lb />
				compounding the offence based on complete settlement
				<lb />
				between the parties. At this stage, the Court can also be
				<lb />
				swayed by the fact that the settlement between the parties
				<lb />
				is going to result in harmony between them which may
				<lb />
				improve their future relationship.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power under
				<lb />
				Section 482 of the Code or not, timings of settlement play
				<lb />
				a crucial role. Those cases where the settlement is
				<lb />
				arrived at immediately after the alleged commission of
				<lb />
				offence and the matter is still under investigation, the
				<lb />
				High Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement to
				<lb />
				quash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is
				<lb />
				because of the reason that at this stage the investigation
				<lb />
				is still on and even the charge-sheet has not been filed.
				<lb />
				Likewise, those cases where the charge is framed but the
				<lb />
				evidence is yet to start or the evidence is still at infancy
				<lb />
				stage, the High Court can show benevolence in
				<lb />
				exercising its powers favourably, but after prima facie
				<lb />
				assessment of the circumstances/material mentioned
				<lb />
				above. On the other hand, where the prosecution
				<lb />
				evidence is almost complete or after the conclusion of the
				<lb />
				evidence the matter is at the stage of argument, normally
				<lb />
				the High Court should refrain from exercising its power
				<lb />
				under Section 482 of the Code, as in such cases the trial
				<lb />
				court would be in a position to decide the case finally on
				<lb />
				merits and to come to a conclusion as to whether the
				<lb />
				offence under Section 307 IPC is committed or not.
				<lb />
				Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is already
				<lb />
				recorded by the trial court and the matter is at the
				<lb />
				appellate stage before the High Court, mere compromise
				<lb />
				between the parties would not be a ground to accept the
				<lb />
				same resulting in acquittal of the offender who has
				<lb />
				already been convicted by the trial court. Here charge is
				<lb />
				proved under Section 307 IPC and conviction is already
				<lb />
				recorded of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no
				<lb />
				question of sparing a convict found guilty of such a
				<lb />
				crime.&quot;
				<lb />
				</item>
			  

			<p>
				7.In the case of Jitendra Raghuvanshi &amp; Ors. Vs. Babita
				<lb />
				Raghuvanshi &amp; Anr. (2013) 4 SCC 58, wherein the Supreme Court in
				<lb />
				respect of the matrimonial disputes has specifically held as follows:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			 
				<item>
				&quot;15. In our view, it is the duty of the courts to
				<lb />
				encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes,
				<lb />
				particularly, when the same are on considerable
				<lb />
				increase. Even if the offences are non-compoundable, if
				<lb />
				they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is
				<lb />
				satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably
				<lb />
				and without any pressure, we hold that for the purpose
				<lb />
				of securing ends of justice, Section 320 of the Code
				<lb />
				would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing
				<lb />
				of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal
				<lb />
				proceedings.
				<lb />
			</item>
			<item>
				16. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes
				<lb />
				in recent times. They institution of marriage occupies
				<lb />
				an important place and it has an important role to play
				<lb />
				in the society. Therefore, every effort should be made in
				<lb />
				the interest of the individuals in order to enable them to
				<lb />
				settle down in life and live peacefully. If the parties
				<lb />
				ponder over their defaults and terminate their disputes
				<lb />
				amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out
				<lb />
				in a court of law, in order to do complete justice in the
				<lb />
				matrimonial matters, the courts should be less hesitant
				<lb />
				in exercising their extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite
				<lb />
				to state that the power under Section 482 should be
				<lb />
				exercised sparingly and with circumspection only when
				<lb />
				the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on
				<lb />
				record, that allowing the proceedings to continue
				<lb />
				would be an abuse of process of court or that the ends
				<lb />
				of justice require that the proceedings ought to be
				<lb />
				quashed….&quot;
				<lb />
			</item>
			  
			<p>
				8. Both the parties who are present in the Court today, approbate the
				<lb />
				aforesaid settlement dated 23.08.2014 and undertake to remain bound by
				<lb />
				the same.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				9. Since the subject matter of this FIR is essentially matrimonial,
				<lb />
				which now stands mutually and amicably settled between the parties and
				<lb />
				the complainant is no longer interested in supporting the prosecution
				<lb />
				because of which, its chances of success in the matter are now greatly
				<lb />
				diminished. Therefore, in view of the law discussed above, in the facts
				<lb />
				and circumstances as noted above, I am of the considered opinion that this
				<lb />
				matter deserves to be given a quietus as continuance of proceedings
				<lb />
				arising out of the FIR in question would be an exercise in futility.
				<lb />
				10. Consequently, FIR No.60/2012 registered at Police Station Pandav
				<lb />
				Nagar, Delhi, for the offences punishable under Sections 498A/406/34 of
				<lb />
				the IPC and all proceedings emanating therefrom are hereby quashed the
				<lb />
				petitioners.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				11. Accordingly, the present petition is allowed with no order as to
				<lb />
				costs.
