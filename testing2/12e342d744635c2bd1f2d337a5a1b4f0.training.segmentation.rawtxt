Stata of Kerala V/s. P. Suqathan AIR 2000 SUPREME COURT 

3323 wherein it is ob:served that to urove a criminal 

.. 

conspiracy, 
there 
mu.st 
be 
evidence 
direct 
or 

circumstantial to .show that there wa.s 41'1 agreement 

between two or more per.sons• to commit an. offence. There 

mu.st 
be a meeting of 
minds 
resulting in ultimate 

decision taken by the conspirator reqar:di11g commission 

<:if offence. The few bites here and few bites there on 

which 
the pro.secut io1'1 
relies 
can 
not 
held 
to 
be 

adequate for con11ect ing the accused to the commi.s.sion 

of crime of criminal con5piracy. The above observations 

are not disputed and can not be disputed. However it 

mu.st be n.oted tho.t in the above cited case, 
Their 

Lord.ship were appreciating the evidence regarding the 

conspiracy wherein the occ:us.ed was held guilty by the 

Court.s below. While in the in.st ant ca.se, we are 011lv at 

the 
stage 
of 
framing 
of 
charge 
and 
the 
present 

appli�ations a.re by the accused for discharge. So the 

above cited r:uling.s are of llO help to the accused. 

15. 

While considering the pre.sent applications, the 

mo.st important thing to be noted i.s that earlier 3 co-

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:37:04 ::: 


16 

ac:: cu.sed i11 this case namely accused No:s. 1, 3 and 4 had 

filed separate applications for discharge and thQ sc.me 

were 
granted 
by 
the 
then 
learned 
Special 
Judqe. 

However, CBI preferred appeals again.st the said order 

and the Apex Court observed ;-

"From o 
bare perusal of the impugned 

order, it would appear that the Special 

Court has virtually pos:sed l!n order of 

acquit t 41 in the garb of an order of 

di;scihl1rqe. It is well settled thtJ.t tJ.t 

the st1:1qe of fr4lrling of the cbl1rge, what 

is required to be �een i s as to whether 

there t:tre :sufficient grounds to proceed 

against the llccu:sed. 

In 

our view, 
the 

Special 
Court 
not 
justified 
in 

disahl!lrging 
the 
afore:sl1id 
llCCU:Sed 

-persons. " 

16. 

So due weiqhtage .shall have to be given to this 

fact particularly when we find that the ca.se of ac:: cu.sed 

No.s. 2 and 5 i.s practically on the .same pedestal and it 

i:s 

not on lower pedestal. 
From the above mentioned 

"

observations, 
one 
h4.s to 
hold 
that the 
ob.serva.tions 

made 
by 
the 
then 
Special 
Judge 
in 
the 
earlier 

applications that there 

i:s 

no 
material 
to 
.show tha.t 

there wa.:s no cheat inq at the incept io11 and that it was 

direct transaction and not ready forward transaction 

end a.s .such it ccm not be held that there i.s pr.i.ma 

facie 
ca.se 
again.st 
accused 

i.s 

not 
Approved 
by 
the 

Supreme Court. 

17. 

So, this fact that the prayer for discharge of 

co-accused in this 
ca..se 
i.s negatived bv the 
Supreme 

Court 
i.s 
in 
fact 
sufficient 
to 
reject 
the 
present 

application of the other two co-accused a.s their ca.se 

i:s practically on the .same pedestal. 

18. 
Apart 
from 
this, 
Shri 
R.S. 
Mham4ne 
learned 

Additional 
Special 
Public 
Prosecutor 
for

Additional Ma.110.qing Director of ABFL, Mumbai. From the 

statements of the prosecution witnes:se.s it a.ppear.s that

20 

i11i t iall y the proposal with regard to transact ion in 

question was initiated by accused N o. 2 to accused No .1 

and thereafter, 
a meeting took plcce between accused 

No.1, accused No.2 with J.R. Shroff and H.S. Mehta i.e. 

accused No.6 in chamber of R.L. Wadhava at Bajaj Bhavan. 

for the purpose of illegal object of making funds of 

ABFL available to the brokers. How the said proposal 

was 
ultimately 
implemented 
has 
been 
.stated 
by 
the 

Prosecutio1i. witr1e.s.ses No.1 to 7 and PW-9,10,11 a1i.d 33. 

From the :statement of PW-14 as well a:s from :some other 

documents produced from record it auuear.s that accused 

... ... 

No.s.l 
and 
2 
beinq 
chairmen 
and Additional 
M.D. 
had 

control over the funds of ABFL. 

It is 
a.l.so a.ppa.rent 

fi:om the .statement of PW-13/P-48 K. V. Balkri.sh.i1a that 

necessary 
instructions 
were 
given 
to 
the 
concerned 

persons to bi:i119 ACC .shares purchased by ABFL. Not only 

that but the shares which were brought in 4 big .suit 

ca.se.s were kept in the residential premise.s of accused 

No.2. It wa.s accused No.2 who had instructed Allaha.bad 

Bank to issue Banker's cheque for Rs. 
60 
crores end 

Rs.39,98,02,602.74 
in 
fcvou:c

of Rs. 100 crore.s. It was he, 
who hod informed tha.t the

afore.said cheques be har1.ded over to V. B. Desai. The:ce 

is prima facie material to .show that the cheque dated 

09/04/1972 
for Rs. 
60 crores was deposited to the 

credit of accounts of Shri H. S. Mehte., 
accused No . 6 

mainte.iited with ANZ Griitdlay.s Bank, Mumbai (document 

No. 33: 
document No. 34) 
From the material 
on record 

prirna facie it i.s clear that no credit instructions 

were is.sued by the issuing bank for the credit to any 

third 
party 
account. 
So,. knowing this 
fact 
fully, 

accused 
No. 5 
S. N. 
Chhapghar 
fraudulent l v 
and 

uncuthori::.edly having co n.spired with accused No.s.1, 2 

and 6 with a view to cause wrongful gain to accused 

No .6 cleared the cheque deposit slip for the credit of 

account of H. S. Mehta. This particular act of o.ccu.sed 

No.5 
which 
was 
totally 
agai11.st 
the 
.standing 

instruct ions, guidelines and the rules and regulations 

of the RBI, prima facie indicates thot the accused No.5 

was al.so involved ii1 the alleged conspiracy. We can not 

ignore the fact that two tra1'1.saction.s vi::.. 6, 00, 000• ACC 

shares and 9% IRFC Bonds were on outright deal, the 

other 
part 
of 
purchase of ACC .shares can 
not 
be 

anything 
other 
than 
outright 
purchase. 
Even 
on 

24/05/1992 the transaction was rolled over for another

O!li!? month up to 25 / 0 6/ 1992 and M / .s. V.B. Desai could n�t 

honour 
Contract 
dated 
29 / 04 / 1992. 
However, 
M/.s • 

V.B.De.sai 
by their 
letter 
dated 
13/05 / 1�92 
provided 

additional .securities and .share.s to ABFL and covered 

the .short fall which wa:s due to falling prices of ACC 

.shares. But this is :sub.sequent thought. Even a.s per the 

opi1tio11. of RBI it does c.ppaar that initially it was 

outright transaction in the beginning and made ready 

forward, 
.sub.sequent 
to 
make fund.s 
available 
to 
the 

Brokex: .s under the guise of ready forward transact ion. 

At the co.st of re" Detition it must be mentioned that the 

... 

ob.servation.s made by the then learned Special Judqe of 

this Court that the tran.sactioJ'l in question appears to 

be ready forward transaction made while discharging co-

accused Nos. 1, 3 a1td 4 are not approved or upheld by 

the A'Cex .. 

Court while considering the appeal 

CBI again:st the discharge order. 

20. 
In 
view 
of 
above 
discussion., 
I 

filed by 

have 
no 

he:sitction to hold 
. 
that the material on record i.e. the 

charge 
sheet, 
statements 
of 
the 
witne.sse:s 
and 
the 

documents accompanied with the :same are certainly prima 

facie indicate involvement of accused No:s. 2 and 5 in

the in.st�uit ca.se and .show that charqe against the said 

accused ha.s to 
be 
framed for 
the o£fences 
mentioned 

earlier. 

Hence, both these .applications are rejected.
