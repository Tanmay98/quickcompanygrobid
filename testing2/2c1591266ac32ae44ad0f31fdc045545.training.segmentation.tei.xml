			<body>call money could not be boITowed for any other purpose. Therefore, it must be <lb/>held that Rs.130 crore could not be borrowed as call money because the purp ose <lb/>of maintaining CRR was served by borrowing amount of Rs.SO crore as per <lb/>instructions given by the head office. Admi ttedly, amount of Rs.130 crore was not <lb/>required to maintain the CRR nor that amount was kept in Andhra Bank account <lb/>maintained with RBI for such purpose. <lb/>18. <lb/>From the record, it is proved that Canara Bank lent Rs. 100 crore to <lb/>Andhra Bank at 1 p.m. and further lent amount of Rs.30 crore to Andhra Bank by <lb/>2 p.m. Thus, by 2 p.m., Andhra Bank had received amount of Rs.130 crore as call <lb/>money and immediately that amount was paid to Grindlays Bank by pay order <lb/>without any document to show for what purpose that amount was paid by Andlira <lb/>Bank to Grindlays Bank. From this evidence, it is clearly established that amount <lb/>of Rs. 130 crore was borrowed by accused Nos. 1 and 2 from Canara Bank as caJI <lb/>money without any instructions from the head office and certainly not for the <lb/>purpose of maintainjng the CRR and thus there was violation of the directions not <lb/>only from Reserve Bank but a]so fr om the head office of Andhra Bank. The said <lb/>amount of Rs.130 crore having been borrowed from Canara Bank as call money <lb/>was advanced to Grindlays Bank clearly to meet the habil.ity of accused No.3 as <lb/>he had a commitment with GrindJ ays Bank to purchase the securities on that day, <lb/></body>

The amount \.Vas received back from Grindlays Bank on the nexc day and <lb/>also was pC1id back to Canara Bank with interest. In view of the facts noted above, <lb/>none of the Banks actually suffered any financial loss in the matter. However, fact <lb/>remains that the said transactions were carried out against the direccions given by <lb/>Reserve Bank of Jnclia under the statu tory provisions of RBI Act as well as against <lb/>the stand i ng instructions of the Head Office of Andhra Bank. There were <lb/>illega lities and irregularities in operations in violation of the Banking rules, <lb/>regula tions, directions and ethics, and thus the Banking system was subverted for <lb/>the he nefit of a private share/scock broker or deal er i.e. accused No.3.
