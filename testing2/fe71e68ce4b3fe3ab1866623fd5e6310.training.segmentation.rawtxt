have 

to

Defendants Nos.

The Plaintiff has 

restricted its claim to that rate of interest.

The lea rn ed Counsel appear i ng for the Def�1dants 

Nos.

though 

at 
the 
relevant time units of the Mutual Fund 
were 

nat 

included 
in 

the 

definition 
of 
the 

term 

"sec:urity", 
because the definition of the "security" 

is 
an 
inclusive 
definition and the 
units 
of 
the 

Mutual 
Funds 
which 
are 

available 
on 
the

and are freely tra nsferable are 

understood 

as security in general parlance. 
The units of mutual 

fund 

will 

be 
covered 
by 
the 

definition 
of 
the 

"security" 
found in the Securities Contract Act 

and 

therefore, as it was a Ready Forward Transact ion, the 

forward 
leg of that transaction would be illegal 
in 

view of the judgment of the S�preme Court in the ca$e 

of

whether the suit transaction

It is an admitted position 

that

in

admittedly for the first time 

with 

effect 

from

Therefore, on the date 
on 

which 
the contract was entered into and also on 
the 

date 

on 

which 
the units were appropriated 
by 
the 

Piaintiff, the units of Mutual Fund were not included 

in the definition of the term "security" found in the 

Securities Contract Act. 

12.

According to

of 

the 
units 

of Mutual Funds in the definition of

13. 
Now, 
perusal 
of the definition 
of

found in Section 2Ch) shows that it 
is 

an

the 

agreed

1 
& 2 h ad agreed to buy, despite the Defendants Nos. 

1 
& 2 comm itting brea<.:h of th eir promise to buy 
the 

un its. 
In my op inion , the Plaintiff was just ified in 

se lling 
the 
un its at the prevalent market 
rate 
to 

cover 
the ir 

risk. 

The situation is 
br ought 

about 

because 

of 
the default camm-i tted by the 
De. fend ants 

Nos. 

1 � 2 thems e l v es by not keeping their 
promise 

and 

buying 
back 

the un its at the agreed 
rate 
and 

therefore , 
they 
cannot now urge that the 
Plaintiff 

shou ld 
have 
continued 
to hold the uni ts 
till 

the 

Defendants Nos. 
1 & 2 are forced by the court to buy 

ba ck 
the 
un its. 
In my op inion, the 
Plaintiff 
"'as 

perfect ly 
justified 
in 
se ll in9/appropriatin9 
the 

units 
as they have done and claiming the 
difference 

in 
the price from the Defendants Nos. 
1 � 2. 
ln my 

opirlion, 
therefore , 
the Plaintiff is 
justified 

ir1 

claiming 
the amount to \& 1h ich the Plaintiff �1ould 
be 

ent itled under the contract between the parties after 

giving 
to 
the Defendants Nos. 
1 � 2 the credit 
of

ISSUE NO. H?i : 

<Whether the De •fendants are liable 

to

interest on the amounts duet if any, to 

the

Pe rusal of the letter dated 24-9-1992 shows that even 

accord ing 

to the Defendants the rate of interest was 

18X 

p.a. , 

which 
the 

P l a i nt i f f

accepted 

and 

therefore � the inte rest is payable at the rate of 18X
