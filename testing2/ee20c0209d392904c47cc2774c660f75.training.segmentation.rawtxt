It

that

certain 
shares 
by M/s.J. H.Mehta to GRAM and 
MAZDA. 

However, 

the bills of exchange were not 

accompanied 

by any contract notes which are required to be issued 

essentially by every registered broker in relation to 

the 
transaction 
of 
sale of the 
shares 
of 
listed 

companies. 
It 
is submitted that when the bills 
of 

exchange were brought by the accused no.7 and accused 

no.9 
to 
the Bank, they were already 
discounted 
by 

Bank 
of Patiala and Syndicate Bank and they had also 

issued 
cheques 
in 
favour 
of 

UCO 

Bank. 

The 

prosecution has established that the accused no.7 and 

acc�sed 
no.9 had come to the Bank on 24-3-1992 
with 

the 
cheques 
issued 
by Syndicate Bank and• 
Bank 

of 

Patiala 
in 
favour 
of UCC• Bank. 
According 
to 
the 

prosecution, 
this 
clearly establishes the 
criminal 

conspiracy, 
because 
it is nobody's case that 
there 

was 

any contact between Syndicate Bank and UCO 

Bank 

and 
between 

Bank of Patiala and UCO Bank 

that 
the 

bills 
discounted 
by 
Syndicate 
Bank 
and 
Bank 

of 

Patiala 1.<rould be re-discounted by UCO Ban k . 

The fact 

that 
even 
before the accounts were opened with 
the 

UCO 
Bank 

by M/s.J. H.Mehta, Mis. GRAM and Mazda, 

the 

Syndicate 
Bank and the Bank of Patiala knew that the 

bills would be re-discounted by the UCO Bank, clearly 

establishes 
the case of criminal conspiracy.

Mls. J.H.Mehta 
and 
were 
accepted 
by 
Mis.GRAM 
and 

Mazda, 
the 
payment 
on re-d iscounting by 
the 
Bank 

should 
have 
been 
made to 
Mls.J.H.Mehta, 
but 
the 

payment was made to Mis.GRAM and Mazda Indust ries and 

Leasing 
Ltd. 
If the bills of EHchange 
were 
drawn 

because 
M/s.J .H.Mehta 
had sold the shares to 
Mazda 

In dustries 
and Leasing Ltd and Mis.GRAM� it would be • 

Mls .J.H.Mehta wh ich would be entitled to the purchase 

price 
of 
the 
shares, and therefore, 

i t 
tAIOU 1 d . b e 

M/s .J.H.M�hta 
which would be entitled to the payment 

of 
the 
price 

of the shares 111hich it 

had 
sold 
to 

Mis . GRAM ad Mazda Industries and Leasing Ltd . 

But in 

the present case, the Bank made first cred it entry in 

the 
account of Ml s.J.H .Mehta and then the amount was 

transferred 
to Mis.GRAM and Mis. Mazda Industries and 

Leasing ltd , and thereafter, the cheques in favour of 

Anz 

Grindlays 
Bank favou ring Mazda 
Indust ries 
and 

Leas ing 
Ltd 
and 
Mis .Gram 
wera 
issued . 
Thus 

ul timately 
payment 
on the rediscounting of the 
two 

bills 
of 
exchange has gone to Gram and 
Mazada 
who 

were 
shown as purchasers of the shares from M/s.J.H. 

Mehta and were therefore to make payment of the p�ice 

f 

of 
the 
shares to Mis. 
J.H. 
Mehta. 
It is 
further 

submitted that eYen the cheques for re-payment to the 

Bank 
on 
27.4.1992 
were 
issued 
by 
Mis. Gram 
and 

Mis.Mazda

returned 
to 
the 
Bank 
by 
Mis.Gram 
and 
Mis. Mazda 

Industries 
and Leasing Ltd., it is not explained 
by 

anybody anywhere as to why the bi lls of exch ang� were 

drawn. 
M/ s.J.H.Mehta 
who 
had sold the 
shares 
to 

Mis.Gram 
and Mis. Mazda Indust ries and Leasing 
Ltd. , 

and 
who 
had accepted them so that 
Mls .J.H. 
Mehta 

could 
get price of shares sold by it to Mis.Gram and 

Mis. Mazda 
Industries and Leasing Ltd .? 
and how 
and 

when 
M/s.J.H.Mehta received the price of the 
shares 

sold by it from Mis.Mazda Industries and Leaving Ltd. 

and 
Mis. GRAM, the purchasers of the shares. 
If 
the 

price 
was 
rece ived 
in 
some 
other 
transac tio n 

independent 
of the bills of exchange, then according 

to 
the 
prosecution, 
it's case that 
the 
bills 
of 

exchange 
did 
not represent the bonaf ide 
commerc ial 

transaction, 
is established beyond any doubt. 
It is 

further 

submitted that the Bank's money was siphoned 

of 
by 
Harshad Mehta group wi thout there 
be ing 
any 

genu ine 
tr ansac tio n 
of sa le of shares, and when 
it 

came 

to repayment of the amount by Harshad Mehta 

to 

the 
Bank, the money was not paid by Harshad Mehta to 

the 
Bank but for that purpose shares were 
purchased 

by 

the UCO Bank. 

A resolut ion was all egedly 
passed 

on 
25.4.1992 for purchase of shares of Gujrat Ambuja 

Cement. 
It 
is further submi tted that those 
shares

A 

contract 
note 
for 
that 
purpose 
�as 
• issued 
by 

M/s.V.B.Desai 
on 27.4. 1992. 

The contract note 

does 

not 
disclose 
that 

the shares were 
purchased 

from 

M/s.J.H.Mehta. 

But the accused no.2 made endorsement 

on 

the contract note that towards purchase price 

of 

the 
shares, cheque should be issued in favour of ANZ 

Grind lays 
Bank 
for 
crediting 

the 

account 
of 

M/s.J.H.Mehta. 

The purchase of the shares, acco rdi ng 

to 

the prosecut i on , was made only to facilitate late 

Harshad 

Mehta to make repayment of the amount due to 

the 

Bank• on account of Bills of EKchange. 

to 
the 
prosecution, though the amount of 

According

was 
paid by the Bank not to 

M/s.J.H.Mehta

to His.GRAM and Mis.Mazda Indu str i es and L eas i ng

the return of the amount is also from Mis.Gram

only 

after funds were transferred to them by M/s.J.H.Mehta 

from the pa yment received by it in its account in ANZ

According to the prosecution, 
the 

fact that towards repayment of bi lls of e xch ange , two 

cheques 

were 

initially issued by M/s.J.H.Mehta 

who 

had 
no 

business to issue any cheques for

prosecu tion the amount of bills of exchange was first

instruction 
by Mis. 

J.H. 

Mehta it was 
transferred 

to 
the

of

therefore ,

have come from Mis.

The

issued 
two 
cheques 
towards 

repayment, 
but those cheques were taken back and 
in 

their

cheques of ,

over . 
This shows that M/s .

are 
al l

Accord ing 

to

prosecut io� , 

by

It

the fact that all decisions bein9 taken for 

entering 
into 
the 
business 
of

and 

re-discounting 
the 
bills 
of

In 
the 

dictation 
taken 

by P.W.22 on 2.5.1992, the date 

of 

the 
meeting 
when this decision was taken, 
was 
not

After 
the note was typed by P.W.22 
and 

handed 
over 
to 
accused 
no.2, 
the 
accused 
no.2 

inserted the date of the meeting as 14.3.1992. 
It is 

submitted 
that 
the 
document at "E:<hibit 
172" 
was 

pre-dated 
and fabricated just to show that what 
was 

being done by accused nos.1 and 2 was above the board 

and 
with the consent of the Board of Directors. 
It 

is 
submitted 
on behalf of the prosecution that 
the 

note 
in 
relation 
to 
the purchase 
of 
shares 
was 

dictated 
by 
accused no.2 to P.W.22 on 3.5.1992 
and 

the show was created that shares were being purchased 

by the UCO Bank because of the profit involved in the 

transaction, when as a matter of fact the shares were 

being 
purchased 
just 
to facilitate 
re-payment 
of 

amount of bi 11 of e:-<chan9e by late Harshad Mehta.

On

of 
Accused 
no.1, 
the 

f i r s t 

submission is that neither because of the transaction 

of 
bill 
discounting 
nor 
because 
of 
purchase 
of 

shares, 
the 
bank 
has 
suffered any 
loss,

both 
the transactions . 
It is further submi tted that 

it 
is 
alleged by the prosecut ion. that 
the 
accused 

no.1 
issued 
directions 
for 
entering 
into 
the 

transactions 
which 
were 
contrary 
to 
the 
banking 

regu l ations and un iversally accepted norms of banking 

pract ice . 
It is submitted by accused no .1 that even 

if 
the 
transaction 
is 
accepted 
to 
be 
against 

universally 
accepted norms of banking practice, then 

also 
punishment 
cannot be imposed by 
the 
criminal 

court 
on 
the 
accused 
because 
those 
universally 

accepted 
norms 
of 
banking practice 
are 
not 
well 

def ined 
and 
definite and at no point of 
time, 
the 

accused 
was told that if he commits breach of it, he 

wou ld 
be criminall y lia ble. 
It is further submitted 

that 
though the charge of conspiracy has been framed 

against 
the 
accused no.1, the ingredients, of 
t�at 

charge 
have not been proved by the prosecu tion . 
It 

is 
further submi tted that thou9h the transaction was 

. 

entered 
into 
without the sanc tion of the 
Board 
of 

Directors, 
the Board of Directors have not 
decl ined 

to 
grant 
sanct ion 
to the transaction

by 
the 

conduct 
of the Bank of holding the shares l•Jhic:h ..iere

by 
the 
Bank for the last so

further subm itted that so far as deliberations in the 

meeting dated 14 .2.1992 are concerned, the statements 

made 
by 
different 
witnesses viz. 
1.&1itness 
P.W.7, 

P.W.44 
and P.W.45 cont rad ict each other and there is 

no 
reliab le 
evidence 
on record 
to 
establish 
the 

del iberat ions 
of the meeting dated 14 . 3.1992. 
With 

reference 
to 
the diary ma intained by P.W.44, it 
is 

su bmi tted 
that the entry in the diary shows that the 

decision 
was not taken by the accused no .1. 
So 
far 

as the second le9 of conspir acy i.e. 
the purchase of 

shares 
of 
Gujrat Ambuja Cement, it 
was 
submit ted 

that 
it was a profitab l� transaction and the accused 

no.1 had no means to know that the sa le cons ideration 

of those shares wou ld be transf erred by M/s .J.H .Mehta 

to 
the 
account of Mis . Mazda Indu$tries and 
Leasing 

Ltd 
and Mis. Gram, to enab le them ta repay the amount 

of 
the bills discounting. 
It is subm itted that 
the 

transact ion of purchase of shares was pursuant to the 

dec is ion of Investment Committed dt .25.4 .1992 and had 

nothing to do with the bill discounting faci lity. 
It 

is 
f�rther 
submitted that the charge of 
consp iracy 

cannot 
be levelled aga inst accused no.1 because even 

assum ing 
that 
the decision of bill discounting 
was 

taken 
by 
accused 
no .1, it is not 
shown 
that 
the 

decision 
was in breach of any Law. 
It is

that

even 
though 
they were not backed by securities, 
it 

will 
not

It 
is 
also 

submitted 
that 
the deposition of P.W.44 and

the 
approvers cannot be relied on 
by 
the 

court 
without 
it

8. 

On 
behalf 
of accused no.2 it 
is 
submitted 

that 
in 
the 
present 
case 
there 
is 
no 
evidence 

whatsoever 
of any previous association or 
closeness 

of

to which 
char9es 
have

is 

subm itted 
that 
though 

the

discounted , 
were 
the transactions for

is 

not 
in 
rel ation to the purchase of shares , 
but 
in 

relat ion 
to discount ing of bills of exchange . 
It is 

submitted 
that the transaction in securities, in 

so 

far 
as 
the present case is concerned, 
is 
remot ely 

connected 
with 

the 

discoun ting 

of 
the 
bills

is 
further 
submitted 
that 
as 
the

prosecution has stated that they are not pressing the 

charge of ch eating against the accused No .4, the only 

accused 
No .4 

are 

charges 
Nos.13 & 15.

that the accused Nos. 

1, 2 � 8 comm itted the offence 

of 
criminal breach of trust by discoun ting the bills 

of exchange drawn by M/ s.J.H. 
Meh ta in breach of UCO 

Bank 

manuals of instructions and R01 Circulars.

is 
submitted 
that there is no ev idence 
brought 
on 

record 
by 
the 
prosecution to 
establ ish 
that

No .4 

had knowledge of UCO Banks

the

in 
the 
offence 
of 

dishonest ly

According 
to accused No .4 this is totally untenable. 

It is further submit ted that the charge of consp iracy 

cannot 
be

The

the

From 
this, 
it

that

agreement of two or more to do an unlawful 
act 
by un lato1ful means. 
So long as suc:h 
a 
design 
rests in intention on ly, it is not 
indictable. 
When 
two agree to carry 

it 

into 
effect , 
the very plot is an 
act 

in 

itself, 

and an act of each of the parties, 
promise 
against promise ,

contra 

actum, 

capab le of 
being 
enforced, 
if 
lawful , punishab le if for a criminal ob ject 
or for us� of criminal means ." 

343 . 

No 
doubt, 
in 
the 
case 

cf 

consp iracy there 
cannot be 
any 
direct 
evidence. 
The ingredients of offen�e 
are 
that 
there should be an agreement between 
persons who are alleged to consp ire and the 
said 
agreement should be 
for doing 

an 

illegal 
ac t or for doing by il legal 
means 

an 
act 
which its elf may not 
be 

illeg al. 
Therefore , 
the 
essence 
of 
cri m i nal 
consp iracy is an agreement tb do an illegal 

act 
and 

such an agreement can be p rov ed 

either 

by 
di rect 
evidence 
or 
by 
circumstantial 
evidence or by both, and it 

is 
a 
matter 

of 

common 

experience 
that 
direct 
evidence 
to prove consp iracy 
is 

rare ly 
availab le. 
Th erefore, 

the 
circumstances proved before, 
during 
and 
after 
the occurrence have to be considered 
to decide 
about 
the complicity o f 

the 
accLtsed . 

351 . 

As 

noted above, the 
essential 
ingredient 
of 
the 
offence of 
criminal 
consp iracy 
is 
the agreement to commit 
an 
offence. 
In a case where the agreement is 
for 
accomp lishment 
of 
an 
act wh ich by 
itself const itutes an offence, then in that 
event 
no overt 
act is necessary 
to be 
proved by the prosecution because in such a 
situation, 
criminal 
consp iracy 
is 
es t ab l i sh ed by proving such an agreement.

and the proof of any 
overt 

act 

by 

the accused or by any one of 
them 

would not be necessary. 
The provisions , in 

such 
a si tuation, do not require that each 

and 
every 
person 
who is a party 
to 
the 

conspiracy 
must do some overt act 
towards 

the fulf ilment of the ob ject of conspi�acy, 

the essential ingred ient being an agreement 

between 

the 

conspirators 
ta 
commit 
the 

crime 
and 
if 
these 

requ irements 

and 

ing red ients 
are establ ished, the act would

contained 
in Section 120-B.

It 
was 
noticed that 
Sect ions 

120-A and 120-B IPC have brought the law of 

conspiracy 
in 
In dia. 
in 
line 
with 
the 

En gl ish 
law 
by 
making 
an 
overt 
act 

inessential 

when 
the 
conspiracy 
is 
to 

commit 
any 
punishable offence. 
The 
most 

important 
in9red i ent of the offence 
be ing 

the 
agreement between two or more 
persons 

to 
do 
an 
illegal ac t. 
In a 
case 
where 

criminal 
conspiracy is alleged , the 
court 

must 
inquire 
whether the two persons 
are 

independen tly pursuing the same end or they 

have 
come together to pursue the 
un l awful 

ob ject. 
The 
former does not render 
them 

conspirators 
but the latter does. 
For the 

offence of conspiracy some kind of physical 

manifestation 
of agreement is required 
to 

be es�ab lish ed. 
The express agreement need 

not 
be 
proved . 
The evidence as 
to 
the 

transm ission 
of 
thoughts 
sharing 
the 

un la .. 1ful 
act 
is 
not 
suffic ient. 

A 

conspiracy 
is 
a continuing offence 
which 

continues to subsist till it is executed or 

rescinded 
or 
frustrated 
by 
choice 
of 

necessity. 
During 

its 

subsistence, 

vrhen ever 
any one of the conspi rators 
.does 

an 
act or series of ac ts, he would be held 

guilty 
under 

Section 120-B of the 

Indian 

Penal Code.

�oncerned , the Supreme Court in parag raphs 36 1, 362, 

363, 364 and 365 has observed thus : 

•361. 

To 

constitute 
an 
offence 
of 

cr iminal 
breach of trust, there must be an 
entrustment, there must be misappropriation 

or 
conversion to one 's own use, or use 
in 

violation 
of 
a legal direction or of 
any 

legal 
contract; 
and the 
misappropr iation 

or 

conversion 

or disposal must be with 
a 

dishon est 
intention. 
When a person al lows 
others 
to 
misappropriate 
the 
money 

entrusted 
to 
him, 
that 
amoun ts 
to 
a 
criminal 
breach 
of 
trust as 
def ined 
by 
Sect ion 

4@5 . 

The section is relatable 
to 
property 
in a posi tive part and a negat ive 

part . 
The 
positive 
part 
d�als 
with 
criminal • misappropriation or conversion of 

the property and the negative part consists 
of 
dishonest ly 
using or disposing of 
the 
property 
in violation of any direct ion and 

of 
la w 
or 
any 
contract 
touch ing 
the 

discharge of trust. 

362 . 
In 
Jaswantrai Manilal 
Akhaney 

V. 

State of Bombay it was held that if the 
Ma naging 
Di rector 
of the 
Bank 
entrusted 

with 
securities 
owned 
by 
the 
pledger 

disposes 
of 
th eir securi t ies against 
the 

st ipulated 
terms 
of the contract 
entered 

into by the part ies with an intent to cause 

wrongful 
loss to the pledger and 
wrongful 
gain 
to the Bank, there can be no question 
but 
that 
the 
Managing 
Di rector 
has 

necessar ily 
mens 
rea required by 
Section 

41? i5 . 

363. 

The 
term "entrustment " is 
not 

necessarily 
a 
term of law. 
It 
may 
have 

different 
impl ications 
in 
different 

contexts. 

In 

its 
most 
general 
significat ion all it imports is 'the handing 

over 
possession for some purpose which may 
not imply the . con ferring of any proprietary 
right at all. 

364 . 

When 
a pe rson 
misappropriates 
to 
his own use the property that does 
not 
be long 
to 
him, 
the 
misappropriation 
is

dishonest 
even 
thou9h 
there 
was 
an 
intention 
to 
restore 
it at 
some 
future 
point of time. 

365. 
As 
notes 
by 
this 
Jaikrishnadas Manohardas Desai v. 
Bomb ay 
to establish the charge of 
breach 
of 
trust , the prosecution 
ob liged 
to 
prove 
the 
prec ise 
conversion, 
misappropriation 
misapplicat ion 
by 
the 
accused 

Court 
in 
State of 
criminal 
is 
not 
mode 
of 
or 
of 
the 
property 
entrusted to him or over wh ich he 
has 
dominion . 
The princ ipal ingred ient of 
the 
offence 
being 
dishonest 
misappropriation 
or 
conversion wh ich 
may 
not ordinar ily be a matter of direct proof , 
entrustment 
of 
property 
and 
fai lure 
in 
breach 
of an ob ligation to account for the 
property 
entrusted if proved, may, in 
the 
light 
of other circumst ances, 
justifiably 
lead 
to 
an 
inference 
of 
dishonest 
misappropriat ion or conversion . 

In the present case, therefore , the prosecution will 

have 
to 
estab lish that the amount of 
Rs .50 
cores 

be longing 
to 

UCO 

Bank was gi ven to 
Grov1rnore

that Mazada and Growmore wer� not entitled to

but

they rec ei ved

The case .of the 

prosecution is that the discounting of the two bills

Therefore, 

firstly 
inqu iry has to be made whether the circular

In th is

reference can be made to the prov is ions 
of 

Sec tion

those directions issued by t h e Reserve Bank of India 

have 
statutory 
force

1988 

at Exh. 247 in so far as it is rel evant for the 

present purpose reads as under:-

"The 
usance 
promissory 
note should be 
backed 
by 

unencumbered 
usance 
Bills of Exchange of at 
least 

equal 
value 
not fa lle n due for payme nt,

endorsed

its 
favour, aris ing out 
of 
bonaf ide 

commercial 
or 
trade 
transactions 
on 
i.111 i ch 
the 

requ ired stamp duty has been paid." 

17. 

It is clear from the above cir cular that the 

UCO Bank could have discoun ted the bills of exchange 

arising 
out 
of 
bonafide 
comme rc ial 
or 
trade 

transactions . 
Therefore , 
now an inquiry is to 
be 

made 
whe ther 
the two bills of exchange "� ich 
were 

admittedly 

drawn by M/s. J.H.Mehta were in 

relation 

to 
a bonafide commercial or trade transactions . 
On 

the 
face, 

Mr.J .H. 

the two bills of exchange were drawn 
by 

M ehta , 
because M/ s.J.H. 

Me h t a , 

a 
stock 

broker 
had 
sold to Growmore and Mazada 
shares 
of 

some 
listed 

compan ies on 20th March, 1992. 

It 
is 

also an ad mi tted posit ion that these shares were not 

purchased 
by 
M/s.J.H. 
Mehta on stock exchange 
as 

broker 
for 
Growmore and Mazada. 
But these 
shares 

were 
owned 
by 
M/ s.J.H. 
Meh ta and 
were 
sold 
to 

Growmore and Mazada on principle to principle basi s .

At 
this 
juncture , 

in 
my 
op inion, 

it 

�•ould 
be 

appropriate to refer to the relat ionship beb1een the 

part ies 
invol ved 
in 
the 
transaction. 
M/s.J.H. 

Mehta is the propri etory concern of Mrs .Jyoti Mehta, 

who 
is 
widow of late Mr.Harshad Mehta. 
So far 
as 

Growmore 
is 
conc erned , 
it i s a company 
1.11 hich 
is 

fully control led by late Mr.Harshad Mehta group. 
So 

far 
as Mazada is concerned , accused No .6 who is 
an 

employee 
of Mazada has stated that Mr.Harshad Mehta 

who 

was 

the 

Ch airman of 
Growmore 
and 
Mr.Ashwin 

Mehta, accused No .4 who was the Chairman of Growmore 

decided 
to help the Mazada and therefore , 
Growmore 

group acquired 33Y. share of Mazada. 
late Mr.Harshad 

Mehta 
was the Dy .Chai rman of that company. 
It 
is, 

thus, 
clear 
that 
Mazada was 
also 
controlled 
by 

Harshad 

Mehta 

group. 
Accused 
Nos. 

4• 
f-1. 
5 

are 

brothers 

of 
late Mr.Harshad Mehta. 
Un 
behalf 
of 

M/s.J.H. 
Melita, bills were drat-in by accused 

No .5, 

who was given power of attorney by the proprietor of 

M/s.J.H. 
Mehta. 
Accused No .4 Ashwin Mehta was one 

of 
the acceptors of those bills of exchange. 
It is 

thus clear that the parties who were invol ved in the 

tr�nsactions 

were 
clos ely connected and it can 
be 

said to be an indicator that the transaction was not 

a 
genu ine trade transaction . 

which 

indicate 
the

Mehta on

and

so that M/ s.J.H. 
Mehta could

the

Mehta 
to 

princ iple 

the 
bills

Gro1.<1more and Mazada had

The result was 
that 
Mis. 

J .H. 
Mehta 
would have rece ived the price 
of 
• the 

shares 
after 
a 
month. 
Therefore, the 
Bank 
\> J ill 

enter 
•into the picture for discoun ting the bills of 

exchange, 
because 
M/s.J.H. 
Mehta who 
would 
have 

rece ived payment after a month wanted to receive the 

payment 
immediately. 
Obviously, there fore , it will 

be 
M/s.J.H. 
Mehta who wi ll approach the bank 
for 

discoun ting 
the 
bills 
of exchange. 
But 
in 
the 

present 
case , 
it 
is cl ear from 
the 
evidence 
on 

record 
that the bills of exchange were presented to 

the UCO bank not by M/s.J.H. 
Mehta, but by Growmore 

and 
Mazada. 
After the bills were discoun ted , 
the 

amount was credited first in the account of M/s.J.H.

and 
from 

that

of

bank, the payment 4,11as made 
to 
the 

drawer 
of 
the

Therefore ,• obviously, the bank should

that the facility v.1 as

was confusion as 
to 

been granted . 
Today 

granted to M.azda and 

to look as if it l•laS 

T1>10 more aspects, in my opin ion , are significant and 

are 
to be noted are that initially fa r rep a yment of 

the 
amount 
t1.a10 cheques 1> 1ere issued by 
Mis . 
J.H. 

Mehta, 
but 
those 
two 
cheques 
were 
returned 
to 

M/s.J.H. 
Me hta, 
when Growmore and 
Mazada 
handed 

over 
the 
cheques. 
The sale consideration 
of 
the 

shares 
purchased 
by 
U.C.O. 
Bank 
from 
M/s. J.H. 

Mehta was transferred to the account of Growmore and 

Mazda 
so 
that they cou l d make the repayment 

under 

the 
two 
bills of e xch ange . 
These facts which 
are 

admi tted, 
in my op in i on , clearly indicate that 
the 

bills 
of 
exchange do not re late to any genu ine 
or 

bonafide 
commercial 
or trade transaction . 
In 
my 

opinion , 
that 
subsequently 
the shares 
which 
are 

supposed 
to have been purchased on 20th March, 1992 

by 
Growmore 
and Mazada from Mis. 
J.H.

are 

sold 

by

knowledge of the circul ar issued by the RB I, because 

the

apart from the fact that as the circular 

ha s 

th� fo rc e of law, knowledge of circu lar can 

be 

attributed 
to 
accused Nos. 

4 & 5, t h e conduct of 

accused persons sh ows that they had knowledge of the

If they did

the know l edg e _ of the circular at Exh .247

a

have been subm i tted .

the circular at Exh.247 that the b an k was not in

In 
ord er that the bank can

transact i on

Mis. 

J.H. 

Mehta on one 
hand 
and 

Growmore 
and

on 

the other

In 

my 

op inion, 

one 
circumstance which cle arly 
i nd ica t es 

that 

the ent ire t�ansaction was we l l rehearsed , 
i s 

the 
circumstance 
that 

before 

the 
bills 
vie re 

red iscounted 
by 

UCO Bank they were 

disco�nted 
by 

Syndicate Bank and Bank of Patiala and w i thout there 

being any direct commun icat ion be � ween the Syn dic ate 

Bank 
and 

Bank of Pat i ala on the one hand 

and 
the 

. 

u.c.o. 
Bank on the o t he r hand, th e Bank of Pa tiala 

and 
Syndica t e

in

Bank , but also 

promissory 

notes 

which were to be e�ecuted by the u.c.o. 

Bank 

in favour of Synd icate Bank and Bank of Pat iala. 

It 

is thus clear that the two bills of exchange did not

to 
any 
bonafide 

t r ad e 
or 
comm e rc i al 

transaction 
and 
therefore , the U.C.O.

He 

identified 

that

He stated that on

he 

had taken dictation from th e accused No .2 in the

He further 

states that accused No .2 had dict ated a note to him,

that 

in

after 

c ons u lt ing

Th is meeting, apart 

from accused No .1 was attended by P.W.44 and P.W.45. 

P.W.44

are 
admittedly 
the 

officers 

subordinate 
to accused Nos. 
1 & 2 and the decision 

was 

taken by accused No .1 after consulting 

accus ed 

No .2. 

This 
note 
shows 

discounting 
was 
taken 
on 

that 

this 

dec ision 
of 

14-3-1992 
when 
the 

transaction 
underlying 
the two bills 
of 
exchange 

drawn 

by 
M/s. J.H. 

Mehta 

is 
d�ted 

20-3-1992. 

Perusal of the note shows that even the• exact amount 

of 

bills 

of exchange was also known 

on 

14 -3-1 992 

when 

the 
transaction wh ich is supposed to 
be 
the 

underlying 
transaction had not yet taken pla ce. 

In 

my 

opinion, this clearly establishes the aspect 

of 

consp i racy. 
It also estab lishes that the unde rlying 

transaction 

of 

alleged 

purchase and sale 
of 
the

shares 
was 
not a bonaf ide comme rcial 
transaction. 

As per the depos ition of P.W.22, a note was dictated 

by 
accused No .2, accused No .2 has signed this note. 

Therefore , 
he 
accepts 
that 
accused 
No .l 
had 

ascertained 
his views in relation to discount ing of 

two 
bills 
of exchange . 
The refore , it 
is 
obvi ous 

that 
he knew ful l details of the transact ion. 
What 

is 
significant 
to note is that when the 
bi lls 
of 

eKchange 
were actually presen ted , P.W.44 
contacted 

the 
accused 
No .2 and that time also 
accused 
No.2 

told 
him that he has to go through the transact ion, 

because that is the desire•of the accused No .1. 

21. 

The transaction in relation to which the two 

bills 

Marc:h , 1992. 

drawn 
are 
dated 

20th 

Growmore and Mazda opened the accounts 

with the Nariman Point Branch of the U.C.O. 
Bank on 

the 
same 
date on wh ich the bills of exchange

it

The Supreme Court in its judgment 

in 

the case of Ram Narayan Popli, referred to above 

has 

held 

that 

when 
a 
person 
al lows 
others 
to 

misappropr iate 
the 
money 
entrusted to 
him, 
that 

amount 
to 

criminal breach of trust as 

defin ed 
by 

Sect io n 
405 • 
If a pe rson who is entrusted with 
a 

property, 
disposes of that property in violation of 

.any 
la w 
wh ich prescrib in the mode in 
which 
such 

property 
is 
to 
be disposed of , 
then 
offence 
of 

criminal 
breach 
of trust is consti tuted. 

In 

the 

present

when 
the officers of the 
UCO 
Bank 

permitted 

the money belonging to the UCO Bank to be 

taken 

a1>1ay 

on 24-3-1992, in breach of the 

bin din g 

direction issued by the RBI� the offence of criminal 

breach

It 
cannot be said 
that 
the 
law 

permits' money 
belong ing 
to the 
public 
wh ich 
is 

entrusted to these off icers is permitted to be taken 

away 
in "such a manner. 
Money to the tune of 
Rs.5� 

crores 
belonging to the UCO Bank was allowed to 
be 

taken away wi thout there being any security taken by 

the 
Bank. 
A large part of the amount was given 
_ 
to 

Mazada, 
which party was denied the facility in 
the 

recent 
past 
by 
the 
same 
Bank. 
The 
1 ine 
of 

cross-examinat ion 
adopted 
by 
the 
accused 
pe rson 

shows that the money was allowed to be taken wi thout 

secur ity 
because 
of the credi t-worth iness of 
late 

Mr.Harshad 
Mehta 
at 
that time. 
Even if 
for 
the 

moment it is assumed that at that time Harshad Mehta 

was credi t-worthy , even then the transaction cannot 

be 
said to be accep table transaction , because in so 

far 
as 
the civil lia bility is 
concerned , 
Harshad 

Mehta was no where in picture. 
The bills were drawn 

by 
M/s.J.H.

Mr�Harshad Mehta. 
So far •as documentary evidence is 

concerned, 
e: <cept 
for 
veri fying 
the 
spec ific 

si gnature 
of a pe r�ons who were op ening account 
on 

behalf 
of 
Mazada, 
Growmore and 
M/s. J.H. 

Harshad 
Meh ta 
was nowhere in the picture . 

Mehta, 

It 
is 

clear 
from 
the ev idence on record that the day 
on 

wh ich the money was paid ou t, the Bank officers were 

not 
sure whether they are discoun ting the bills 
of 

exchange 
or 
they 
are rediscounting the 
bills 
of 

exchange 
and 
at whose instance they are doing 
it, 

i.1hether 
they 
are doing it at the instance 
of 
M/s 

J • H. 
Mehta or they are doing it at the instance of 

Mazada or Growmore . 
If it is assumed that the bills 

were 
discounted 
by 
the 
UCO Bank 
and 
they 
were 

redi scounted 
by Synd icate Bank and Bank of Pat iala, 

then 
cheques should have been issued by UCO Bank in 

favour 
of Synd icate Bank and Bank of Patiala. 
But 

here 
no cheque was issued by UCO Bank in favour 
of 

Synd icate 
Bank 
and Bank of Patiala. 
ln any 
case, 

for 
the purpose of discoun ting and red iscounting of 

the bills of exchange be�ween two banks there has to 

be 
arrangement 
arri ved at between the UCO bank 
on 

the 
one hand and Syndicate Bank and Bank of Patiala 

on the other hand . 
But no such arrangement was ever 

reached between the two banks. 
In law there can not 

be a transaction of discoun ting and redis.counting of 

•

a 
bill of exchange between two banks wi thout 
there 

being 
an 
agreement reached between the 
two 
banks 

which 
are 
involved . 
It, thus, appears 
that 
the 

money 
belonging 
to 

UCO Bank was permitted 

to 
be 

taken 

away 
in a transac tio n wh ich is not known 
to 

any l a�i . 
As off icers of the Bank who were entrusted 

with 
the funds of the bank wh ich are public 
funds, 

the 
law requires that they should not part with the 

funds 
unl ess 
the interest of the bank is 
secured. 

In 

the 
present 
case, 
as obse rved 
abov e, 
by 
no 

stretch 

of imag ination it can be said that the 

la w 

regulating the disposal of the funds of the Bank was 

fol lowed . in 
dispos ing of the funds and 
therefore, 

the 
of fence 
of 
criminil 
breach 
of 
trust 
stood 

committed 
.by 
the 
officers 
of 
the 

UCO 

bank 
on 

24-3-1992 
itself. 
In as much as, the funds of 
the 

UCO 

Bank 
were permi tted to be taken away and 
were

That 

circumstance at best may become rel evant at the time 

of 
considering 
the. question 
of 
awarding 
t h e 

sen tence, 
but that cannot be the ground for proving 

innoc ence of the accused pe rson . 

So far as accused Nos . 
4 � 5 are concerned, 

they 
are 

invol ved 

in 
drawing 
of 
the 
bills 
of 

exchange 
and the ir acceptance . 
It is already fo und 

abov e 
that 
there 
was 
no 
genuine 
ial 

transaction underlying the two bills of exchange and 

sti ll 
the 
accused 
Nos. 

4 � 5 

were 
invol ved 
in 

drawing 
and 
acceptance of the bi1ls 
of 
exchange , 

accused no .4 was also invol ved in the opening of the 

account 
of Growmore at the Nariman Point Branch 
of 

the 

U.C.O. 

Bank, in my op in ion, therefore, 
the ir 

parti�ipat ion in the conspiracy is well estab lished.

Two 
bills were admi ttedly signed by accused 

No.5 
as const ituted at torney of Mrs.Jy oti Mehta, 
a 

prop rietor of M/s.J.H. 
Mehta. 
Bill of exchange has 

been 
accepted on behal f of Mazada by accused

th ere 
is 
no 
9enuine transaction of 
sale 
of 
any 

shares 
by Mis . 
J.H. 
Meh ta to Mazada or 
Growmore, 

still 
he 
signed 
the bills of 
exchange. 
In 
the 

simi lar 
way 
accused 
No .4 
knew 
fully 
we ll 
that 

Growmore 
has 
not 
purchased any 
shares 
from 
Ms. 

Jyoti 
Mehta, but he accepted the bill of 
exchang e. 

The 
account opening form of Growmore was signed 

by 

accused 
no.4 

M/s.J.H .Meht a 

and o. 
The account opening 
form 
of 

is 
also 
signed 
by 
accused 
no.5. 

Accused 
no .5 
also 
s19ned 
letter 
sent 
to 
the 

Grindlays 
Bank dated 27 .4.1992 for transfer of 
the 

amounts 
from 
the account of M/s.J.H.Mehta 
to 
the 

account 
of 
Growmore and Mazda so that 
they 
could 

make 
repayment 
1.m der the bi 11 s of' e:<change . 
The 

part ic ipat ion 
of 
the 
accused Nos. 
4 & 5 
in 
the 

conspiracy, 
in 
my 
op inion, 
is 
thus 
established 

beyond any reasonab le doub t. 
So far as accused Nos. 

6, 7 & 9 are conc erned, they are employees of Mazada 

and 
Growm6re . 
It is estab lished on record that 
it 

is 
accused 
Nos. 
7 & 91 who came to UCO Bank 
with 

the bills of exchange drawn by Mis. 
J.H. 
Mehta and 

accepted by Growmore and Mazada. 
They had with them 

two 
cheques 
issued 
in 
favour 
of 

UCO 

Bank 
by 

Synd icate Bank and Bank of Pat iala. 
As emp loyees of 

Growmore 
and 
Mazada, 
they knew that there 
is 
no 

genu ine 
transaction of sale and purchase of 
shares

between 
the 
parties . 
They came with 
the 
cheques 

issued 
by 
Synd icate 
Bank and Bank of 
Pati ala 
in 

favour 
of 
UCO 
Bank, 
even 
before 
the 

UCO 

bank 

discounted 
the 
bills. 
It 
is 
accused 
no.7 
who 

accepted 

the 
bill of exchange on behalf of 

Mazda. 

He also signed the form for opening the account with 

the 
Nariman 
Point Branch. 
Therefore, it is 
cl ear 

that 
the accused Nos. 
7 & 9 had ful l knowledge 

of 

the transaction and they acted in furtherance of the 

transaction 
and therefore , it is obvious that 
they 

were 
parties to the consp irac y. 
Similarly ro le 
of 

accused 
No .6 was of open ing bank account of 
Ma�ada 

in 
the UCO Ban k, Nariman Point Branch for 
carrying 

out 
the transaction. 
It is clear that accused Nos. 

6, 
7 

& 9 had knowledge of the ful l facts and 
they 

have played certain ro le in hatching and earring out 

the 
consp irac y. 
It is tru� that they are employees 

of 
Mazada 
and Growmore , wh ich are companies 
ftilly 

controlled by Harshad Meh ta group . 

25 . 

So 
far as accused No .a i� concerned , though 

it 
is clear that he knew all the facts constitut ing 

the 
consp iracy, 
it 
is 
estab lis hed 
that 
he 
was 

present 
in 
the 
meet ing h e l d 
on 

14-3-1992. 

His 

presence with accused Nos. 
7 � 9 for the purpose of 

opening 
of 
the account is also 
established . 
The

-63 -

fact 
that 
he 
collected 
the 
shares 
wh ich 
were 

purchased 
by the UCO Bank is also establish ed. 
But 

it appears that he had no authority to direct P.W.44 

Mr.Prabhu 
to 
90 
through 
the 
traQsaction. 
The 

SLtp reme 
Court , 
however, 
has in the 
case 
of 
Ram 

Narayan 
Popli, referred to above, held that essence 

of 
criminal 
consp iracy 
is an agreement to 
do 
an 

ille gal 
act 
and 
that essence in 
the 
of fence 
of 

criminal 
consp iracy 
is an agreement to 
commit 
an 

offence . 
The ev idence that is on record proves that 

the 
accused 
No .8 was a party to the 
agreement 
to 

syphon 
of 
the 
amount 
and 
he 
has 
actually 

pa rtic ipated in the comp let ion of the transaction. 

26 . 
Not•1 , 
so 
far 
as the subm ission 
that 
this 

court 
does 
not 
have the jurisd iction to 
try 
the 

accused 
persons because the underlying 
transaction 

is 
not 
a transaction in �ecurit ies 
is 
concerned, 

perusal 
of 
the 
provisions 
of Sect ion 
7 
of 
the 

Spec ial 
Court 
Act 
shows that any 
prosecution 
in 

respect 
of 
any offence re ferred to in 
sub-sect ion 

<2) 
of Sect ion 3 sh all be inst ituted in this Court. 

Perusal 
of sub-section (2) of Sect ion 3 shows 
that 

the 
relevant 
phrase 
is 
"Offence 
relating 
to 

transaction 
in 
securities" . 
In th e

UCO 
Ban k 
was un lawfu l discoun ting of two bills 
of 

e :< chang e. 
Both the bills of exchange were shown to 

have 
been 
issued 
in relat ion 
to 
transaction 
in 

shares 
between 
Mis. 

J.H. 
Mehta 
and 
Growmore 

Industries and Mazada. 
For the purpose of arranging 

repayment of the amount again M/s.J.H.Meh ta's shares 

were purchased by UCO Bank through M/s.V.B. 
Des a i & 

Co . 
Thus, 
the 
of fence 
of breach 
of 
trust 

and 

consp iracy 
to commit the of fence of breach of trust 

is 
definitely 
related 
to 
the 
transactions 

in 

secur ities 
and therefore, in my op inion, this court 

t&Ji 11 

have 
t h e 
jurisdiction 

to 

try 
the 
accused 

persons for the offences alleged against them . 

27 . 

If 
one looks at th e aspect of repayment 
of 

the •a mount , which was advanced by the bank 
against 

the 
two 
bills of exchange. 
It is found 
that 

the 

amount 
was 

to 
be 
paid 
on 
24th 
April, 
1992. 

Initially 
two 
cheques 
were 
issued 
by 

M/s.J.H. 

Mehta, but those cheques were not sent for clearing. 

Really speaking as M/s.J.H. 
Mehta was the drawer of 

t he 
bills 
of 
exchange, it was 

the 

liab ility 
of 

M/s.J.H. 

Meh ta to repay the amoun t. 
Therefore , the 

moment cheques were received from Mis. 

J.H. 

Mehta, 

they being high v a lue cheques, should have been sent 

for 
clearance immed iately. 
But that was not 
done.

I nst e ad , 

the 

UCO Bank borrowed cal l money to 

make 

the 

payment to Synd icate Bank and Bank of 
Pat iala. 

As the amo unt was not paid on due date, normally the 

constituent 
who 
ha� 
committed default 
in 

mak ing 

repayment on due date shou ld have been charged penal

recov ered . 

The cheques that were issued by M/s.J.H.

that 

M/s.J.H.

persons 
that 
M/s.J.H. 
Mehta sold the 
shares 
of 

Gu jarat Am buja at a rate lower than the market rate. 

Th is 

cannot be believed , because if M/s. J.H. 
Mehta 

was 
in possession of the shares of Gujarat 

Ambuja, 

wh ich 

is a list ed company, in stead of se lling 

thg 

share 
at 

a lower rate to the UCO Ban k , the 

shares 

could 

have 
been sold on the Stock Exchange a t 

the 

market 
rate and the UCO Bank could have been 
paid . 

The 
ent ire 
transaction appears to have 
been 
gone 

through 
because 
of 
a 
deal-struck 
between 
the 

deceased 
Harshad 
Mehta and his group 

and 
ac cus ed 

No .1. 

The ro le played by accused No .2 in the entire 

c on t rov ersy 

is 
sign ificant. 
The 

dec ision 
to 

discount 

the two bills of exchan9e at Nariman Point 

Branch 
was 
taken by accused No .1 after 
consult ing 

the 
accused No .2. 
It is clear from the 
deposit ion 

of 

t h e P.w•.44 that accused No .2 had ful l details of 

the 
transac tion, 

otherwise he would not have 

told 

P.W.44 

to 
go 
throu9h the transaction 
at

As

shows that he knew that 
the 
shares 

were being purchased from M/s.J .H. 
Mehta though the 

contract 
note did not mention the name of 
M/s .J.H.

28. 
To sum up , so far as accused No.1 is conc erned � 

P.W. 1 
Ranjitkumar 
Mukherjee in his deposit ion 
has 

clearly 
stated 
that 

on 24th March, 

1992 
he 
(l.Jas 

informed by P.W.4 4 Prabhu that two bills of exchange 

were 
to be discoun ted as per the direct ions of 
the 

Accused No .1/ Ch airman and Manag ing Director . 
P.W.1 

has 

further 

stated 
that on instruction 
from 
the 

P.W.44 
he 
had sent a letter dated 7th Ap ri l, 
1992 

alon9 
with 
the 
statement to the 
Head 
Office 
at 

Calcutta . 
That 
letter is at Exh .57. 
Perusa l 
of 

that letter shows that the sub ject of that letter is 

"a dvances 
released as per the instruct ion of 

CMD". 

It 
is clearly stated that with the letter a list is 

enc losed 
sho1•1ing 
that 
the 
advances 
released 
on 

ad-hoc basis as per the instruc tions of Chai rman and 

Man aging 
Director . 
It is further stated th�t these 

instructions 

were given during the last 2-3 

visits 

to 
Bomb ay. 
Perusal of the statemen t 
accompanying 

the 
letter at Exh .57 shows that at serial Nos . 
10 

and 
11, 
two bills of exchange drawn by His . 
J.H.

for

he 
wou ld have definitely protested , 
but 

there 

is 
no 

protest . 
P. W.6 
Raghunath 
Kash inath 

Joglekar, 
the 

driver of the vehicle which 

brought 

the 

accused No .1 from the Ai rport on 13-3-1992 

has 

clearly 

st�ted 
that 

he took the accused 
No .1 
to 

Maker 

Chamber No .5, where the office of the Harshad 

Mehta 
was 
situated . 

A book entry has 

also 
been 

shown the vehicle was taken on lS-3-1992 to the 

Maker Chamber No .5. 
P.W.7 Radhakrishna Laxman Joshi 

supports 

the version of P.W.6 Nr. Raghunath Jog lekar 

about 

taking the veh icle on ins truct i ons of accused 

No .1 
to the bui lding wh ere the late Harshad Mehta's 

office 
was 
situated . 
He also confirms 
that 
the 

accused No .1 asked the driver to take the Yehicle to 

late 
Harshad 

Mehta's off ice. 

P.W.7 also 
con firms 

the 

version of the meeting held on 14-3-1992 

given 

by 
P.W.44 
and 
P.W.45. 

It 

is 

c l ear 
from 
the 

depos ition 

of 

P.W .7 
that it is accused 
No. 1 
who 

entered 

i n t o 

consp iracy 
with 
accused 
No.8 

Raman athan , 
P.W.44 

and P.W.45 to discount the 

two 

bills of exchange illegal ly for the benefits of late 

Mr.Harshad 
Mehta. 

The test imony of two 

approvers 

P.W.44 and P.W.45 is fully supp orted by P.W.7, in so 

far as deliberat ion in the meeting held on 14-3-1992 

is

accused No .1 and late Mr . Harshad Meh ta is clear from 

the statement of accused No .5 when he states that on 

1-5-1992 

he 
accomp an ied 
th e 

accused No .8 

for 

col l ect ing the shares they met late Mr.Harshad Mehta 

and 

Mr.Harshad M eh t a told him that he would talk to 

the 

CMD. 

P.W.7 also disc loses that 
accused 

No .8 

told 

him 
that accused No .1 had informed 

that 
the 

shares 

of Gujarat Ambu ja were to col lected . 

As 

observed 
abov e, 

the m i n ut e s of the 

meet ing 

dated 

14-3-1992 

leaves one in no manner of doubt that not 

on ly 
the 

accused No .1 was the consp irator , but 

he 

was 

the prime conspirator and that the huge 

amount 

b elong i ng 

to the bank was given to Mr .Harshad Mehta 

and his group in b r eac h of law. 

Clearly, therefore , 

the 

accused No . 1 is gu ilty of both the offences 

he 

is 
charged 
with, 

name ly c r i m inal 

consp iracy 

and 

cr im i na l breach at trust. 

29. 

So 
far 
as accused No .2 is 
conc erned , 

P.W.7 

Radhak rishna 

Joshi 
has clearly sta ted that 
du r i ng 

the course of the meet ing on 14-3-1992, accused No .1 

talked 
on telephone with accused No .2 and 

informed 

the 
accused 

transac tion . 

No .2 
about 
the 
bill 

discount ing 

Minutes of the meet in9 dated 14-3-1 992

B an k 

were 
il legally 

handed 

over to the 
H arshad 
Mehta 

group . 
Thus, the accused No .2 is gu ilty of both the 

offences as charged namely a crimin�l consp iracy and 

criminal breach of trus t. 

30. 
So 

far as accused No .4 is concerned , 
by 
the 

reso lut ion 

dated 
14th 

March , •1992 passed 
by 
the 

Board of Directors of the Growmo re, th e accused No.4 

alongwith 

Mr.Harshad Meh ta who was the Chairm an and 

accused 

No.5 Sudh ir Mehta who was the Director 

was 

authorised 

to seek bill d iscoun t i n g facility to the 

limit 

of 

Rs . S!?i 

c:rores 

from the 

UCO 
Bank. 
The 

appl ication 
fer opening the account of Growmore 

at 

the 
Nariman 
Point Branch is signed by the 
accused 

No .4. 
On 

behalf of Growmore the bill of 

exchange 

has 

been accepted by the accused No .4. 

The 

letter 

at 
Euh .36 

dated 24th March , 1992 addressed to 
the 

UCO 

Bank, 
Nariman 
Point 

Branch 

by 
Growmore 

un dertaking to repay the amount on the due date i.e. 

24th Ap ri l, 1992 is also signed by the accused No.4. 

It is i n te r est ing to note here that it is clear from 

the 

letter 

at 

Exh .35 

itse lf that 

the 
bill 
was 

discounted by the Bank was drawn by M/ s.J .H. 

Mehta.

It 
is 
cl ear 
from the letter 
dated 
24-3-1992 
at 

Exh .33, 
that request for discoun ting the two 
bills 

was 
made by M/s.J.H. 
Mehta, and therefore , as 
the 

bill 
was discounted by the Bank as per the 
request 

of 
M/s. J.H. 

Mehta, there was no liab ility on 

the 

acceptor 
of 
the 
bill 
of 
exchange 
to 
make 
the 

repayment 
of 
the amount to the bank. 
But 
in 
the 

letter 
at 
Exh .36, Growmore undertakes to make 
the 

payment 
of the bills of exchange and the bills were 

being 
discounted 
by 
the bank at 
the 
request 
of 

M/ s.J .H. 

Mehta and the Bank was also m ak i ng payment 

to 
M/ s.J.H. 
Mehta. 
Legally the Bank was concerned 

on ly with M/s.J.H. 
Mehta. 
But the letter at Exh .36 

signed 
by 
the 
accused 
No .4 
clearly 
indicates 

involvement 
of 
the 
accused No .4 in 
the 
criminal 

consp iracy. 

The accused No .4 is, therefore , clearly 

gu ilty 
of 
the 
criminal consp iracy 
to 
c omm it 
an 

offence 
by 
accused Nos. 
1, 2 & 8 of the 
criminal 

breach of trust as charged . 

31. 
So far as accused No .5 is concerned , it is 
he 

who has signed the bills of exchange as the power of 

attorney 

of the proprietor of M/ s.J.H. 

Mehta. 
It 

is 
he 
who 
has si9ned the forms 

for 
opening 

the 

account 
with 

the Nariman Point Branch of 

the 

UCO 

Bank. 

It is he, i.1ho has g i v e n the •letter dated 24th

March , 

1992 Exh .33 requesting th e Bank to 
discount 

the 

two bills of exchange . 
It is pe rt inen t to note 

here 
that the accused No .5 was hold ing the Power of 

Attorney from the prop ri etor of M/s.J.H. 
Mehta. 

He 

was 
also 
one 
of 
the 
authorised 
si gnatories 
of 

Growmore . 
As 
obserYed 
above, 
the 
r� lat ionship 

between 

the 

p art i es , 
both 
actual 
and 
business, 

clearly 
estab l i sh es 

criminal consp iracy to 
commit 

the 
offence 
of 

criminal 

b r e ach 
of 

trust . 

The 

accused 

No .5 is, therefore , gu ilty of that 

offence 

as charged. 

32. 
So far as accus ed No .6 is con cern e d , as per the 
.. , 
deposition 
of 

P. $.34, 

the accus ed 

No .6 

was 
the 

executive officer ;f Maz ad a . 

P.W.26 has stated t h a t 

there 
were 

only 
seven 

employees 
t•,i"t:h -Mazada 

inc luding 

the 
accused 

No .6. 
As per 
the 

P.W.34; 

accused 
No .6 

was 

the Ch ief Execut ive 
of 
Mazada. 

P.W.34 has also stated in his deposition that before 

accused 

No .6 joined the Mazada he was working 

with 

Growmore 
control led by late M r.H arshad Meh ta. 

P.W. 

34 
also 
discloses 
that 

the 

resolution 
dated 

18-3-1992 

was 

passed by the Board of Di rectors • of 

Mazada 

authorising 

the 

acc us ed No .6 to 
open 
the 

account with UCO Banks Nariman Point branch and seek 

bill 
discourit ing 
faci lity 
to the limit 
of 
Rs.58

crores . 
It is cl ear from th e deposition of 
P.W.34 

that 
the 
accused No .6 was clearly invol ved in 
the 

criminal 
consp iracy so that accused Nos. 

1, 2 & 
8 

wou ld 
commit 
the 
offence of 
criminal 
breach 
of 

t rust . 
The 
accused 
No .6 is thus 
gui lty 
of 
the 

offence of criminal conspiracy as charg ed. 

•so far as accused Nos. 

7 and 9 are concerned, 

accused 
No .7 
was 
the off icer of 
Mazada 
and 
the 

accused 
No.9 
was the officer ot Growmore . 
It 
is 

they , 
who 
had taken two bills of exchange 
to 
the 

Nariman 
Point Branch . 
lhey had gone there with two 

cheques 
issued 
by the Syndicate bank and 
Bank 
of 

Patiala, as also draft promissory notes to be signed 

by 

UCO 

Bank in favour of these two banks. 
It 
is 

accused 
No.7 who has signed the letter 
undertak ing • 

to 
repay 
the 

amount to UCO bank. 

It 
is 
accused 

No .7, 
who 
had 
given 
the lett�r 
at 
Exh . 105 
for 

issuing 
the cheque in favour of Grindlays Bank 
for 

transfer 
of 
proceeds 
of 
the 
bill 
discount ing 

facil ity. 
The events discussed above shows that the 

accused 
No .7 
Sunil 
S amtan i 
was 
th e 
Asst .V ice 

President 
of the Mazada. 
Perusal of the deposition 

of 
P.W.44 shows that all steps in the Nariman Point 

Branch 
were 
taken at the instance of 
tha 
accused 

Nos . 

7 & 9. 

It is also clear from the ev idence on

-75 -

record 
that 
i t is accused No .9 who had 
approached 

the 
Synd icate 
Bank 
for discounting two 
bills 
of 

exchange. 
When really sp eak ing it is the UCO 
Bank 

which 
should have approached the Synd icate Bank and 

Bank 
of Patiala. 
Evidence on record leaves one 
in 

no manner of doubt about involvement of ac cused Nos. 

7 & 9 in the criminal consp iracy so as to enab le the 

accused 

Nos. 

1, 
2 & 8 to commit the 

offence 
of 

criminal 
breach 
of 
trust. 
Accused Nos. 

7 
� 

9, 

therefore, 
are 
gui lty of the offenc e 
of 
criminal 

consp iracy as charged. 

34. 
So 
far 
as accused No .8 is concerned, 
it 
is 

clear 
from 
the 
deposition of P.W.1 
that 
he 
was 

pr�sent 
in 
the 
meet ing 
dated 

14-3-1992 

of 
the 

off icers of the UCO bank . 

P.W.1 also discloses that 

he 

rec � ived a telephone cal l from the accused No .8, 

who 

was the Divisional Man ag e r , that three 

cheques 

towards 
repayment 
of the amount would be 
brought . 

P.W. 
7 

also confirms presence of accused No.8 
at 

t h e 

mee ting dated 14-3-1992. 

P.W.7 also 
discloses 

that 
he 
rece ived 
a 
te l ephone 
on 

1-5-1992 

from 

accused 
No .1 
asking him to accompany 
the 
accused 

No .8 to the of fice of V.M. 
Desai for co llect ing the 

shares of Gu jarat Ambu ja. 
P.W.7 also discloses that 

on 
2-5-1992 the accused No .8 had gone to the 
Hamam

Street 
Branch fcrr colle cting the shares . 
Evidence 

on 
recoT"" d 
sho1>1s that it t.11 as the accused 
No . 8 
1. 11ho 

intT""" oduced on 18-3-1992 the accused Nos . 
7 and 9 to 

the 

officers of the UCO Ba nk. 

From the evidence on 

record it is cl•ar that the accused No.8 was clearly 

part 
of 
the 
consp iracy and he also 
assisted 
the 

players 

who were involved in performing the ir pa�t. 

Ho111e ver, 
it 
appears . that he being 
the 
Sc ale 
IV 

officer, 
he 
was 
not in a po sit ion to 
direct 
t he 

officer invol ved to do anyth ing. 
But as observed by 

the 
Supreme Court , the essen tial ingredients of the 

offence 
of 
criminal conspiracy is an agreement 
to 

comm it 
the 
offence 
and 
that 
overt 

act 

is 
not 

essen tial 

when 

the 
conspiracy is 

to 
commit 

any 

offence 

punishable as laid down by Section 120-B of 

the Indian Penal Code. 
As accused No .8 was not in a 

position 
really 
to issue direction, it 
cannot 
be 

said 
that 

he is gu ilty of t h e offence of 

criminal 

breach 

of 
trust , but he is clearly gui lty 

of 
the 

offence of criminal conspiracy as charged . 

35 . 

In 
the result, thus , accused Nos. 

1 � 2 

are 

conv icted 
of 

the 
offence of 
criminal 
conspiracy 

punishable 
under Sect ion 120-B of the Indian 
Penal 

Code 
and

Code 
and 
Accused 
Nos .4 to 9 are convicted 
of 
an 

offence punishable under Section 120-B of the lndian 

Penal Code-. 

36. 
I 
have heard the le arned Counsel for al l 
the 

accused 
persons 
on the question of sentence . 

37. 

The learned Co unsel appearing for the 
accused 

No .1 relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in 

the 
case 

of Ram Narayan Popl i vis. 
Ct3I , (20e;3> 
3 

sec 
641 , s.ubmi tted that in this case ultimately the 

Bank 
did not suffer any loss , in fact the bank made 

lot 
of 
prof it and therefore that is 
the 
relevant 

circumstance 
wh ile 
cons idering 
the 
aspect 
of 

sentence 
to 
be imposed on the accused person. 
He 

also 
submits 
that 
• the accused No. 1 is 73 years 
of 

age 
and 
he is also suffering from 
limpfoma 
si nce 

1996. 

It is further submi tted that accused No .1 was 

also 

tried 

in Sp l.Case No .2 of 1993 . 

FIR 

on 
the 

basis 
of which the present case was registered 
was 

the 
same 
which 
was 
in 
Sp l.Case 
No .2 
of 
1993. 

Therefore, . the 
sentence 
that may 
be . 
imposed 
on 

accused 

No .1 in this case shou ld be ordered to 

run 

concurrently 
with the sentence imposed in 
Sp l.Case 

No .2 of 1993.

38 . 
So 
fa r 
as accused No .2 is concerned , 
it 
is 

subm itted 

that the accused No .2 is also 69 years of 

a� e 
and he has rec en tly undergone by-pass 
surgery. 

It 
was 
also 
subm itted 
that, 
according 
to 
the 

prosecution, 
accused 
No .2 has 

the 
amount 
1,.&1as disbursed . 
It 

that in Sp l.Case No.2 of 1993 , 

been 
convicted 
and 
sentenced 

sentence that may be imposed

conc urrently 
with 
the 

Sp l.C ase No .2 of 1993 . 

in 

played a f'Ol e

i's also pointed 
OLlt 

accused No .2 has also 

and 
therefore 
the 

this case sh al 1 also 

sentence 
imposed 
in 

39. 

So 
far 
as accused No .4 is conc erned , 
it 
is 

submi tted 
that accused No .4 was acting merely as 
a 

power 
of attorney holder and his role was to accept 

one 
of the bills of , exchan9e and to sign forms 
for 

open ing 
of 
bank 
accoun t. 
There 
is 
no 
mat erial 

pla ced on record by the prosecution to show that the 

accused No .4 gained anything out of the transaction . 

It 

is 
also 
submitted that the 
accused 
No .4 
has 

undergone 
by-p�ss 
surg ery. 
He is also patient 
of 

hiper-tens ion . 

41?i . 
So 
far 
as accused No .5 is concerned, 
it 
is 

submitted 
that the only role played by him was as a 

power of attorney holder for M/ s.J.H. 
Mehta. 
It is 

l

, . 

-79 -

not 
shown 

by the prosecution that he has ma.de 

any 

gain out of the transaction . 

41. 

So far as accused Nos . 

6, 7 & 9 are conce � ned , 

it 
is 

subm itted that they are employees of 

Mazada 

and 
Grov.1more . 
Whatever• 

they have done 
in 
the ir 

capac ity as employees of the company pursuant ta the 

resolution 
passed 
by 
the Board of 
Directors 
and 

therefore 
the 

acc us ed 

shou ld 
be 
considered 

symp athetical ly whi le imposing sentence . 

42. 

So 
far 
as accused No .a is concerned , 
it 
is 

submitted 

that he has been found gui 1 ty on ly of the 

offence 

of 

criminal consp iracy . 
He 

is 
dismissed 

from 

t h e 

service 

of UCO bank . 

Un behalf 
of 

th e 

accused 

per$on the fact that the bank has not 

lost 

any 

money 

and 
has 

re ally m ad e 

prof it 
from 
the 

transaction 
of 

purchase 
and 
sale 
of 
shares 
is 

emphasised. 

43. 

On b eh a l f of the prosecution re liance is placed 

on 

the judgment of the Supreme Cour t in the case of 

State 
of M.P. 

v/s.Ghanshyam Singh, 

(2003) 
Supreme 

Court Cases <Cri) 1935 specially on the obse rvat ions 

made by the supreme Court in paragraphs 13 and 17 of 

the 
judgment • 

It is submitted that as the property

-80 -

b e l onging 

to 

the pub l ic was syphoned away , 

me rely 

because 

of lapse of time lenient view shou ld not be 

taken to convict the accused p e rsons . 

44. 

Pe rus a l of the judgment of t h e Supreme Court in 

Ram 
Narayan 
Popli's case which was a case 

ar ising 

out of t h e same scheme out of which the present case 

arises, 
the 
Supreme Court has held that 
the 
fa ct 

that the money has been recovered and ultimately the 

. 

bank 

has not suffered is the circumstance 

relevant 

fer 

impos ing 
the puni shmen t. 

It is further to 

be 

seen 

here 
that 
the age and ailments 
suffered 

by 

accused 

Nos . 

1 L 2 would also be re l evant �nd the 

fact 

thatr the prosecution was pending so many years 

in court is also relevan t as that fact has also been 

taken into considerat ion by the Supreme Court in the 

case of Ram Narayan Popl i. 

45 . 

lak ing ove rall view of the mat ter, 
th erefore, 

in 
my opinion, fol lowing order would meet the 
ends 

of justice.
