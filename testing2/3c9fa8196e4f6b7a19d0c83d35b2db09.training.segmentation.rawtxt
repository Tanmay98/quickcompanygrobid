ORAL JUDGMENT : (PER:-DIPANKAR DATTA, C.J.) 

1] 
W.P. No. 2412/2020 has been instituted by Shri Sachin 

Rameshwarrao Bhople seeking the following relief: -

"It is, therefore, most humbly and respectfully prayed that this 

Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to issue an appropriate writ,

the post of Associate Professor & further be pleased to direct 

the respondent No. 1/University & respondent No. 2/Vice-

Chancellor to restore the petitioner on the said post, with 

continuity & all benefits, in the interest of justice; 

iii) 
during the pendency and final disposal of the present 

petition, stay the effect & operation of the impugned 

communication dated 09.07.20 (Annex-T), issued by the 

respondent No. 1/University and further restrain the 

respondent No. 1/University from proceeding ahead with 

the said selection process of promotion of Associate 

Professor in the respondent No. 1/University, in the interest 

of justice;" 

2] 
Since order has been claimed for a declaration is prayed for 

quashing and/or setting aside the judgment and order passed by a co-

ordinate Bench of this Court, on the ground of alleged misrepresentation, 

Mr. Sudame, learned advocate representing the respondents 5 to 7 has 

raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition. 

According to him, the judgment and order dated February 27, 2020 by 

which the petitioner feels aggrieved has attained finality by reason of no 

appeal being carried therefrom to the Supreme Court as well as no review 

application having been filed in line with the principles flowing from 

section 114 read with Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure. These 

being the remedies made available by law to the petitioner, it is contended 

that he ought to have elected one such remedy but writ remedy is not 

available to him in the circumstances. He also contends that relief as

claimed by the petitioner cannot be granted since it is not open to us to 

quash and/or set aside the judgment and order of a co-ordinate Bench in 

exercise of judicial review powers; if at all the petitioner is aggrieved, his 

remedy lies elsewhere. It is, thus, prayed that the writ petition be 

dismissed. 

3] 
Mr. Khedkar, learned advocate representing the petitioner 

counters such preliminary objection by placing reliance on a decision of 

the Supreme Court reported in (2007) 14 SCC 108 : Deepa Gourang 

Murdeshwar Katre vs. Principal, V.A.V. College of Arts and others. 

According to him, the said decision is an authority for the proposition that 

if an order has been passed by a Court of law based on fraud or 

misrepresentation, the Court can recall its order in exercise of its inherent 

power. It is, therefore, submitted that this Court may examine whether the 

contention of the petitioner that the judgment and order dated February 

27, 2020 was obtained by misrepresentation has substance or not; if yes, 

the Court may proceed to grant such relief as it may consider appropriate 

in the circumstances. 

4] 
Before dealing with the preliminary objection, it would be 

appropriate for us to notice what was under challenge in W.P. Nos. 

2444/2019, 2471/2019 & 2806/2019 and what the judgment and order 

dated February 27, 2020 (hereafter "the said judgment", for short),

whereby these writ petitions were disposed of, directed. Incidentally, the 

said three writ petitions were instituted by the respondents before us who 

are represented by Mr. Sudame. 

5] 
The first of these writ petitions [W.P. No. 2444/2019], at the 

instance of Ms. Amrapali W/o Atul Akhare, challenged the promotional 

orders of appointments of the respondents 2 to 5 therein on the post of 

Associate Professor, Agricultural Botany. The second writ petition [W.P. No. 

2471/2019] was instituted by Dr. Manish Ramdas Deshmukh & one other, 

wherein the appointments on promotion on the post of Associate 

Professor, Agronomy of the respondents 4 to 10 were challenged. In the 

third writ petition [W.P. No.2806/2019], wherein Ms. Vanita Khushalrao 

Khobarkar was the petitioner, challenge was laid to the appointments on 

promotion of the respondents 2 and 3 on the post of Associate Professor, 

Agricultural Economics. All the appointments under challenge were made 

by Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (hereafter "the University", 

for short). The said three writ petitions were heard together and the 

operative part of the said judgment reads as follows: -

"28. 
Since it has been found that the manner in which the 

concerned respondents have been promoted to the post of 

Associate Professor is not in accordance with ]law, we have no 

hesitation in setting aside the orders of promotion as issued to the 

respondent nos.2 to 5 in Writ Petition No. 2444 of 2019 in the 

subject of Agricultural Botany, respondent nos.4 to 10 in Writ 

Petition No. 2471 of 2019 in the subject of Agronomy and

respondent nos.2 and 3 in Writ Petition No.2806 of 2019 in the 

subject of Agricultural Economics. The Selection Committee is free 

to consider the proposals as received by 06.11.2017 by applying 

the criteria that was prevailing on the said date for effecting 

promotions to the post of Associate Professor. As regards other 

Associate Professors who have been promoted but who have not 

been impleaded in these writ petitions, the matter is left to the 

wisdom of the University to take appropriate steps in accordance 

with law if so advised. It is clarified that we have not examined the 

legality of the promotions of such Associate Professors who are not 

parties in these writ petitions. It is also declared that Resolution 

No.26 of 2019 passed by the Executive Council dated 07.01.2019 to 

the extent it has the effect of modifying the criteria prescribed in 

the matter of effecting promotions which is in variance with 

Statutes 52 and 73 would not operate till the procedure as 

contemplated by Section 38 of the said Act is complied with. Rule 

in each writ petition is made absolute in aforesaid terms leaving 

the parties to bear their own costs." 

(emphasis ours) 

6] 
It is not in dispute that in terms of the operative directions as 

quoted above, the University (where the petitioners as well as the private 

respondents in the aforesaid three writ petitions are employed) initiated 

action for fresh selection and appointment. In course of such process being 

undertaken by the University, the present petitioner who was appointed 

on promotion on the post of Associate Professor in Horticulture was 

served with an order dated July 9, 2020, whereby he was reverted to the 

post of Assistant Professor in Horticulture. Upon this writ petition being

moved, a co-ordinate Bench of this Court by its order dated October 5, 

2020 stayed the order of reversion with the effect that the petitioner has 

continued to function as an Associate Professor in Horticulture. However, 

the Court granted liberty to the University to finalize the process of fresh 

selection and we are informed that the process has been completed and 

the consequent recommendation kept in a sealed cover. 

7] 
The vital circumstance that never be overlooked and 

would always loom large is that the petitioner was not a party to the 

proceedings of W.P. Nos. 2444/2019, 2471/2019 & 2806/2019. 

8] 
Bearing in mind the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we are 

now tasked to decide the preliminary objection as to whether this writ 

petition is maintainable. The question of grant of relief, if any, would arise 

only if the preliminary objection is overruled. 

9] 
Mr. Sudame, Mr. Khedkar and Mr. Sambre, learned advocates 

for the University, respondent no. 1, have been heard and the materials on 

record perused.

We are inclined to overrule the objection of Mr. Sudame and 

hold the writ petition to be maintainable having regard to the Constitution

Singh vs. State of Punjab. There, certain agricultural lands were allotted to 

a number of displaced persons including the appellants on a quasi-

permanent basis under the administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 

and Rules made thereunder in a particular village. It was an admitted fact 

that the appellants fell the category of "non-faujis". On October 9, 

1951, the Director of Relief and Rehabilitation, Punjab, made an order 

adverse to the interest of the appellants Shivdeo Singh and others. To 

maintain the character of the said village as "fauji", he directed that the 

appellants have to move out for being accommodated in some other 

village. Soon after this order was made, the appellants preferred a writ 

petition before the High Court of Punjab for quashing the order. The 

Director of Rehabilitation alone was made a party thereto. The petition 

was allowed by Hon'ble Khosla, J. (as His Lordship then was). Eventually 

the respondents 3 to 14 in the appeal before the Supreme Court, who were 

members of "fauji" families and in whose favour either allotment had been 

made or was intended to be made, preferred a petition before the High 

Court under Article 226 of the Constitution for impleading them as parties 

in the appellants' petition and re-hearing the whole matter. The petition 

was entertained by the High Court and Hon'ble Khosla, J. allowed it. The 

appellants preferred a Letters Patent appeal before the High Court which 

having been dismissed, the Supreme Court was approached in appeal by 

special leave. Hon'ble J.R. Mudholkar, J. (as His Lordship then was) 

speaking for the Bench ruled as follows:

"8. 
The other contention of Mr Gopal Singh pertains to the second 
order of Khosla, J., which, in effect, reviews his prior order. Learned 
counsel contends that Article 226 of the Constitution does not confer 
any power on the High Court to review its own order and, therefore, 
the second order of Khosla, J., was without jurisdiction. It is sufficient 
to say that there is nothing in Article 226 of the Constitution to pre-
clude a High Court from exercising the power of review which inheres 
in every Court of plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice 
or to correct grave and palpable errors committed by it. Here the pre-
vious order of Khosla, J., affected the interests of persons who were not 
made parties to the proceeding before him. It was at their instance 
and for giving them a hearing that Khosla, J., entertained the second 
petition. In doing so, he merely did what the principles of natural jus-
tice required him to do. It is said that the respondents before us had 
no right to apply for review because they were not parties to the pre-
vious proceedings. As we have already pointed out, it is precisely be-
cause they were not made parties to the previous proceedings, though 
their interests were sought to be affected by the decision of the High 
Court, that the second application was entertained by Khosla, J." 

(emphasis ours) 

11] 
The ratio of such decision has been followed in the decision 

reported in (2004) 6 SCC 126 : Pohla Singh vs. State of Punjab. The law 

declared in such decision is that, if a decision rendered in a writ petition 

adversely affects the interest of a third person who was not impleaded as 

a party in the writ petition, it is always open to him to ask for recall of the 

judgment which has been rendered without affording any opportunity of 

hearing to him.

12] 
The facts of the present case appear to be unusually similar 

to those arising for consideration in Shivdeo Singh (supra) and Pohla Singh 

(supra). Admittedly, the petitioner was not included in the array of 

respondents in any of the three writ petitions which were allowed by the 

said judgment. We have noted from paragraph 15 of the said judgment that 

objection had been raised to the effect that all the promotees were not 

impleaded as respondents in the writ petitions. The view expressed by the 

co-ordinate Bench while dealing with such objection needs to be noted. 

Paragraph 15 records as follows: 

"15. 
Another objection raised is the absence of all 

promotees being impleaded as respondents in the writ petitions. 

According to the promoted respondents, since the entire process of 

promotion was being challenged by the petitioners, it was 

necessary for them to implead all the Assistant Professors who had 

been promoted as Associate Professors. In reply, it has been 

submitted by the petitioners that only those Assistant Professors 

who were less meritorious than the petitioners but had been 

promoted as Associate Professors were impleaded as respondents. 

The justification for the same is that if the procedure as prescribed 

by the Statutes is adopted, the concerned respondents being less 

meritorious than the petitioners, they were not liable to be 

promoted. The petitioners therefore have chosen to challenge the 

promotions of such promotees who were less meritorious than the 

petitioners. 

In the light of the specific challenge raised by the 

petitioners and as they are aggrieved by the adoption of a different 

procedure than the one prescribed by the Statutes which has 

resulted in less meritorious candidates being promoted, we are

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:49 ::: 


Judgment

WP2412.20 

ANSARI 

inclined to examine the challenge as raised on merits and we do 

not find it appropriate to non-suit the petitioners only on the 

ground that all promoted Associate Professors have not been 

impleaded as respondents. In any event, the petitioners have no 

grievance with the promotion of such Associate Professors who are 

more meritorious than them and hence in this backdrop, such 

more meritorious candidates are not found to be even proper 

parties. We are of the position that promotions of such 

Assistant Professors who have been promoted but have not been 

impleaded cannot be challenged in their absence. 

(emphasis ours) 

13] 
Once the co-ordinate Bench in the said judgment has 

observed that it was conscious of the legal position that promotions of 

such Assistant Professors as Associate Professors who have not been 

impleaded as respondents could not be challenged in their absence, our 

task becomes easy. We are inclined to the view that the observation in the 

operative directions quoted above constitute an error apparent on the face 

of the record which, in the exercise of the inherent power of this Court 

(being a court of plenary jurisdiction) deserves to be reviewed. The 

observation in paragraph 28 is plainly inconsistent with the conclusion 

recorded in paragraph 15 and, thus, interests of justice would require that 

the two inconsistent views be reconciled, if possible; if not, to review the 

said judgment and relieve such of the promotees, who were not parties to 

the earlier proceedings, from being visited with adverse civil 

consequences not only on the ground of their non-impleadment but

because of the clear stand of the petitioners in course of hearing of the said 

three writ petitions that only selection and appointment of less 

meritorious promotee candidates had been challenged consequent 

whereto only such promotees were impleaded as respondents. The co-

ordinate Bench having found that the highly meritorious candidates were 

not even proper parties, the observation made in paragraph 28 could be 

applied only to candidates who were not as meritorious as the petitioners 

in W.P. Nos. 2444/2019, 2471/2019 & 2806/2019; but such observation 

had no application qua a candidate like the petitioner, who was not only 

not a respondent, but is claimed to be a highly meritorious candidate. Also, 

the petitioner could not have figured in the scheme of things since none of 

the respondents, who instituted the said three writ petitions as 

petitioners, were Assistant Professors in Horticulture. Their subjects being 

different, the observation in paragraph 28 could not have been made the 

sheet anchor to direct reversion and fresh selection, and carried forward 

to the detriment and prejudice of the petitioner. The University while 

reading paragraph 28 seems to have been clearly oblivious of the 

unambiguous conclusion recorded in paragraph 15 by Their Lordships. 

14] 
In such view of the matter, in exercise of our power of review, 

we hold that any action taken by the University to divest the petitioner of 

the fruits of promotion as an Associate Professor, Horticulture, triggered 

by the observation in paragraph 28, must be regarded as inoperative and 

ineffective having regard to the observation made in paragraph 15 of the

said judgment. As a consequence, we hold that the reversion of the 

petitioner by the University by the order dated July 9, 2020 not at all being 

lawful, in the sense that the University was nudged to act on the basis of 

the observation in paragraph 28 of the said judgment by the respondents 

represented by Mr. Sudame despite the observation in paragraph 15 

thereof, merits to be set aside. We order accordingly. 

15] 
The result of the aforesaid direction would be that the 

petitioner shall be deemed to have continued in service on the promoted 

post of Associate Professor, Horticulture from the initial date of his 

promotion notwithstanding the action taken by the University in terms of 

the said judgment. The selection process that the University has initiated, 

pursuant to the impugned order of this Court, needs to be aborted and 

shall not be carried forward any further. We, therefore, allow the writ 

petition with the aforesaid directions. Since the petitioner has not suffered 

adversely because of the timely intervention by this Court by its aforesaid 

interim order, we refrain from imposing costs. 

16] 
We, however, make it clear that this order does not affect any 

action taken by the University against the promotees who were 

respondents in the said three writ petitions and which were disposed of 

by the said judgment. Any process initiated against any of the respondents
