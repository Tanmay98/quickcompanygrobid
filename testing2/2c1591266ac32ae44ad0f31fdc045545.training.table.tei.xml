It shows that rate of interest was to be 14% per annum.<lb/> However, it appea rs that Grindlays Bank did not agree with interest at 14% and<lb/> issued the call mon&lt;.:&gt;y deposjc receipt Ex. 74A in v.rhkh the rate of interest was<lb/> shown to be 10%. Jn the kuchha register Ex.58, PW-4 Hemlata Nair had notecl<lb/> about i.HTIOLmt of Rs.130 crore Js call money lent to Grindlays Bank at 14% per<lb/> annum in terest. Il was noted by her ot the bottom of the page for 26.12.1991. In<lb/> the statement of Current Accounc showing the call money lent, there is one entry<lb/> dated 26.12.1991 which shows that amount of Rs.1.30 crore t. &quot;J as Jent to Grindlays<lb/> Bank as cal l money and ra t e of .interest was jnitially 14%, but it appears ro have<lb/> been changed tD 10%. Similarly, there is next entry on 27.12.91 whkh shmvs thi.lt<lb/> call money lent to Grindlays Bank wa s received back. Here also i nitjally the<lb/> interest rate was mentioned as 14%, but then it was changed to 10% and in the<lb/> product col um n showing total amount of interest received, th ere appears some<lb/> overwriting or correction. It appears that accused Nos. 1 and 2 had agreed to<lb/> advance amount of Rs. 130 crore under the impressjon that Andhra Bank would be<lb/> gerting interest at the rate of 14% per ;.innurr1 and accordingly the cred it voucher<lb/> was issued, but Grindlays Bank refused to pay 14c Yo and therefo re these documents<lb/> were changed. Gri ncllays Bank paid interest at the rate of 10%. In view of this,<lb/> there was a difference of 4% per annum. Towards the difference of the said 4% per<lb/> annum, amount of Rs.1,42,466/-was debited to t&apos;he account of accused No.3 Hiten<lb/> Dalcll maintained with Andina Bank for which debit voucher Ex.9A was prepared<lb/> by PW-4 Hemlala and signed by accused Nos. 1 C1nd 2. It is materia l to note that<lb/> in the sa. i d debit voucher, it was shown to be amount of commis sion on sale and<lb/> purchase of securi ties . There is also a debit entry in the Account No.4819 of<lb/> accused No.3 Hiten DalaJ vide Exhibit 11. In that account also amount is debited<lb/> as commission on sale. In fact, this could not have been a com m ission on sale.<lb/> As stated earlier, as per standi ng instructions from the head office on securities<lb/> transactions of Hiten Da lal and ocher brokers, commission of Rs.400/-per crore<lb/> \11as to be charged. [n fact, in (he present cnse, the transuction of purchase cf<lb/> securities of Rs.130 crores was not materialised. Had the said deal materialis2c1,<lb/> And!ira Bank could have charged maximum nmounc of Rs.52,000/-towards<lb/> commission from Hiten Dalal. The com mission cou1d not be Rs.1,42,466/-.<lb/> PW-4 Hemlata Nair, after calculation, deposed on oath that this amount was<lb/> equivalent to 4% per annum interest on the amount of Rs.130 crore. Finally, it is<lb/> conceded bv the accused Nos. 1 and 2 that this amount was recovered as<lb/> </figDesc>

Finally the<lb/> deal about purchase of securities could not be materialised and it was called off,<lb/> most probably on 27.12.1991 and on that day, the amount which \•Vas a lready paid<lb/> by accused Nos. 1 and 2 on behalf of Andbrn Bank to Grindlays Bank was treated<lb/> as call money lent lo Grincllays Bank and on that day, the officers of Grindlays<lb/> Bank prepared documents to show that call money was borrowed from Andhra<lb/> Bank. There is no material to show that there \•Vere any instructions from the head<lb/> office to accused Nos. 1 and 2 to bonow the amount of Rs.130 crore as call money<lb/> and then co lend the same to Grindlays Bank.
