the 
prior 

approval 
of his superior officers and whatever he had 

done 
was 
done by him in good faith and 
belief 
that 

whatever 
instructed to him was correct. 
According to 

his defence, in NHB no decision could be taken without

the prior approval of the General Manager Hosangadi PW 

[29J 
or any officer above liim. 
Therefore, 
accord ing 

to accused No.l, he has not committed any offence. 

15. 
The 
defence of accused No .2 is that he was 
not 

authorised 
to finalise the transaction . 
He was 
also 

not 
authorised to sign any cheques . 
According to his 

defence, 
it was his duty on ly to prepare the cheques, 

vouchers 
and 
make entries in respect thereof in 
the 

records. 
Accord ing to him, he is also made scape-goat 

by 
NHB top management. 
Therefore, he also claims 
to 

be i.nnoc ent . 

16. 
The defence of accused No.3 is that he was merely 

an 
employee 
of Harshad S. 
Meh ta [since deceased) 

accused 
No .3. 
He joined the services with Harshad S. 

Meh ta [deceased accused] in June, 1990. He never took 

part in any deal or transac tion between th• banks. 
He 

was 
only 
looking after the back 
off ice 
operations. 

Whatever 
contract 
notes 
or delivery orders 
he 
had 

initialled, 
it 
was done after confirming 
the 
deals 

with 
the 
dealers or computer operators. 
He came 
i:n 

picture 
on ly after the deal was done. 
He had 
merely 

received 
the salary and was not be � efit in any 
other 

way 
from 
the 
sc am. 

innocent. 

Therefore, 
he 
claims 
to 
be 

17 . 

The defence of accused No.4 is almost to the same 

effect. 
Accord ing 
to hi� defence, he was mere ly 
an 

employee 
and 
got 
only salary and did 
not 
get 
any

the

The case of the pros ecu t i on is that there was,

fact, no transac tion of purch ase of securit i es , as 

neither

by 

the NHB fr om the Grind lays Bank.

those

It is also 

the case of prosecution that the accused No .l and 2 

did not 
issue any direct ion or author isat ion along 

with 
the cheques to the Grind lays Bank requ iring them 

to credit the amoun ts of those cheques to the account 

of HSM. 
In fact, as per the case of prosecut ion, the 

NHB 

was not 
authorised to deal 

in 

securities 

transaction through any broker. 
The prosecution also 

led 
evidence to indicate that no such transac tion of

vouchers as also repurchase of these secur ities by the

with regard to call money transaction dated 25. 3. 1992. 

. 
\ 

It this was really a call money transaction. the entry 

would 
have appeared in the deal dump dated 

25.3. 1992 

showing the call money transaction with NHB men tioning 

the 
particulars 
like 
rate 
ot 
interest. 
date 
of 

matur ity, 
name ot the bank etc. 
However, in the deal 

dump 
lExhibit -156) there is no entry in respect 
ot 

these 
transactions. 
Therefore, 
he 
clarified 
that 

there 
was no transaction of borrowing Rs. 15 crores by 

the 
Grindlays 
Sank 
from NHB on 25.3.1992. 
He 
was 

cross 
examined on behalf of accused No. 1 but 
nothing 

material is elicited in the cross examination so as to 

doubt the testimony ot this witness. 

32. 

What 
is, 
however , submitted on behalf 
of 

the 

accused No. l is that the ofticers wor king in the Funds 

Management 
Department of the Grindlays Bank were 
th e 

dealers dealing in secur ities transaction on behalf of 

the 
Grindlays 
Bank, 
but 
none 
of 
theml 
has 
been 

examined. 
It 
is true that no dealer wor king in 
the 

Grindlays 
Bank 
is exami ned. 
However, that 
was 
not 

necessary 

because 
there 
is 
positive 
evidence 
of 

Khambadkone LP Wl SJ who was wo rking in the back office, 

where day-to-day entries with regard to the secur ities 

transaction either of purchase or sale as we ll as call 

money 
transactions were entered into in the deal dump 

register 
maintained 

in 
his 

department. 
This 

was 

negative evidence, which was reauired to be led by t he 

prosecution 

to sho� that there is no such transaction 

ot 

purchase 
ot securities by NHB trom the 
Grindlays

Bank 
or lending ot money by NHB to Grindlays Bank had 

ever 

taken 
place. 

What is mater ial to be 
noted 
is 

that 

it is not the case made out either on behalf 
ot 

accused 

No . 1 
or on behalf of accused No. 2 

tha t 
the 

physical 
securities 
or 

BRs 
in 
respect 

ot 

the 

secur ities 
concerning the purchase transactions 
were 

exchanged between NHB and the Grindlays Bank, although 

the 

documents 
were 

prepared 

in 

NHS 
showing 
the 

transaction ot purchase of sec uri ties on the aforesaid 

dates. 

The evidence of Kh�mbadkone [PW1 5J, therefore, 

proves 
the 
fact 
that there wa s 

no 
transaction 
ot 

purchase 
of securities by NHB from the Grindlays Bank 

as 

indicated by the vouchers at Exhibit -19, 31, 

45 

a nd 
87 
had 

ever taken place. 
Similar ly, 
he 

also 

esta blis hes 

the 

tact 

that 
there 

was 
never 
any 

tr ansaction 

of 

purchase 
of securities 

or 

sale 
of 

securities between Gr indlays Banks to NHB as indicated 

by 
the 
vouchers-
Exhibit -99 and 100 

having 
taken 

place 
on 23. 3. 199Z and 24.3.1992. 

This evidence also 

establishes 

the tact that on 25. 3. 1992. there was 

no 

transaction 
of 
lending 
of money ever 

having 

taken 

place 

between Grindlays Bank and NHB as indicated 

by 

the voucher Exhibit -39.

53 

in 
fact 
no transaction ot purchase of securities 
by 

NHB from Grindlays Bank is that the Grindlays Bank had 

disowned 
such transactions as also the responsibility 

to 
reverse 
them, in the correspondence 
that 
ensued 

between 
two 
Banks atter the same came to 
to 
light. 

That is borne out by evidence ot Hosangadi CPW 29 ) and 

cor respondence 
at 
Exh.251 
to 

255. 

the 
stand 
of 

Grindlays 
Bank was that it had no tran saction of sale 

of securities to NHB. 
This evidence, therefore. makes 

it 
clear that securities shown to have been purchased 

were 
never received by NHB and thus could not be with 

NHB. 
All the transactions were fake transactions. 

33. 

In addition to this, there is evidence of Rakshit 

(PWl J 
and Hosangadi lPW29J which. shows that these two 

officers 

of 
record 

along with others had carried out inspection 

of 
NHB 
and 
they 
had 
found 
that 
the 

securities 
concerning 
the 
at oresaid 
purchase 

transactions 
having 
taken 
place 
on 
13.4.19 93 , 

?.0. 4.1992, 23. 3. 1 992 and 24 . 3.1992 were not found with 

NHS. 
If, 
in tact, such transaction of 
purchase 
of 

securities 
by 
NHB from the Gr1 ndlays Bank had 
taken 

place, 
the relevant secur ities should have been found 

with 

the NHB in the office section ot FMG. 

At 
least 

the BRs which are normal ly issued in lieu of physicals 

should 
have been found. 
But their evidence 
indicate 

that 
even 
BRs were not found. 
Therefore, 
both 
the 

witnesses have clear ly stated that, in fact, there �as

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:34:43 ::: 


':>4 

no transaction of purchase ot securities at all on any 

of 
the aforesaid dates had taken place. 
They further 

state 
that moneys were, however . transferred from NHB 

to Grindlays Bank by way of various RSI cheQues issued 

by 
NHB under the signature of accused No. l in 
favour 

of 
Grindlays 
Ba nk. 
As indicated above, there is 
no 

dispute 
about 
this 
aspect. 
Further 
both 
these 

wi tnesses 
have 
also 
specifically 
stated 
that 
no 

receipt 
passed 
by Grindlays Bank in respect ot 
call 

money transaction of Rs. 
15 crores having taken Place 

on 

ZS. 3. 1992 
was ever tound with NHB. 
If really 
it 

was 
a 
transaction 

�f lending of money 

of 
Rs. 

15 

crores 
by way of call money by NHB to Grlndlays 
Bank 

had 
taken place, the Grindlays Bank wou ld have passed 

receipt. 
However. 
as indicated above, it 
is 
clear 

from 

the evidence of Khambadkone [PWlSJ as also these 

two 
witnesses Ra kshi t LPWl l a�d Hosangadi [PW29 ) that 

there 
was no such call money transaction al though the 

money 
i.e. 
Rs. 

15 crores were transferred by way ot 

RBI 
cheoue 
issued 
by 
accused 
No . 1 
in 
favour 
ot 

Grindlays Bank without the money having been called by 

the 
Grindlays 
Bank 
from 
the NHB. 
Thus, 
all 
the 

purchase 
transactions 
were 
fake 
transactions. 

Simi lar ly tne call money transaction was also the rake 

transaction. 

With 
regard to the transaction dated 20. 4. 1992, 

the 
cheQue 
Exhibit -88 is signed by 
Jambukeshwaran 

LPWZ3J 
and Katre tPW1 3l as second signatory.

ot 
the voucher lExhibit-87 ) would, however, indicates 

that 
at 
the top the date mentioned 

1$ "16.4. 1992", 

whereas 
at 
the 
bottom 
the 
date 
mentioned 

is"ZO. 4. 1992". 
It was vel-iemen tly submitted on behalf 

of 

the 
accused No .1 that on 20. 4 .1992, 
the 
accused 

No. 1 was on leave and, therefore, this transaction was 

not 
entered into by him and that this transaction was 

entered 
into by Jambukeshwaran (PW23J. 

However, 

the 

evidence 
of 
Jambukeshwaran LPW2 3) clear ly 
indicates 

that 
this 
voucher 
[Exhibit 
-87) 
and 
the 
cheQue 

lExhibit-88] were given to him by accu. No. Zand accused 

No. 2 had clarified that this transaction was finalised 

by accused No. l on 16.4. 1992 itself but it remained to 

be carried out and it ls on this repre-sentation made 

to 

him 
by 

accused No .Z that 

Jambukeshwaran 

LPWZ3 l 

signed the cheque [Exhibit-88 J. 

brought 

lPW23J 

in 
the cross examination 

on behalf of accused No. 1. 

This aspect has been 

of 
Jambukeshwaran 

It is true that it 

has 
been 
brought 

on 

record that 
when 
a 
deal 
is 

finalised 
on a particular date, the transaction is to 

be 
carried 
out on the same da y. 
There should be 
no 

dispute 
about this aspect. 
However, what is reauired 

to 
be noted is that in these transactions ot purchase 

including the transaction dated 16.4. 1992 or 

20. 4. 1 992, 
in 
fact, there was no transaction at 
al l 

because 
there 
was no purchase of secur ities at 
all. 

Only 
the 
cheques 
were 
reouired 
to 
be 
issued. 

Jambukeshwaran 
lPW23 J 
had, in fact, no knowledge 
o-f 

transaction at all and it was on the representation ot

accused 
No .2 
that 
he had put his signature 
00 
the 

cheQue 
after 
going 
through the voucher, 
wh ich 
was 

bear ing bot h the dates-16.4.1992 and 20. 4. 1992. 
This 

portion 
of 
evidence, therefore, 
clear ly 
implicates 

Sures ti 
Babu 
lAccused 
N0. 2) being a 
member 
of 
the 

conspiracy. 
With 
regard to the conspiracy , I 
shall 

deal 
latert but suffice it to say at, this 
stage, 

that 
there 
is involvement of accused Nos. 
and 
2 

even 
in the tr&nsaction dated 20. 4. 1992 al though 
the 

cheque 
LExhibit 
88J is signed 
by 
Jambukeshwaran 

lPW23 J and not by accused No . 1. 

34. 
On behalf of accused No .l it was pointed out that 

there 
no primary evidence either documentary or 
oral 

to 
show 
that 
the 
secur ities 
were 
not 
avai lable. 

Howeve r9 

I do not tind any mer it in this 

submission. 

It 
has to be noted that dur ing inspection carried out 

by Rakshit LPWl J and Hosangadi lPWZ9 ) the accused No. 1 

was 
called back from leave and he had also helped the 

investigating 
team carrying out the investigation 
i� 

this 
respect. 
At that time accused 
No. 1 
indicated 

that 
there were se cur ities, however, he did not 
know 

about 
the 
same. 
Therefore accused 
No .2 
�as 
a lso 

called 
back trom the leave and it is with the help of 

both 
these 
accused� four packets con taining 
various 

securities 
were 
recovered. 
The inventory 
of 
those 

securities 
were made by Sambamurthy [PW34 J and 
lists 

ot those securities were prepared [Exhibit -278, 279, 

280 
and 

281 J. 

The details of these securities 
have 

::: Uploaded on -14/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:34:43 ::: 


57 

been 
mentioned 
in 
these 
inventoties. 
From 
this 

evidence, 
it 
is clear that the secur ities that 
were 

tound, 
which were shown to have been purchased by the 

aforesaid 
purchase transactions were not there. 
Here 

again 
it 
has to be noted that it is not the case 
of 

accused 
No. 
or accused No. 
2 that the 
securities 

were, 
in fact, received and they wer� kept some where 

and no 
entries 
with regard thereto were 
ever 
made. 

Much is also made about admitted fact that no register 

f o r 

holding of sec urities was maintained in FMG. 
To 

maintain 
such register was also the responsibi Jjty o t 

accused Nos. 
1 and 2. 
Therefore, non-maintenance of 

this 
register would go against the accused No. 1 and 2 

themselves. 
Apart from this, as discussed above, 
it 

is 
not 
the 
case 
of accused No. 1 
and 
2 
that 
the 

secur ities 
or 
BRs 
were, in fact received 
from 
the 

Grindlays 
Bank 
in 
respect 
ot 
aforesaid 
purchase 

transactions. 
There 
is 
positive 
ev idence 
of 

Khambadkone LPW1 5] to show that no such transaction ot 

purchase 
of securities by NHB from the Grindlays Bank 

had 
ever taken place. 
Therefore, non mai ntenance 
of 

such register would be of no help to the accused. 

35. 

From 
the evi dence ot Raksh it

That order indicated that Ravi Kumar 

[Accused

completion 
ot the audit for the year, 
1 990 -9 1. 

Much 
was made on behalf ot accused No. 1 to submit 
in 

respect 
of this or der that the accused No .1 was never 

in-charge 
of 

FMG. 

However , 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 

aforesaid witnesses including that ot Sivaraman [PW 24J 

and 
Hosangadi 
LPWZ9 ) 
bear 
out 
that 
even 
after 

completion of the audit �or the year , 1990-91, Accused

to 
hold the char�e

He 

states 
that accused No. 1 was 
al lowed 
to 

continue to work in the FMG as such. 
Hosangadi (PW29 J 

has 
further stated that all the transactions 
carried 

out 
in the FMG were by the officers in-charge of 
the 

FMG and that officer in -charge ot the FMG was accused 

No. l. 
The evidence of Sivaraman (PW24J also makes it 

clear 
that, it was Accused No. 1 who was enter ing into 

the 
deal 
and authorising the deal and it is 
at 
his 

instance 
that the entries in that deal diary used

No. 21 
or by Si varaman l PW 24]. 
ln this regard. it 
is 

also 
further 
to be noted that Hosangadi 
[PWZ 9l 
had 

stated 
that 
in 
the 
begi nning atter 
the 
deal 
was 

finalised, 
and 
deal 
slip was prepared, 
the 
papers 

connected 

with the transactions used to be p ut up 

to 

him 
prior to September 1991 . 
He further states 
that 

these 
documents 
used to come to him 1'or 
pos t 
tacto 

approval only. 
He fur ther clarifies that since he was 

treQuently reQuired to go on tours and used to be away 

trom the office for official purpose, he was unable to 

attend 
to 
the 
work ot pos t facto sanctions 
of 
the 

deals 

finalised in FMG. 
The pr ac tice of getting 

h i s 

/J<-""f St 
facto appr oval was discontinued after Seotember, 

1991 . 
He 
further clarifies tha t entering 
into 
the 

transaction 
and deployment ot national housing 
funds 

was 

attended to only by Ravi Kumar ( Acc used NO. 1 J 

in 

the 

FMG. 

This also shows that accused No. 1 alone was 

the 

person in charge of t he FMG. 

It is pertinent 
to 

note 
that accused No. 1 has not denied having 
entered 

into any of the aforesaid purchase tr ansac t ions. 

That 

aspect 

has also been claritied fr om the tact that 

it 

was 
accused 
No. 1 who has signed a ll the 
cheQues 
in 

respect ot this purchase transaction except the cheque 

l£xhibit-88 Jin respect of transaction dated 24. 4.1992 

This 
cheaue 
is 
signed 
by 
Jambukeshwaran 
LPW23 ]. 

However1 I have explained above as to how he signed i t 

on 
the 
false representation made to him 
by 
accused 

No .2 
and on the basis of voucher presented to him 
by 

Accused No . 2 in respec t ot the transaction having been

finalised by accused No. 1. 

36. 

Learned 
Counsel 
for 
accused 

No. 1 
further 

submi tted that there is no evidence led by prosecution 

to show that it was the responsibi l i t y of accused No. 1 

to 

hand 
over the cheque and col lect the 
securities. 

There 
is 

also no evidence to show as to 

who 
handed 

over the cheQues in case of purchase of securities and 

to 
whom 
the said cheques were hand$d over. 
Learned 

Counsel 
tor the CBI has submitted that 
un fortunately 

this evidence could not be collected and broupht torth 

betore 
the Court. 

He, however, submits that the tact 

remains 

that the cheQues were drawn on RBI in 
favour 

of 
ANZ Grin dlays Bank and thus, cheoues had, in fact, 

reached 
Grindlays 

Bank 
and on the 
basis 

of 
those 

cheques, 

the amounts have been debited to the account 

ot 

NHB 
with the RB! and credited to the 
account 
ot 

Grindlays 
Bank with the RBI .As could be seen from the 

evidence 
of Sivaraman LPW24], he clearly states 

that 

the 
cheques 

used 
to 

be 
handed 
over 

against 
the 

physical 

securlty 

or 
BRs. 

in 

a 

transaction 

of 

purchase 

of 
securities by NH S . This is 
obviously 

so 

because 
no 
oheoue could be handed over or 
i� 
other 

words 
no 

payment cou ld be made unless 
the 
secur ity 

purchased is received or is assured to be delivered as 

the 
assurances 
contained 
in 
the 
BRs. 
Therefore, 

either physical securities or BRs . 
ought to have been 

received 
in 
FMG before the cheques were 

issued 
and 

delivered to the Grindlays Sank.

he

see 
that

It 

is immater ial as to �ho handed over the cheQue and who

would 
have been adduced by the

that

the 
prosecution in 
positively 

establishin� 

that 
fact. 

Non 
production 
ot 
such 

evidence, 
however, does not help• the de�ence at 
all. 

Ravi Kumar lAccused No.

ought 

to 
have 
ensured 
the 
receipt 
of 
physical 

securities 
purchased 
or 
at 
least BRs 
in 
lieu 
of 

physical 
securities in the purchase transaction. 
It 

was 
also the joi nt responsibility of accused No. 1 and 

accused No .2 to ensure the same. 
However , the cheaues 

were 
issued.

by Accused No. 2

that 
were 
received 
in the Gr indlays 

Bank 

and 
the 

credit 

of that amount has been given to the Grindlays 

Bank's 

account with the RBI . 

Therefore, un less there 

is 
connivance 
between both the accused No. 1 
an d 
2, 

such 
cheoues 
could not have gone out of NHS 
without 

receipt 
ot 
the physical secur ities or BRs. 
When 
no 

such 
securities 
or 8Rs are found with the 
NHB 

that 

clearly 
indicates 
that 
it was to the 
knowledge 
ot 

accused

that matter. 

37 . 
Much was also made about evidence that is brouQht 

forth 
in 

the deposition of Raksh it CPWlJ and 

others 

that accused No .1 had signed first. 
A submission that 

is 
advanced 
on behalf of accused No .1 is that 
there 

are 
no written Rules or Regulat ions prescribing as to 

who 
should sign the cheque first and as to what 
were 

the 
du ties of first and second signatories. 
However, 

in 
this 
regard , 

Raksh it CPWlJ has 

stated 
that 
an 

officer 
working 
in 
the department 
from 
which 
the 

cheque 
is 
issued , 
is required to 
sign 
the 
cheque 

first . 
Even othe rw ise , there could be no doubt 
that 

the 
second 
signatory 
would 
require 
the 
person 

responsible 
for entering into the transac tion to sign 

the 
cheque first and then alone the second 
signatory 

1.>1ou ld 
put 
his signature. 
It is true that by 
simply 

o \..4-• 

at the cheque , it can not be made as to wh ich 
" 

of 
the 
two signatories had put Mis signature 
f i rs t. 

Desp ite 
this, as discussed above, it �as the 
accused 

No. l, 
who 
was i n-charg e of FMG, the 
transac tion 
of 

purchase 
of securities or sale of securities for that 

mat ter 
were conc ern ing FMG, therefore , there could be 

no 
manner of doubt that the accused No .l had sign the 

cheque 
first 
and 
then 
the 
second 
signatory. 

Jambukeshwaran 
CPW23J has, however , made a 

statement 

in 
his cross examination that the cheques 
concerning 

any department was requi red to be signed first by Ravi 

Kumar

6� 

this statement however, t ak e s the case of defenc� no 

1>1here . 
fhis is so because, as stated above, so f.3.r as 

purchase 
transactions of securities are concerned , 

� 

they are concern ing 1� the FMG and accused No .1 was 

in-charge 
of 

FMG and , therefore , it was for him to 

sign the cheque first as it is he who had entered into 

the transaction of purchase of secur ities. 

38. 

Th is di�cuss ion estab l ishes the fact that all the 

purchase 
transactions and c.all 
money transac tions 

dated 

25 .3.1 .992 

of 
lend ing of Rs . 1 5 crores 
to 

Grindlays Bank were fake transac tions . No securi ties 

had been exchanged e i ther physica� 7 or BRs although the 

purchase amount was transferred to Brind lays Bank 's 

account 

with RB I and debited to NHB 's account with 

RBI . 
The question then would be as to who had done 

this and why it was done so? As discussed abov e,

prepared 

showing credit to be given to the Harshad s.

He 
states 

that 
these oral instructions were given to him either 

by 
Accused No.6 or by accused No. 7. 
T h is shows 
that 

he, 
however, definitely did not remember as to 
w hich 

ot these accused had given oral instructions. Therefore 

it 
becomes 
necessary 
to consider 
the 
position 
of 

accused No. 6 and 7.Considering the position ot accused 

No .6 and 7, it is not in dispute that accused No. 6 was 

wo rking as Accounts Manager and was co ncer ne d with the

It is und isputed that Harshad Mehta

the same person i.e. 

accused No . 6 . 

41. 
The ev idence of Hand Wr iting Expert Mr. 
Sharma 

[PW36J , 
ha s been chal l enged on behalf of accused No .6 

mai nly 
on 
the 
ground that Mr. 
Sharma 

CPW3�J 

had 

prepared 
the 
pencil notes on the basis of 
which 
he 

prepared 
the 
final notes. 
These pencil 
notes 
were 

prepared in the course of examinat ion of the documents 

fo llowing the aforesaid procedure . 
Mr. 

Sharma CPW38l 

had 
stated that said pencil notes were destroyed . 

It 

is, 
therefore , 

vehemently 

submitted 
on 
behalf 
of 

accused 

N0 .6 that the primary ev idence is not 

before 

the 

Court an d, therefore , defence has been 
serious ly 

prejud i ced 
in 
its ab ility to examine the 
expert 

to 

dete rmine 
the verac ity of his op inion. 
Howe ver, I do 

not 

find 
any merit in this submission . 
!'he

of 

the 
documents fo llo 1>1ing aforesaid procedure } then 

the 

reasons 
tAte re prepared � giving the si lent 

features 

and 
thereafter 
the pencil notes were destroyed . 

In 

fact, pencil notes are the rough notes and the reasons 

for 
the opinion are final . 
Therefore , it can not 

be 

said 

that the penc il notes 1.11ere primary evidence 

and 

not the reasons for op in ion wh ich are furnished by Mr.

CPW38J. 

It is also submitted that Mr.

had 

made an improvement by stating for the first time 

in 
his 
evidence 
that 
he 
had 
also 
noted 

diss imi larities. 
However, I do not find any me rit in 

this 
submission 
as 
11th i le not ing 
simi larities, 

dissimi larities are bond to be noted so far as general 

writing habits and other things are concerned . 
There 

is no question of any prejudice having been caused to 

the defence on account of destroyin9 the pencil notes 

as the reasons for the op inion are avai lable and they 

are already on record at �xhibit -303. 
It is further 

subm itted on behalf of accused No.6 that on ly on the 

basis of 
the evidence of Hand Writing �xpert no 

conviction could be based . 
There is no dispute about 

this proposition . 
However, in this case , 
there 
is 

ev idence 
by Roche CPW25l and other witnesses to state 

that accused N0 .6 was working as the Asstt. 
Manager 

CCustomer Re lations] and looking after the account of 

Harshad Mehta (deceased accused]. 
He has 
also 

spec ifically stated that credit of the cheques issued 

by NHB was given to the account of Harshad Mehta 

[deceased accused] as per the oral 
instrLtct ions of 

Accused No .6 and I or ac:c:used No .7. So far as accused 

No.7 

is concerned, she was only a Trainee Officer and 

could not have taken any dec ision on her own unl �s9 

she was guided and 
instructed by accused No .6. 

Therefore , 
there should be no doub t that the credit 

vouchers 
for the purpose of gi ving credit to the 

account of Harshad S. 
Mehta (deceased accused] were 

prepared 
in 
the Clearing Department on the oral 

instructors of accused No .6 alone and no one else .

The 

fa ct 
that 
accused No .6 was 
working 
as 
As stt. 

Manager lCustomer Relat ions] is not in dispu te . 
Much , 

however , was made on the as p ec t that mak ing posting on 

the 
basis 
of 
credit 
vouchers 
was 
dealt 
with 

in 

operat ions 
department . 
Ho111eve r, 
it 
is 
of 
no 

consequences because 
the Operat ions Department acts 

only 

on the basis of the voucher . No other docum en t 

comes to the Operat ions D�partment, not even a cheque. 

Therefore , 
unless the credit voucher goes to the 

Op erations 

Department, no credit would be given . 

So 

far 

as Clearing Depar tment is concerned , the working 

of Clearing Department was on ly to receive the cheque 

for clearance i.e. 

for sending the cheques to the RBI 

for 9ett tn9 the c red i t to the Grindlays Bank 's account 

1>1ith 
RB I. 
The 
persons 
working 
in 
the 
Clearing 

Department 
ob v i ous l y 
did 
not 
have 
any 
customer 

contact. 
The 
cheques 
were coming to 
the 
Clearing 

Department , 
as 
could 
bi seen from 
the 
evidence 
of 

yarious 
Wi tnesses 
from 
the Grindlays Bank 
as 
also 

other documents 1 on ly for the purpose of clearing . 

Takin9 
all 
these factors into 
cons ideration� 
there 

should 
be 
no doubt that it was accused No .6 who 
was 

the person respons ible for giv ing credit of the amount 

of 
the 
cheques to the 

account 
of 
Harshad 
Mehta 

(deceased accused] and no one else.

As regards accused No .7, besides there be ing no

On 
both 

t h ese

there 
is 

s ignatu re 

of

These letters show 
that 

Harshad

issuance 
of

for 

the amount 
mentioned 
in 

the 

lett ers 

and 
accord ing ly accused No .7 had issued 
two 

cheques [Exh ibit -275 and Exhibit -276] for the said 

amounts 
on 
13.4. 1992. 

It is, therefore, 

vehement ly 

subm itted 
on

accused 

No . 
7 had issued these two cheques knowing fu lly we ll 

that 
these 

cheques 
of

amounts 
hav ing 
been 

cred ited first to the ANZ Grindl ays Bank 's account and 

then

cheques signed by her as per statement of accoun t 

of

Howe ver, 
this 

subm i ss ion 

is 

not acceptable as there is noth ing 
to 

indicate that accused No .7 was having knowledge of the 

transfe r 
of the amoun ts of the cheques issued by 
NHB 

being 

credi ted to the Harshad Meh ta 's account and 

it 

is 

from that amount that the Harshad Mehta

not 

prove 
that

There is, however, more than

a

emp l oyed 
after

retirement 
from

It is, therefore� clear 

that

tra nsac tions 

were 
received 
and 

the y 

were 
not 

possessing 
the securities when they issued the BRs in 

sale transactions. 

44. 

It 
is 

vehemently submitted on 

be half 
of 

the 

accused 

No. 1 that Rakshi t lPWl J admitted that all the 

sale 
transactions 
were reversed by NHB and that 
all 

th e 
BRs were issued by the authorised officers of the 

NHB. 

Therefore, it is not the case that the BRs were 

issued 

without 
any author ity by NHB and, 
therefore, 

the 
trns. 

can 

no t be sai d to be tor�ed docume nts . 

However, 
there 
is no me r i t in th i s submission. 
The 

authority 
in 
accused 
r-.io. l 
and 2 

tor 

issuing 
8Rs 

presupposes 
that 

the 

BRs . 

were 
backed 
by 
the 

physicals 
and while issuing BRs. 

t h e physicals 
were 

ava i l abl e . 
Nei ther accused No. 1 or accused No.2 
had 

any 
author ity 
to issue BR wh 1.ch were not 
backed 
by 

physicals. 
Though accused No .1st had an author ity to 

issue BR. 
that a ut hor ity was to be exercised when the 

BRs. 

were back by the physicals. 
The accused No. 1&2 

did 
not 

have an authority to issue BR without 

being 

back by the physical secur i ty . 

4�• �. 

It 
is also submitted on behalt of accused 

No. l 

tna t 
the 
prosecution 

has �ailed to show 
any 

legal 

provision, Rule , Regu lation , Notification. Ctrcular or• 

any 
other 
prescribed mandate applicable to 
the 
NHB 

reauiring 
the 
availability 
of 
physical 
securiti es 

while 
issuing BRs . 
It is also submitted that the 8Rs 

iss ue d in this case are only bank receipts of money by

., 7 

NHB. 

It is turther submitted that it is admitted 
by 

Hosa n qa di 
lPW29J that the BRs. 
could be issued 
even 

in 
expectation of receipt ot secur ities. 
He 
turther 

pointed 
out 
that in the present case when 
the 
BRs. 

were 
issued 

in 

sale 
transactions, 

the 

physical 

securities or the BRs in lieu thereof were expected to 

be 
received 
from 
the 
Grindlays 
Sank 
in 
purchase 

transactions. 
I 
do 
not 
find 
any 
me rit 
in 
this 

submission also. It was olear that no BRwas received in 

the 
purchase transaction nor the physical 
secur ities 

were 
received 
in 
the 
purchase 

transact ions. 

Theretore, in the first place, the BRs. 
issued in the 

sale 
transaction were neither backed by the 
physical 

secur ities 
nor 
by 
BRs. 
in lieu 
of 
the 
physical 

securities. 
Even, it it is taken that the tirst sale 

transaction 
had 
taken 
place and then 
the 
purcnase 

transaction. 

Even 
then. it was to the knowledge 
ot 

the 
accused No. 1 and 2 that no physicals or BRs. 
in 

lieu 
thereof were received in purcnase transaction on 

that 
day, as all the purchase transactions were 

tat<e 

transactions. 
Theretore, it is immaterial whether the 

purchase 
transaction 
took place first and then 
sale 

transaction 
or sale transaction took place f i rst 

and 

then 
the purchase transaction. 
The fact remains that 

in neither of the transactions. there was existence ot 

physical securities or the BRs in lieu of the physical 

se curities. 
It 
is fallacious to say that 
t he 
BRs. 

are 
only bank receipts in respect of money. 
Perusal 

ot Bl{s.

is 
receipt of money but in the second paragraph there

It 
was to the knowl edge of accused

that

the 
phys ical 

securit ies were not avai lable with him nor were likely 

to 
be received later-on during the course of the

or 

even subsequent thereto. 

It is, there fore , 
clear 

that 
even 
with regard to the sale

As I have stated that it 

concerned 

with 
the 
Sale Transaction . 
This 
clear ly 

i n d i cates 

that 
accused No . 

3 and 5 were not me rely work i n g as 

an 
employees 

or as ho l de r ot power ot 

attorney 
but 

they 
were 
taking 
part in the 

business 
of 
Ha r sha d 

Mehta s 1'irm. 

48. 

With this evidence it wo u l d be necessary to 

see 

whether 
the accused Nos. 
3, 4 and 5 were the par t of 

the 

conspiracy which had two objects. one ot 

getting 

pecuniary 

advantage to Harshad Mehta and of 
cheating 

the 
t inan c i al 
institutions wi t h regard to 
the 
sale 

tr a n sactions in respect ot the securi ties wi thout they 

be in� 
backed 
bv the physicals. 
As discussed 
above, 

there 

is only evidence of issuan ce of con t r act 

notes 

under 
the 
signature ot accused No. 5 
and 
si gnatur e/ 

initials of acc use d No. 3. 
The defence of accuse d No .3 

is 
that 
he was merely an employee. 
The 
defence 
of 

accused No. 5 is of only holding Power of Attorney from 

Har shad 
Mehta. 
It is su bmi tted on bet1al. f 
ot 
these 

accused

that 

there 

is no evidence that either of these tu10 

accused 
or 
even 
accused no .4 for 
that 
matter 
had 

part icipated 

in finalisat ion of the sale transact ion, 

it is true that there is no evidence in that regard . 

It 
is 
true 
that 
there is also 
no 
evidence 
about 

invol vement 

of any of these three accused in p urch ase 

t !" ans act i on . 

However, since accused No .3 and 5 
have 

signed 

the con tract notes, the ir participation in the 

transact ion of sale of securities wh ich we re purchased 

on 
the 
very day is clea!". 
The perusal 
of 
contract 

� 

note 

t.JCJu ld shoi.1 that the t-l>re sig nator i es thereof had 

intimated 
to 
the purchasing bank of 
the 
securi ties 

that they, as per the order of the bank, ente red into 

the transaction indicated in the contract note and the 

transac tion 
indicated 
in 

the con t r ac t note is o'f 

buying 
by them for the bank, the secur ities ment ioned 

and 
the 
securities 
wh ich were ready 
for 
del ivery. 

Th is 
ob viously 

makes it clear that the accused No.3 

and 

5 

had entered into a con tract of purchase of 

securities 
obv ious ly 

from NHB for and on 

behalf 
of 

banks name ly the Synd icate Bank, State Bank of Patiala 

and 
Grindlays Bank. 

So far as other transactions of

respect 
of 
the 

transaction 
of 

sale of sec ur ity 1>.1hich took plac:e 
on 

20 .4. 1992, 

th e accused No .3 had also issued 

del ivery 

order 
addressed 

to State Bank of 

Patiala 
requi ring 

th�m 

to receive from NHB, the so ld secur ities 

name ly 

17'!. 

NTPC bonds. 
Th is evi .dence , therefore, shoi.1s 

the 

knowledge 

on t h e part of the accused No .3 and 5 about 

the 
transaction 
of 
sale 
of securi ties 
by 
NHB 
to 

di fferent 
banks and in to tal ity of the transaction it 

can be ��nfe rred that they also knew that the purchase 

+;rans act ions 

ex.istence 

1�ere 
fake 
transac tions 
without 
the 

of 

the 

s ecuri t i es 

and 
when 
the 
same 

securities 
were 
sold 
on the same day, it 
could 

be 

inferred th at they knew that the se secur it ies were not 

avai lable and the BRs issued by the accused No .1 and 2 

were 
no t 

bac�ed by t h e securities. 
Th erefore , 

the 

invol vement 
of 
accused 
Nos. 
3 
and 

5 

in 

these 

transactions is q u ite clear. 
Therefore , they could be 

said 
to 
be 
the 
member of 
the 
consp iracy 
hatched 

between 
accused 

No .1 and 2, accus e No .6 and 

accused 

Na .3 and 5. 

49. 
As 
regards , 

accused No .5 there 
is 
add itional 

ev idence 

in the form of cheques having been issued by 

him 
for 

m ak in g payment to Jyoti H. 

Mehta 

from 

the 

account of Harshad S. 
Mehta [deceased accused ]. 
That 

shows di rect invol vement of accused No .5. 

50. 
As regards accused No .4, the evidence in the form

of the company is on ly o f general 

natu re. 

The 
depos ition of Nay an Thakkar CPW21) to the 
e•ffec:t 

that 
accused No .4 was also giving instructions to him 

for 

col lect ing ch�que i.1 as also of g ene r a l nature . 

In 

fact , 
his 
evidence 
indicates 
that 
mos tly 

instructions 
were 

given to him by Sh ivraj , the 

head 

de livery 
boy. 

Th ere 
is 

f ur th e r 

ev idence 
of 
Mr. 

Jindal 

[PWlbJ , who was working with the State Bank of 

P a t i a l a. 

He 
states that for giv ing offers from 
the 

office 
of brokers Mis . 

Harshad S. 

and accused 
No .4 

and 
other s used to contact him on telephone for 
that 

purpose . 
He also states that mostly accused No .4 used 

to 

contact 

him. 

These are all 
general 
statements. 

There 

is no spec ific ev idence showing i n v o lvem e n t 

of 

accused 
No .4 in any of the transactions of sale or of 

purchase 

for 

th a t 

matter 1 
involved 
in 
this 
case . 

Th erefore , the benefit of doubt shal l have to be gi ven 

to 

the 

accused No .4, the doubt b e ing in 

respect 

of 

"''hether 
the 

accuse d No.4 \•las ot• i.1 as not a member 

of 

th e a fo r es a i d c onsp i r ac y . 

51. 

Under 

these circumstances, accused No .4 

and 
7 

sh all have to be acquitted. 

52. 
Now 
we 

sh al l have to deal w i t h the

evidence 

of R.V. 

Gupta EPW36J . 

The sanc tion 
o rd e rs 

are produced at Ex hibit -285 and 286. 
They are dated 

16th 

March, 

1994. 

Mr. 
Gupta then was 
the 
Spec ial 

Secretary 
in 

the Ministry of F in ance in the 

Banking 

Division 
and 
was also the Chai rman of the 

NHB. 
He 

states 
that 

in 
the 
month 

of 
February , 

1994, 

he 

re ceived 
a 
report 

from the CBI along with 
all 

the 

documents . 
The report and the documents were exam ined 

in legal cel l ot the NHB and thereafter the report and 

the documents were placed before him. 
He vi en t th rough 

the 
report 

and 

the 
documents 
and 
was 
sat isfied 

therefrom that there was prima facie case against both 

the 
accused 
Nos. 

1 and 2. 

Th erefore , 
he 
accorded 

sanction 
for prosecuting both the accused Nos. 
1 and 

2. 
He 

states that the sanction was prepared in 

t h e 

off ice 

in 

the 
required format and then was 
put 
up 

before 

him for his signature . 
He signed the sanc tion 

after 

reading the sanction order and find ing it to be 

corre ct . 

He clarifies that since he was the Chai rman 

of 

the NHB and accused No .1 and 2 were the 

employees 

of 

the NHB, h e was having an authority to remove both 

of 
them 

and , 

therefore , 

had 
author ity 
to 

accord 

sanc tion 

for prosecution of both the accused Nos . 

1 

and 2. 

56. 
Th is sanc tion or de r is ch allenged by both ac cused 

No .1 and 2 on the ground of la ck of authority and non 

appl icci .tion 
of 
mind by Mr. 
R.V. 
Gup ta. (PW36J . 
As 

alread y 
discussed 

abov e, it is not in 

dispute 
that 

accused 

No. 1 was brought to NHB from the RBI in 
1988 

::: Uploaded on -14/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:34:43 ::: 


sg 

and 
was 

t h e re af t e r confirmed in the NHB. 

So f ar 
as 

accused 

No .2 is con c e rn ed , he was also brought to NHB 

f rom 
outside 

and was sub se quen tly confirmed in NHB . 

It 

is 
un d isput ed pos ition that no independent 
Staff 

Regulations 

for NHB 's employees �••ere made till, 1995 . 

Th erefor-e , 

at the time when sanc tio n was accorded 

by 

Mr. 

Gup t a [PW36J, both the accused Nos . 
1. and 2 �1e re 

governed 

by the RBI Staff Regulat ions . 
It is fu rth e r 

undisputed 
that NHS was a hundred percent 
subsid iary 

of 
RB I. 
It is submi tted that as per Regulation 

No . 

47 
of the RBI Staff Regu lat ion [Exh ibit -A1 <8 >J, the 

penalty 

of dismissal could be imposed on ly on 

orders 

in 
wr iting 

signed by the Governor in the case of 
an 

officer 

other than an officer in Grade -"A" . 

There 

is 
no 
d ispu t e 

that accused No .1 and 2 

are 

Grade-A 

officers. 
It is, therefore, vehemently submi tted that 

sanct ion 
could be accorded only by the au thor i ty 
wno 

had 
power 

to remove accused Nos.• 
1 and 2 

f rom 
the 

serYice 
and as per the Regu lation NU . 
4'/ of the 
RBl 

St a•ff Regulat ions that authority i.1as on ly t h e Gov e r nor 

of 

RBI 
and none else. 
The sanc t i on accorded by 

Mr. 

Gup t a tPW36 J, who was on ly the Chai rman of the NHB did 

not have any authority to remove accused Nos. 
1 an d 2 

and , the re fo r e , could not accord sanc tion to prosecute 

them . 
Ho1>1e ve r, 

I 

do 
not find any 
merit 
in 
this 

submi ss ion . 

It 
has to be noted in the 
first 
pl ace 

that 
both the accused No .1 and 2 w� r e absorbed in NH� 

t•th ich 
\11 as 
an 
independent institution though 
was 
a 

subs idiary of RB I. 
Wh en it is said that the employ e es 

of 
NHB 
were governed by RBI Staff 
Regulat ions 

that 

::: Uploaded on -14/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:34:43 ::: 


139 

only means that till the independent Statf Regulations 

for 
the 
employees of the NHB are made the RBI 
Staff 

Regulations 
would 
be applicable to them. 
That 
does 

not 

mean that the NHB employees were continued to 

be 

the 
employees ot the RBI and would be governed by RBI 

Regulations. 
For 

the conditions of the services 

ot 

the 

staff ot the RBI, the RBI Staff Regulation 
would 

be 
made 
applicable. 

It 

is, 

th er etor e , 
beyond 

aopre nension 
that as per Regulation No. 
47, the 
RBI 

Governor 
would 
be 

the authority to remove 

the 
NHB 

employees, 
who 
does 

not work under the control 
ot 

�over nor. 
Since 
the 
NHB 
became 
an 
independent 

institution. 
the 
statt working in the NHB 
would 
be 

regulated 
by the top officers of the NHB only and not 

by 

the 

RBI Gove rnor. 
In absence ot any 
regulation, 

the 
Chairman 
be ing 
the 
highest 
author ity 
ot 
NHB 

obviously 

had an authority to remove accused Nos . 

and 

Z from the service. 

The RBI Staff Regulation No. 

47 
speaks 
that the heights authority of the RBI 
has 

the 
authority 
to pass an order of dismissal 
against 

the 
RBI 

Grade -A officer. 
Theretore, 

synonym 
will 

have 

to 
be drawn therefrom meaning thereby that 
the 

highest 

author ity ot NHB would be having those powers 

of 

dismissal 

or removal of any officer of 

Grade 
-A 

working 

in National Housing Ba nk. 
It is under 

these 

circumstances, 
that 
Mr. 

Gupta 
LPW36 J 

being 
the 

highest 
ranking 
officer 
wor king 
with 
NHB 
had 
an 

author ity to dismiss or remove accused No. l and 2 from 

the 

NHB's services and therefore, he had an authority 

to accord sanction tor their prosecu tion.

In the present case, the repo�t of 
the 

Investigating Officer along with documents were p l aced 

b�fore 

him 

and 
hav ing cons idered the same � 
he 
was 

sat isfied 
that 
there 

was prima iacie 

case

and

accorded

This 

was quite su fficient to show his app lic a tion 

of 

mind wh ile according sanction. 
As such , I do not find 

any 
me rit 
in the contention raised on behalf of 
the 

accused No .1 and 2 that the sanction is bad. 

58. 

C�min 9 back to the nature of of fence c omm i t ted by

No .1 and 2 with regard to t h e char� e Nos.

to __ .8..L 

accused 

No .1 an d 2 Nere the 

pub lic: 
servants 

1>1ork ing 

in 
the NHS. 

Ac c use d No .1 was 
in-charge 
of 

FMG . 

The job of FMG was to enter i n to the transaction 

of purchase of securi tie s and enter into ready forward 

transaction 
with a view to lending mon ey directly 
to 

the 

banks 

and 
not any p ri va te party. 
The 

NH� J 

t.1as 

authorised 
to 
lend money on ly and not borrow 
money. 

As 
such , 
the 
NHB 's fund we re ent rusted 
to 
accused 

No . l. 

The accused No .1 had dominion over the fund of 

the 
NHB . 
The 

accused No .1 and 2 

pursuant 
to 
the 

fu lfilment 

of the ob ject of the consp i racy had 

shown 

to 
have 
entered

a purchase price of th� securities vih en there l>tas$ 

(' &.\.¥ c�• ..._ _ � 

in fact, no transaction of securities at all and thus ,

ob ject 
of 

the NHB of lending mon ey by entering 

into 

the 
transaction 
of purchase ot securities and 
thus,

�2 

committed 
cr iminal 
breach ot trust pursuant 
to 
the 

conspiracy 
in respect ot the purchase transaction 
as 

indicated 

above. 

It is established that accused No .2 

had entered into criminal conspiracy with accused No. l 

and 
others in doing this illegal act. 
Thus , both the 

accused 

No. 1 

and 

2 

have 
comm itted 
an 
offence 

punishable under section 409 r/w section 120LB) ot the 

Indian 
Penal 
Code 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
purchase 

transactions. 

59. 

WiU1 regard to the transaction dated 

20. 4. 1992, 

as 
discussed 
above, the transaction of 

purchase 
ot 

securities 
was 
finalised 

by 

accused 
No. 1 
as 

represented 
to Jambukeshwaran LPWZ�J by accused No .z. 

lhus, 
even with regard to that transaction, both 
the 

accused 
have 
committed 
ottence 
punishable 

under 

section 409 r/w section 120LBJ. 

60. 
The charge Nos. 
9 to 15 are against accused NOs. 

6 
and 

7 
for 

abatement ot the breach 
ot 

trust 

in 

rela tion 
to 
seven cheques commi tted by accused 
No. 1 

and 

2. 

As discussed above, there is no evidence 
as 

against 
accused 
No. 7. 
However , as 
against 
accused 

No .6, 
there is a�ple evi dence to show that she abated 

accused 
No. 1 
and 

2 

in 
committing 
the 
aforesaid 

cr iminal 
breach 

of 

trust 

by 
enter ing

transaction 
of

by

accused 
No .6 got the amounts ot the cheaues 

to 
Harshad 
Mehta•s account with Grindlays 

thus 
abetted 
accused No. 1 and 2 to complete 

act 
of 
commi tting 
cr iminal 
breach 
of 

crediged 

Bank 
and 

*** 

the 

trust. 

Theretore, 
the 
oftence committed by accused No .6 
is 

under 
section 
409 
r/w section 109 and 1208 
of 
the 

Indian Penal Code. 

61. 
The charge No. 
16 to 22 are against accused Nos. 

3 
to 

7 

and l and 2 for abating 
in 
commi tting 
the 

offence ot misappropr iating the amount by transferrino 

the 
same 
to the account of Harshad 
Mehta 
[deceased 

accused ]. 
This 
offence is punishable under 
sect1oh 

403 
r/w section 109 r/w section 120(BJ of the 
Indian 

Penal 
Code. 
So 
far 
as 
accused 
No. 4 
and 
7 
are 

concerned, 
as 
discussed above, there is no 
evidence 

against them tor having committed this offence or even 

ot 

conspiracy under section 1208 of the Indian 
Penal 

Code. 
Howeve r, 
as 
against accused No. 6, 
there 

is 

sutticient 
evidence 
that 
accused No. 6 had 
got 
the 

amount 
ot 
seven cheoues credited to the 
account 
ot 

Harshad 
Mehta 
Ldeceased 
accused J 
by 
giving 

instr�ctions 
in 
that regard and abated accused 
No. l 

and 
2 to dishonestly misappropriate those funds. 
so 

far 
as 
accused 
No. 3 and 5 are concerned, 
there 
is 

evidence 
of their involvement in the conspiracy 
on ly 

with 
regard to second part and not with regard to the 

first pa rt, therefore, they can not be found guilty of 

ottence 
punishable under section 403 r/w section 
109 

r/w 
section 
'ZOLBJ 
of 
the 
Indian

It 

is clear that accused No.

furtherance 

of 
the aforesaid conspiracy had prepared fifteen 

BRs 

in 

respect 
of sale transactions and when those 
BRs. 

were not backed by secur ities, shown them to have been 

sold in the sale transactions and with clear intention 

that 
the 
banks 
which 
have entered 
into 
the 
sale 

transaction with NHB would part with the money and, in 

tact, they had issued various cheques in tav ou r of NHB 

and those cneaue were deposited with the NHB• s accou nt 

with the RSI. 
Therefore, the offence punishable under 

section

r/w sec tion 467 r/w sectio n 1208 o f 

the 

India n 
Penal Code. 
Th is offence has also been p roved 

against accused No .1 and 2 as they had used the fo rged 

f i fteen 

BRs . 
in 
sale 
transactions 
as 
genuine 

docum�nts 

knowing t h a t the BRs were not b ac k ed by the 

s ecu r i t i es . 

It 
is, howe ver, submitted on behalf 
of 

accused 
No .1 

and 2 that the evidence that is led 

by 

the prosecution is to the effect that these BRs . 
were 

not 
backed by the phys ical securities. 
However, this 

aspect 
had not been mentioned in any of the aforesaid 

charges 
Nos. 

23 to 37 and charges Nos . 

38 

to 
52. 

What is, howe ver, mentioned in the charges is that the 

BRs . 
were 
made 
by 
accused No. 
1 
and 
2 

wi thout 

author ity 
of 
NHB . 
Therefore, it is 
submitted 
that 

there 

i s 

no ev idence to show that BRs . 
were 
issued 

wi thout 
authority of NHB. 
So far as accused No .2 
is 

concerned , 
it 
is 
ad mitted position that he 
had 
no 

authority to issue BRs . 
but there is evidence to show 

that 
on e BR was issued by the accused No .2. 
Using of 

1•iord 
"authority" , as discussed abov e, meant that 
the 

person 
having aLt t ho r i t y coLtld on ly the issLte BRs

the

means that t•:h ile issuing .bR, it

in 

lieu 
of

without 
holding 
the 
phys ical 

secur i t i e s 

in

It

that 
these securities were the same securities

in lieu thereof , 
As such , sale

under secti on 420 r /w sect ion 120B cf the India n Penal 

Code has b�en e$tab l ished against accused Nos .l and 2. 

68. 

In th is regard , it is subm itted on behalf of the 

accused 
No .l 
and 2 that the ch a rge s do 
not 
mention 

anyth ing 
about 
the 
BRs 
not 
be ing 
backed 

by 

the 

physicals 
and 
also 
about the 
false 
representation 

having 

been 

made by any of accused No .1 and 

accused 

No .2. 
The 
charges 
also do not state that 
the 
8Rs 

falsely 
stated 

that they were backed by 
securities. 

rt 

is 

also submitted that no witness hag• said 
that 

the 
banks 
were 

gi ven to b�lieve that the 

BRs 

were 

bac�ed 

by the physicals or that they were induced 
to 

part 
with fun ds due to any false representat ion 
made 

in 
the 

BRs. 
Therefore 1 it is submi tted 
that 
this 

evidence 
has not been est ab l ished . 

How ev er, I do no t 

find 
any 
merit 
in 
th is 
subm ission 

also. 

ft 
is 

necessary 
to see the manner in wh ich the transac tions 

cf 
sale 
and purchase of securit ies are entered 
i n to 

bett11een 

inter 

the t1,a10 b anks . 
Such transactions are 
ahrays 

bank transactions. 
It is not necessary 
that 

there 
should be direct evidence with regard to 
false 

representation 

or with regard �o the BRs being ba cked 

by 

the 
phys ic: als. 

The 

mann e r 

in 
wh ich 
such 

transactions 

take .place is that the deal is final ised 

on 
telephone or with the intervent ion of the 
bro�er. 

The 
broker issues the contract note in f a v our of 
his 

client, 
in this case the purchasing banks , and 
after 

ne�o t i at ions 
with the officer working in the NHB 

the 

transact ion 
is 
final ised . 
Once the 

transaction 
is 

::: Uploaded on -14/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:34:43 ::: 


f i n a l ised , 

there is always an understand ing that 
the 

physical 
secur ities 

or BRs in lieu thereof wou ld 

be 

under l i. Ji � 

understandi ng 

and 
con fidence that the BRs 
would 
be 

delivered 

against 

the c:h eque . 

There 
is 

b ac k ed 

by 

the 
securiti es . 
It 
i s , 

Lin der 
thes e 

circumstances, 
that 
the 

trans act ions 

of 

sale 

of 

sec urities 
by 

one bank to an o th e r bank takes place. 

In 
this 
case, 
there is ev idence to 
show 
that 
the 

chequ e s 
issued 

by 

purchasing banks 

were 
delivered 

ag ainst the BR.s . 

Th is ac t itself is i n d i c a t i v e of the 

fact 
that 
the 
representation 

t-tas 
made 

to 

the 

purchasing 
bank 

that 

the 
BRs were 
backed 
by 
the 

securities 
and 

it 

is, therefore, t h e 

cheques 

were 

delivered 
by the purchas ing bank. 
When the BRs 

were 

del ivered 

ag ainst 
th� cheque, it was represented 

to 

that 
bank that the BRs were backed by the 

securit ies 

but 
to 
the knowledge of accused Nos . 

1 and 2 
these 

Bf.ts . 

were 
not 
backed 
by 
the 

s ecur i t i e s 

and, 

therefore , 
when 

the 
BRs 
were 

issued 
by 
them 
in 

c omp l e t ing 
the 
transact ion of sal e, they liad made 

a 

false 
representation 
to 
the 
purchasing 
bank 
for 

parting with the amount of the price of the se cu r i ties 

ir. 

the 
form 
of 
cheques. 

I t 

is , 

under 

these 

c i rcums t anc e s , 
that 
th e cheat ing of 
the 
purc:has in9

has taken p l ac e due to dishonest and

In this particular case , the large amounts

506 cr•ores were siphoned ou t"" t\,. NHB

through Grind lays 8ank, they were transferred to

Th :i. s \•1as 

obviously 
done in conn iva nce with the accused Nos .

Accused No .1 be ing 

in 

charge of FMG of NHB. A l though accused No .2 was 

working under acc use d No .1, as discussed abov e, he was 

a 

pub l i c servant and was expected to see 

that 
the 

transact ions 
are 
carried out legally 
and 
properly. 

Both 

the accus ed fai led to se cu red the s e cu r i t i es or

It is tru� that there is

both these accused do not deserve leniency as tried to 

be pu t-forth on th e i r behal f. 

81 . 

So 

far as accused No. 
3 and 5 
are 
conc erned, 

the ir 
role 
was on ly of s igning th e 
c on t rac t 
n o tes . 

Accused Na .5 had �i thdrawn certain amoun ts from the 

account of Harshad S . . Mehta [deceased accused] hav ing 

got 

the Power of Attorney from the Harshad S. Mehta . 

lh� 
accus ed Na .3 was on ly an employee. 
Accus e d 

No .5 

did not have direct deal i n g s in the secur ities but was 

deal �ng 
in 

Stack Market and was ac t i ng on behalf 

of 

the 
Harshad

Meh ta 

(deceased

in 
the 

absence 
of

Cons idering these aspects, 

Mehta 
[deceased 
accused]. 

.. 
�> 

accused No .3 deserv e� ta be 

,, 
f 

shot.m leniency to some extent. 

82. 

l ady , 

Sa far as accused No .6 is concerned , she is a 

age d 55 years. She acted on l y as per the then 

establ ished 
bank ing practice of giving cred it of 

RBI 

cheques to the consti tu'ent 's accoun ts 1t.1hen the cheque 

is 

presented by the constituent o r the 

constituent 's 

representat ive. 

At the same time 1 it has to be noted 

that 

when such cheques of large amounts we r e rece ived 

in 

the Grindlays Bank , which were d rawn in favour 
of 

Grindlays 
Ban k, it was necessary to have some wr i tten 

mand ate 

for crediting the amounts of those che�ues ta 

the co�sti tuent 's account and that was no t locked into 

as 

probably there was a p r ac tic e . 

1•he ev idence 
does 

disc:: lose 
that 

th e cheqLtes used to be brought by 

the 

constituents 

and the bank's emp loyees were acting

instructions

Accused 

No .6 
being a lady and ac ted on ly as per the
