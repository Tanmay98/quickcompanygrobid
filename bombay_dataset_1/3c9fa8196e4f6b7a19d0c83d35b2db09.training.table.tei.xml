<lb/> 
            <note>Mr. Khedkar, learned advocate representing the petitioner<lb/> counters such preliminary objection by placing reliance on a decision of<lb/> the Supreme Court reported in (2007) 14 SCC 108 : Deepa Gourang<lb/> Murdeshwar Katre vs. Principal, V.A.V. College of Arts and others.<lb/> According to him, the said decision is an authority for the proposition that<lb/> if an order has been passed by a Court of law based on fraud or<lb/> misrepresentation, the Court can recall its order in exercise of its inherent<lb/> power. It is, therefore, submitted that this Court may examine whether the<lb/> contention of the petitioner that the judgment and order dated February<lb/> 27, 2020 was obtained by misrepresentation has substance or not; if yes,<lb/> the Court may proceed to grant such relief as it may consider appropriate<lb/> in the circumstances.<lb/> 4]<lb/> Before dealing with the preliminary objection, it would be<lb/> appropriate for us to notice what was under challenge in W.P.

As regards other<lb/> Associate Professors who have been promoted but who have not<lb/> been impleaded in these writ petitions, the matter is left to the<lb/> wisdom of the University to take appropriate steps in accordance<lb/> with law if so advised. It is clarified that we have not examined the<lb/> legality of the promotions of such Associate Professors who are not<lb/> parties in these writ petitions. It is also declared that Resolution<lb/> No.26 of 2019 passed by the Executive Council dated 07.01.2019 to<lb/> the extent it has the effect of modifying the criteria prescribed in<lb/> the matter of effecting promotions which is in variance with<lb/> Statutes 52 and 73 would not operate till the procedure as<lb/> contemplated by Section 38 of the said Act is complied with.
