JUDGMENT RESERVED ON 
: 26TH AUGUST 2008 
JUDGMENT PRONOUNCED ON : 25TH SEPTEMBER 2008 

JUDGMENT (Per Swatanter Kumar, C.J.) 

RELEVANT FACTS: 

Mohd. Riyazur Rehman Siddiqui met with an accident on 30 th 

September 1986 on Bidar-Udgir road while he was driving a motor-cycle 

No. MZV-6233. According to him, while he was driving the vehicle at a 

very moderate speed, the driver of jeep bearing No. MZV-6437 who was 

driving the vehicle rashly and negligently gave a dash to the motor-cycle and 

resultantly he sustained injuries. A case under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of 

the Indian Penal Code was registered with the Police Station, Udgir. The 

Appellant resultantly of the accident sustained permanent disability to the 

extent of 48%. He filed a Petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles 

Act, 1988 being Case No. 26 of 1987 before the Motor Accident Claims

Tribunal, Latur, which was contested and decided finally by the Tribunal 

vide its judgment and award dated 5 th May 1989 awarding compensation of 

Rs.51,000/-only with interest at the rate of 10% per annum from the date of 

the claim petition. This judgment of the Tribunal was impugned by the 

Claimant by filing First Appeal No.638 of 1989 before this Court praying for 

enhancement of the compensation awarded. The owner-driver of the jeep 

died on 16 th July, 1987 during the pendency of the Claim Petition before the 

Tribunal. The Insurance Company had denied its liability and the present 

Appeal was only preferred against the Respondent No.1-owner of the 

vehicle. The Deputy Director of Health Services-original Respondent No.1, 

being owner of the jeep also preferred Appeal being First Appeal No. 637 of 

1989 impugning the judgment of the Tribunal. First Appeal No.637 of 1989 

was dismissed by a learned Single Judge of this Court vide common 

judgment dated 12 th February 2004. The Appeal filed by the Claimant (First 

Appeal No.638 of 1989) was partly allowed and the compensation was 

enhanced to Rs.56,000/-with interest at the rate of 9% per annum. 

Dissatisfied from the judgment of the learned Single Judge, the Claimant 

filed Letters Patent Appeal No. 35 of 2005 praying for further enhancement.

2. 
Civil Application No. 1407 of 2006 has been filed in Letters 

Patent Appeal (Stamp) No. 20447 of 2006 for condonation of delay of 212 

days caused in filing Letters Patent Appeal against judgment of the learned 

Single Judge in First Appeal No. 129 of 1998. 

There was no serious objection on behalf of the learned Counsel 

appearing for the Respondents for condonation of delay in filing the 

present Appeal. We have perused the Application. Since sufficient 

cause for condonation of delay is shown, the Civil Application is 

allowed. The delay of 212 days in filing the present appeal is 

condoned. The Civil Application is accordingly disposed of. Registry 

to register and number the Letters Patent Appeal accordingly. 

3. 
First Appeal No. 129 of 1998 was filed challenging judgment 

and award of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Jalna. The Claimants 

therein are the dependents of deceased Kalyan Takale, aged 28 years, who 

died on 16 th April 1995 due to injuries sustained in an accident arising out of 

use of motor vehicle which occurred on 15 th April 1995. The accident

occurred when motor-cycle No.MH-21 driven by the deceased was dashed 

by Taxi No. MH-20-A-7090 driven by Respondent No.1 in a rash or 

negligent manner. The taxi was owned by Respondent No.2 and was 

insured with Respondent No.3. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Jalna 

by Judgment and Award dated 4 th April 1997 directed Respondent Nos.1 to 

3 to pay amount of Rs.1,50,000/-(inclusive of no fault liability) to 

Claimants with interest at the rate of 12% per annum. The Judgment/Award 

of the Tribunal was challenged in First Appeal No. 129 of 1998 in which the 

learned Single Judge by Judgment and Award dated 25 th January 2005 

modified the Award by substituting figure of Rs.2,00,000/-(Two lakhs) in 

place of Rs.1,00,000/-(One lakh). This Judgment/Award of the learned 

Single Judge is challenged by filing Letters Patent Appeal (Stamp) No. 

20447 of 2005 by Claimants seeking further enhancement in the amount of 

compensation. 

ORDER OF REFERENCE: 

4. 
When the matter came up for hearing before a Division Bench 

of this Court on 22 nd February 2008, the learned Counsel appearing for the 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


7 

respective parties relied upon different judgments of this Court as well as of 

the Supreme Court to argue for and against the very maintainability of the 

Letters Patent Appeal in view of the provisions of Sections 100A of the 

Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 

(hereinafter referred to as the "M.V. Act") Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. 

The Division Bench of this Court noticed the view expressed by another 

Division Bench of this Court in the case of Asha d/o Bhalchandra Joshi vs 

National Insurance Co. Ltd., 2008 (1) Mh.L.J. 724, and the view of the 

other Benches and noticing the difference of opinion expressed in different 

judgments, directed the matter to be referred to a larger Bench for settling 

the legal issue involved in the present case with regard to the maintainability 

of the Letters Patent Appeal. 

5. 
It will be useful to refer to the Order of Reference dated 22 nd 

February 2008 which reads as under:-

"1. 
The learned counsel, appearing for the 
appellant, stated that Full Bench Judgment of this High 
Court in the case of "Laxminarayan vs. Shivlal Gujar, 
2003 (1) MPLJ (FB) 10 = AIR 2003 MP 49 (FB)" was 
considered by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


8 

"Asha d/o Bhalchandra Joshi vs. National Insurance 
Company Ltd., 2008 (1) Mh. L.J. 724" and in paragraph 
No. 28 of the said judgment, while declining to adjudicate 
upon the effect of Section 100-A of the Code of Civil 
Procedure on maintainability of the letters patent appeal, 
arising from the award of the Tribunal, it was held that the 
appeal is maintainable. 

2. 
On the other hand, learned counsel, appearing 
for the respondent, contended that besides the fact that the 
Full Bench's conclusions or dictums could not have been 
varied or dilated by the Division Bench and also the fact that 
the Supreme Court in the case of "Kamal Kumar Dutta & 
another vs. Ruby General Hospital Ltd., & others, 2008 
AIR SCW 4594", has held that such an appeal is not 
maintainable, the Supreme Court had overruled the view of 
the Bombay High Court taken in AIR 2004 Bombay 38. 

3. 
In view of above mentioned circumstances, we 
feel it appropriate and the principles of judicial propriety 
demand that this matter is placed before the Full Bench. 
Accordingly, this matter be placed before the Full Bench. 
The Registry shall communicate the date fixed for hearing 
of the matter before the Full Bench to the parties." 

QUESTIONS OF LAW FORMULATED: 

6. 
In order to appropriately deal with the different questions 

which require consideration of the Court, it will be desirable to 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


9 

formulate the questions which are likely to arise repeatedly before the 

Court and even otherwise are questions of law of some significance as 

under :-

(a) 
Whether, upon amendment to Section 100A of 

the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ( with effect 

from 1 st July, 2002 ), the Letters Patent Appeal 

against the judgment rendered by the learned 

Single Judge of 
High 
Court would be 

maintainable ? 

(b) 
Whether an appeal arising out of special statute 

like Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 ( even if 

assuming that it is a special statute ) would be 

maintainable under Clause 15 of the Letter 

Patent against the judgment passed by the 

learned Single Judge of this Court in exercise of 

its appellate jurisdiction ? 

RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF LAW AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


10 

LEGAL ISSUES FORMULATED. 

7. 
The language of Section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure is 

specific but still of wide connotation and impact. It contemplates that 

in absence of any specific provision to the contrary nothing in the Code 

shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any special or local law, 

special judicial jurisdiction or power conferred or any special form of 

procedure prescribed under any other law. This Section, upon its 

plain construction, indicates the purpose for incorporating such a 

provision. The Code of Civil procedure being a Code to control and 

regulate the proceedings before the Courts under various remedies and 

enforcing law makes a clear exception in regard to operation and 

effect of a specific provision contained in any other law unless some 

provision of Code specifically excludes an application of that other 

provision. General Rule is that wherever a special provision renders 

the general provision incapable to apply to a remedy, then the 

provisions of the Code will not limit or affect such special provision. 

8. 
An appeal to be filed under a decree or order passed by 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


11 

the Court of competent jurisdiction in exercise of its original or 

appellate jurisdiction is again controlled by the specific provision of 

the Code. Under Section 96 of the Code, an appeal shall lie from 

every decree passed by any Court exercising original jurisdiction to the 

Court authorized to hear appeals from the decision of such Court. 

An appeal from the appellate decree is permissible under the provision 

of Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, where it is stated that 

an appeal shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in 

appeal by any Court subordinate to the High Court, if the High Court 

is satisfied that the case involves substantial questions of law. 
In 

terms of Section 101 of the Code, no appeal is provided from an 

appellate decree which is passed by the High Court itself. Under 

Section 102 of the Code which was also amended by the Code of Civil 

Procedure Amendment Act, 2002 with effect from 1 st July, 2002, no 

second appeal would be maintainable from any decree when the 

subject matter of the original suit is for recovery of money not 

exceeding Rs.25,000/-. By this very amendment Act, Section 100A 

was amended which opens with non obstante clause and which takes 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


12 

within its sweep even the provisions of Letters patent of any High 

Court. Not only that it even renders any instrument having the force 

of law or any other law for the time being in force ineffective. Thus, 

the provision of Section 100A is an exception to the appeals provided 

under other statutes and it in no uncertain terms mandates that where 

any appeal from the original or appellate decree or order is heard and 

decided by the learned Single Judge of the High Court, no further 

appeal shall lie from such judgment and decree. 

9. 
Section 104 in no uncertain terms provides that an appeal 

shall lie from the orders stated in that Section and save as otherwise 

provided in the body of this Code or by any law for the time being in 

force and from no other orders. This process of first and second 

appeals specified under the Code is further regulated and controlled by 

the provisions of Orders XLI, XLII and XLIII, respectively, of the Code 

of Civil Procedure. They provide as to how and in what manner 

appeal from an appellate decree or order is maintainable and would be 

decided and also the procedure to be adopted by the Court while 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


13 

deciding such appeals including the power of the Court under those 

provisions. 

10. 
It will be appropriate to examine the legislative 

amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure. The Code of Civil 

Procedure, 1882 was replaced by Code of 1908. However, Section 

100A was introduced for the first time by amending Act 104 of 1976. 

The intent was to bar third appeal before a Division Bench of the High 

Court from a judgment of the Single Judge deciding a matter in a 

Second Appeal. By the amending Act of 1999, the earlier Section 

100A was substituted. Section 100A as introduced by amending Act 

46 of 1999, though attained the assent of the President on 30 th 

December 1999, it was not enforced because of various factors. Clause 

(b) of Section 100A was subsequently deleted finally and as already 

noticed, by the amending Act of 2002, present Section 100A was 

introduced. Present Section 100A reads as under :-

"Section 100A. Notwithstanding anything contained in 
any Letters Patent for any High Court or in any other 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


14 

instrument having the force of law or in any other law 
for the time being in force, where any appeal from an 
original or appellate decree or order is heard and 
decided by a single judge of a High Court, no further 
appeal shall lie from the judgment and decree of such 
single judge." 

11. 
The design behind frequent amendments of these 

provisions is obvious. Legislative attempt has been to reduce the 

number of Appeals which a litigant could prefer against an original or 

appellate decree. Where the Single Judge hears an appeal from an 

appellate decree or order, the question of there being a further appeal 

would not arise as it is not so contemplated. Where the regular First 

Appeal is heard by a Division Bench, the question of there being an 

intra Court appeal does not arise. It is only in cases where the value is 

not substantial that the Rules of the High Court may provide for the 

regular First Appeal to be heard by a learned Single Judge and in such 

a case to give further right of appeal may not be convenient as it may 

amount to over-loading the judicial work. 
Since the Appeal is 

creation of the statute, no prejudice would be caused to the litigant by 

not providing intra Court appeal even where the value involved is

15 

large. Newly incorporated Section 100A in clear and specific terms 

prohibits further appeal against the judgment and decree or an order 

of a learned Single Judge to a Division Bench. 

12. 
It is thus obvious that the provisions of Section 100A 

curtailed the right of intra-Court appeal available to a litigant where 

the Single Judge of the High Court was deciding a matter in exercise 

of its appellate jurisdiction. The object and reasons for introduction of 

Section 100A is another aspect which can be examined by the Court. 

The Malimath Committee had examined the issue of further appeal 

and recommended suitable amendments to then existing Section 100A 

so as to bar further Appeal. 

13. 
In the case of Salem Advocate Bar Association, Tamil Naidu 

vs Union of India, AIR 2003 SC 189, the Supreme Court while 

examining the constitutional validity of the amending Act held that the 

provisions of Section 100A were not unreasonable and did not place 

any unjustifiable restriction by removing the right to file intra-court 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


16 

appeal and held as under :-

"15. Section 100-A deals with two types of cases 
which are decided by a single Judge. One is where the 
single Judge hears an appeal from an appellate decree 
or order. The question of there being any further 
appeal in such a case cannot and should not be 
contemplated. Where, however, an appeal is filed 
before the High Court against the decree of a trial 
Court, a question may arise whether any further appeal 
should be permitted or not. Even at present depending 
upon the value of the case, the appeal from the original 
decree is either heard by a single Judge or by a Division 
Bench of the High Court. Where the regular first 
appeal so filed is heard by a Division Bench, the 
question of there being an intra-Court appeal does not 
arise. It is only in cases where the value is not 
substantial that the rules of the High Court may 
provide for the regular first appeal to be heard by a 
single Judge. In such a case to give a further right of 
appeal where the amount involved is nominal to a 
Division Bench will really be increasing the workload 
unnecessarily. We do not find that any prejudice 
would be caused to the litigants by not providing for 
intra-Court appeal, even where the value involved is 
large. In such a case, the High Court by Rules, can 
provide that the Division Bench will hear the regular 
first appeal. No fault can, thus, be found with the 
amended provision Section 100-A." 

14. 
Of course, the application of Section 100A is stated to be 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


17 

prospective and would not affect the right and remedies of an 

Appellant who had filed the Appeal prior to 1 st July 2002. In other 

words, accrued right of appeal vested in a suitor was not affected. 

This view was also taken by a Full Bench of the Punjab & Haryana 

High Court in the case of Parashottam Dass vs State of Haryana, AIR 

2003 P&H 301. The Full Bench of this Court in the case of Rahul 

Sharad vs Ratnakar, 2004 (3) Mh. L.J. 706, took the same view which 

is approved by the Apex Court in Bento De Souza Egipsy vs Yvette 

Alvares Colaco, (2004) 13 SCC 438. The Supreme Court in a more 

recent case of Kamla Devi vs Kushal Kanwar and another, (2006) 13 

SCC 295 referring to Bento De Souza (supra) and Sanjay Z Rane vs 

Saibai S Dubaxi, (2004) 13 SCC 439 wherein it is opined that Section 

100A of the Code has no retrospective effect observed that the Letters 

Patent Appeal filed prior to coming into force of the 2002 Act would 

be maintainable. 

15. 
The right of Appeal is a substantive right. The vested right 

of appeal can be taken away only by a subsequent enactment if so 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


18 

provided expressly or by necessary intendment and not otherwise. 

16. 
The Supreme Court in the case of Garikapati Veeraya vs N 

Subbiah Choudhry, AIR 1957 SC 540, spelt out the five propositions as 

precepts to right of appeal. The formulated propositions read as 

under :-

(i) That the legal pursuit of a remedy, suit, appeal and 
second appeal are really but steps in a series of 
proceedings all connected by an intrinsic unity and 
are to be regarded as one legal proceeding. 

(ii) The right of appeal is not a mere matter of 
procedure but is a substantive right. 

(iii) The institution of the suit carries with it the 
implication that all rights of appeal then in force 
are preserved to the parties thereto till the rest of 
the career of the suit. 

(iv) The right of appeal is a vested right and such a 
right to enter the superior Court accrues to the 
litigant and exists as on and from the date the lis 
commences and although it may be actually 
exercised when the adverse judgment is 
pronounced such right is to be governed by the law 
prevailing at the date of the institution of the suit 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


19 

or proceeding and not by the law that prevails at 
the date of its decision or at the date of the filing 
of the appeal. 

(v) This vested right of appeal can be taken away only 
by a subsequent enactment, if it so provides 
expressly or by necessary intendment and not 
otherwise. 

17. 
Once the Legislature has decided to take away the right of 

Second Appeal the intra-Court appeals are impermissible specifically in 

face of the fact that constitutional validity of Section 100A has been 

upheld. The scope of Section 100A is so wide that it would take into 

its sweep not only other laws but even the Letters Patent of a High 

Court. The intention of the Legislature in taking away of right of 

appeal by abolishing an intra-Court appeal to a Bench of two Judges of 

the very High Court against a decision rendered by a Single Judge, is 

in no way prejudicial to the protected right of appeal of a litigant. The 

Scheme of Section 100A thus indicates that intra-Court appeal from an 

appellate jurisdiction of a Single Judge of the High Court is not 

permissible.

18. 
The Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 is considered and was 

enacted as social welfare legislation to provide adequate compensation 

to the people who sustained bodily injuries or to dependents of 

persons who are killed in vehicular accident expeditiously. This Act 

has been considered even as a self-contained Code as it provides 

methodology to be adopted for institution of claim petition, powers of 

the Tribunal and passing of an award and how such an award would 

be executed. The Tribunal is established for adjudicating such claims 

by a State Notification issued under the provisions of Section 165 of 

the Act. On receipt of an application for compensation claimed under 

Section 166 of the Act, the Claims Tribunal is expected to issue 

notice/afford an opportunity of being heard to parties, hold inquiry 

into the claim and then to make an award determining the amount of 

compensation payable to the claimants. The Tribunal determines all 

questions of law and fact while arriving at a conclusion. The 

jurisdiction of the Tribunal does not limit to determine compensation 

but even as to the party/parties liable to pay compensation and its 

extent.

21 

19. 
While holding an inquiry as contemplated under Section 

168 of the Act, the Claims Tribunal has to follow summary procedure 

as the Tribunal thinks fit, subject to the rules made in this behalf. 

However, it has all the powers of a civil court for the purpose of taking 

evidence on oath and of enforcing the attendance of witnesses and of 

compelling the discovery and production of documents and material 

objects and for such other purposes as may be prescribed. Further the 

Claims Tribunal shall be deemed to be a civil court for all purposes of 

Section 195 and Chapter XXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 

1973. Section 175 mandates that where any Claims Tribunal has been 

constituted for any area, no civil court shall have jurisdiction to 

entertain any question relating to any claim for compensation which 

may be adjudicated upon by the Claims Tribunal. 
The State 

Government is competent to frame rules for the purposes of carrying 

into effect the provisions of Sections 165 to 174 of the Act and it can 

frame rules which may provide for the matters indicated in that 

section and in particular, the procedure to be followed by a Claims

Tribunal in holding an inquiry under the said Chapter XXVI and in 

terms of Section 176(c) of the Act, the powers vested in a civil court 

which may be exercised by a Claims Tribunal. 

20. 
In exercise of its power vested in it under Section 176, the 

State of Maharashtra has framed rules known as "Maharashtra Motor 

Vehicles Rules, 1989" and Rules 275 and 276 thereof deal with the 

powers of a civil court which may be exercised by Claims Tribunal and 

the procedure to be followed by a Claims Tribunal in holding inquiries 

respectively. The Tribunal is fully empowered to exercise powers 

vested in a civil court in relation to the procedural matters and is 

vested with wide powers including Sections 151, 152 and 153 of the 

Code. 
Some of the other provisions of the Code of Criminal 

Procedure are also applicable to the proceedings before the Tribunal. 

Some of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure i.e. Orders V, VI, 

VII, IX, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII, 

XXIV, XXVI, XXVII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXX, XXXII, XXXVII AND XXXIX are 

also applicable to the proceedings before the Tribunal. 
These 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


23 

provisions clearly indicate that the Tribunal has all trapping of a civil 

court may be in stricto senso it is not a court within the meaning of the 

provisions of Code of Civil Procedure. The provisions of the Code of 

Civil Procedure by and large are applicable in all matters to the 

proceedings before the Tribunal. 
The Tribunal in exercise of its 

power is obliged to determine all issues in controversy of fact and law 

in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. As 

already noticed, even the provisions relating to amendment of 

pleadings additional evidence, service of summons and proceedings by 

an indigent person, all are applicable to the Tribunal. 

21. 
As early as in 1950s, the Supreme Court in the case of The 

Bharat Bank Limited, Delhi v. The Employees of the Bharat Bank 

Limited, Delhi, and the Bharat Bank Employee's Union, Delhi, reported 

in AIR 1950 SC 184, enunciated the principle that an industrial 

tribunal performs all duties and functions of a court. The provisions of 

that Act also shows that the Tribunal is discharging functions very 

near to those of a court, although it is not a court in the technical

sense of the word.

In the case of Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd. Meerut v. Lakshmi 

Chand & Ors., reported in AIR 1963 SC 677, the Court while 

considering the essential characteristics of judicial adjudication by 

process of determination culminating in the judicial decision observed 

that a judicial decision always postulates the existence of a duty laid 

upon the authority to act judicially, and to make a decision or an act 

judicial, following criteria was spelt out, 

"1) 
It is in substance a determination upon 
investigation of a question by the application 
of objective standards to facts found in the 
light of pre-existing legal rules; 

2) 
It declares rights or imposes upon parties 
obligations affecting their civil rights; and 

3) 
that the investigation is subject to 
certain procedural attributes contemplating an 
opportunity of presenting its case to a party, 
ascertainment of facts by means of evidence if 
a dispute be on questions of fact, and if the 
dispute be on question of law on the 
presentation of legal argument, and a decision 
resulting in the disposal of the matter on 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


25 

findings based upon those questions of law 
and fact." 

23. 
The Court also stated that in deciding whether the 

authority required to act judicially when dealing with the matters 

affecting the rights of citizens may be regarded as a Tribunal, though 

not a court, the principal incident is the investiture of the "trappings 

of a court", -such as authority to determine matters in cases initiated 

by parties, sitting in public, power to compel attendance of witnesses 

and to examine them on oath, duty to follow fundamental rules of 

evidence, power to pass orders mandatory to enforce obedience to 

their commands. Some though not necessarily all such trappings will 

ordinarily, make the authority which is under a duty to act judicially, 

a `tribunal'. 

24. 
Further in the case of Associated Cement Companies Ltd. vs 

P.N. Sharma & Anr., reported in AIR 1965 SC 1595, it was stated by 

the Supreme Court that the presence of some of the trappings may 

assist the determination of the question as to whether the power 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


26 

exercised by the authority which possesses the said trapping, is the 

judicial power of the State or not, and the main and the basic test, 

however, is whether the adjudicating power which is the particular 

authority is empowered to exercise, has been conferred on it by a 

statute and can be described as a part of the State's inherent power 

exercised in discharging its judicial function. Applying this principle, 

it was held by the Supreme Court that the Tribunal constituted under 

the Punjab Welfare Officers Recruitment and Conditions of Service 

Rules, 1952 was a Tribunal having the trappings of a court. 

25. 
More so, in the case of State of Haryana vs Smt. Darshana 

Devi & Ors., reported in (1979)2 SCC 236, the Supreme Court, while 

dealing with a case under the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, 

stated that as under:-

"The reasoning of the High Court in holding that Order 
XXXIII will apply to the Tribunals which have the 
trappings of the civil court finds our approval. We 
affirm the decision." 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


27 

26. 
It is said that all Tribunals are not courts, though all the 

courts are Tribunals. The word "courts" is used to designate those 

Tribunals which are set up in an organized State for the 

Administration of Justice. The Administration of Justice is meant to 

be the exercise of judicial power of the State to maintain and uphold 

rights and to punish "wrongs". Whenever there is an infringement of a 

right or an injury, the courts are there to restore the vinculum juris, 

which is disturbed. 

27. 
In addition to the above general principles, some of the 

courts have taken a specific view stating the principle that the Tribunal 

constituted under the M.V. Act is a court subordinate to the High 

Court in terms of Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, The 

Karnataka High Court in Mrs. Noreen R. Srikantaiah v. L. Dasarath 

Ramaiah, Gulbarga & Anr., reported in AIR 1985 Karnataka 208, held 

as under:-

"8. Then again, the proposition that when the 
"District Judge" is notified as constituting the Tribunal, 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


28 

the conferment of the special jurisdiction on the 
District Judge is by virtue of his presiding over the 
District Court and not as persona designata and that 
though the term "District Judge" is used in the 
notification, the investiture of jurisdiction is in reality 
in the court of District Judge is eminently arguable. In 
Balakrishna Udayar v. Vasudeva Ayyar, AIR 1917 PC 
71, the Judicial Committee observed: 

"It appears to their Lordships to be clear that in 
all these matters the Civil Court exercises its powers as 
a Court of Law, not merely as a persona designata 
whose determinations are not to be treated as 
judgments of a legal Tribunal......" 

9. 
It is not necessary to refer to the differing views 
to the High Courts on the point. We have now the 
pronouncement of the Supreme Court in Bhagwati 
Devi v. I.S. Goel, 1983 Acc CJ 123 which imparts an 
altogether new complexion to the problem and puts 
the point beyond controversy. 
In this decision, 
Supreme Court referred to its earlier pronouncement 
in Darshan Devi's case, AIR 1979 SC 855 which arose 
out of the decision of the Punjab & Haryana High 
Court in Smt. Darshana Devi v. Sher Singh, AIR 1978 
Punj & Har 265. The question before the High Court in 
that case was whether a claimant before the Tribunal 
constituted under S. 110 of the `Act' is entitled to the 
benefit of O.33 R.1 C.P. C. The Tribunal had, in that 
case, negatived this claim holding that O.33, C.P. C. 
was not one of those provisions which had expressly 
been made applicable by the Punjab Motor Accidents 
Claims Rules, 1964. In support of its view the Tribunal 
had relied upon an earlier opinion expressed by Dua, J. 
that S.110-C of the M.V. Act by no means clothed the 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


29 

Tribunal with all the characteristics of a Civil Court. 
But in Darshana Devi's case, (AIR 1978 Punj & Har 
265), Koshal, C.J. did not subscribe to the earlier view 
of Dua, J. but referred, with approval, to a Full Bench 
judgment of that Court in Shanti Devi v. General 
Manager, haryana Roadways, Ambala, AIR 1972 Punj 
& Har 65 (FB), in which, Jain, J. speaking for the Full 
Bench had said (at p.72): 

"The proceedings before the Claims Tribunal 
closely resemble the proceedings in a Civil Court and 
to use the language of their Lordships of the Supreme 
Court in Jugal Kishore's case AIR 1967 SC 1494, the 
Claims Tribunal for all intents and pruposes discharges 
the same functions and duties in the same manner as a 
Court of law is expected to do. In this view of the 
matter I hold that the proceedings before the Claims 
Tribunal are not in the nature of arbitration 
proceedings and that the Claims Tribunal while 
disposing of the claim acts as a Court." 
(Emphasis ours) 

Darshana Devi's case, in which the above view of Jain, 
J. was reiterated, went up to the Supreme Court. 
Supreme Court observed: 

"2. 
The poor shall not be prised out of the 
justice market by insistence on court-fee and refusal to 
apply the exemptive provisions of O.XXXIII, C.P. C. So 
we are distressed that the State of Haryana, mindless 
of the mandate of equal justice to the indigent under 
the Magna Carta of our Republic, expressed in Art. 14 
and stressed in Art.39A of the constitution has sought 
leave to appeal against the order of the High Court 
which has rightly extended the `pauper' provisions to 
auto-accident claims. The reasoning of the high Court 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


30 

in holding that Order XXXIII will apply to Tribunals 
which have the trappings of the Civil Court finds our 
approval. We affirm the decision." (Emphasis ours) 

But in Revanappa's case (AIR 1983 Kant 164), 
Swami, J. did not accept the contention that in 
Darshana Devi's case, Supreme Court must be 
understood to have affirmed the view of Jain, J. in 
Shanti Devi's case (AIR 1972 Pun & Har 65) (FB) on 
which Koshal, C.J. Had, in turn, placed reliance. 

10. However, Bhagwati Devi's case (1983 Acc CJ 
123) (SC), now puts the points outside the pale of 
controversy. The matter arose in the context of the 
power of the Supreme Court under S.25 to transfer 
suits and other proceedings, inter alia, from one "Civil 
Court" in one State to the other "Civil Court" in any 
other State. There is no distinction in the concept of a 
Court between S.24 and S.25 C.P. C. However, the 
requirement of the element of subordination envisaged 
in S.24 so as to render the power under S.24 
exercisable, is, understandably, not in S.25. If, for 
purposes of S.25 a Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal is 
a "Civil Court", if follows, a fortiori, that the Tribunal is 
a "Court", for the purpose of S.24 as well. It is in this 
context that the pronouncement in Bhagwati Devi's 
case is instructive on the aspect now under 
consideration. Supreme Court said: 

"In view of the observations of this Court in State 
of Haryana v. Dharshan Devi, we are of the view that 
the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal constituted under 
the M.V. Act is a Civil Court for the purposes of S.25 of 
the Civil P.C. We are satisfied that the cases before us 
are fit cases for being transferred from the file of the

31 

Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Moradabad to the 
file of the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal Delhi 
................" 
(Emphasis supplied) 

This pronouncement of the Supreme Court should now 
serve to put the controversy at rest. In view of this 
pronouncement, the view taken in State of Karnataka 
v. Subbanna (AIR 1974 Kant 109) and in Revanappa's 
case (AIR 1983 Kant 164) that such a Tribunal is not a 
`Court' cannot continue to hold the field." 

28. 
A Bench of this Court in Gurucharansing Hardayalsing 

Sethi v. Narhari Laxman Shinde & Ors., reported in 1996(4) Bom.C. R. 

298 observed that the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal is a persona 

designata and stated that it is a court subordinate to High Court under 

Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
The Court observed 

thus:-

"Though amongst various High Courts there was 
difference of opinion as to whether the Motor 
Accident Claims Tribunal is persona designeta or the 
Court subordinate to the high Court within the 
meaning of section 115 C.P. C., but after the Apex 
Court in (State of Haryana v. Smt. Darshana Devi & 
Others), A.I. R. 1979 S.C. 855, observed that the 
Motor Accident Claims Tribunal has the trappings of 
the Civil Court, the later decisions of various High 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


32 

Courts are consistent that the Motor Accident Claims 
Tribunal, for all intents and purposes, is Court 
subordinate to the High Court and has trappings of 
Civil Court and amenable to revisional jurisdiction of 
the High Court under section 115 C.P. C. I fully 
agree with the view that Motor Accident Claims 
Tribunal is not a persona-designeta but a Court 
subordinate to the High Court under section 115 C.P. 
C." 

29. 
The Supreme Court in a very recent judgment in the 

case of Kamal Kumar Dutta & Anr. v. Ruby General Hospital Ltd. 

& Ors., reported in 2006 AIR SCW 4594, while dealing with the 

case under Sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act also took 

the view that the Company Law Board has adjudicatory power 

to decide all questions of law and facts, and held that :-

"There is no two opinion in the matter that when the 
CLB exercises its power under Ss.397 & 398, it 
exercised a quasi-judicial power as the original 
authority. It may not be a Court but it has all trapping 
of a Court." 

30. 
A Bench of Rajasthan High Court in the case of R.S. R.T. C. 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


33 

& etc. etc. vs Vaibhav Kumar & Ors., reported in AIR 2007 Rajasthan 

147, held as under:-

"23. The legal position exposited by the Supreme 
Court in Kamal Kumar Dutta, 2006 AIR SCW 4594, 
applies on all fours to the order /award passed by the 
Motor Accident claims Tribunal under Section 168 of 
the Motor Vehicles Act and where such order/award is 
carried in an appeal under Section 173 of that Act. 
Even if it be assumed that the Motor Accident Claims 
Tribunal is not a Court as is the term ordinarily 
understood, it is beyond doubt that such Tribunal has 
all the trapping of a Court. Though the Tribunals 
occupy a special position of their own under the 
scheme of the Courts and Tribunals and special matters 
and questions are entrusted to them for their decision 
yet they share with the Courts one common 
characteristic viz.; both the Courts as well as Tribunals 
are constituted by the State and are invested with 
judicial functions as distinguished from purely 
administrative or executive functions. It is the State's 
inherent judicial power which is discharged by the 
Courts and Tribunals. If the Company Law Board 
constituted under the Companies Act in its 
adjudicatory powers has the trappings of a Court and 
an appeal under Section 10F of the Companies Act 
from its order to the single Judge is not amenable to 
further appeal (Letters Patent) to the Division Bench of 
the same Court because of Section 100A of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, a fortiori, an order passed by the 
Single Judge in appeal under Section 173 of the Motor 
Vehicles Act from the order/award of the Motor 
Accident Claims Tribunal shall not be subject to intra-

34 

Court appeal in view of the bar created by Section 
100A of the Code of Civil Procedure effective from 1 st 
July, 2002." 
( Emphasis supplied ) 

31. 
In the light of the above judgment and consistent view 

taken by the courts there can hardly be any doubt that the Tribunal 

does have trappings of a court. It satisfies all the tests stated above. 

In any case, it has power to summon, record statements on oath, 

compel attendance of the witnesses, determine controversies by a 

public adjudicatory process and even has the power to punish the 

defaulters. It can get its award executed in accordance with the law. 

Besides all these, it is performing duties and functions of 

administration of justice under the power of the State and in fact 

under a statute. At this stage itself, we may notice that the Division 

Bench of this Court in the case of Asha d/o Bhalchandra Joshi vs. 

National Insurance Co. Ltd., reported in 2008 (1) Mh. L.J. 724 did 

not consider the judgment of the Supreme Court in Kamal Kumar 

Dutta's case (supra) and of this Court in Gurucharansing Hardayalsing 

Sethi vs Narhari Laxman Shinde and others, (1996) 4 Bom. C.R. 298, 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


35 

besides it has ignored the basic principles applicable for determination 

i.e. whether the Tribunal has a trappings of a Court or not. With 

respect, we are unable to follow the view taken by a Division Bench in 

that case in this regard. 

32. 
As far as the appeals under the Motor Vehicle Act are 

concerned, it specifically provides that the award of the Tribunal made 

under Section 165 of the Act would be appeallable to the High Court 

under Section 173 of the Act. Section 173 of the Act thus reads as 

under: -

"173. Appeals : (1) Subject to the provisions of sub-
section (2), any person aggrieved by an award of a 
Claims Tribunal may, within ninety days from the date 
of the award, prefer an appeal to the High Court : 

Provided that no appeal by the person who is 
required to pay any amount in terms of such award 
shall be entertained by the High Court unless he has 
deposited with it twenty-five thousand rupees or fifty 
per cent of the amount so awarded, whichever is less, 
in the manner directed by the High Court; 

Provided further that the High Court may 
entertain the appeal after the expiry of the said period 
of ninety days. If it is satisfied that the appellant was 
prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the

36 

appeal in time. 

(2) No appeal shall lie against any award of a 
Claims Tribunal, if the amount in dispute in the appeal 
is less than ten thousand rupees." 

33. 
The bare reading of Section 173 of the Act shows that the 

provisions are self-contained in all respects. It provides for filing an 

appeal by any person aggrieved by an award of the Claim Tribunal 

provided the amount in appeal is not less than Rs.10,000/-. Such 

appeals are to be filed within 90 days and the appeal would be 

entertained by the High Court subject to satisfaction of the conditions 

stipulated under the proviso 1 of Section 173(1) of the Act. In terms 

of proviso 2 of Section 173(1) of the Act, the High Court can entertain 

an appeal even after the expiry of 90 days if it has shown sufficient 

cause for preferring an appeal beyond time. In other words, this 

provision indicates the scope of powers of the High Court while 

entertaining an appeal under the said provision. The ambit, scope and 

the powers thus have been outlined by the Legislature itself and may 

not be dependent on the provisions of other laws. 
There is no 

provision in the entire M.V. Act which provides for further appeal from 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


37 

the judgment passed by the High Court in exercise of its appellate 

jurisdiction under Section 173 of the M.V. Act. 

34. 
Once the M.V. Act provides for a remedy of First Appeal 

and does not specify availability of any further right of appeal, it is 

obvious that the Legislature does not intend to give any further right 

of appeal within the provisions of the Act particularly in relation to 

intra-Court appeal. The right to appeal and in fact all remedial 

provisions do not emerge from any fundamental or vested right. It is a 

grant or a statute under which such right of appeal is available. In 

view of this settled principle, the absence of any provision providing a 

further appeal in terms of Section 173 of the Act would obviously lead 

to one inevitable conclusion that the special law (i.e. Motor Vehicle 

Act) in comparison to general laws (i.e. Code of Civil Procedure) does 

not contemplate maintainability of a second appeal against the 

judgment of the learned Single Judge. 
It may also be noticed that 

remedy of appeal being a statutory right, cannot be introduced by 

judicial interpretative process. The Court would be very reluctant to 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


38 

read into the statute, a right of appeal in absence of any such specific 

provision. 

NATURE OF RIGHT OF APPEAL: 

35. 
According to Salmond, (Salmond on Jurisprudence, 

Twelfth Edition), the right in the strict sense is duty which is 

something owed by one to another. Correspondingly, the latter has a 

right against the former. The expression `right' is capable of being 

used in wider sense. Thus the rights are concerned with interest, yet 

right and interest are not identical. Bentham introduced the concept 

of natural law and natural rights which, according to him, are two 

kinds of fictions or metaphors which play a greater part in books of 

legislation that they deserve to be examined by themselves. Of 

course, this concept has not found much acceptance so far in 

legislative or judicial analysis. A legal right is commonly accompanied 

by the power of instituting legal proceedings for enforcement of it. 

Legal rights are normally enforceable by process of law. There could 

be a situation where a legal right itself is imperfect and, therefore, 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


39 

becomes unenforceable in law. Every legal right has distinguishable 

characteristics, like it is vested in a person, it is available against a 

person and such right is enforceable in accordance with the provisions 

of law. A legal right could also be a vested right as it gives right to a 

person aggrieved to prefer an appeal in accordance with the principles 

of that statute. In simple language, a right to appeal is a statutory 

right, it is neither a natural nor a fundamental right. 

36. 
An appeal is an application to a superior Court or Tribunal 

praying for reversal or varying or setting aside a judgment under 

appeal. A right which is conferred by statute or equivalent legislative 

authority is not a matter of practice or procedure and neither the 

superior nor the inferior Court or Tribunal nor both combined can 

create or take away such a right. Even the Civil Division of the Court 

of Appeal in England is bound by its own decisions. No appeal lies 

from a decision of the Court of Appeal as to whether a judgment or 

order is, for any purpose connected with an appeal to that Court, final 

or interlocutory. Right to appeal thus should be created by vested 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


40 

specific jurisdiction. (Halsbury Law of England, Fourth Edition). 

37. 
In the case of Garikapati Veeraya (supra), the Supreme 

Court in unambiguous terms stated the principle that right of appeal is 

a vested right which is created by a statute alone. This was reiterated 

by the Supreme Court in a more recent judgment and was followed 

with approval in Kamal Kumar Dutta (supra), where the Court held 

that right to prefer appeal is a statutory right and it could be exercised 

only in case of adverse decision and will be governed by the law 

prevailing at the time of commencement of the suit and comprise of 

successive rights of appeal from Court to Court which rarely constitute 

one proceeding. This legal right was also capable of being taken away 

either expressly or by necessary intendment by a subsequent 

Legislature. 

38. 
In the case of Maria Cristina De Souza Sodder and others vs 

Amria Zurana Pereira Pinto and others, (1979) 1 SCC 92, the Supreme 

Court held as under :-

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


41 

"It is no doubt well-settled that the right of appeal is a 
substantive right and it gets vested in a litigant no 
sooner the lis is commenced and such right or remedy 
will not be affected by any repeal of the enactment 
conferring such right unless the repealing enactment 
either expressly or by necessary application takes away 
such right or remedy." 

39. 
The principle of `appeal being a statutory right and no 

party has a right to file appeal except in accordance with the 

prescribed procedure' is followed in the case of M/s M Ramnarain 

Private Limited and another vs State Trading Corporation of India 

Limited, (1983) 3 SCC 75, where the Supreme Court held as under:-

"16. 
The right to prefer an appeal is a right 
created by statute. No party can file an appeal against 
any judgment, decree or order as a matter of course in 
the absence of a suitable provision of some law 
conferring on the party concerned the right to file an 
appeal against any judgment, decree or order. The 
right of appeal so conferred on any party may be lost to 
the party in appropriate cases by the provisions of some 
law such as the law of limitation and also by the 
conduct of the party and in appropriate cases a party 
may be held to have become disentitled from enforcing 
the right of appeal which he may otherwise have." 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


42 

40. 
This view was reiterated with approval by the 

Supreme Court in the case of Gujarat Agro Industries Co. Ltd. Vs 

Municipal Corporation of the City of Ahmedabad and others, 

(1999) 4 SCC 468, where the Court stated that even right of 

appeal can be made conditional or qualified and it is a creation 

of a statute alone. The Court held as under :-

"Right of appeal is the creature of a statute and it is for 
the legislature to decide whether the right of appeal 
should be unconditionally given to an aggrieved party 
or it should be conditionally given. Right of appeal 
which is a statutory right can be conditional or 
qualified. It cannot be said that such a law would be 
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. If the statute 
does not create any right of appeal, no appeal can be 
filed. There is a clear distinction between a suit and an 
appeal. While every person has an inherent right to 
bring a suit of a civil nature unless the suit is barred by 
statute, however, in regard to an appeal, the position is 
quite opposite. The right to appeal inheres in no one 
and, therefore, for maintainability of an appeal there 
must be authority of law. When such a law authorises 
filing of appeal, it can impose conditions as well." (Para 
8). 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


43 

41. 
Right of appeal is neither a natural nor inherent right 

vested in a party. It is substantive statutory right regulated by the 

statute creating it. (Kondiba Dagadu Kadam vs Savitribai Sopan Gujar 

and others, (1999) 3 SCC 722, and Kashmir Singh vs Harnam Singh 

and another, 2008 AIR SCW 2417). 

42. 
Thus, it is evident that the right to appeal is not a right 

which can be assumed by logical analysis much less by exercise of 

inherent jurisdiction. It essentially should be provided by the law in 

force. In absence of any specific provision creating a right in a party to 

file an appeal, such right can neither be assumed nor inferred in 

favour of the party. On the bare reading of provisions of Section 173 

and in absence of any other specific provision providing further 

appeal, it is difficult to accept the view that with the aid of any of the 

provisions or by general practice the appellate order passed under 

Section 173 by a Single Judge of this Court would be further 

appealable by intra-Court appeal.

44 

RIGHT OF APPEAL UNDER LETTERS PATENT : 

43. 
It has been held that Letters Patent is a word of definite 

legal meaning. It is derived from the latin words literae patents. The 

Letters Patent are so called because they are open letters, they are not 

sealed up, but exposed to view, with the great seal pendant at the 

bottom and are usually directed or addressed by the King to all his 

subjects at large. Different Letters Patent have been handed down by 

the Sovereign in British India to Chartered High Courts which included 

only judicature of Bengal, Madras, Bombay, North-West Provinces, 

Patna, Lahore and Rangoon. (See Blackstone's Commentaries on 

the Laws of England, Vol. II. pp. 284-85). 

44. 
Now, we may examine the impact of Clause 15 of the 

Letters Patent which provides for intra-Court appeal. Clause 15 of the 

Letters Patent does not create a substantive right of appeal from the 

decision of the Single Judge, but such right is obviously subject to the 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


45 

application of the stipulated condition. Right of appeal can be 

exercised only in accordance with the limitations specified in the 

provision granting right of appeal. Clause 15 of the Letters Patent 

reads as under :-

"15. Appeal to the High Court from Judges of the 
Court:-And We do further ordain that an appeal shall 
lie to the said High Court of Judicature at Bombay from 
the judgment (not being a judgment passed in the 
exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a Court subject to 
the superintendence of the said High Court, and not 
being an order made in the exercise of revisional 
jurisdiction and not being a sentence or order passed or 
made in the exercise of the power of superintendence 
under the provisions of section 107 of the Government 
of India Act, or in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction) 
of one Judge of, the said High Court or one Judge of 
any Divisional Court, pursuant to section 108 of the 
Government of India Act, and that notwithstanding 
anything herein before provided an appeal shall lie to 
the said High Court from a Judgement of one Judge of 
the said High Court from a Judge of any Division 
Court, pursuant to section 108 of the Government of 
India Act, made on or after the first day of February 
one thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine in the 
exercise of appellate jurisdiction; in respect of a decree 
or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction 
by a Court subject to the superintendence of the said 
High Court, where the Judge who passed the judgment 
declares that the case is fit one for appeal; but that the 
right of appeal from other judgments of Judge of the

High Court or of such Division Court shall be to Us, 
Our heirs of successors in Our or Their Privy Council, 
as hereinafter provided." 

45. 
Clause 15 of the Letters Patent is the provision which 

grants right of appeal to the aggrieved party against the judgment of 

the learned Single Judge of the Court to Letters Patent Bench. The 

exception carved out to this right of appeal is that the judgment not 

being a judgment passed in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in 

respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate 

jurisdiction by a Court subject to the superintendence of the said High 

Court, and not being an order made in the exercise of revisional 

jurisdiction and not being a sentence or order passed or made in the 

exercise of the power of superintendence under the provisions of 

section 107 of the Government of India Act, or in the exercise of 

criminal jurisdiction. In other words, where the clause grants right of 

appeal, it has inbuilt exception and limitation applicable to said right 

of appeal. It is also a settled proposition of law that a right to appeal 

can be regulated and/or restricted by the provisions of Section 

providing such right. The legal right that is available to a party to

47 

prefer an appeal from the judgment of the learned Single Judge thus is 

not a unrestricted or unfettered right. Besides the requirement that 

the order of the learned Single Judge as understood in common 

parlance has to be a judgment within the meaning of the said 

expression of clause 15 of the Letters Patent to perfect a right of 

appeal to litigant. Once it clears the parameter of a judgment and is 

not hit by any of the exceptions stated in the clause itself, an appeal 

may lie to a letters patent bench. Various aspects of Letters Patent 

Appeal and especially what is a judgment within Clause 15 of the 

Letters Patent has been dealt with by a Division Bench of this Court in 

a recent judgment delivered on 19 th June, 2008 ( The Bombay 

Diocesan Trust Association Pvt. Ltd. v. The Pastorate Committee of the 

Saint Andrews Church & Ors.). A relevant observations of the said 

judgment are as under:-

"10. While relying upon the case of 
Vinita M. 
Khanolkar v. Pragna M. Pai and others, 1998(1) SCC 
500, it is argued that provision of appeal in clause 15 
of the Letters Patent, which is a charter under which 
the High Court of Bombay functions, is not whittled 
down by the statutory provisions of section 6(3) of the 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


48 

Specific Relief Act. In that case, the Supreme Court 
stated that any statutory provision barring an appeal or 
revision cannot cut across the constitutional power of a 
High Court. 
Even the power flowing from the 
paramount charter under which the High Court 
functions could not get excluded unless the statutory 
enactment concerned expressly excludes 
appeals 
under under letters patent. It was also noticed that no 
such bar is discernible from language of section 6(3) of 
the Specific Relief Act holding that appeal under clause 
15 would lie to the Letters Patent Bench. It needs to be 
noticed that in this case, the Supreme Court was 
primarily concerned with the provisions of the Specific 
Relief Act which in comparison to the Contempt of 
Courts act is a statute of general impact. Furthermore, 
the provisions of section 6(3) contemplates that no 
appeal shall lie from any order or decree passed in any 
suit instituted under that section nor shall any review 
of such order or decree be allowed. It was on the 
language of the section that the Supreme Court was of 
the view that jurisdiction of the court under section 15 
of the Letters Patent was not ousted and the appeal 
was consequently, restored to the file of the High 
Court. 

11. Similarly, in the case of State of West Bengal and 
others v. Kartick Chandra Das and others, (1996) 5 SCC 
342, 
the Supreme Court again emphasised the 
principle that in absence of specific exclusion, the 
provisions of sections 4 to 24 and section 5 of the 
Limitation Act were applicable to the appeals filed 
under clause 15 including those under the Contempt of 
Courts Act. In that case, it was not an issue whether an 
appeal would lie to the Division Bench or not as 
recorded in para 4 of the judgment that maintainability 
of the appeal was not disputed. It is also useful to 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


49 

notice that in that case, the appeal had been preferred 
against issuance of contempt notice by the Division 
Bench. The Supreme Court held that the Appellate 
Side procedure of the Calcutta High Court was 
applicable. 

12. Lastly, reliance was also placed on the judgment 
of the Supreme Court in the case of P.S. Sathapan 
(Dead) by Lrs. v. Andhra Bank Ltd. and others, (2004) 
11 SCC 672. In that case, the Court was primarily 
concerned with bar under section 104(2) of the Civil 
Procedure Code and clause 15 of Letters Patent of 
Madras High Court. The Apex Court again affirmed 
the principle of harmonious construction of section 104 
which leads to the conclusion that Section 104(1) 
saves Letters Patent Appeal and bar of section 104(2) 
of the Civil Procedure Code does not apply. The only 
conclusion that can be arrived at is that unless there is 
specific exclusion by expression mention in the section 
then alone, the appeal would not lie. 
It will be 
appropriate to notice paragraphs 21 and 22 of this 
judgment on which the learned counsel placed heavy 
reliance. 

"21. We are of the opinion that in reaching 
this conclusion the Court missed the relevant 
portion of clause 15 of the Letters Patent of 
the Bombay High Court. Reliance cannot, 
therefore, be placed on this judgment for the 
proposition that under clause 15 of the Letters 
Patent of the Bombay High Court no appeal to 
a Division Bench from the order of the Single 
Judge in exercise of appellate jurisdiction is 
maintainable. 

22. Thus the unanimous view of all courts 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


50 

till 1996 was that Section 104(1) CPC 
specifically saved letters patent appeals and 
the bar under Section 104(2) did not apply to 
letters patent appeals. The view has been 
that a letters patent appeal cannot be ousted 
by implication but the right of an appeal 
under the Letters Patent can be taken away by 
an express provision in an appropriate 
legislation. The express provision need not 
refer to or use the words "letters patent" but if 
on a reading of the provision it is clear that all 
further appeals are barred then even a letters 
patent appeal would be barred." 

13. These judgments referred by appellant are 
different on facts and the judicial dictum does not have 
a direct bearing to the matters in issue before us in the 
present appeal. In fact, in the case of Kartick Chandra 
Das (supra), it was specifically conceded that appeals 
against notice of contempt lies and there was no 
determination on the question of maintainability of 
appeal even with reference to the provisions of 
Limitation Act. Moreover, these were primarily 
determination of lis between the parties in regard to 
certain personal reliefs and were not the cases of 
discharge of power within special jurisdiction as to 
contempt. 

14. As is evident from the discussion of the 
judgments relied upon by the appellant, right of 
Letters Patent Appeal can be taken away by an express 
provision in an appropriate Legislation. It is not 
necessary that the section should expressly use the 
word "Letters Patent" but if on plain reading of the 
provision, it is clear that all further appeals are barred 
then even a Letters Patent Appeal would be barred.

51 

The judgments cited by appellant do not have any 
direct bearing on issue in hand. In the controversy 
before us in as much as the provisions of the Specific 
Relief Act, section 104 of the CPC and the Limitation 
Act are not pari materia to the provisions of section 19 
of the Contempt of Courts Act. Section 19 of the Act 
reads as under: 

"19. Appeals.-(1) An appeal shall lie as of 
right from any order or decision of High 
Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction to 
punish for contempt-

(a) where the order or decision is that of a 
single Judge, to a Bench of not less than two 
Judges of the Court; 

(b) where the order or decision is that of a 
Bench, to the Supreme Court: 

Provided that where the order or decision is 
that of the Court of the Judicial Commissioner 
in any Union territory, such appeal shall lie to 
the Supreme Court. 

(2) Pending any appeal, the appellate Court 
may order that-

(a) the execution of the punishment or 
order appealed against the suspended; 

(b) if the appellant is in confinement, he be 
released on bail; and 

(c) the appeal be heard notwithstanding 
that the appellant has not purged his 
contempt. 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


52 

(3) Where any person aggrieved by any 
order against which an appeal may be filed 
satisfies the High Court that he intents to 
prefer an appeal, the High Court may also 
exercise all or any of the powers conferred by 
sub-section (2). 

(4) an appeal under sub-section (1) shall be 
filed-

(a) in the case of an appeal to a Bench of 
the High Court, within thirty days; 

(b) in the case of an appeal to the Supreme 
Court, within sixty days, from the date of the 
order appealed against. 

15. The language of section 19 where gives a 
statutory right to a party to maintain an appeal, there 
it restricts such right by using specific language in 
regard to punishing a person for contempt. The 
expression used is "An appeal shall lie as of right from 
any order or decision of High Court in the exercise of 
its jurisdiction to punish for contempt". Thus, the 
statute itself provides the class of cases in which an 
appeal shall lie. Once a special legislation restricts the 
right of appeal by specific language, it obviously 
excludes what is not specifically included. 
The 
intention of the Legislature is certainly not to permit or 
grant statutory right of appeal unless the order passed 
was for grant of punishment for contempt. The section 
is self-contained provision and even provides that the 
appeal shall lie to two Judges bench of the High Court 
where the decision is of a Single Judge of that court 
and to the Supreme Court where the order is by a 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


53 

Bench of the High Court. The complete mechanism of 
right to appeal and forum to which the appeal would 
lie has been spelt out by the Legislature and, thus, 
there is no reason for the court to expand its scope to 
hold that appeal would lie by adding that even the 
order of discharge shall be included in the expression 
`punish for contempt'. 

..... 
...... 
....... 

18. The appeals are filed against a decree or an 
order which is determination of a lis in accordance 
with law. The appeal would lie against such order or 
decree with the exception that such order or decree 
was not made in exercise of appellate jurisdiction. A 
decree as even contemplated under the provisions of 
Civil Procedure Code would be a finding on matters in 
issue between the parties and would decide such 
issues. Thus, the matter referred would be the one 
which decide the rights of the parties and in fact, is a 
substantial determination of rights of the parties to the 
lis before the Court of competent jurisdiction. As 
against this, a matter of contempt is primarily a 
matter between the Court and the contemnor and is 
not determination of any lis pending before the court 
on which parties are litigating. An order of discharge 
in a contempt, thus, would not be a judgment and 
order within the meaning of clause 15 of Letters Patent 
and an appeal against such an order is excluded under 
the language of section 19 of the Contempt of Courts 
Act which unambiguously states that only orders of 
punishment for contempt are appealable. 

19. As far as this court is concerned, as back as in 
Narendrabhai Sarabhai Hatheesing and others v. 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


54 

Chinubhai Manibhai Seth, AIR 1936 Bombay 314, the 
Division Bench took the view that order of court for 
breach of undertaking to court is not a judgment. An 
Order of the court refusing to commit a person for 
breach of an undertaking given to the court and 
embodied in the order of the Court cannot be said to 
be a judgment within the meaning of Clause 15, as it 
does not affect the merits of any question between the 
parties and hence is not appealable. The Bench also 
noticed a judgment of Full Bench of Calcutta High 
Court in Mohendra Lall Mitter v. Anundo Coomar 
Mitter, (1897) 25 Cal. 236 (F.B.) and declined to 
accept the view firstly as it was not binding and 
specifically for the reason that decision of the Calcutta 
High Court was in absence of any reason for the 
conclusion arrived at and ultimately rejected the 
contention that an order refusing the application to 
commit a person for contempt was appealable. The 
same principle was approved and distinguished by the 
Full Bench of this court in the case of Collector of 
Bombay v. Issac Penhas, AIR (35) 1948 Bombay 103, 
where the court held as under: 

"17. On the preliminary point as to whether 
an appeal lies, there has been a long and 
continuous controversy in the different High 
Courts as to the true meaning to be given to 
the expression "judgment" in Cl. 15 of the 
Letters Patent. I should have thought that, 
apart from authority, an order of committal 
for contempt was a judgment within that 
definition. The order undoubtedly constitutes 
final adjudication. It affects the merits of the 
case and it also determines the right and 
liability of the appellant. Let us therefore 
consider whether there is anything in the 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


55 

reported decisions which are contrary to the 
view I am suggesting. The definition given by 
Sir Richard Couch, Chief Justice, in the two 
Calcutta decisions is considered to be a locus 
classicus as far as the definition of the 
expression "judgment" is concerned in Cl. 15, 
Letters Patent. The first of these decisions is 
reported in 8 Beng. L.R. 433. That was a case 
where an order was made directing the issue 
of a writ of mandamus to the Justices of the 
Peace for Calcutta to compel them to refer to 
arbitration question of compensation, and the 
question arose whether an appeal lay from 
that order, and Sir Richard Couch said in his 
judgment (p. 452): 

"We think that `judgment' in Cl.15 
means a decision which affects the merits of 
the question between the parties by 
determining some right or liability." 

18. In the subsequent decision reported in 
13 Beng. L.R. 91 the interpretation was 
slightly extended and the learned Chief 
Justice said (page 101): 

A judgment "is not a mere formal order, 
or an order merely regulating the procedure 
in the suit, but one that has the effect of 
giving a jurisdiction to the Court which it 
otherwise would not have." 

In that case the learned Chief Justice was 
considering an order refusing to set aside an 
order granting leave to sue to the plaintiff 
under Cl.12, Letters Patent. 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


56 

19. The Madras High Court has always 
given a more liberal interpretation to the 
expression "judgment", and the leading case is 
the one reported in 35 Mad. 1, where we have 
the judgment of Sir Arnold White, and the 
opinion of that learned Chief Justice as to the 
true meaning of the expression "judgment" is 
(p.7): 

"If its effect, whatever its form may be, 
and whatever may be the nature of the 
application on which it is made, is to put an 
end to the suit or proceeding so far as the 
Court before which the suit or proceeding is 
pending is concerned, or if its effect, if it is 
not complied with, is to put an end to the suit 
or proceeding, I think the adjudication is a 
judgment within the meaning of the clause." 

20. This High Court has always preferred to 
follow the Calcutta High Court rather than the 
Madras High Court: or, in other words, it has 
undoubtedly given a more restricted meaning 
to the expression "judgment" than the Madras 
High Court has done-see the observations of 
Sir Basil Scott C.J. In 11 Bom. L.R. 241. 
.................................... 

23. Then we come to the decision which has 
created some difficulty, and that is the 
decision reported in 38 Bom. L.R. 571. The 
order with which the Divisional Bench of Sir 
John Beaumount C.J., and Rangnekar J. was 
concerned was refusing to commit a person 
for breach of an undertaking given to a Court, 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


57 

and the Court held that no appeal lay from 
such an order. It is difficult to see how such 
an order could possibly be a `judgment' 
within the meaning of Cl. 15, Letters Patent 
and give the right of appeal to a person who 
had moved the Court for contempt and had 
failed to get an order for committal. It is 
impossible to say that any right or liability of 
the appellant was determined by the order of 
committal. The appellant had no right to get 
such an order from the Court. It was the 
discretion of the Court, and the Court having 
refused to exercise its discretion, the appellant 
could not say that any right of his was 
affected or any liability imposed upon him. 
Therefore on the facts of the case that 
decision is clearly distinguishable from the 
facts before us where the appellant has been 
ordered to pay a fine and has been held to be 
guilty of contempt. It cannot be disputed that 
in this case the appellant's rights are 
undoubtedly affected and that a liability has 
been imposed on him on a final adjudication 
by the learned Judge. But it is contended by 
Mr. Taraporewalla that the decision in 38 
Bom. L.R. 571 is of wider import than the 
facts on which it was decided. It is suggested 
that that decision lays down that there is no 
appeal from any order made by a Judge in 
contempt proceedings whether he refuses to 
commit or whether he makes a committal 
order. I refuse to read that judgment of the 
Court of Appeal in that light. 
What is 
contended is that that judgment relies on the 
definition given by Sir Richard Couch C.J. and 
it is argued that the decision of Bhagwati J. is 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


58 

not a decision between parties and, therefore, 
it cannot constitute a judgment. Now it is to 
be remembered that most of the decisions 
reported in the books dealing with the 
definition of `judgment' were cases between 
parties and usually the question that fell to be 
determined was whether a certain order was 
final or interlocutory; and if interlocutory, 
whether it was `judgment' within the 
meaning of Cl.15, Letters Patent. What we 
are concerned with here is not the case of a 
`judgment' given between parties in a 
litigation between parties but a `judgment' 
given against a party which affects his rights. 
It would be clearly wrong to apply a definition 
given in its own context applicable to its own 
facts and circumstances to an entirely 
different set of facts and circumstances. The 
expression "between the parties" in the 
definition of Sir Richard Couch J. is not an 
integral part of that definition. Therefore, in 
my opinion, in deciding that an appeal lies 
from an order of committal, we are in no way 
deviating from the accepted definition of Sir 
Richard Couch to the extent that that 
definition deals with the essentials and 
fundamentals of the expression `judgment' 
occurring in Cl. 15, Letters Patent. As I have 
already pointed out, the order of Bhagwati J. 
affects 
the merits of the question by 
determining a right or liability. It is not 
between parties, but that it could not be 
because the contempt proceedings were 
between the Court and the appellant and not 
between the appellant and the respondent. 
Sir Richard Couch did not intend and could 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


59 

not have intended that any decision affecting 
the rights of a party against which the Court 
has made an order could not be a `judgment' 
merely because there was no other party to 
those particular proceedings." 

..... 
..... 
..... 

23. The expression "judgment" was examined by the 
Supreme Court in the case of Hanskumar Kishan Chand 
v. The Union of India, AIR 1958 SC 947. The Supreme 
Court while dealing with the powers of Federal Court 
specifically held that the word `judgment' used in 
section 2(b) would be a judgment, decree or order of a 
High Court in civil case and an order under Defence of 
India Act would not be a judgment, decree or order 
and, thus, leave to appeal could not be granted. 

24. In the case of Shah Babulal Khimji v. Jayaben D. 
Kania and another, (1981) 4 SCC 8, the Supreme 
Court spelt out the guidelines and illustrations in 
regard to the Letters Patent clause 15 of the Bombay 
High Court and appeals which could be maintained 
before the Division Bench against the judgment. The 
court also explained the phrase `judgment'. While 
including some of the interlocutory orders within the 
ambit of the judgment, the Court stated that it should 
receive a much wider and liberal interpretation than 
the word `judgment' used in Civil Procedure Code. 
The court clearly stated the dictum that it cannot be 
said that every order passed by the trial Judge would 
amount to judgment. 
It seems that the word 
"judgment" has undoubtedly a concept of finality in a 
broader and not a narrower sense. The court held that 
an order even though it keeps the suit alive but still 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


60 

decides an important aspect of the trial and which 
affects the vital right of the defendants would be liable 
to be construed as judgment. 

25. The Supreme Court in its earlier judgments and 
reference can be made to the case of Nachiappa 
Chettiar and others v. Subramaniam Chettiar, AIR 1960 
SC 307, wherein the Apex court held that the word 
"judgment" cannot refer to the various interlocutory 
orders and judgments that may be passed during the 
hearing of the suit and so the word "judgment" cannot 
be given the meaning assigned to it by Section 2(9) of 
the Civil Procedure Code. It cannot mean in the 
context the statement given by the Judge of the 
grounds of a decree or order. It must mean a 
judgment which finally decides all matters in 
controversy in the suit. Similar view has been 
expressed by the Supreme Court in Shri Radhey Shyam 
v. Shyam Behari Singh, 1970(2) SCC 405. 

..... 
..... 
..... 

28. 
Judgment by the court is an affirmation of a 
relation between the particular predicate and a 
particular subject. It is always a declaration that a 
liability, recognised as within the jural sphere, does or 
does not exist. A judgment, as the culmination of the 
action, declares the existence of the right, recognises 
the commission of the injury, or negatives the 
allegation of one or the other. [(Gurdit Singh and 
others v. State of Punjab and others, (1974) 2 SCC 260] 

29. 
The principles which emerge from the 
consistent view taken by the Courts including the 
Supreme Court is, there has to be a conscious 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


61 

determination of rights and liabilities between the 
parties to a lis before the court of competent 
jurisdiction. 
Undisputedly, contempt is a matter 
primarily between the Court and the contemnor. The 
proceedings of Contempt of Court would be initiated 
against the contemnor through any of the specified 
modes with or without consent of the specified 
authorities depending on the facts and circumstances 
of each case. The contempt jurisdiction vested in the 
Court by development of law as well as under the 
statutory provision is very wide and is of pervasive 
magnitude. A party to the proceedings before the 
court may bring to the notice of the Court any matter 
which invites the attention of the Court for taking any 
action under the provisions of the Contempt of Courts 
Act. Once such act is done, the matter squarely falls in 
the exclusive domain of the Court of competent 
jurisdiction, as the purpose of contempt jurisdiction is 
primarily to ensure enforcement of the order of the 
court and to maintain the dignity of the judicial 
administrative system. The contempt proceedings per 
se are not taken or declined for the benefit or interest 
of the individual party. When the court passes an 
order of discharge or holds that no case for contempt 
of Court is made out and declines to take action, no 
right or interest of the parties to the lis are determined 
by the court much less finally. Such an order besides 
being not appealable on the bare reading of the 
provisions of section 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 
would also not be a judgment within the meaning of 
clause 15 of the Letters Patent and as such, not 
appealable. The provisions of section 19 of the Act are 
not ambiguous and do not leave any scope for addition 
or substitution of a word. Definite legislative intent is 
clear that right to appeal shall only be available in the 
cases where there is an order of punishment. The 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


62 

matter primarily and substantially being between the 
court and the contemnor , parties to the lis cannot be 
permitted to raise issues or litigate on the view of the 
court that a case of contempt is made out or not. 
Where the court in exercise of its judicial discretion 
and keeping in mind the well settled principles of 
contempt jurisdiction finds that contempt proceedings 
need not be initiated, or no contempt is made out or 
discharges the contemnor on merits of the case, the 
appeal before the Division Bench even with the aid of 
clause 15 of the Letters Patent would not be 
maintainable. In the present case, the learned Single 
Judge has concluded, as already noticed, that the 
petitioners themselves are not sure as to which of the 
contemnors are allowed to use the Welfare Centre and 
while taking an overall view of the matter held that 
this was not a fit case where action under the 
Contempt of Courts Act can be taken. This order of the 
learned Single Judge, in our opinion, is not appealable 
in view of the unambiguous language of section 19 of 
the Contempt of Courts Act and an appeal is not 
maintainable even under clause 15 of the Letters 
Patent. Although we have no hesitation in rejecting 
this appeal as being not maintainable, in the facts and 
circumstances of this case, Parties are left to bear their 
own cost." 

46. 
Another facet of right of appeal under this clause is that 

the provisions of clause 15 are subject to legislative powers of the 

Governor-General in Legislative Council and also of the Governor-

General in Council under Section 71 of the Government of India Act, 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


63 

1915. Clause 44 of the Letters Patent specifically contemplates that 

the provisions of Letters Patent are subject to the exercise of legislative 

powers by the competent legislature. In other words, Clause 15 of the 

Letters Patent does not confer an absolute or unqualified right to 

appeal. This remedy is subject to the other laws enacted by competent 

Legislature. Viewed from that angle, the restrictions contemplated 

under Section 100-A of the Code of Civil Procedure would be a 

relevant consideration which would control right of appeal as 

envisaged under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. 

47. 
Clause 12 of Letters Patent is an independent clause which 

relates to the exercise of ordinary original jurisdiction in suits by this 

Courts. The orders which are passed by the High Court in exercise of 

its original jurisdiction would be apparently covered under clause 12 

of the Letters Patent but of course to the limitation stated in the 

provision itself. But, in the present case, jurisdiction under Clause 12 

is not a relevant consideration to answer the questions of law posed 

before us.

48. 
In Shah Babulal Khimji's case (supra), the Supreme Court , 

while explaining the ingredients of a judgment, held that Section 104 

with Order XLIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure is neither 

inconsistent, nor override, nor controls clause 15 of the Letters Patent. 

The judgment was in relation to the orders passed by the learned 

Single Judge of this Court in exercise of its original jurisdiction. 

49. 
Similar view was also expressed by the Supreme Court in 

Vinita M. Khanolkar's case (supra) where the Court held that the order 

passed by the learned Single Judge in the proceedings under Section 6 

of the Specific Reliefs Act would be appealable under Clause 15 of the 

Letters patent. The Courts stated the principle that the powers of the 

appellate court and right provided under the provision to appeal can 

be excluded by a statute expressly and it cannot be excluded by 

juridical provision barring the appeal. 

50. 
We will shortly proceed to discuss the effect of provision of

Section 100-A of the Code of Civil Procedure where the Legislature has 

specifically used non obstante language with particular reference to 

letters patent. 

INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES : * * 

51. 
A statute is stated to be a will of the Legislature. 
It 

expresses a will of the Legislature, and function of the Court is to 

interpret the document, according to the intent of them that made it. 

It is a settled rule of construction of statute that the provisions should 

be interpreted with application of plain rule of construction. The 

courts normally would not imply anything in them which is 

inconsistent with the words expressly used by the statute. In other 

words, the Court would keep in mind that its function is jus dicere, not 

jus dare. The right of appeal being creation of a statute and being a 

statutory right does not invite unnecessary liberal or strict 

construction. The best norm would be to give literal construction 

keeping the legislative intent in mind.

The Supreme Court in the case of Shiv Shakti Co-op. 

Housing Society, Nagpur vs Swaraj Developers and Others, reported in 

(2003) 6 SCC 659, while referring to the principles for interpretation of 

statutory provisions, held as under: -

"19. It is a well-settled principle in law that the court 
cannot read anything into a statutory provision which 
is plain and unambiguous. A statute is an edict of the 
legislature. The language employed in a statute is the 
determinative factor of legislative intent. Words and 
phrases are symbols that stimulate mental references to 
referents. The object of interpreting a statute is to 
ascertain the intention of the legislature enacting it. 
(See Institute of Chartered Accountants of India v. Price 
Waterhouse.) 
The intention of the legislature is 
primarily to be gathered from the language used, 
which means that attention should be paid to what has 
been said as also to what has not been said. As a 
consequence, a construction which requires for its 
support, addition or substitution of words or which 
results in rejection of words as meaningless has to be 
avoided. As observed in Crawford v. Spooner courts 
cannot aid the legislatures' defective phrasing of an 
Act, we cannot add or mend, and by construction make 
up deficiencies which are left there. (See State of 
Gujarat v. Dilipbhai Nathjibhai Patel ). It is contrary to 
all rules of construction to read words into an Act 
unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. [ See Stock v. 
Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd. ] Rules of interpretation do

67 

not permit courts to do so, unless the provision as it 
stands is meaningless or of a doubtful meaning. Courts 
are not entitled to read words into an Act of Parliament 
unless clear reason for it is to be found within the four 
corners of the Act itself. ( Per Lord Loreburn, L.C. In 
Vickers Sons and Maxim Ltd. v. Evans, quoted in Jumma 
Masjid v. Kodimaniandra Deviah.)" 

53. 
The Law Commission of India, in its 183 rd Report, while 

dealing with the need for providing principles of interpretation of 

statute as regards the extrinsic aids of interpretation in General 

Clauses Act, 1897 expressed the view that a statute is a will of 

legislature conveyed in the form of text. Noticing that process of 

interpretation is as old as language, it says that the rules of 

interpretation were evolved even at a very early stage of Hindu 

civilization and culture and the same were given by `Jaimini', the 

author of Mimamsat Sutras, originally meant for srutis were employed 

for the interpretation of Smrities also. While referring to the said 

historical background, the Commission said thus: -

"It is well settled principle of law that as the statute is 
an edict of the Legislature, the conventional way of 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


68 

interpreting or construing a statute is to seek the 
intention of legislature. The intention of legislature 
assimilates two aspects; one aspect carries the concept 
of `meaning', i.e., what the word means and another 
aspect conveys the concept of `purpose' and `object' or 
the `reason' or `spirit' pervading through the statute. 
The process of construction, therefore, combines both 
the literal and purposive approaches. 
However, 
necessity of interpretation would arise only where the 
language of a statutory provision is ambiguous, not 
clear or where two views are possible or where the 
provision gives a different meaning defeating the 
object of the statute. If the language is clear and 
unambiguous, no need of interpretation would arise. 
In this regard, a Constitution Bench of five Judges of 
the Supreme Court in R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay, AIR 
1984 SC 684 has held: 

".....If the words of the Statute are clear and 
unambiguous, it is the plainest duty of the 
Court to give effect to the natural meaning of 
the words used in the provision. 
The 
question of construction arises only in the 
event of an ambiguity or the plain meaning of 
the words used in the Statute would be self 
defeating." 

Recently, again Supreme Court in Grasim Industries 
Ltd. v. Collector of Customs, Bombay, (2002)4 SCC 
297 has followed the same principle and observed: 

"Where the words are clear and there is no 
obscurity, and there is no ambiguity and the 
intention of the legislature is clearly conveyed, 
there is no scope for court to take upon itself 
the task of amending or altering the statutory 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


69 

provisions." 

54. 
Above stated principles clearly show that the Court can 

safely apply rudiments of plain construction to legislative intent and 

object sought to be achieved by the enactment while interpreting the 

provision of an Act. It is not necessary for the Court to implant or 

exclude words or over emphasize the language of a provision where it 

is plain and simple. We have already noticed that Section 100-A 

opens with a non obstante clause and clause 44 of the Letters Patent 

refers to the aspect that the letters patent would be read in community 

with the legislative enactment. 
A clause beginning with 

`notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time 

being in force including the Letters Patent' normally would show the 

intent and the view of the Legislature enacting part of the section to 

give overriding effect over the provision of that Act or other laws in 

case of conflict. 
The enactment following it will have its full 

operation or that the provisions embraced in the non obstante clause 

will not be an impediment for the operation of the enactment. In the 

case of Union of India & Anr. v. G.M. Kokil & Ors., reported in 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


70 

1984(Supp) SCC 196, the Supreme Court observed thus:-

"A non obstante clause is a legislative device which is 
usually employed to give overriding effect to certain 
provisions over some contrary provisions that may be 
found either in the same enactment or some other 
enactment, that is to say, to avoid the operation and 
effect of all contrary provisions." 

55. 
The above observations have also been reiterated by the 

Supreme Court in the case of Pannalal Bansilal Patil v. State of Andhra 

Pradesh, reported in AIR 1996 SC 1023 and in the case of T.R. 

Thandur v. Union of India, reported in AIR 1996 SC 1643. Of course, 

a non obstante clause has to be distinguished from the phrase "without 

prejudice". A provision enacted "without prejudice" to another 

provision does not have the effect of affecting the operation of the 

other provision and any action taken under it must not be inconsistent 

with other provision. It is also to be kept in mind that the wide 

meaning of non obstante clause and the enacting words following it 

cannot be curtailed when the use of wide language accords with the 

object by the Act.

56. 
While dealing with interpretation of statutes regulating 

appeals the treatise of principles of statutory interpretation by Justice 

G.P. Singh ( 11 th Edition 2008) explains:-

"An appeal is the "right of entering a superior court 
and invoking its aid and interposition to redress an 
error of the court below" and "though procedure does 
surround an appeal the central idea is a right". The 
right of appeal has been recognised by judicial 
decisions as a right which vests in a suitor at the time 
of institution of original proceedings. Any change in 
the law relating to appeals, after institution of original 
proceedings, which adversely touches this vested right 
is presumed not to be retrospective." 

57. 
In the case of A.G. Varadarajulu & Anr. vs State of T.N. & 

Ors., reported in (1998) 4 SCC 231, the Supreme Court held as 

under: -

"16. It is well settled that while dealing with a non 
obstante clause under which the legislature wants to 
give overriding effect to a section, the court must try to 
find out the extent to which the legislature had 
intended to give one provision overriding effect over 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


72 

another provision. Such intention of the legislature in 
this behalf is to be gathered from the enacting part of 
the section. In Aswini Kumar Ghose v. Arabinda Bose, 
reported in AIR 1952 SC 369, Patanjali Sastri, J 
observed: 

"The enacting part of a statute must, where it 
is clear, be taken to control the non obstante 
clause where both cannot be read 
harmoniously." 

58. 
In the case of Iridium India Telecom Ltd. vs Motorola Inc., 

reported in (2005) 2 SCC 145, the Supreme Court, while relying 

upon the judgment of the of the Constitution Bench in the case of P.S. 

Sathappan vs Andhra Bank Ltd., reported in (2004) 11 SCC 672 did 

not accept the contention that the provision of superior legislation viz. 

Code of Civil Procedure would override the provision of the Letters 

Patent but clearly noticed firstly that there was no conflict between 

Section 104 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the Letters Patent and 

they could be harmoniously interpreted and permitted to operate in 

their field but specifically approved earlier view that once there was 

specific exclusion the provisions of Letters Patent would be overridden 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


73 

by the provisions of the Code. This was with reference to the 

language of Section 4 of the Code. Once there was specific provision 

to the contrary applicability of the special law could be excluded. It 

categorically specified and referred view of constitution bench in P.S. 

Sattapan's case (supra) that the specific provisions of this kind would 

be a provision like Section 100-A of the Code. 

59. 
On the clear analysis and application of judicial 

interpretative process, it is clear that Section 100-A of the Code of 

Civil Procedure and the Clause 15 of the Letters Patent would have to 

be construed on their plain reading and without any conflict. 

DISCUSSION ON MERITS : 

60. 
The factual matrix of the case has already been stated by 

us above. Suffice it to note that the present appeals have been filed 

after coming into force a provision of Section 100-A of the Code of 

Civil Procedure (i.e. 1 st July, 2002). All these appeals have been 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


74 

preferred against the judgment of the learned Single Judge passed in 

exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. The appeals before the learned 

Single Judge were preferred in terms of Section 173 of the Motor 

Vehicles Act and were accordingly decided by the learned Single 

Judge vide judgments dated 12 th February, 2004 and 25 th January, 

2005. There is undoubtedly no provision contained in the M.V. Act 

which gives right to appeal to any dissatisfied litigant to prefer an 

appeal against the appellate judgment of the learned Single Judge. In 

other words, special statute does not provide any right of second 

appeal against the judgment of the appellate court. The Tribunal 

certainly has trappings of a civil court, may be, it is not a civil court in 

stricto senso. Once the special law and even the M.V. Act which is 

treated to be a self-contained Code, and which do not provide for a 

grant of specific right of second appeal, the same cannot be made 

available by a recourse to any general provision. 
It is an 

unquestionable proposition of law that right of appeal is a statutory 

right and not a general, natural, or a fundamental right. In the 

absence of any provision granting such statutory right to prefer second 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


75 

appeal, the litigant cannot be permitted to rely upon the general 

provisions, if at all there is any, to prefer a second appeal. The award 

made by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal under Section 168 of the 

Act even if it is treated as a decree and so is the judgment of the 

learned Single Judge passed in appeal, still the Court would not be 

able to take recourse to general provision of the Code and for that 

matter, it will hardly be of any consequence as to whether the 

proceedings before the Tribunal are at parity with the civil court or 

actual proceedings are before the civil court. Non availability of right 

of appeal under the statute would be a complete answer to non-

maintainable of such an appeal. 

61. 
Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act provides only for a 

restricted right of appeal and the same cannot be stretched by 

interpretative process to hold that even a second appeal or an appeal 

against the appellate jurisdiction of the Single Judge would be 

maintainable. This would obviously be an interpretation which would 

neither further the cause of the Legislation nor it will be true on the 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


76 

plain reading of the Section. 

62. 
We have already noticed that the Tribunal has the 

trapping of a Civil Court and various procedural and effective 

provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure have been made applicable 

substantially to the proceeding before the Tribunal. After the Award is 

passed by the Tribunal, an Appeal under Section 173 is maintainable 

before the High Court and the High Court would exercise its appellate 

jurisdiction arising from a statute with the help of the provisions of the 

Code of Civil Procedure. Section 100A was introduced by the 

Legislature with a specific object. The object being to curtail the right 

of Second Appeal and attach finality to the judgment of the first 

appellate Court in normal course of law. That is the reason why the 

Legislature has specifically worded Section 100A while opening the 

Section with a non-obstante clause and provided over-riding effect 

over the provisions of Letters Patent, other law and even other 

instrument having the force of law. The intent of the Legislature to 

provide precedence to enforcement of Section 100A is patently clear 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


77 

from the unambiguous and definite language of Section 100A. We 

must notice here that both the Motor Vehicles Act and the Code of 

Civil Procedure are Central enactments. No State amendment has 

been carried by the State of Maharashtra to dilute or alter the effect of 

the language of either Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act or 

Section 100A of the CPC. The Legislature was fully aware of the 

provisions of Section 173 as well as of the Letters Patent when it 

introduced Section 100A which came into force on 1 st July 2002. Once 

the Legislature , being aware of the existing law, has worded Section 

100A in specific terms, then it has to be given its natural and effective 

meaning. The Court while construing these provisions by applying the 

principles of harmonious construction or otherwise, cannot frustrate 

the object of provisions of Section 100A which has been given over-

riding effect by use of non-obstante clause and with specific exclusion 

of other laws. Clause 15 of the Letters Patent thus would have to be 

read in conjunction with Clause 44 of the said Letters Patent and 

Section 100A of the CPC that too in light of the language of Section 

173 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The cumulative reading and analysis of 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


78 

these provisions in consonance with the Rules of interpretation stated 

above, would lead to simple and one conclusion that the Letters Patent 

appeal or an appeal against the judgment of the learned Single Judge 

passed in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction against the appellate 

judgment passed by the Court subordinate to the High Court, would 

not be appealable. Where Section 100A constitutes a complete bar 

against right to prefer an appeal against an appellate decision, there 

appeal cannot be preferred with the aid of Clause 15 of the Letters 

Patent against such judgment. 
Thus, either way, the obvious 

conclusion would be that no intra-Court appeal is maintainable in the 

High Court against the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge 

in exercise of its appellate powers in terms of Section 173 of the Motor 

Vehicles Act. 

63. 
Another aspect which would support the view which we 

are taking is that the whole object of introducing Section 100A was to 

curtail litigation by regulating the right of appeal. Attempt obviously 

is to attach finality to the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


79 

High Court particularly where he has passed the judgment while 

exercising appellate jurisdiction of the High Court. Where the 

judgment of the Tribunal and the learned Single Judge is treated as a 

judgment within the meaning of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent or not 

or under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, would hardly 

make any difference on the conclusion inasmuch as even against an 

order of the Single Judge in exercise of appellate jurisdiction, a further 

appeal is prohibited in terms of Section 100A. The Legislative object 

of regulating the right of appeal and rendering Second Appeal from 

appellate order or judgment impermissible would stand defeated by 

any other interpretation. The rule of mischief contemplates that what 

remedy the Parliament resolved and attempted to cure the disease 

should be permitted to operate rather than the same be defeated by 

process of interpretation. The Court while performing its function of 

interpretation of law would make such construction as shall suppress 

the mischief and advance the remedy and to suppress subtle 

inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief and pro 

privato commodo. The mischief which is sought to be controlled and 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


80 

avoided by the Legislature is not to grant repeated right of appeal and 

to introduce the concept of finality to the appellate judgment, decree 

or order. The provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act do not recognise 

an appeal from an appellate jurisdiction of the High Court passed 

under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act. On the contrary, Section 

100A specifically bars filing of an appeal against such judgment. The 

provisions of Section 100-A have a precedence and take limited 

exception to the provisions of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. On 

plain reading of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent, an appeal to a 

Division Bench of the High Court from the judgment of the learned 

Single Judge passed while deciding an appeal against the appellate 

judgment, and decree or order passed by the Court of competent 

jurisdiction subordinate to the High Court would not be maintainable. 

The only exception to this general rule is that where the learned Single 

Judge grants a certificate of fitness as contemplated under the 

language of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. This we have noticed only 

to elucidate the point that Clause 15 will have to be read with Clause 

44 of the Letters Patent and thus giving precedent to Section 100-A of 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


81 

the Code of Civil Procedure. The cumulative reading of all these 

provisions would thus show that Clause 15 of the Letters Patent 

cannot be treated as a provision granting independent right of appeal 

de hors the other relevant provisions noticed by us in this judgment. 

64. 
The Supreme Court in the case of P S Sathappan (supra) 

clearly stated while referring to Clause 44 of the Letters Patent that 

provisions of Letters Patent were subject to legislative powers of the 

Governor-General-in-Legislative Council and, therefore, in the present-

day context, subject to legislative power of the appropriate legislature. 

(Emphasis supplied). 

65. 
Now we would refer to the judgments, some of which 

were relied upon by either party before us in support and against the 

proposition formulated at the beginning of this judgment. 

66. 
In the case of Kamal Kumar Dutta (supra), the Supreme 

Court was dealing with Sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act 

and while holding that an appeal against an order made by the 

Company Law Board under Section 10E was maintainable before the 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


82 

High Court under Section 10F and after referring to the pre-

amendment provisions held that no appeal was maintainable against 

the order of the learned Single Judge passed in appeal in face of 

Section 100A and despite the language of Clause 15 of the Letters 

Patent of the Calcutta High Court and held as under :-

"16. Appeal lies under Letters Patent from the 
judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court 
to the Division bench. In this connection, learned 
counsel placed reliance on a decision of this Court in 
the case of Garikapatti Veeraya vs N Subbiah 
Choudhury reported in 1957 SCR 488 and submitted 
that the appeal is vested right and it cannot be taken 
away. Alternative submission was if clause 15 does not 
apply, appeal lies under Section 483 of the Act. In this 
connection reliance was placed on decisions of this 
Court in the case of Arati Dutta vs M/s Eastern Tea 
Estate (P) Ltd reported in (1988) 1 SCC 523 and the in 
the case of Maharashtra Power Development 
Corporation Limited vs DabholPower Company & Ors., 
reported in (2003) 117 Company Cases 651. As against 
this, learned senior counsel for the appellants 
submitted that Section 10F of the Act came into being 
with effect from 31.5.1991. Prior to that application 
under Sections 397 and 398 of the Act was being filed 
with the Company Judge in the High Court. But after 
the amendment of the Act by Act 31 of 1988, this 
power under Sections 397 & 398 of the Act has been 
given to the CLB. Under Section 10E of the Act, the 
Company Law Board was created. It deals with 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


83 

applications under Sections 397 and 398 of the Act. 
Therefore, learned Single Judge has not exercised 
original jurisdiction and as such the appeal 
contemplated under clause 15 of the Letters Patent is 
not maintainable. Learned senior counsel invited our 
attention to Section 100A of the Code of Civil 
Procedure which came into being with effect from 
1.7.2002. This section starts with non-obstante clause 
that notwithstanding anything contained in any Letters 
Patent for any High Court or in any other instrument 
having the force of law or in any other law for the time 
being in force, where any appeal from an original or 
appellate decree or order is heard and decided by a 
single Judge of a High Court, no further appeal shall lie 
from the judgment and decree of such single Judge. 
Therefore, it was pointed out that in view of the latest 
amendment in the Code of Civil Procedure, Letters 
Patent or intra court appeal will not lie when the 
learned Single Judge has exercised appellate 
jurisdiction. In fact, this amendment seems to have 
been brought about on the recommendations of the 
Malimath Committee report that right to appeal should 
be curtained and only one appellate forum should be 
available. Therefore, in view of this recommendations, 
this amendment was brought about. In support of this 
contention learned senior counsel invited our attention 
to the following decisions. 
(i) (2004) 11 SCC 672 ( P.S. Sathappan (dead) by 
Lrs Vs. Andhra Bank Ltd. & Ors.) 
(ii) (2003) 10 SCC 361 (Subal Paul vs Malina Paul & 
Anr.) 
(iii) AIR 2003 AP 458 (Gandla Pannala Bhulaxmi vs. 
Managing Director, APSRTC & Anr.) 
(iv) (1987) 62 Company Cases 504 (Rev. C.S. Joseph 
& Ors. vs. T.J. Thomas & Ors.) 
(v) AIR 2004 Ker. 111 (Kesava Pillai Sreedharan 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


84 

Pillai & etc. vs. State of Kerala & Ors.) 

17. We have considered the rival submissions of the 
parties. The first question that we have to examine is 
whether the appeal against the order of the learned 
Single Judge lies before the Division Bench under 
Letters Patent or not. It may be relevant to mention 
here that prior to the amendment of the Act, the power 
under Sections 397 & 398 used to be exercised by the 
Company Judge of the High Court. Appeal against that 
order of the learned Single Judge lies under Section 
483 of the Act before the Division Bench of the High 
Court. Section 483 of the Act reads as under : 

"483. Appeals from orders -Appeals from any 
order made or decision given before the 
commencement 
of 
the 
Companies 
(Second 
Amendment) Act, 2002, in the matter of the winding 
up of a company by the Court shall lie to the same 
Court to which, in the same manner in which, and 
subject to the same conditions under which, appeals 
lie from any order or decision of the Court in cases 
within its ordinary jurisdiction. 

But after the amendment the power which was being 
exercised under Sections 397 & 398 of the Act by 
learned Single Judge of the High Court is being 
exercised by the CLB under Section 10E of the Act. 
Appeal against the order passed by the CLB, lies to the 
High Court under Section 10F of the Act. Therefore, 
the position which was obtaining prior to the 
amendment in 1991 was that any order passed by the 
Single Judge exercising the power under Sections 397 
& 398 of the Act, the appeal used to lie before the 
Division Bench of the High Court. But after the 
amendment the power has been given to the CLB and 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


85 

the appeal has been provided under Section 10F of the 
Act. Thus Part 1A was inserted by the amendment with 
effect from 1.1.1964. But the constitution of the 
Company Law Board and the power to decide 
application under Sections 397 & 398 of the Act was 
given to the CLB with effect from 31.5.1991. Therefore, 
on reading of Sections 10E, 10F, 397 & 398 of the Act, 
it becomes clear that it is a complete code that 
applications under sections 397 & 398 of the Act shall 
be dealt with by the CLB and the order of the CLB is 
appealable under Section 10F of the Act before the 
High Court. No further appeal has been provided 
against the order of the learned Single Judge. Mr. 
Nariman, learned senior counsel for the respondents 
submitted that an appeal is a vested right and 
therefore, under clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the 
Calcutta High Court, the appellants have a statutory 
right to prefer appeal irrespective of the fact that no 
appeal has been provided against the order of the 
learned Single Judge under the Act. In this connection, 
learned counsel invited our attention to a decision of 
this Court in the case of Garikapatti Veeraya vs. N 
Subbiah Choudhury reported in (1957) SCR SCR 488 
and in that it has been pointed out that the appeal is a 
vested right. The majority took the view that the 
appeal is a vested right. It was held as follows : 

"... that the contention of the appellant was well-
founded, that he had a vested right of appeal to the 
Federal Court on and from the date of the suit and the 
application for special leave should be allowed. 

The vested right of appeal was a substantive right 
and, although it could be exercised only in case of an 
adverse decision, it was governed by the law prevailing 
at the time of commencement of the suit and

86 

comprised all successive rights of appeal from court to 
court, which really constituted one proceeding. Such a 
right could be taken away only by a subsequent 
enactment either expressly or by necessary 
intendment." 

So far as the general proposition of law is concerned 
that the appeal is a vested right there is no quarrel with 
the proposition but it is clarified that such right can be 
taken away by a subsequent enactment either expressly 
or by necessary intendment. The Parliament while 
amending Section 100A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
by amending Act 22 of 2002 with effect from 1.7.2002, 
took away the Letters Patent power of the High Court 
in the matter of appeal against an order of learned 
single Judge to the Division Bench. 

Section 100A of the Code of Civil Procedure 
reads as ......................................................................... 

Therefore, where appeal has been decided from an 
original order by a single Judge, no further appeal has 
been provided and that power which used to be there 
under the Letters Patent of the High Court has been 
subsequently withdrawn. The present order which has 
been passed by the CLB and against that appeal has 
been provided before the High Court under Section 10F 
of the Act, that is an appeal from the original order. 
Then in that case no further Letters Patent Appeal shall 
lie to the Division Bench of the same High Court. This 
amendment has taken away the power of the Letters 
Patent in the manner where learned single Judge hears 
an appeal from the original order. Original order in 
the present case was passed by the CLB exercising the 
power under Sections 397 and 398 of the Act and 
appeal has been preferred under Section 10F of the Act

87 

before the High Court. Learned single Judge having 
passed an order, no further appeal will lie as the 
Parliament in its wisdom has taken away its power. 
Learned counsel for the respondents invited our 
attention to a letter from the then Law Minister. That 
letter cannot override the statutory provision. When 
the statute is very clear, whatever statement by the Law 
Minister made in the floor of the House, cannot change 
the words and intendment which is borne out from the 
words. The letter of the Law Minister cannot be read to 
interpret the provisions of Section 100A. 
The 
intendment of the Legislature is more than clear in the 
words and the same has to be given its natural 
meaning and cannot be subject to any statement made 
by the Law Minister in any communication. The words 
speak for itself. It does not require any further 
interpretation by any statement made in any manner. 
Therefore, the power of the high Court in exercising 
Letters Patent in a matter where a single Judge has 
decided the appeal from original order, has been taken 
away and it cannot be invoked in the present context. 
There is no two opinion in the matter that when the 
CLB exercises its powers under Sections 397 & 398 of 
the Act, it exercised its quasi-judicial power as original 
authority. It may not be a court but it has all the 
trapping of a court. 
Therefore, the CLB while 
exercising its original jurisdiction under Sections 397 & 
398 of the Act passed the order and against that order 
appeal lie to the learned single Judge of the High Court 
and thereafter no further appeal could be filed. 

18. In this connection, our attention was invited to a 
decision in the case of Arati Dutta vs M/s Eastern Tea 
Estate (P) Ltd. reported in (1988) 1 SCC 523. This was 
a case in which the power was exercised by learned 
single Judge under Sections 397 & 398 of the Act and 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


88 

against that order appeal lay to the Division Bench of 
the High Court under Section 483 of the Act. In that 
context, their Lordships observed that mere absence of 
procedural rules would not deprive the litigant's of 
substantive right conferred by the statute. We have 
already explained above that earlier the power under 
Sections 397 & 398 of the Act was being exercised by 
learned Company Judge in the High Court and 
therefore, appeal lay to the Division Bench under 
Section 483 of the Act. If the power has been exercised 
by the Company Judge in the High Court, then one 
appeal shall lie before the Division Bench of the High 
Court under Section 483 of the Act. But that is not the 
situation in the present case. Therefore, this decision 
cannot be of any help to respondents." 

67. 
This judgment in fact is a complete answer to the 

arguments raised on behalf of the Appellants. In that case, the 

Supreme Court even took the view that a body like Company Law 

Board has the trapping of a Civil Court and it exercises original 

jurisdiction under Sections 397/398 of the Companies Act against 

which an appeal lies to the Single Judge. It also rejected the 

contention that Section 100A does not create a specific bar. While 

referring to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Subal Paul vs 

Malina Paul and another, (2003) 10 SCC 361, the Court referred with 

approval the dictum of the Court which reads as follows : 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


89 

"Whenever the statute provides such a bar, it is so 
expressly stated, as would appear from Section 100-A 
of the Code of Civil Procedure." 

Motor Accident Claims Tribunal which has all the trapping of a Civil 

Court, discharges its judicial functions subject to the superintendence 

and control of the High Court. In fact, the High Court being its 

appellate Court, would exercise all the control over the Motor 

Accident Claims Tribunal. 

68. 
It can be useful to notice at this stage itself that in Kamal 

Kumar Dutta (supra), the view taken by a Division Bench of this Court 

in the case of Maharashtra Power Development Corporation Limited vs 

Dabhol Power Company and others, (2003) 117 Company Cases 651 

= AIR 2004 BOM 38, that appeal shall lie against the judgment of the 

Single Judge passed in Appeal against the order of Company Law 

Board as the Letters Patent Appeal or a statutory appeal under special 

enactment and will not be affected by the provisions of Section 100-A, 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


90 

was specifically rejected and the view taken by this Court was held to 

be incorrect proposition of law. 

69. 
In the case of Municipal Corporation of Brihanmumbai and 

another vs State Bank of India, (1999) 1 SCC 123, the Court was 

concerned with maintainability of a Letters Patent Appeal under 

Clause 15 from the judgment and order of the Single Judge passed on 

an Appeal under Section 218-D of Bombay Municipal Corporation Act. 

The Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 is a complete code and 

contains provisions of filing of appeals, etc., against the order made 

under the Act. In terms of Section 127(1) of the Act, the jurisdiction is 

exercised by the Chief Judge of Small Causes Court and the appeal 

against that order was preferred before the High Court under Section 

218-D of the Act and the Court held that no Second Appeal could lie 

from that order observing as under : 

"9. Thus, according to Section 218-D, an appeal shall 
also lie to the High Court from any decision of the 
Chief Judge of the Small Cause Court in an appeal 
under Section 217, "upon a question of law or usage 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


91 

having the force of law or the construction of a 
document". That the respondent had taken recourse to 
Section 218-D(1) in filing an appeal against the 
appellate order of the learned Additional Chief Judge 
of the Small Cause Court is not in dispute. 
The 
appellant has not questioned the maintainability of the 
appeal filed by the respondent under Section 218-D of 
the Act before the learned Single Judge of the High 
Court before us. Thus, it is obvious that the appeal 
filed by the respondent under Section 218-D of the Act 
was a second appeal against the appellate order made 
by the Additional Chief Judge, Small Cause Court. 
Under the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, no 
further appeal has been provided against the judgment 
of a learned Single Judge of the High Court deciding 
the second appeal under Section 218-D of the Act 
against an appellate order of the Chief Judge of the 
Small Cause Court passed under Section 217(1) of the 
Act. Section 100-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
which was introduced by the Amendment Act, 1976, 
specifically bars any further appeal in such cases. .... 

10. This section has been introduced to minimise the 
delay in the finality of a decision. Prior to the 
enactment of the above provision, under the letters 
patent, an appeal against the decision of a Single Judge 
in a second appeal was, in certain cases, held 
competent, though under Section 100 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, there was some inhibition against 
interference with the findings of fact. The right of 
taking recourse to such an appeal has now been taken 
away by Section 100-A of the Code of Civil Procedure 
(supra). Since an appeal under Section 217(1) of the 
Act is a first appeal in a second forum/court and an 
appeal under Section 218-D of the Act is the second 
appeal in the third forum/court, no further appeal 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


92 

would be competent before the fourth forum/court in 
view of Section 100-A of the Code of Civil Proeedure 
(supra)." 

70. 
At this stage, even at the cost of repetition, we may notice 

that the provisions of Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act provide 

for an appeal against the Award of the Tribunal specifically and do not 

contemplate any further appeal. Thus, the statute does not specifically 

provide for any further right of appeal. 

71. 
A Division Bench of Rajasthan High Court in the case of 

HYPERLINK "http://R.S.R.T.C/" HYPERLINK "http://R.S.R.T.C/"R.S.R.T.C. & etc. 

etc. vs Vaibhav Kumar and others, etc., AIR 2007 RAJASTHAN 147, 

while dealing with identical questions relating to maintainability of a 

Letters Patent Appeal against the appellate order passed by the Single 

Judge of the High Court under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 

held that the further intra-Court appeal is barred by Section 100-A of 

the Code of Civil Procedure. It mainly relied upon the judgment of 

the Kamal Kumar Dutta's case (supra), while also referring to other

93 

provisions including a view of Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High 

Court in the case of M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. S. Surya 

Prakash Reddy and another, 2006 (4) Andh L T 448, The Court held 

as under :-

"16. A Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in 
the case of Gandla Pannala Bhulaxmi v APRTC and 
another, AIR 2003 AP 458, was seized with the 
question whether the right of appeal available under 
the Letters Patent is taken away by Section 100A of the 
Civil Procedure Code in respect of the matter arising 
under special enactments or other instruments having 
the force of law. That was a case where Letters Patents 
Appeal was preferred from the order of a Single Judge 
passed in an appeal under Section 173 of the Motor 
Vehicles Act. The Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh 
High Court upon consideration of the amended 
provision of Section 100A and the judgment of the 
Supreme Court in the case of Vinita M Khanolkar v 
Pragna M Pal, AIR 1998 SC 424 and another decision of 
the Supreme Court in Sharda Devi v State of Bihar, AIR 
2002 SC 1357, held that Section 100A of the Code of 
Civil Procedure in clear and specific terms prohibits 
further appeal against the judgment and decree of a 
Single Judge to a Division Bench notwithstanding 
anything contained in the Letters Patents. It was held 
that the Letter Patents which provides for further 
appeal to a Division bench remains intact but the right 
to prefer a further appeal is taken away even in respect 
of the matters arising under a special enactment or 
other instruments having the force of law. 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


94 

17. The view of the Kerala High Court is on the same 
lines. A Full Bench of Kerala High Court in the case of 
Kesava Pillai Sreedharan Pillai and etc. v State of Kerala 
and others, AIR 2004 Kerala 111, was concerned with 
the question whether an appeal from a judgment, 
decree or order passed by the Single Judge on an 
appeal against the order of a Court or tribunal is 
maintainable despite Section 100A of the Code of Civil 
Procedure effective from 1 st July, 2002. 

18. The Full Bench of the Kerala High Court noticed 
that the intention of the Legislature by enacting Section 
100A was to abolish an intra-Court appeal to the Bench 
of two Judges of the same High Court from a decision 
rendered by a Single Judge. It held that Section 100A 
of the Code of Civil Procedure would prevail over the 
provisions contained in Section 5(ii) of the Kerala High 
Court Act. We may observe here that the said provision 
is similar to erstwhile Section 18 of the Rajasthan High 
Court Ordinance, 1949 regarding further appeal to the 
Bench of two Judges from the decision of the Single 
Judge. The Full Bench of Kerala High Court has thus 
held that the right of further appeal as provided under 
Section 5 (ii) of the Kerala High Court Act stands 
abrogated by Section 100A of the Civil Procedure Code 
w. e. f. 1 st July, 2002. 

19. The Supreme Court in Subal Paul v Malina Paul 
and another, (2003) 10 SCC 3611 : AIR 2003 SC 1928, 
was concerned with the question whether the Letters 
Patent Appeal would lie from the judgment of a Single 
Judge of the High Court filed under Section 299 of the 
Indian Succession Act. Pertinently in Subal Paul's case 
the Supreme Court observed that whenever a statute 
provided such a bar it did so expressly as would appear 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


95 

from Section 100A of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is 
also important to notice that in Subal Paul an appeal 
was preferred before the Division Bench from the order 
of the Single Judge prior to 1 st July, 2002. 

20. The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in 
P.S. Sathappan (dead) by L.Rs. V Andhra Bank Ltd. & 
Ors., (2004) 11 SCC 672 : AIR 2004 SC 5152, 
extensively dealt with the provisions contained in 
Section 100A and the other provisions of the Code of 
Civil Procedure, more particularly, Sections 4 and 104 
and had held that when the Legislature wanted to 
exclude the Letters Patent Appeal, it specifically did so 
and the words used in Section 100a were not by way of 
abundant caution. That is what the Supreme Court 
said in P.S. Sathappan (supra) (Para 30 of AIR ) :-

"It is thus to be seen that when the legislature 
wanted to exclude a letters patent appeal it specifically 
did so. The words used in Section 100A are not by way 
of abundant caution. By the Amendment Acts of 1976 
and 2002 a specific exclusion is provided as the 
legislature knew that in the absence of such words a 
Letters Patent Appeal would not be barred. The 
legislature was aware that it had incorporated the 
saving clause in Section 104(1) and incorporated 
Section 4, CPC. Thus, now a specific exclusion was 
provided. 

"100-A : ............................................................. 

To be noted that here again the legislature has 
provided for a specific exclusion. It must be stated that 
now by virtue of Section 100A no letters patent appeal 
would be maintainable. However, it is an admitted 
position that the law which would prevail would be the

96 

law at the relevant time. At the relevant time neither 
Section 100A nor Section 104(2) barred a letters patent 
appeal." 

21. The recent decision that squarely concludes the 
controversy is the decision of the Supreme Court in the 
case of Kamal Kumar Dutta, 2006 AIR SCW 4594. That 
was a case where the Company Law Board passed order 
under Sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act. An 
appeal was filed before the High Court under Section 
10F of the Companies Act. The said appeal was heard 
and disposed of by the Single Judge. From the order of 
the Single Judge under Section 10F of the Companies 
Act, the matter was carried to the Apex Court. Before 
the Apex Court, an objection was raised regarding 
maintainability of the appeal on the ground that the 
appellants have alternative remedy of approaching the 
Division Bench under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent 
and that the appellants ought to have availed the said 
remedy. Dealing with this aspect, the Supreme Court 
held that Letters Patent appeal against the order passed 
by a Single Judge in an appeal under Section 10F of the 
Companies Act would not be maintainable. 

22. It would be seen that the Supreme Court held 
that the power exercised by the Company Law Board 
under Sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act is a 
quasi-judicial power as original authority. It may not 
be a Court but it has all the trappings of a Court and, 
therefore, the Company Law Board while exercising its 
original jurisdiction under Section 397 and 398 of the 
Companies Act passed the order and against that order 
appeal would lay to the learned Single Judge of the 
High Court and thereafter no further appeal could be 
filed.

97 

23. The legal position exposited by the Supreme 
Court in Kamal Kumar Dutta, 2006 AIR SCW 4694, 
applies on all fours to the order/award passed by the 
Motor Accident Claims Tribunal under Section 168 of 
the Motor Vehicles Act and where such order/award is 
carried in an appeal under Section 173 of that Act. 
Even if it be assumed that the Motor Accident Claims 
Tribunal is not a Court as is the term ordinarily 
understood, it is beyond doubt that such Tribunal has 
all the trapping of a Court. Though the Tribunals 
occupy a special position of their own under the 
scheme of the Courts and Tribunals and special matters 
and questions are entrusted to them for their decision 
yet they share with the Courts one common 
characteristic viz. : both the Courts as well as Tribunals 
are constituted by the State and are invested with 
judicial functions as distinguished from purely 
administrative or executive functions. It is the State's 
inherent judicial power which is discharged by the 
Courts and Tribunals, if the Company Law Board 
constituted under the Companies Act in its adjudicatory 
powers has the trappings of a Court and an appeal 
under Section 10F of the Companies Act from its order 
to the Single Judge is not amenable to further appeal 
(Letters Patent) to the Division Bench of the same 
Court because of Section 100A of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, a fortiori, an order passed by the Single 
Judge in appeal under Section 173 of the Motor 
Vehicles Act from the order/award of the Motor 
Accident Claims Tribunal shall not be subject to intra-
Court appeal in view of the bar created by Section 100A 
of the Code of Civil Procedure effective from 1 st July, 
2002." 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


98 

72. 
The Bench also noticed the distinction between the decree, 

order and the award. It held that decision of the Single Judge in 

Appeal under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act is nothing but a 

judgment. We adopt the reasoning and have no hesitation in coming 

to the conclusion that the Award of the Tribunal and in any case the 

judgment of the learned Single Judge passed under Section 173 of the 

Motor Vehicles Act in appeal has all the ingredients of a judgment 

within the meaning of Section 15 of the Letters Patent and/or under 

the Code of Civil Procedure. 

73. 
The provisions of Letters Patent, being a special law, as 

opposed to Civil Procedure Code which would be generally applicable 

to all Courts, would have normally taken precedence and regulated 

the right to file an appeal, but for the non-obstante clause and specific 

exclusion of its application in terms of Section 100A of the Code of 

Civil Procedure. In the case of P.S. Sathappan (supra) as well as in the 

case of Iridium India Telecom Ltd. (supra), it was held that the 

provision of Section 100A is the provision which specifically excludes 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


99 

application of other laws. 

74. 
We have discussed in some elaboration, the reasons for 

arriving at a conclusion that the Letters Patent Appeal against the 

appellate judgment passed in exercise of powers conferred on the 

court under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act is not maintainable. 

Similar view was taken by a Five Judge Bench of the Andhra Pradesh 

High Court in the case of M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. S. 

Surya Prakash Reddy and another, 2006 (4) Andh L T 448, and a Full 

Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of Laxminarayan 

vs Shivlal Gujar, 2003 91) MPLJ (FB) 10 = AIR 2003 MP 49 (FB). 

With respect, we also adopt the reasoning given by the two High 

Courts in support of our view. We also add and follow the view of 

these Courts which is in consonance with the judgment of the 

Supreme Court afore-referred. This principle would not apply to the 

Appeals which were preferred prior to 1 st July 2002 as the provisions 

of Section 100A are prospective in their operation and limitations. 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


100 

75. 
It is a settled principle of law that appeal is continuation of 

original proceedings and the procedural law regulating the right of 

appeal would be prospective unless and until it is clearly spelt out to 

the contrary. Equally well settled is the principle that right of appeal 

being a statutory right can be regulated and/or even taken away by a 

subsequent Legislation. There being no fundamental right or a 

general right to prefer appeals, the appeals instituted prior to 1 st July 

2002, before introduction of Section 100-A on the statute of Code of 

Civil Procedure would be controlled by earlier law and the appeals 

filed thereafter would be regulated by the present provisions of 

Section 100-A of the Code. 

76. 
In the case of Kamla Devi vs Kushal Kanwar and another, 

(2006) 13 SCC 295, the Supreme Court, where the Appeal before the 

learned Single Judge under the provisions of the Indian Succession Act 

was filed in the year 1992 against the order passed by the learned 

Single Judge dated 13 th February 1992, held that the Letters Patent 

Appeal would be maintainable as it was filed prior to coming into 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


101 

force of the Amending Act of 2002 Act. The Supreme Court also 

noticed the judgments in the case of Kamal Kumar Dutta (supra) and 

Subal Paul (supra). The main contention in these cases was with 

regard to retrospective or prospective operation of Section 100-A and 

also that for appeals filed prior to Amendment Act, it had not taken 

away the right of appeal provided the ingredients of Clause 15 of the 

Letters Patent were satisfied. 
Obviously, one of the relevant 

considerations would be as to when the right to file an appeal arose. 

As noticed in the case of Kamla Devi (supra), the judgment was passed 

on 13 th February 2002 and appeal itself was filed at that time and, 

therefore, was controlled by the law prior to the amendment of 1 st July 

2002. 

77. 
Having noticed the relevant principles of law and the 

interpretation that the relevant provisions of law need to be 

interpreted on settled canons of interpretative jurisprudence, now we 

may analyse the view taken by a Division Bench of this Court in the 

case of Asha Joshi (supra) which is the very basis for the present 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


102 

Reference. In paragraph 40 of the said judgment, the Bench 

concluded as under :-

"40. To sum up, we hold that : 

(a) Section 100-A of the Code of Civil Procedure 
would apply on to the proceedings governed by 
the Code; 

(b) Proceedings under section 140, 163-A or 166 of 
the Motor Vehicles Act are not governed by the 
Code and Claims Tribunal is not a Civil Court; 

(c) Award by Tribunal is not a decree or order of a 
Civil Court; 

(d) Such award is not a decree or order made in 
exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a Court subject 
to superintendence of the High Court; 

(e) A single judge of this Court hearing appeals under 
section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act from awards 
of Claims Tribunal consequently does not deliver a 
judgment in exercise of appellate jurisdiction in 
respect of a decree or order made in exercise of 
appellate jurisdiction; 

(f) It would, therefore, follow that such judgment of 
Single Judge would be subject to an appeal under 
Clause 15 of the Letters Patent."

103 

78. 
With greatest respect, we are unable to contribute to the 

conclusions arrived at by the Bench as, in our opinion, it is not a 

correct exposition of law. Inter alia, we may notice the patent reasons 

for which we are unable to accept the law Asha Joshi's case (supra). 

(a) Despite the fact that the judgment was pronounced 

on 12 th December 2007, the judgment of the 

Supreme Court in Kamal Kumar Dutta (supra) 

decided on 11 th August 2006, which has a direct 

bearing and to a large extent answers the 

controversies in issue was not brought to the notice 

of the Bench. The ratio decidendi stated in Kamal 

Kumar Dutta (supra) case being squarely applicable 

to the facts of the present case, would have been 

the correct precept for answering the questions of 

law. 

(b) The Division Bench did not notice and interprete 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


104 

the language of Section 100-A of the Code of Civil 

Procedure in relation to the cases where the 

appeals were filed subsequent to st July 2002. 

(c) Clause 44 of the Letters Patent was not brought to 

the notice of the Bench so as to grant precedence to 

the provisions of Section 100-A even after the 

provisions of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent were 

attracted in the present case. 

(d) The Bench treated the Motor Vehicles Act as a 

special law, however, no material was placed 

before the Bench to the effect that under the 

special statute the order passed by the Single Judge 

in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction under 

Section 173 was made appealable. In other words, 

no Second Appeal was provided under the Motor 

Vehicles Act. 

(e) The Full Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


105 

in the case of Laxminarayan (supra) and this Court 

in the case of Rahul Sharad (supra) were primarily 

concerned 
with 
the 
retrospectivity 
and 

prospectivity of the provisions of Section 100-A 

which in fact already stand settled by the judgment 

of the Supreme Court in Bento De Souza Egipsy vs 

Yvette Alvares Colaco, (2004) 13 SCC 438, and 

Kamla Devi (supra) and the said provisions being 

prospective and appeals in the case before the 

Bench having been filed subsequent o 1 st July 2002 

and as such they will be covered by the provisions 

of Section 100-A of the Code. 

(f) The view of the Division Bench that the Tribunal 

was neither a Civil Court nor had the trapping 

thereof, in our humble opinion, is not correct 

position of law in view of the well settled position 

of law as afore-noticed. The Tribunal has all the 

trapping of a Civil Court and its orders are

106 

judgments or orders as even known in the common 

parlance. The learned Single Judge exercises 

powers of an appellate Court in terms of the Code 

of Civil Procedure while hearing an appeal 

preferred to that Court in terms of Section 173 of 

the Motor Vehicles Act. 
The Tribunal and 

particularly the appellate Court does not lose the 

trapping of a Civil Court while exercising such 

jurisdiction. 

(g) The Division Bench placed heavy reliance upon the 

observations of the Supreme Court in the case of 

Sharda Devi (supra) stating that the provisions of 

Letters Patent were akin to the constitutional 

powers of the Court, but it was clarified and in fact 

not accepted by the Constitution Bench in P.S. 

Satthapan's case (supra) where the Court held as 

under : 

".... At this stage it must be clarified that during

107 

arguments, relying on the sentence "the powers 
given to a High Court under the Letters Patent are 
akin to the constitutional powers of a High Court" 
in para 9 of this judgment it had been suggested 
that a Letters Patent had the same status as the 
Constitution. 
In our view these observations 
merely lay down that the powers given to a High 
Court are the powers with which that High Court is 
constituted. These observations do not put Letters 
Patent on a par with the Constitution." 

(h) In our considered view, the Division Bench while 

determining the controversy before it could have 

hardly relied upon the judgment of the Supreme 

Court in the case of Jindal Vijaynagar Steel vs 

Jindal Praxair Oxygen Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 

521, where the Supreme Court was primarily 

concerned with interpretation of Clause 12 of the 

Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court and 

Section 20 of the Civil Procedure code in relation 

to determination of jurisdiction. The question in 

that case related to the determination of Ordinary 

Original Civil Jurisdiction under the Letters Patent

108 

Act in relation to a cause of action arising within 

the jurisdiction of the Court and on construction of 

Sections 20 and 120 of the Code read with 

Arbitration Act, 1940, it was held that the Court 

would exercise jurisdiction in terms of Clause 12 of 

the Letters Patent. 

79. 
Another aspect, which needs to be examined by us, is that 

the Division Bench in Asha's case (supra) in paragraph 33 noticed 

another judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in the case of 

Bhenoy G. Dembla & Anr. vs M/s. Prem Kutir P. Ltd., reported in 

2003(4) Mh.L.J. 883, where the Division Bench had taken the view 

that keeping in view the provisions of Section 100-A of the Code of 

Civil Procedure and Section 10F of the Companies Act, 1956, an 

appeal from the judgment of the learned Single Judge in exercise of its 

appellate jurisdiction under Section 10-F of the Companies Act would 

not lie after 1 st July, 2002. The Bench held that : 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


109 

".......... There is no express conferment of a right of 
a further appeal to the Division Bench against the 
decision of a learned Single Judge. That being the 
position, an appeal to the Division Bench is clearly 
not maintainable against the decision of the Single 
Judge rendered after 1 st July, 2002." 

80. 
In our view, the most appropriate course of action in 

consonance with the judicial propriety and discipline would have been 

that the Division Bench dealing with Asha's case (supra) should have 

referred the matter to a larger Bench rather than expressing the 

contrary view to that of equi bench judgment in Bhenoy G. Dembla's 

case (supra) which had been pronounced much earlier. Be that as it 

may, we would leave the matter at that stage and proceed to discuss 

paragraph 33 of the judgment in Asha's case (supra) where the Bench 

distinguished the judgment in Bhenoy G. Dembla's case (supra) that the 

proceedings in that case had arisen from the provisions of Section 10-F 

of the Companies Act. The Division Bench in Asha's case (supra) had 

referred to earlier Division Bench Judgment of this Court in the case of 

Maharashtra Power Development Corporation Limited's case (supra) which 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


110 

had taken the contrary view and held that the judgment of Company 

Court pronounced in the appeal under Section 10-F of the Companies 

Act would not be a judgment and decree within the meaning of the 

provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore, the appeal 

was not barred in terms of Section 100-A of the Code of Civil 

Procedure. The Division Bench in Asha's case (supra) ignored the fact 

that the view of the Division Bench of Bombay High Court in 

Maharashtra Power Development Corporation Limited's case (supra) was 

not approved by the Supreme Court in Kamal Kumar Dutta's case 

(supra), and in fact, diametrically opposite view has been expressed by 

the Supreme Court which we have already discussed in some detail. 

It was expected from the learned counsel appearing for the respective 

parties to bring these judgments to the notice of the Division Bench, 

which, if brought, we have no doubt in our mind that the Bench would 

have come to a different conclusion and preferably to the one 

indicated above. 

81. 
It is a settled norm of interpretation of statute that the 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


111 

enactment should be examined in its entirety and the Court essentially 

are considering the legislative scheme and object and intent of the 

Legislature even while applying the rule of plain interpretation. 

Reference to one or two odd provisions of the Act, Code or Rules 

framed under that Act may not thus sufficiently satisfy the 

requirements of law. We have discussed in some elaboration the 

various provisions of the Civil Procedure Code that have been made 

specifically applicable to the Motor Vehicles Act. The functions and 

powers of the Tribunal in the process of determination are controlled 

by the specific provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as indicated in 

Section 169 of the Motor Vehicles Act and Rules 257 and 276 of the 

Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Rules framed under the Motor Vehicles 

Act. It has to entertain an application filed under Section 165 of the 

Act and has to exercise its adjudicatory powers required for the 

purpose permitting to file reply, give hearing and adequate 

opportunity to prove its case, then hear the arguments and decide the 

claim petition in accordance with law. The entire adjudicatory process 

is thus primarily and substantially controlled by the provisions of the 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


112 

Code. It is difficult for us to come to the conclusion that the Tribunal 

is not having the trapping of Civil Court. Technically or grammatically 

speaking, the Tribunal may not be a Civil Court, but it has all the 

trapping of the Court and it pronounces an Award which is 

determination of rights of parties and which has all the ingredients of 

a judgment and an order as known under civil jurisprudence. 

82. 
Now, we will proceed to deal with the judgment of the 

Supreme Court relied upon by the appellants. Heavy reliance was 

placed on the judgment in Subal Paul's case (supra) where the 

Supreme Court, while dealing with the provisions of Section 299 of 

the Succession Act, observed that this was not governed by Section 

104 of the Code of Civil Procedure and against the order passed by the 

learned Single Judge in exercise of that jurisdiction, letters patent 

appeal would lie. Firstly, the provisions of Section 100-A of the Code 

of Civil Procedure are not the subject matter of discussion in this case. 

Secondly, the appeal before the learned Single Judge had been filed 

prior to coming into force the provisions of Section 100-A of the Code 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


113 

i.e. 1 st July, 2002. The Supreme Court was primarily concerned with 

the interpretation of sub-section (2) of Section 104 and held that, that 

provision will not bar a remedy which otherwise is provided under any 

other law. We may find it necessary to refer to at this stage itself that 

the provision of Section 104 unlike the provision of Section 100-A of 

the Code of Civil Procedure does not contain any non obstante clause 

or legislative exception. In paragraph 20 of the judgment, the Supreme 

Court has specifically noticed that the provisions of Section 104 does 

not contemplate order or decree passed under a special statute and 

thus the restrictions carved out under Section 104 would not prohibit 

an appeal in terms of Section 299 of the Succession Act. The real 

catchword of the judgment of the Supreme Court in this case is: -

"20. 
By reason of Section 104 of the Code of civil 
Procedure the bar of appeal under a special statute is 
saved. A plain reading of Section 104 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure would show that an appeal shall lie from 
an appealable order and no other order save as otherwise 
expressly provided in the body of this Code of or by any 
law for the time being in force. Section 104 of the Code 
merely recognises appeals provided under special statute. 
It does not create a right of appeal as such. It does not, 
therefore, bar any further appeal also, if the same is 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


114 

provided for under any other Act, for the time being in 
force. Whenever the statute provides such a bar, it is so 
expressly stated, as would appear from Section 100A of 
the Code of Civil Procedure." 

83. 
This judgment, in our opinion, does not support the case 

of the Appellants but the very pertinent feature of this judgment is that 

the Supreme Court has clearly held that an order passed by the High 

Court under Section 299 of the Succession Act is a judgment, if not a 

decree, observing that -

".....Whenever the statute provides such a bar, it is so 
expressly stated, as would appear from S. 100 A of 
the Code of Civil Procedure. If a right of appeal is 
provided for under the Act, the limitation thereof 
must also be provided therein. A right of appeal 
which is provided under the Letters Patent cannot be 
said to be restricted. Limitation of a right of appeal, 
in absence of any provision in a statute cannot be 
readily inferred." 

84. 
These dicta of the Supreme Court have not been noticed 

by the Division Bench in Asha's case (supra). Reliance was also placed 

upon a judgment of the Supreme Court in Sharada Devi's case (supra). 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:18 ::: 


115 

In that case, the Supreme Court was concerned with an appeal to a 

Division Bench against the judgment of a learned Single Judge of the 

High Court as in terms of Section 54 of the Land Acquisition Act. The 

Court noticed that the expression "only" occurring in Section 54 after 

non obstante clause refers to forum of appeal i.e. an appeal would lie 

to the High Court, and not to any other Court and appeal would take 

within its sweep Letters Patent Appeal, while noticing that Section 54 

does not specifically excludes the provisions of the Letters Patent. The 

Court specifically noticed that the right to entertain appeal would not 

get excluded unless the concerned statutory enactment excludes an 

appeal under the Letters Patent. The language of Section 100-A of 

the Code of Civil Procedure specifically excludes the application of the 

Letters Patent. As already held by the Constitution Bench of the 

Supreme Court, the Letters Patent is not akin to constitutional powers. 

We may also notice here that the judgment of the Supreme Court in 

Sharada Devi's case (supra) was pronounced on 13 th March, 2002 i.e. 

prior to 1 st July, 2002 when the provision of Section 100-A of the Code 

of Civil Procedure was added and none of the contentions which we 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:19 ::: 


116 

have considered above were raised before the Supreme Court. In 

these circumstances, again this judgment is of no help to the 

appellants. 

85. 
It is always not possible to state the legal proposition and 

answers to them with absolute precision. Still the Court makes 

attempt to answer the proposition of law accurately and adequately, 

with reference to the material facts as well as the points to be decided. 

The Courts are guided by the written laws, which they interpret and 

develop a meaningful set of rules by the process of case by case 

adjudication. The reasons for deciding the earlier case have been 

provided as the guidelines for future decision. We have attempted to 

cull out the reasons for taking the view that we have taken above. 

"Experientia docet" and "Expedit rei publicae ut sit finis litium" are the 

two accepted maxims which are equally applicable to the 

interpretation of statutes. We have to keep in mind the intent of the 

Legislature that in no uncertain terms, it decided to put an end to 

intra-Court appeal by debarring entertainment of the second appeal 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:19 ::: 


117 

where the learned Single Judge of the High Court has pronounced an 

order or judgment in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. In terms of 

Section 100-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, the unambiguous and 

definite expressions in Section 100-A of the Code of Civil Procedure 

clearly demonstrate this legislative intent. 
Clause 15 read with 

Clause 44 of the Letters Patent would squarely fall within the sweep of 

provisions of Section 100-A of the Code, which specifically by definite 

language excludes the provisions of the Letters Patent. There is no 

provision in the special i.e. M.V. Act providing further appeal against 

the appellate judgment passed by the learned Single Judge under 

Section 173 of the M.V. Act. 

86. 
Thus, we proceed to record and answer propositions of 

law formulated by us in paragraph 5 of the judgment as follows: 

(a) 
Upon amendment of Section 100-A of the 

Code of Civil Procedure by Amending Act of 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:19 ::: 


118 

2002 with effect from 1 st July, 2002, no Letters 

Patent Appeal would be maintainable against 

the judgment rendered by the learned Single 

Judge of the High Court under the provision of 

Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 

(b) Appeal against the judgment of the learned 

Single Judge in exercise of its appellate 

jurisdiction under Section 173 of the Motor 

Vehicles Act, 1988 even with the aid of 

Clause 15 of the Letters Patent is not 

maintainable, and in fact, in both these 

situations, the appellate court would have no 

jurisdiction to entertain and decide such an 

appeal. 

87. 
Having answered the above questions of law, and in view 

of the fact that the Appeals themselves have been placed for decision 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:19 ::: 


119 

before this Bench, we have no hesitation in holding that these appeals 

are not maintainable. 
Consequently, both these Appeals are 

dismissed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the cases, the 

parties are left to bear their own costs.
