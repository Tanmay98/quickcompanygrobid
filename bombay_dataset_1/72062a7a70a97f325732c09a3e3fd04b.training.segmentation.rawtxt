The Honourable the Chief Justice has constituted this Full 

Bench in order to resolve a conflict between the conflicting views which

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

have been expressed by two Division Benches of this Court. In our 

detailed order dated 24 th April, 2014 we noticed that conflict and by 

consent of parties we formulated the questions which have to be 

answered by us. They read as under: 

(1) 
Does Section 3(1)(b) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and 

Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 read with Section 6 of 

the General Clauses Act, 1897 r/w Section 7 of the 

Bombay General Clauses Act, 1904 save the orders of 

exemption including all terms and conditions thereof 

passed under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act, 

namely, the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 

1976 and all actions taken thereunder? 

(2) 
Whether, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 

r/w Section 7 of the Bombay General Clauses Act, 

1904 apply to the repeal of the Principal Act by the 

Repealing Act, 1999? 

(3) 
Whether in view of Section 3(1)(b) of the Urban Land 

(Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 and the 

Bombay General Clauses Act, 1904: 

(a) the order of exemption including all its terms 

and conditions under Section 20(1) of the Principal 

Act, namely, the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) 

Act, 1976 can be continued and enforced in 

accordance with the provisions of the Principal Act; 

(b) all remedies and proceedings in respect of the 

order of exemption including all its terms and

*6* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

conditions may be instituted, continued and 

enforced? 

(4) 
Whether in view of the repeal of the Principal Act by 

the Repeal Act, the Government of Maharashtra can: 

(a) recall/ cancel/ modify the exemption order 

granted either under Section 20 of the Principal Act; 

(b) enforce circulars for implementation of 

exemption orders issued under Section 20 of the 

Principal Act prior to the repeal of the Principal Act; 

(c) acquire the land by issuing notification under 

Section 10(3) of the Principal Act; and 

(d) take any action of whatsoever nature on 

account of noncompliance/ breach of exemption 

order issued under Section 20(1) of the Principal 

Act? 

(5) 
Whether, the view taken by a Division Bench of this 

Court in the case of Vithabai Bama Bhandari v/s State 

of Maharashtra and another reported in 2009(3) 

Bombay Cases Reporter 663 (Writ Petition 

No.4241/2008 decided on 31 st March/ 16 th April, 

2009) and Damodar Laxman Navare and others v/s 

State of Maharashtra and others in Writ Petition 

No.6300/2009 dated 08 th July, 2010 sets out the 

correct legal position as regards the ambit and scope 

of Section 3(1)(b) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and 

Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 or whether, the view

taken in Mira Bhayandar Builders and Developers 

Welfare Association v/s the Deputy Collector and 

Competent Authority, Thane Urban Agglomeration and 

others in Writ Petition No.5745/2009 dated 27 th 

August, 2009 to the contrary should be held to be 

laying down the correct principle of law? 

2 
Since both sides have canvassed arguments on legal issues, in 

order to appreciate them a few facts are required to be noted. We take the 

facts from a lead case, namely, Writ Petition No.9872/2010. That is a Writ 

Petition which has been filed by the Maharashtra Chamber of Housing 

Industry and its various Units. These are associations established to 

promote the housing and real estate industry. The Writ Petition is filed in 

the interest of members of these Associations and real estate industry and 

in the circumstances which are set out in paragraph 4 of the memo of 

Writ Petition. 

3 
It is the case of the Petitioners that the State of Maharashtra 

and Competent Authorities under the Urban Land (Ceiling and 

Regulation) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as "THE PRINCIPAL ACT") 

continue to enforce and apply the provisions thereof despite enactment of 

the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 (hereinafter 

referred to as "THE REPEAL ACT"). The Repeal Act has been brought into 

effect and is in force in the State of Maharashtra from 29.11.2007. 

4 
The grievance of the Petitioners is that there is a circular 

dated 18.03.2009 issued by the State Government, copy of which is at 

AnnexureA. That circular states that the Repeal Act has been brought into 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 ::: 


*8* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

force in the State of Maharashtra w.e.f. 29.11.2007. The same expressly 

saves the vesting of excess vacant land in the State as also validity of an 

exemption order passed under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act. 

Meaning thereby, the repeal of the Principal Act does not affect the 

vesting of excess vacant land in the State provided its possession has been 

taken, so also, validity of an exemption order passed under Section 20(1) 

of the Principal Act. Therefore, such excess vacant lands of which 

possession has not been taken, but which are subjected to certain 

concessions under the order of exemption passed in terms of Section 

20(1) of the Principal Act and which are particularly to utilize the lands 

for residential purpose, for implementing residential housing scheme, for 

industry and it's expansion, shall not be transferred without prior 

permission of the State and there are restrictions placed on change of user 

thereof. The permission for change of user will not be granted unless 

premium is paid to the Government. 

5 
A reference is made in this circular and the steps taken to 

implement the Repeal Act. The steps include two communications from 

the Government dated 01.03.2008 and 03.03.2008 which outline the 

scheme for development of these lands or their transfer. 

6 
It has been revealed that the exempted lands are being dealt 

with and for the purpose of implementation of the Slum Rehabilitation 

Scheme, Rental Housing Scheme, etc.. Further, the reservations in respect 

of these lands have been changed or altered from industry/ agriculture 

without any reference to the Government/ Competent Authority. The 

permissions in that regard have been granted without any prior approval 

from the competent authorities under the Principal Act. Therefore, the 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 ::: 


*9* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Government has directed that the exempted lands cannot be used for any 

other purpose nor their reservation can be changed unless the approvals/ 

remarks are called for from the competent authority under the Principal 

Act. Any violation of such requirement would visit the persons concerned 

with all consequences and at their costs. 

7 
Prior to this circular there are certain Government 

Resolutions and which enable utilization of Transferable Development 

Rights (TDR) so as to use the lands for construction of houses for weaker 

sections and equally to grant development permissions in relation thereto. 

This is a Government Resolution dated 30.06.2007. 

8 
There is also an order and which has been referred to 

because it is the case of the Petitioners that their members had to obtain 

several permissions from the Respondent Nos.1 and 2 for carrying out the 

development. It is contended that the Government Resolutions referred by 

us including dated 30.06.2007 and emphasis by the authorities on 

compliance of the same continues despite the Repeal Act brought into 

force with effect from 29.11.2007. There are several instances which have 

been given and copies of the exemption orders passed under Section 

20(1) of the Principal Act are referred to in paragraph 7 of the memo of 

Writ Petition No.9872/2010. 

9 
The grievance is that though the order of exemption was 

passed exempting the excess vacant land from the purview of ChapterIII 

of the Principal Act, when that Act was in force, but now after it's repeal 

the exemption order would not survive. In other words, the steps taken by 

the Authorities to give effect to the order of exemption even after repeal 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 ::: 


*10* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

of the Principal Act in the State of Maharashtra are wholly illegal. The 

Authorities cannot compel parties like the Petitioners to seek any 

extension of time to complete the scheme or to comply with the 

conditions on which the order of exemption under Section 20(1) of the 

Principal Act has been passed. The stand taken is that the Respondents 

have no powers to enforce the Principal Act directly or indirectly. Several 

instances of such alleged attempts are set out. There is reference made to 

the legal provisions and finally what is prayed is that this Court must 

restrain by an appropriate writ, order or direction under Article 226 of the 

Constitution of India, the Respondents from enforcing the provisions of 

the Principal Act insofar as such exemption orders and their terms and 

conditions. 

10 
From the record, what transpires is that a Writ Petition being 

Writ Petition No.3815/2010 from this group or batch of petitions, 

appeared before a Division Bench of this Court and it pronounced its 

judgment on 22.12.2010 noting that two Division Benches in the cases of 

Sundersons and others v/s State of Maharashtra and others reported in 

2008 (5) Bombay Cases Reporter 85 and Damodar Laxman Navre v/s 

State of Maharashtra in Writ Petition No.6300/2009 dated 08 th July, 

2010, take a view that certain steps in pursuance of the order of 

exemption or seeking to enforce the terms and conditions thereof cannot 

be taken, whereas a conflicting view has been rendered by another 

Division Bench of this Court in Mira Bhayandar Builders and Developers 

Welfare Association v/s the Deputy Collector and Competent Authority, 

Thane Urban Agglomeration and others in Writ Petition No.5745/2009 

dated 27 th August, 2009.

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

11 
The attention of the Division Bench in Writ Petition 

No.3815/2010 (Jayesh Tokarshi Shah v/s Deputy Collector and Competent 

Authority, Thane Urban Agglomeration) was invited to all these judgments 

and orders and stated to be conflicting. The Division Bench, therefore, in 

its judgment dated 22 nd December, 2010 in the aforesaid matter observed 

as under: 

15. 
This prompts an answer in favour of a premise that the 
Additional District Collector, Thane and Competent 
Authority was not competent to issue the said Circular, 
and as such the efficacy of the said Circular 
commanding the Registering Officer to refuse the 
registration of the documents referred to therein remains 
questionable. A view congenial to the said premise is 
found expressed in some of the judgments Sunderson & 
Ors Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. 2008(5) Bombay 
Cases Reporter 85, Damodar Laxman Navre & 4 others 
Vs. State of Maharashtra & 4 others Writ Petition No. 
6300 of 2009, delivered previously by the Division 
Bench of this Court. However, there is a conflicting view 
expressed in the judgments delivered by the Division 
Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No.5745 of 2009 
Mira Bhayander Builders & Developers Welfare 
Association Vs. Dy. Collector & Competent Authority, 
Thane and 3 others. The Circular dated 23.6.2008 was 
the epicentre of controversy in Mira Bhayander Builders 
& Developers Welfare Association (Supra). The State 
contended as in the present case that the scheme holders 
were trying to wriggle out of their obligations under the 
scheme sanctioned under Section 20 of U.L.C. Act, and 
therefore, the said Circular came to be issued to protect 
the schemes meant for economically weaker sections, 
and also the government . The Division Bench after 
considering the rival contentions observed thus: 
"In our view, if the members of the petitioners' 
association have taken benefit of the schemes under 
Section 20 of the said Act by constructing buildings, they 
now cannot wiggle out of their obligations to surrender 
flats to the government which the government could sell 
at fixed rate. The entire tenor of the above petitioners 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 ::: 


*12* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

appears to be that the petitioners do not want to fulfil 
their obligations under the said Schemes viz. 
surrendering the flats to the State Government and 
taking advantage of the repeal of the said Act want to 
contend that their obligations under the said schemes do 
not survive. In our view the impugned letter as rightly 
contended by the learned AGP has been issued to protect 
the public interest and government revenue. It does not 
befit the Petitioners who have taken advantage of the 
said scheme now contend that their obligations do not 
survive, and therefore, there is no need for them to 
surrender flats to the government. We, therefore, do not 
find any merit in the challenge raised in the above 
petition which is accordingly dismissed." 

16. 
In the instant case similar situation is portrayed in the 
affidavit in reply filed by the State. Referring to the 
Mohan Gopal Mate case (Supra) reported in 2008(6) 
ALL MR 41, the learned Advocate for the Petitioner 
submitted that a pertinent question regarding the extent 
of power of the State under Sections 20 and 21 of U.L.C. 
Act in the case of breach of conditions of the scheme by 
the scheme holder has been clearly answered as follows: 
"Powers of the State under Section 20 in case of 
breach of condition of the order of exemption is limited 
to withdraw exemption order only and so far as Section 
21 is concerned, declare the land which is not to be 
treated as excess land in view of the SubSection (1) in 
case of breach of condition State can declare such land 
to be excess in view of SubSection (2) of Section 21. 
Thereupon, the provisions of Chapter III will apply to 
the said land." 

17. 
Going by strict interpretation of the Sections 20 and 21 
of the ULC Act, the power of the State in case of 
contravention of any of the conditions of the scheme by 
scheme holder remains limited to withdrawal of the 
exemption and declaring the exempted land as excess 
land and to application of the provisions of the Chapter 
III of the said Act for acquisition of the said land as 
contemplated under SubSection (2) of Section 21 
therein.

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

18. 
This view is in conflict with the view expressed by the 
Division Bench in Mira Bhayander Builders & 
Developers Welfare Association (Supra), and as such the 
controversy raised by such conflict deserves to be 
resolved by the Full Bench of this Court. 

19. 
This Petition is, therefore, referred to the Hon'ble the 
Chief Justice for passing appropriate directions in the 
matter." 

12 
It is in view of these events that a Full Bench was constituted 

and the above formulated questions await an answer from us. 

13 
At the outset we must clarify that we would be only 

answering the question/s formulated and reproduced hereinabove. We 

would not be expressing any opinion on the rival contentions insofar as 

merits of individual petitions. Each of these petitions thereafter would be 

placed before the appropriate Division Benches and for a decision on 

merits and in accordance with law. Our observations and findings, 

therefore, shall not be construed as expression of any opinion on the 

merits of the Writ Petitions referred above or pending in this Court. 

14 
The Petitioners' counsel have made an attempt to show us as 

to how the Division Bench judgment in the case of Mira Bhayander 

Builders and Developers Welfare Association v/s Deputy Collector and 

Competent Authority, Thane (supra) does not lay down the correct law. 

They have all, more or less, urged that repeal of the Principal Act in the 

State of Maharashtra on 29.11.2007 results in the State and competent 

authorities being prevented from withdrawing the order of exemption 

passed under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act. Assuming that the order 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 ::: 


*14* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

of exemption or any action taken thereunder is valid notwithstanding 

anything contrary held in any judgment or order of the competent court, 

yet the Repeal Act saves only validity of the order of exemption and 

nothing more. Such saving would not permit the State Government or 

competent authority to withdraw the order of exemption or enforce the 

terms and conditions thereof or to subject the excess vacant land to the 

consequences under the Principal Act. The saving is thus not absolute, but 

restricted in nature. Thirdly, it is urged that there being a Repealing Act 

containing such restricted saving clause, the same rules out applicability 

of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 or its parimateria provision 

in the Bombay General Clauses Act, 1904. 

15 
We shall now elaborate these contentions as articulated by 

Mr.Naphade, learned Senior Counsel and adopted with some additions by 

Mr.Sathe, Mr.Sridharan, Mr.Devitre, Mr.Samdani, learned Senior Counsel 

and Mr.Gangal, Mr.Joshi and Ms.GadreRajyadhyaksha, learned counsel 

appearing for the Petitioners. 

16 
Mr.Naphade firstly submitted that for understanding the 

Repeal Act we must have a look at the Principal Act. The Principal Act, 

according to Mr.Naphade, contains several provisions, but material 

therefrom are Sections 3, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 38. Mr.Naphade also took us 

through Section 11 of the Principal Act before coming to Section 20. In 

his submission the scheme of the Principal Act is that no one shall hold 

the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit. The return or statement has 

to be filed so as to determine the extent of excess vacant land. In other 

words, Mr.Naphade submits that except as otherwise provided in the 

Principal Act, on and from the commencement of the Act, no person shall 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 ::: 


*15* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

be entitled to hold any vacant land in excess of ceiling limit in the 

territories to which the Principal Act applies. Mr.Naphade submits that 

Section 4 sets out the ceiling limit. He submits that the transfer of vacant 

land is also an aspect which is taken care of by Section 5. The persons 

holding the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit have to file the 

statement. He submits that further provisions enable scrutiny of 

particulars, preparing a draft statement as regards the vacant land in 

excess of ceiling limit and the final statement. Mr.Naphade submits that 

Section 10 is entitled "Acquisition of vacant land in excess of ceiling 

limit". The extent of the vacant land held by a person in excess of ceiling 

limit has to be specified by subsection (1) of Section 10 and the purpose 

of same is to enable acquisition of the same eventually. That is an aspect 

dealt with by subsections (2) and (3) of Section 10. The vesting of such 

excess vacant land free from all encumbrances and with effect from the 

date of publication of a notification under subsection (3) results in 

enabling the Government to take possession of the land. In these 

circumstances, according to Mr.Naphade, only consequence of not filing a 

return or statement, but which is not accepted in totality is provided by 

Section 10. There is also a provision, namely, Section 38 which makes 

such act a punishable offence and Mr.Naphade invites our attention to 

subsections (1) to (4) of Section 38 in that regard. Mr.Naphade's attempt 

was to show that even if the vacant land is in excess of ceiling limit and 

there is no compliance with the provisions requiring filing a statement of 

such vacant land, still the owner is not deprived of his rights in the same. 

Mr.Naphade in that regard invites our attention to Section 15 of the 

Principal Act and submits that it reflects the legislative intent. There is no 

loss of ownership on promulgation of the Principal Act. In these 

circumstances all that the Principal Act does is to create some sort of clog

*16* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

or cloud on the rights of a person to hold the land. His ownership rights 

therein are not affected. 

17 
Mr.Naphade, therefore, submits that the power to exempt the 

excess vacant land from applicability of ChapterIII of the Principal Act is 

exercised by the Government either on its own motion or otherwise and 

that is also clear by Sections 21 and 22 which permits the excess vacant 

land not to be treated as such in certain cases and it's retention under 

certain circumstances. Therefore, merely because a holder of the excess 

vacant land seeks exemption from applicability of ChapterIII or the State 

exempts such vacant land from applicability thereof will not mean that 

the right and particularly ownership therein is surrendered much less 

waived. Mr.Naphade's attempt was to show that the State seeks to put the 

excess vacant land beyond application of ChapterIII, but keeping all his 

rights and options intact. The reference, therefore, will have to be 

answered by us bearing in mind this vital aspect, is the submission of 

Mr.Naphade. 

18 
Mr.Naphade elaborated this aspect by submitting that once 

the land is exempted, it is out of the purview of the Principal Act. The 

right to hold it conditionally remains unaffected. The power to exempt is 

limited in nature. It is legislative in character. By no stretch of imagination 

it is a right conferred in the Government nor exercise of powers to exempt 

creates any right in the Government in respect of such excess vacant land. 

In these circumstances and if Sections 20(2) and 21(2) are read together 

it would be apparent that neither any action under subsection (1) of 

Section 21 or the power under subsection (2) is saved by repeal of the 

Principal Act. In fact the Repeal Act does not save Section 21 at all.

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Hence, when the Repeal Act in Section 3(1)(b) refers to the validity of 

exemption order, it deliberately omits to include or refer subsection (2) 

of Section 20. Hence, there is no power to withdraw the exemption order 

under Section 20(1) after repeal of the Principal Act. Hence, even breach 

or violation of the condition in the exemption order will not result in its 

cancellation or withdrawal. Apart therefrom any breach or violation of 

the condition on which the exemption order was granted does not result 

in automatic withdrawal or cancellation thereof. That is apparent from 

Section 20(2). It is, therefore, clear that the Repeal Act does not save this 

power and by omitting subsection (2) of Section 20 from clause (b) of 

subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. The legislature was aware 

that the power to withdraw the exemption order will have to be exercised 

only after giving a reasonable opportunity to such person who has 

violated the conditions subject to which the exemption under clause (a) 

and (b) of subsection (1) of Section 20 is granted. That reasonable 

opportunity is to make representation against the proposed withdrawal. It 

is the only consequence of either not complying with the conditions 

subject to which the exemption is granted or not being able to satisfy the 

Government that such exemption should not be withdrawn or from 

applicability of ChapterIII to the excess vacant land. Meaning thereby 

same is capable of being acquired and thereafter, vested in the 

Government. Once that power cannot be exercised post repeal of the 

Principal Act, then, we would be in complete error if we hold that the 

repeal of the Principal Act does not affect the power to withdraw the 

exemption or to enforce the terms and conditions thereof. 

19 
In that regard, Mr.Naphade has taken us through Sections 

20(2), 21(2) and 22(2) of the Principal Act. He submits that subsection 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 ::: 


*18* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

(2) of Section 20 confers discretion in the Government and it may not 

withdraw the exemption order despite the conditions subject to which the 

same is granted are not complied with by any person. Whereas, sub 

section (2) of Section 21 mandates declaring the vacant land to be excess. 

It is submitted that there are distinct consequences and which are taken 

care of by subsection (2) of Section 22. Thus, the power of exemption 

has different parameters and the legislature was aware that such power 

cannot survive the repeal of the Principal Act. Hence, in the teeth of this 

clear language of the Repeal Act recourse to Section 6 of the General 

Clauses Act, 1897 is impermissible. Once a different intention appears 

from the provisions contained in the Repeal Act, then, Section 6 of the 

General Clauses Act, 1897 would not apply. The question of liberal 

construction of Section 3 of the Repeal Act, therefore, does not arise at 

all. 

20 
Mr.Naphade thereafter took us extensively through the 

Repeal Act to submit that what is saved is specific. By clause (a) of sub 

section (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act the vesting of land of which 

possession has been taken by the State is saved. Meaning thereby, any 

vacant land which is subject matter of declaration under Section 10(3) of 

which possession has not been taken by the State Government, then its 

vesting is not saved by the Repeal Act. Such land of which possession has 

not been taken will have to be restored post repeal after the requirement 

stipulated in subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act is complied 

with. Therefore, there is no collision between clause (a) and clause (b). 

What clause (b) saves is only validity of the order granting exemption 

under Section 20(1) or any action taken thereunder. The power to 

withdraw the exemption is not saved. If it is held to be saved, then, clause 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 ::: 


*19* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

(a) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act would be rendered 

redundant. Only consequence of exemption being withdrawn is to subject 

the land to applicability of ChapterIII of the Principal Act and particularly 

Section 10(3) thereof. If possession of such excess vacant land cannot be 

taken even after withdrawal of exemption in terms of subsection (2) of 

Section 20 of the Principal Act, then, there was no point in saving its 

validity. Therefore, the validity of the order of exemption is saved, but 

neither that saving will enable the State to withdraw the exemption post 

repeal nor will the State be in a position to give effect to the order of 

withdrawal of the exemption if cannot take possession of the excess 

vacant land. That is the reason why the power to withdraw the exemption 

has not been saved. Section 4 of the Repeal Act, therefore, would throw 

light on the interpretation of clauses (b) and (c) of subsection (1) of 

Section 3 of the Repeal Act. That Section 4 provides for abatement of 

legal proceedings. If the legal proceedings abate on the date on which the 

Repeal Act came into force, then, the intent could never be to save the 

power to withdraw the exemption. Therefore, the words, appearing in 

clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3, after Section 20 should be read 

accordingly and that would be consistent with the object and purpose 

sought to be achieved in enacting the Repeal Act. None of the proceedings 

relating to any order made or purported to be made under the Principal 

Act pending immediately before commencement of the Repeal Act are 

saved. Even if they are pending before any court or tribunal or any other 

authority they shall abate. In these circumstances the Legislature clearly 

intended that any past or closed or conclusive action alone is saved. 

Anything in the pipeline or inchoate is affected and not saved. This is 

because the Principal Act is a self contained code. It contains substantive 

and procedural provisions and even creates a forum for the purpose of 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 ::: 


*20* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

enforcing and exercising substantive rights and powers and equally 

procedural one. A forum is created so as to make and enact a complete 

code. Nothing beyond the Principal Act can be seen. If the Repeal Act is 

construed in this manner, then, it envisages complete destruction of the 

rights under the Principal Act. Any right which is crystallized and which is 

not a mere hope or chance is alone saved. 

21 
Mr.Naphade also submits that Section 6 of the General 

Clauses Act cannot be imported into and read when the Repeal Act is so 

specific and clear. Alternatively and without prejudice to this submission 

Mr.Naphade submits that if Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is 

analyzed, it by clauses (a) to (e) saves something which is in force or 

existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect. It does not affect 

previous operation of the Act so repealed or anything duly done or 

suffered thereunder. The repeal does not affect any right, privilege, 

obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the repealed 

enactment. Mr.Naphade submits that clause (b) would, therefore, refer to 

past or complete act and not something which is intended and 

incomplete. The liabilities that are crystallized under the enactment which 

is repealed alone are unaffected by repeal of the original or Principal Act 

and that is clarified by clause (c). This clause cannot be imported in the 

present Repealing Act for the simple reason that it would create 

inconsistency. Mr.Naphade submits that clause (e) of Section 6 of the 

General Clauses Act would have saved Section 20(2) of the Principal Act 

had Sections 3 and 4 been not enacted in the Repeal Act. That being 

clearly enacted there will be inconsistency if one imports clause (e) of 

Section 6 of the General Clauses Act in Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act. 

For all these reasons Mr.Naphade would submit that the view taken by the

Andhra Pradesh High Court, Delhi High Court and Madras High Court 

follows the Division Bench judgments of this Court from which Mira 

Bhayander (supra) differs. That is the only view possible in the present 

legal backdrop and we must, therefore, hold that Mira Bhayander (supra) 

does not lay down the correct law and should be overruled. Mr.Naphade 

submits that when three or four High Courts in the country have taken a 

consistent view of the provision contained in a Central Act, then, that 

view ought to be followed so as to bring comity and consistency in 

interpretation of a Parliamentary statute. The reference, therefore, be

In addition, Mr.Sathe submits that the Preamble of the Principal Act 

provides for imposition of a ceiling on vacant land in urban 

agglomeration, for acquisition of such land in excess of the ceiling limit 

and to regulate the construction of buildings on such land. It is also to 

distribute the excess vacant land after it vests in the State. In these

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

circumstances if the construction placed by the State on the provisions of 

the Repeal Act is accepted that would result in saving of the consequences 

following withdrawal of exemption. Section 20(2) of the Principal Act 

envisages withdrawal of exemption and after such withdrawal what 

follows is the vesting of the land in terms of Section 10(3) and its 

possession as envisaged by Section 10(5) and (6). This is specifically not 

saved by Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. Having regard to the clear 

language of the Principal Act this is the only consequence which follows 

on withdrawal of exemption. If it is not expressly saved, then, by an 

indirect or oblique 
method the Court cannot save it. Mr.Sathe's 

contention is that what is specifically saved is the validity of the order of 

exemption and the crucial words are to be found in clause (b) of sub 

section (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act to this effect that the validity of 

any order granting exemption under Section 20(1) or any action taken 

thereunder is saved notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the 

contrary. Therefore, even if the Court declares the order of exemption or 

any action taken thereunder to be bad or invalid that is unaffected by 

repeal of the Principal Act. Beyond this nothing more can be read in the 

saving clause or the Repeal Act as a whole. The Reference, therefore, be 

answered accordingly. Mr.Sathe relies upon the following judgments:

25 
Then Mr.Sridharan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 

Petitioners in Writ Petition Nos.2243/2011 and 2244/2011, argued that 

the Repeal Act envisages application of same in the first instance to the 

whole of the State of Haryana and Punjab and to all the Union territories. 

This is envisaged by Section 1(2) of the Repeal Act. The Repeal Act comes 

into force in other States after other States adopt the Repeal Act by 

resolution passed in that behalf under Article 252(2) of the Constitution 

of India. Mr.Sridharan, therefore, submits that this aspect must be borne 

in mind while considering the submission or stand of the State regarding 

applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. Mr.Sridharan 

submits that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act applies only when 

either the General Clauses Act or any Central Act or Regulation made 

after commencement of the General Clauses Act repeals any enactment 

made prior to the General Clauses Act coming into force or thereafter. In 

the present case the State Government has adopted by resolution passed 

under Article 252 of the Constitution of India the Repeal Act in the State 

of Maharashtra with effect from 29.11.2007. In the light of such adoption 

by resolution of the State Assembly the Section 6 of the General Clauses 

Act cannot be resorted to or applied. That applies only when either the 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014

*27* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

General Clauses Act or any Central Act or Regulation made after 

commencement of the General Clauses Act repeals any enactment made 

or to be made by the Parliament. Both are Parliamentary Statues and in 

such circumstances by virtue of Article 252(2) of the Constitution of India 

the applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is ruled out. 

26 
Alternatively, Mr.Sridharan submits that Section 3(1)(b) of 

the Repeal Act is a special saving clause demonstrating a clear different 

intention. Therefore, Section 3 of the Repeal Act saves only what is 

specifically mentioned therein. There is no room for applying Section 6 of 

the General Clauses Act, 1897 by implication or impliedly. Mr.Sridharan 

also submits that in true sense we are not construing a validating statute 

or clause. What is saved by clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3 is an 

order under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act and the exemptions which 

are subject matter of the same. All actions under the same are saved, but 

that does not mean that the power to take action under Section 20(2) is 

also saved. The saving in the present case is only to protect the rights of 

innocent third parties. Even the actions under the exemption are saved 

with a view to ensure such protection. This is not a substantive provision 

and therefore, it cannot be construed with reference to the Principal Act. 

By no stretch of imagination it revives the Principal Act. This is apparent 

from reading of Section 4 of the Repeal Act because even the proceedings 

as initiated abate on Principal Act coming into force. By clause (c) of sub 

section (1) of Section 3 the liability incurred under the exemption order is 

not saved, but only the payment made to the State Government as a 

condition for granting exemption under Section 20(1) is unaffected and 

thus, saved. Beyond all this we should not read anything into the Repeal 

Act. Mr.Sridharan relied upon the following decisions in support of the

27 
It is pertinent to note that Mr.Sridharan's main argument has 

not been supported or adopted by any counsel. It is clear that 

Mr.Naphade's contentions and submissions as adopted by Mr.Sathe are 

further adopted and elaborated by Mr.Devitre, learned Senior Counsel 

appearing in the Original Side Writ Petition No.37/2010 and Mr.Samdani, 

learned Senior Counsel appearing in Writ Petition No.346/2011. Both of 

them have urged that a different intention appears in clause (b) of sub 

section (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act and therefore, Section 6 of the 

General Clauses Act has no application. The specific saving is for the 

benefit of the land holders and therefore, there is no scope for construing 

clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act on equitable 

principles. Once there is no room for equitable considerations and 

particularly as Mr.Samdani urges because of the Principal Act being 

expropriatory in nature and providing for compulsory acquisition, then, 

all the more any liberal construction is ruled out. Mr.Samdani submits 

that even the saving clause has to be strictly construed in this case and 

the repeal of the Principal Act wipes out the same and obliterates it from

Mr.Aniruddha Joshi, learned Counsel appearing for the 

Petitioners in Writ Petition No.9872/2010 invites our attention to the 

judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Vithabai Bama 

Bhandari v/s State of Maharashtra (supra) and submits that there is 

nothing sacrosanct about Section 20 of the Principal Act. By indirect 

process we cannot, therefore, save what is not expressly saved by the 

Repeal Act. Once the power to exempt cannot be exercised and not 

available after the Repeal Act, then, merely because such power is

exercised during the subsistence of the Principal Act and prior to the 

Repeal Act coming into force does not mean that further or incidental 

power envisaged by the primary power to exempt is saved. Even this 

incidental or ancillary power is unavailable after repeal of the Principal 

Act. This argument is built more or less on the wording of Section 21 of 

the General Clauses Act, 1897.

Ms.GadreRajyadhyaksha, learned counsel appearing for the

Statute or construed its provisions in a particular way, then, for the sake 

of consistency and certainty this Court must follow the reasoning of the 

Delhi High Court, Madras High Court and Andhra Pradesh High Court.

On the other hand, Mr.Khambata, learned Advocate General 

appearing on behalf of the State submits that it is fallacious to assume 

that the State or other Respondents, namely, Authorities under the 

Principal Act are requesting this Court to go by any equitable 

consideration or liberal principle. The State has throughout maintained 

that in terms of the Preamble of the Principal Act and Constitutional 

philosophy as enshrined by Articles 21 and 39(b) and (c) of the 

Constitution of India a ceiling has been placed by the Principal Act on the 

holding of vacant land within the urban agglomeration. This ceiling limit, 

as is reflected from the Principal Act and which cannot be disputed, is 

placed by a statutory prescription that is to be found in Section 4 of the 

Principal Act. ChapterIII of the Principal Act is titled as "ceiling on vacant 

land". Except as otherwise provided in the Principal Act on and from the 

commencement of the Principal Act no person shall be entitled to hold 

any vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit in the territories to which 

this Act applies under subsection (2) of Section 1. The obligation under 

the statute is, therefore, clear and absolute. It relates and dates back to 

the commencement of the Principal Act. None can dispute that what is 

exempted from the purview of ChapterIII and by a overriding power 

conferred in the State Government is the applicability of ChapterIII to the 

vacant land in excess of ceiling limit. Therefore, when the excess vacant 

land is exempted in exceptional circumstances and which have been also 

specified by the statute, then, all that happens is that the excess vacant 

land is exempted from the provisions of ChapterIII either conditionally or

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

unconditionally and in terms of the satisfaction in clauses (a) and (b) of 

subsection (1) of Section 20 of the Principal Act. The power to exempt is 

exercised by the State suomotu or otherwise meaning thereby on the 

Application of the person holding the excess vacant land. The request is 

not to apply the Chapter in the light of the factors and circumstances 

specified therein. This request is made and granted only on the 

satisfaction reached and not as a matter of course. Thus, application of 

the chapter is a rule and its nonapplication is an exception. Despite 

repeal of the Principal Act if the validity of the order granting exemption 

under subsection (1) of Section 20 is saved by Section 3 of the Repeal 

Act and such validity remains unaffected notwithstanding anything to the 

contrary contained in the order of the competent court, then, full effect 

will have to be given to the language of the Repeal Act. Once the Repeal 

Act is so clear and does not evince anything contrary to the principles 

enshrined in Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, then, on the strength of 

the wording of the Repeal Act and in any event with the assistance of 

Section 6 of the General Clauses Act it can safely be held that there is no 

intention to destroy the rights and liabilities or consequences which flow 

from a valid exemption order. In fact the language of Section 3 of the 

Repeal Act supplements Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. Nothing in 

Section 3 of the Repeal Act takes away applicability of the Principal Act to 

the extent of enforcing the obligations in terms of the conditions imposed 

in the order of exemption. The learned Advocate General submits that the 

arguments of the Petitioners revolve around the saving clause enacted by 

Section 3 of the Repeal Act. The submissions are that the Repeal Act 

shows intention contrary to the applicability of Section 6 of the General 

Clauses Act inasmuch as neither the exemption order nor any of the terms 

and conditions therein can be enforced post repeal.

33 
The learned Advocate General submitted that the provisions 

of the Repeal Act and particularly Section 3(1) clauses (b) and (c) require 

a harmonious interpretation. By reading these clauses together what is 

apparent is that by clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal 

Act it is clarified that repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the 

vesting of any vacant land under Section 10(3) of the Principal Act, 

possession of which has been taken over by the State Government or any 

person duly authorized by the State in this behalf or by the competent 

authority. Thus, if the steps as contemplated by subsection (3) of Section 

10 of the Principal Act and equally by subsections (5) and (6) thereof are 

taken, then, the vesting of excess vacant land referred to in a Notification 

published under Section 10(1) in terms of subsection (3) thereof is not 

affected by repeal of the Principal Act. No person then can claim that the 

excess vacant land to which the Principal Act admittedly applies and 

which is deemed to have been acquired by the State does not belong to it 

or the State is not entitled to it because the Principal Act has been 

repealed and the vesting comes to an end. The vesting is of vacant land in 

excess of ceiling limit. Undisputedly, if the land in excess of ceiling limit 

can vest after the notification in terms of Section 10(1) is published in the 

official Gazette, then, the declaration which is postulated or contemplated 

by subsection (3) is in relation to such excess vacant land. What sub 

section (3) of Section 10 really contemplates and envisages is that the 

State can declare that the excess vacant land is deemed to have been 

acquired by it upon publication of the declaration and particularly with 

effect from the dates specified therein. By such deemed acquisition the 

land is further deemed to have vested absolutely in the State free from all 

encumbrances with effect from the date specified in the declaration. By

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

the repeal what has been clarified is that unless the State has taken over 

possession of such excess vacant land and as referred to in the 

Notification under Section 10(1) either by itself or through any person 

duly authorized by it in this behalf or by the competent authority, its plain 

and simple vesting will not enable the Government to take over 

possession of the excess vacant land after coming into force of the Repeal 

Act. This coming into force or commencing is reckoned in terms of sub 

sections (2) and (3) of Section 1 of the Repeal Act. Thus, the State is 

disabled from taking possession of the excess vacant land which has 

already vested in it if it has failed to take possession. Thereupon the land 

can be restored and that is how subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Repeal 

Act would read. Therefore, this is not a restricted or limited saving clause 

in any sense of the term. Though Section 3 is titled "saving" it contains 

the substantive provisions. The Legislature or the Parliament did not 

intend a vacuum. It did not stop by only stating that if possession of the 

land vested in the State in terms of Section 10(3) is not taken, then, that 

cannot be taken or the land cannot be made over to the Government after 

repeal of the Principal Act. It enacts a further provision by which it is 

possible for the State to restore the land to the holder and that is why 

restoration is contemplated by virtue of Section 3(2). That restoration is 

conditional upon repayment of an amount to the State Government by 

the holder. Section 11 of the Principal Act talks of payment of amount for 

the vacant land acquired under Section 10(3). That payment can be 

claimed even without the land being handed over or without the 

possession of the excess vacant land being taken. The deemed acquisition 

by virtue of Section 10(3) enables the person or persons having interest in 

the excess vacant land to claim the amount under Section 11. If any 

payment has been made after such deemed acquisition, then, that amount 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014

*35* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

has to be returned to the Government and only then the excess vacant 

land of which possession has not been taken will be restored to any 

person or the holder as the case may be. If this was a complete 

obliteration or destruction of the rights and liabilities under the Principal 

Act, then, such substantive provision enabling restoration would not have 

been inserted or incorporated is the submission of the learned Advocate 

General. The refund of such amount and which has been paid to the 

person or persons interested in the excess vacant land in terms of Section 

11 of the Principal Act alone entitles such person to claim restoration of 

the land to him. If the repeal had been simplicitor and without such 

substantive provision, then, it would not have been possible for the holder 

or any person interested in the excess vacant land to claim its restoration. 

It is, therefore, erroneous to urge that the Repeal Act evidences an 

intention contrary to the applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses 

Act, 1897. 

34 
Inviting our attention to clauses (b) and (c) of subsection 

(1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act the learned Advocate General submits 

that the true nature of the power to exempt under the Principal Act would 

have to be properly and completely appreciated. He submits that the basis 

on which the power to exempt is exercised is that the person is holding 

the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit. It is in case of such vacant land 

that the State Government must be satisfied either on its own motion or 

otherwise that having regard to its location, purpose for which such land 

is being or is proposed to be used and such other relevant factors as the 

circumstances of the case may require, it is necessary or expedient in the 

public interest so to do that the Government is conferred with discretion 

to pass an order exempting such vacant land from the provisions of 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014

*36* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

ChapterIII either conditionally or otherwise. The learned Advocate 

General submits that it is not just having regard to location of the land, 

purpose for which the excess vacant land is being or is proposed to be 

used and such other relevant factors as the circumstances of the case may 

require, but it is necessary and expedient in the public interest that the 

discretion to exempt such land has to be exercised. That is in terms of 

clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 20. Whereas, in terms of clause 

(b) of subsection (1) of Section 20, the State is satisfied either on its own 

motion or otherwise that the application of the provisions of ChapterIII 

would cause undue hardship to the persons holding the vacant land in 

excess of ceiling limit that the Government may by order exempt 

conditionally or unconditionally the vacant land from the provisions of 

ChapterIII. Further the order under clause (b) cannot be made unless the 

reasons for doing so are recorded in writing. That is because clause (b) 

contemplates relieving the person holding the excess vacant land from 

undue hardship. Clause (a) necessarily postulates an exercise of powers to 

exempt the excess vacant land in public interest. When such is the ambit 

and scope of the powers and it is vacant land in excess of ceiling limit 

which is exempted from the provisions of ChapterIII that too in 

exceptional circumstances, then, it is futile to contend that the State 

Government despite validity of its Act or order being saved by the Repeal 

Act, would not be able to do anything in relation to such land post repeal 

of the Principal Act. The learned Advocate General submits that in this 

case the power of exemption and which is to be exercised for public good 

and in public interest is so exercised by making an order in that behalf. 

That the validity of such an order is saved though the Principal Act is 

repealed, but the legal consequences flowing from exercise of such clause 

are not saved, would be an incorrect, improper and legally untenable

*37* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

reading of the saving clause and the Repeal Act itself. The true nature of 

the power to exempt has not been appreciated in making such 

submissions. The Petitioners' arguments proceed on an unsound and 

erroneous basis and namely that the power to exempt in terms of Section 

20(1) of the Principal Act is exercised by the State Government only to 

benefit the holder. The argument is that it is to relieve the holder from the 

consequences of applicability of ChapterIII that the State exercises such 

power and therefore, nothing further can be done in pursuance of the 

valid order of exemption post repeal of the Principal Act. 

35 
The learned Advocate General submits that implicit and 

inherent in this is the assumption that even conditional order of 

exemption, though valid after repeal, cannot be enforced in any manner 

post such repeal or post commencement of the Repeal Act. Meaning 

thereby the condition incorporated in the order of exemption though 

valid or any action taken in pursuance of such valid exemption order or 

condition gets saved still further acts and consequences would not ensue 

post repeal of the Principal Act. This construction of such Section 3(1) 

ignores clause (c) of the said subsection totally. In that clause any 

payment made to the State Government as a condition for granting 

exemption under subsection (1) of Section 20 is not affected. The 

condition of payment and which is for granting exemption is not affected 

post repeal of the Principal Act. Then that condition can be enforced, 

would be the sequitur. If that logically follows and qua one condition one 

fails to understand as to why the Parliament would enact a Repealing Act 

not only to save the validity of any order granting exemption under 

Section 20(1) of the Principal Act or any action taken thereunder 

notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary, but to save

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 ::: 


*38* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

only conditional payment and leaving out all other conditions. It would 

mean that a condition of payment incorporated in the order granting 

exemption is valid and validity of such condition shall not be affected by 

repeal, but the conditions other than payment are affected by repeal of 

the Principal Act though Section 3(1)(b) saves the validity of the order 

granting exemption. Such construction of the Repeal Act would lead to 

absurdity and every interpretation which leads or results in such absurdity 

must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, when the repeal of the Principal 

Act shall not affect the validity of any order granting exemption under 

Section 20(1) it means the order as whole including the conditions 

incorporated therein is valid notwithstanding any judgment of any court 

to the contrary. Equally any action taken thereunder is also valid 

notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary. The action 

taken under the exemption order could be of enforcing it or any of its 

conditions or withdrawing it. The repeal of the Principal Act shall not 

affect the validity of all this notwithstanding any judgment of any court to 

the contrary. The Parliament is presumed to be aware of the ambit and 

scope of the power to exempt conferred by the Principal Act in the State 

Government. It is further presumed to be aware of the fact that such 

exemption orders are in force or were in force. Therefore, when the 

repeal of the Principal Act is to take effect from the date of adoption of 

the Repeal Act, then, the Parliament plainly intended that the repeal of 

the Principal Act shall not affect the validity of any order granting 

exemption under Section 20(1) or any action taken thereunder. The 

Parliament was equally aware of the fact that such exemption order or 

any action taken thereunder may have been declared as invalid by any 

judgment of any court. Therefore, it did not stop at merely saving and not 

affecting any order of exemption under subsection (1) of Section 20 or 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014

*39*

any action taken thereunder, but by a nonobstante clause declared that 

the validity of any order granting exemption or any action taken 

thereunder shall not be affected by repeal of the Principal Act 

notwithstanding any judgment of any Court to the contrary. Far from 

evincing or demonstrating any contrary intention the saving clause vide 

Section 3 protects and saves not only the initial order of exemption or any 

action taken thereunder, but the exemption order or any action taken 

thereunder is declared valid and expressly saved notwithstanding any 

judgment of any court to the contrary. Equally, any payment made to the 

State Government as a condition for granting exemption under sub 

section (1) of Section 20 is saved and shall not be affected. Thus, both the 

condition and the payment under same shall not be affected by repeal of 

the Principal Act. 

36 
The learned Advocate General submits that correct and true 

understanding of the saving clause is what is the real issue. The 

Petitioners' arguments are based on erroneous and incorrect 

understanding of such clause. A saving clause is used to preserve from 

destruction certain rights, remedies or privileges already existing. It 

means that it saves all the rights the party previously had. It does not give 

him any new rights. The saving clauses are introduced into the Acts which 

repeal others to safeguard the rights which, but for the savings, would be 

lost. The Legislature may have termed Section 3 as saving provision or 

clause, but it is well settled that the description of the provision cannot be 

decisive of its true meaning or interpretation which must depend on the 

words used therein. But, when two interpretations are sought to be put 

on a provision which fits the description and which the Legislature has 

chosen to apply it, is according to sound canons of constructions, to be

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

adopted, provided of course, it is consistent with the language employed. 

That is to be preferred to the one which attributes to the provision a 

different effect. (See: State of Bombay v/s United Motors (India) Limited 

AIR 1953 SC 252). Therefore, it is not safe to hold that Section 3 of the 

Repeal Act saves only limited rights or consequences. 

37 
Taking us through Section 4 of the Repeal Act and 

particularly its proviso the learned Advocate General submitted that all 

proceedings relating to Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Principal Act 

insofar as such proceedings are relatable to the vacant land, possession of 

which has been taken over by the State Government, do not abate. This is 

not a total abatement of legal proceedings as is contended. If the 

interpretation or construction placed on the Repeal Act by the Petitioners 

is accepted that would mean that the vesting of any vacant land of which 

possession is taken by the State Government is not affected and therefore, 

that power or right of the Government is saved. The repeal of the 

Principal Act shall not affect such vesting as is clear from clause (a) of 

subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. However, because of such 

deemed acquisition and vesting of excess vacant land of which possession 

is taken by the State Government or competent authority the person 

holding the vacant land would stand to lose completely. He would not be 

entitled to claim any payment of the deemed acquisition and vesting of 

the land in the State Government free from all encumbrances and which 

is unaffected by the repeal of the Principal Act. He would be totally 

remedyless. Since the Principal Act is repealed Sections 11 to 14 also 

would be taken as obliterated from the statute book. If they stand 

obliterated and removed, then, a person holding the vacant land in excess 

of ceiling limit though entitled to payment or compensation under the 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014

*41* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Principal Act would not be so entitled because the Principal Act is 

repealed. Without the proviso, the duty of the State to compensate for 

such vesting, may not have been saved or survived the repeal. It could 

have been urged that the right to seek compensation from the State is lost 

as the Principal Act is repealed and all proceedings thereunder abate on 

the Repeal Act taking effect. That is why the Legislature by proviso to 

Section 4 of the Repeal Act clarified that such excess vacant land of which 

possession has been taken and its vesting is saved despite repeal of the 

Principal Act does not mean that a person holding such land need not be 

or cannot be compensated. He can claim payment and the proceedings 

relating to Sections 11 to 14 of the Principal Act insofar as they relate to 

the vacant land of which possession has been taken, do not abate. This 

proviso is completely overlooked while arguing in support of the principle 

of total destruction or obliteration of the rights and liabilities under the 

Principal Act so also the remedies. If this is demonstrative of a positive 

legislative intent and which is duly reflected in the statement of objects 

and reasons of the Repeal Act, then, it would not be proper to accept the 

contentions of Mr.Naphade and other Senior Counsel. If the intent and 

purpose is to save all rights and liabilities in relation to the excess vacant 

land of which possession is taken, then, it would be safe to proceed and 

hold that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and its applicability is not 

ruled out or that the saving section demonstrates a contrary intention and 

of non applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. 

38 
The learned Advocate General also submitted that when the 

rights, obligations and liabilities are intended to be saved it is not the 

saving of only vested rights, but those of the nature specified in Section 6 

of the General Clauses Act, 1897. He, therefore, submits that understood 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014

*42* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

thus and in the context of the power to exempt the excess vacant land 

from applicability of ChapterIII of the Principal Act, then, the only 

conclusion that can be reached is that not only Section 20(1) of the 

Principal Act, but subsection (2) thereof is also saved and remains 

unaffected by repeal of the Principal Act. He submits that an order of 

exemption does not take the vacant land out of the purview of the 

Principal Act or rules out its applicability to it totally. All that results after 

such power is exercised is that, but for the duration of the exemption, the 

vacant land in excess of ceiling limit continues to be treated and dealt 

with as such. Its nature continues to be the same. It also continues to be 

subject to the Principal Act. All that happens is that such an order of 

exemption keeps in abeyance the operation of ChapterIII of the Principal 

Act. As a result of such abeyance and by exercise of a statutory power the 

rights and liabilities attached to the excess vacant land remain unaffected. 

In that regard it must not be lost sight that none can hold the excess 

vacant land beyond the ceiling limit on and from the commencement of 

the Principal Act. If that is the statutory position and which is recognized 

even by the Repeal Act, so also, the exemption order only keeping in 

abeyance the operation or applicability of ChapterIII to such lands, then, 

all original rights, liabilities in relation thereto remain unaffected. The 

Repeal Act saves such rights and liabilities and which are accrued and 

incurred on commencement of the Principal Act. That is why by clause (a) 

of subsection (1) of Section 3 it was declared by the Parliament that the 

repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the vesting of any vacant land 

under Section 10(3) the possession of which has been taken over by the 

State Government otherwise, but for such express declaration it could 

have been asserted that the Principal Act having been repealed the 

vesting comes to an end or is obliterated. By clause (b) which cannot be

*43* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

termed as merely a validating clause or saving theoretically the validity of 

the exemption order, the Legislature declares that the said order is saved 

with all legal consequences. This is in consonance with the object and 

purpose in enacting the Repeal Act and saving from such repeal or leaving 

unaffected by the repeal the exercise of some of the vital powers 

conferred by the Principal Act and the actions taken thereunder. 

39 
The learned Advocate General then submitted that it is not 

correct to urge that the power to exempt is legislative in character. In that 

behalf he took us once again through Sections 20(1) and (2), Sections 21 

and 22 of the Principal Act, so also, the scheme of the Principal Act to 

urge that it is an administrative order passed in the case of a excess 

vacant land. Equally, the conditions imposed are inextricably linked to the 

said exemption order. The public interest is paramount in imposing such 

conditions and equally the Preamble of the Principal Act acts as a guide in 

passing the orders of exemption under clauses (a) and (b) of subsection 

(1) of Section 20. In such circumstances and when the order must contain 

the reasons when it is made under clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 

20, that order can be made on reaching the requisite satisfaction alone 

and that withdrawal of the order of this nature is only after compliance 

with the principles of natural justice, then, that rules out the possibility of 

the power being termed as legislative in character, that submission of 

Mr.Naphade has no substance. In these circumstances and when the point 

is concluded by the judgment of the Constitution Bench of the 

Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Bansidhar v/s State of Rajasthan 

reported in (1989) 2 SCC 557, then, the reference cannot be answered, 

but by holding that both subsections (1) and (2) of Section 20 of the 

Principal Act are saved and not affected by repeal of the Principal Act. It is

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 ::: 


*44* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

fallacious to contend that withdrawal of the exemption order is axiomatic 

or automatic on the satisfaction in terms of Section 20(2) being reached. 

On the other hand what subsection (2) of Section 20 states is that it shall 

be competent for the State Government to withdraw by order the 

exemption if it is satisfied that any of the condition subject to which any 

exemption under clause (a) or clause (b) of subsection (1) is not 

complied with by any person. Further part of subsection (2) is that the 

exemption can be withdrawn by an order, but after giving reasonable 

opportunity to such person of making representation against the proposed 

withdrawal. This means that the said person can make a representation 

against the proposed withdrawal and the Government is obliged to 

consider it. If the State Government is so obliged and it may withdraw the 

order of exemption though fully competent to do so that would falsify all 

the contentions to the contrary. If the withdrawal is not automatic or 

axiomatic or only outcome or result upon the satisfaction under sub 

section (2) being reached, then, it is further fallacious to contend that if 

there is non compliance with any of the conditions subject to which 

exemption has been granted, then, the only consequence of such non 

compliance or breach would be applicability of Section 10(3) of the 

Principal Act. That is not the only consequence because the State 

Government may or may not withdraw the exemption, but by an order 

under subsection (2) of Section 20 stipulate that if the condition is not 

complied with within the time extended or provided in the further order 

the exemption may be withdrawn. The Government can also in the order 

state that some of the terms and conditions have been complied with 

whereas others are not and since the order of exemption is not complied 

with in its totality, additional time is being granted for such compliance 

failing which the State may proceed to withdraw the order and take all

such and further actions as are permissible in law. Therefore, it is not as if 

subsection (2) of Section 20 being not referred in the saving clause 

enacted by Section 3 of the Repeal Act would mean the Legislature never 

intended to save it. Rather it was not necessary to be mentioned because 

if the validity of the order of exemption or any action taken thereunder is 

saved that means the exemption order is valid, but not its conditions and 

they cannot be enforced or only the exemption order is valid or any action 

taken thereunder, but other consequences flowing from such valid 

exemption order or any valid action taken thereunder are ruled out, that 

is an erroneous submission. Relying on Bansidhar's case (supra) it is 

submitted that intention contrary to the applicability of Section 6 of the 

General Clauses Act is not to be assumed only with reference to what is 

expressly saved and it cannot be further assumed that what is not 

expressly saved stands destroyed or obliterated. An express saving clause 

necessarily does not reflect intention contrary to the applicability of 

Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. Therefore, the reference needs to be 

answered accordingly.

The learned Advocate General while ending his submissions 

urged that the decisions in the case of Voltas Limited v/s Additional 

Collector & Competent Authority reported in 2008(5) Bom.C.R. 746,

others reported in 2008 (5) Bombay Cases Reporter 85 or any 

observations therein are not binding on construction and interpretation of 

Section 3(1)(b) and (c) of the Repeal Act. At best, the observations and 

findings in these decisions can be applied to a case falling under Section 

3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. In that regard as well some further conclusions

rendered in Voltas Case (supra) and all above decisions contrary to what 

is held in Bansidhar's Case (supra) do not lay down the correct law. In 

fact Bansidhar's case (supra) was cited before the Division Bench in Votlas 

Case (supra), but the Division Bench completely omitted it from 

consideration and made some sweeping observations. These observations, 

findings and conclusions in Voltas (supra) have been followed in Vithabai 

(supra), Sundersons (supra) and in Mohan Gopalrao Mate v/s Principal 

Secretary and others reported in 2009(1) Bom. C.R. 275, all of which, 

therefore and to the extent indicated above must be held to be not laying 

down the correct law. 

41 
These submissions of the learned Advocate General are fully 

adopted by Mr.P.K.Dhakephalkar, learned Senior Counsel appearing in 

some of the petitions for the State. He has take us through the scheme of 

Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and particularly the words of clause 

(b) thereof to urge that the exemption order including the conditions 

thereunder and all legal consequences survive the repeal of the Principal 

Act. That is the only construction which can be placed on Section 3 of the 

Repeal Act.

A brief rejoinder was given by Mr.Naphade to these 

contentions and he urged that each of the judgments cited by the learned 

Advocate General are with reference to the statutes which are not 

parimateria with the Principal Act or the Repeal Act. Therefore, 

Bansidhar's case (supra) and other judgments are distinguishable. Even 

otherwise the judgments are not to be read like statutes. One cannot 

construe the Repeal Act and as clear in the present case to mean reviving 

the Principal Act. In Bansidhar (supra) and other cases cited there was no

*49* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

plain and express repeal, but a reenactment of the earlier legislation or 

law. The Rajasthan Ceiling Act of 1955 was replaced or repealed by a 

later Ceiling Act. That is, therefore, a case of reenactment. In the 

reenacted statute there was a saving clause, namely, Section 15 of the 

Rajasthan Act No.VIII of 1976. That indicated that earlier Ceiling Law, 

namely, Act of 1955 was still on the statute book albeit for a limited 

purpose. That is how paragraph 24 of Bansidhar's judgment (supra) 

would read. Thus, the factual matrix was different. In the present case, 

the Repeal Act destroys many provisions of the Principal Act. Sections 21 

and 22 of the Principal Act are not saved and therefore, parimateria 

provision like Section 20(2) cannot be held to be saved. Similarly all cases 

which have been cited by the learned Advocate General on the law 

enacting ceiling on agricultural lands are inapplicable because firstly 

those Acts are not parimateria. Secondly, interpretation on the provisions 

of those Acts was placed by the Honourable Supreme Court when the said 

Acts were existing on the statute book and not repealed. That is why 

these judgments cannot be cited as precedent for applicability of Section 6 

of the General Clauses Act to the present case. Lastly, Mr.Naphade would 

submit that the learned Advocate General was in error in placing reliance 

on the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Atia 

Mohammadi Begum v/s State of U.P. reported in AIR 1993 SC 2465 

because this decision is expressly dissented from in a later decision of the 

Honourable Supreme Court in Her Highness Maharani Shantidevi P. 

Gaikwad vs. Savjibhai Haribhai Patel and Others reported in (2001) 5 SCC 

101. It is overruled. Thus, if ChapterIII of the Principal Act is the heart of 

the said law and its applicability is ruled out completely and not 

temporarily as urged, then, the said ChapterIII does not survive repeal of 

the Principal Act. For these reasons the Reference must be answered in

terms urged by the Petitioners. 

44 
For properly appreciating the rival contentions a reference 

firstly to the Principal Act and thereafter, the Repeal Act is necessary. In 

AIR 1979 SC 1415 (Union of India v/s Valluri Basavaiah Chouwdhary), 

the Honourable Supreme Court outlined the object and purpose of the 

Principal Act in the following words: 

"6. 
The primary object and the purpose of the Urban 
Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, 'the Act', as 
the long title and the preamble show, is to provide for 
the imposition of a ceiling on vacant land in urban 
agglomerations, for the acquisition of such land in 
excess of the ceiling limit, to regulate the construction 
of buildings on such land and for matters connected 
therewith, with a view to preventing the 
concentration of urban land in the hands of a few 
persons and speculation and profiteering therein, and 
with a view to bringing about an equitable 
distribution of land in urban agglomerations to 
subserve the common good, in furtherance of the 
directive principles of Art.39(b) and (c)." 

45 
ChapterI of the Principal Act contains preliminary 

provisions. Firstly, by Section 1 short title, application and 

commencement is set out and by virtue of subsection (2) thereof the 

Principal Act becomes applicable to the State of Maharashtra in the first 

instance. Then, in Section 2 there are certain definitions. For our purpose 

the definitions of the term "appointed day" appearing in Section 2(a), 

"ceiling limit" in Section 2(c), "to hold" in Section 2(l), "urban land" as 

defined in Section 2(o) and "vacant land" appearing in Section 2(q) are 

relevant. On perusal of these definitions further provisions of the Principal 

Act can be properly appreciated. The Principal Act, therefore, must be

*51* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

seen as applicable to the vacant land and within an urban agglomeration. 

A person holding such land or possessing it in any of the capacities 

referred to in Section 2(l) shall be bound by the ceiling limit as specified 

in Section 4(1) and further subsections of that Section. By Section 3 it is 

mandated that on and from the commencement of the Principal Act 

except as otherwise provided therein no person shall be entitled to hold 

any vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit in the territories to which the 

Principal Act applies under subsection (2) of Section 1. Further 

provision, namely, Section 5 sets out as to what are the consequences on 

such vacant land being transferred at any time during the period 

commencing on the appointed day and ending with the commencement 

of the Principal Act. Then, Section 6 requires the persons holding vacant 

land in excess of ceiling limit to file a statement. Section 6 of the Principal 

Act reads as under: 

"6. 
Persons holding vacant land in excess of ceiling limit 

to file statement: 

(1) 
Every person holding vacant land in excess of the 
ceiling limit at the commencement of this Act shall, 
within such period as may be prescribed, file a 
statement before the competent authority having 
jurisdiction specifying the location, extent, value and 
such other particulars as may be prescribed of all 
vacant lands and of any other land on which there is 
a building, whether or not with a dwelling unit 
therein, held by him (including the nature of his 
right, title or interest therein) and also specifying the 
vacant lands within the ceiling limit which he desires 
to retain: 

Provided that in relation to any State to which this 
Act applies in the first instance, the provisions of this 
subsection shall have effect as if for the words "Every 
person holding vacant land in excess of the ceiling 
limit and the commencement of this Act", the words,

figures and letters "Every person who held vacant 
land in excess of the ceiling limit on or after the 17th 
day of February, 1975 and before the commencement 
of this Act and every person holding vacant land in 
excess of the ceiling limit at such commencement" had 
been substituted. 

Explanation. -In this section, "commencement of this Act" 
means, -
(i) 
the date on which this Act comes into force in 
any State; 
(ii) where any land, not being vacant land,

become vacant land by any reason whatsoever, the 
date on which such land becomes vacant land; 
(iii) where any notification has been issued under 
clause (n) of section 2 in respect of any area in a 
State in which this Act is in force; the date of 
publication of such notification. 

(2) 
If the competent authority is of opinion that -
(a) in any State to which this Act applies in the 
first instance, any person held on or after the 17th 
day of February, 1975 and before the commencement 
of this Act or holds at such commencement; or 
(b) in any State which adopts this Act under clause 
(1) of Article 252 of the Constitution, any person 
holds at the commencement of this Act, 

vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit, then, 
notwithstanding anything contained in subsection 
(1), it may serve a notice upon such person requiring 
him to file, within such period as may be specified in 
the notice, the statement referred to in subsection 
(1). 

(3) 
The competent authority may, if it is satisfied that it 
is necessary so to do, extend the date for filing the 
statement under this section by such further period or 
periods as it may think fit; so, however, that the 
period or the aggregate of the periods of such 
extension shall not exceed three months.

A bare perusal thereof would indicate as to how the filing of 

statement is compulsory and by a person holding vacant land in excess of 

ceiling limit at the commencement of the Principal Act. He being required 

to file within the prescribed period a statement before the competent 

authority having jurisdiction specifying the location, extent, value and 

such other particulars as may be prescribed of all vacant land and of any 

other land on which there is a building, whether or not with a dwelling 

unit therein held by him including the nature of his right, title and 

interest therein and also specifying the vacant land within the ceiling limit 

which he desires to retain, that we are of the view that such statement is 

contemplated by law so as not to allow the holder of excess vacant land to 

escape the consequence of law. This aspect would become clear if one 

peruses Sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Principal Act. It is not as if the 

competent authority does not make any inquiry on the statement filed 

under Section 6. That such an inquiry has to be made because it is the 

competent authority who has to prepare the draft statement. The 

statement gets finality by virtue of Section 9 and thereafter, the 

consequences follow and those are to be found in Section 10. Much 

emphasis has been laid on the said provision, namely, Section 10. It is 

reproduced herein below: 

"10. Acquisition of vacant land in excess of ceiling limit: 
(1) 
As soon as may be after the service of the statement 
under section 9 on the person concerned, the 
competent authority shall cause a notification giving 
the particulars of the vacant land held by such person 
in excess of the ceiling limit and stating that -
(i) 
such vacant land is so be acquired by the 
concerned State Government; and 
(ii) the claims of all persons interested in such 
vacant land may be made by them personally or by 
their agents giving particulars of the nature of their

interests in such land, 
to be published for the information of the general 
public in the Official Gazette of the State concerned 
and in such other manner as may be prescribed. 

(2) 
After considering the claims of the persons interested 
in the vacant land, made to the competent authority 
in pursuance of the notification published under sub 
section (1), the competent authority shall determine 
the nature and extent of such claims and pass such 
orders as it deems fit. 

(3) 
At any time after the publication of the notification 
under subsection (1), the competent authority may, 
by notification published in the Official Gazette of the 
State concerned, declare that the excess vacant land 
referred to in the notification published under sub 
section (1) shall, with effect from such date as may be 
specified in the declaration, be deemed to have been 
acquired by the State Government and upon the 
publication of such declaration, such land shall be 
deemed to have vested absolutely in the State 
Government free from all encumbrances with effect 
from the date so specified. 

(4) 
During the period commencing on the date of 
publication of the notification under subsection (1) 
and ending with the date specified in the declaration 
made under subsection (3) -
(i) 
no person shall transfer by way of sale, 
mortgage, gift, lease or otherwise any excess vacant 
land (including any part thereof) specified in the 
notification aforesaid and any such transfer made in 
contravention of this provision shall be deemed to be 
null and void; and 
(ii) no person shall alter or cause to be altered the 
use of such excess vacant land. 

(5) 
Where any vacant land is vested in the State 
Government under subsection (3), the competent 
authority may, by notice in writing, order any person 
who may be in possession of it to surrender or deliver

person duly authorised by the State Government in 
this behalf within thirty days of the service of the 
notice. 

(6) 
If any person refuses or fails to comply with an order 
made under subsection (5), the competent authority 
may take possession of the vacant land or cause it to 
be given to the concerned State Government or to any 
person duly authorised by such State Government in 
this behalf and may for that purpose use such force as 
may be necessary. 

Explanation. -In this section, in subsection (1) of section 11 
and in sections 14 and 23, "State Government", in 
relation to -
(a) any vacant land owned by the Central 
Government, means the Central Government; 
(b) any vacant land owned by any State 
Government and situated in a Union territory or 
within the local limits of a cantonment declared as 
such under section 3 of the Cantonments Act, 1924, 
(2 of 1924), means that State Government." 

47 
A bare perusal thereof would indicate that it is providing for 

acquisition of vacant land in excess of ceiling limit. Sections 11 to 14 

create a mechanism for the purpose of payment of amount for vacant 

lands acquired in terms of Section 10. By Section 15 there is a ceiling 

limit on future acquisition by inheritance, bequest or by sale in execution 

of decrees, etc. Then, there are other consequences which are to be found 

when the Principal Act is adopted subsequently by any State. Then the 

persons can file the statement and in relation to such State within the 

time specified by Section 16. By Section 17 the power is given to enter 

upon any vacant land. By Section 18 there are penalties provided for 

concealment etc. of particulars or furnishing inaccurate particulars of

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

vacant land. Section 19 states that the Chapter will not apply to certain 

vacant lands and those are specified in subsection (1) of Section 19. By 

subsection (2) of Section 19 the intent of the legislature is further 

clarified inasmuch as there is distinction between the Chapter not 

applying to certain vacant lands and exemption to vacant lands from the 

provisions of the Chapter. By subsection (2) of Section 19 it is clarified 

that the provisions of subsection (1) of Section 19 shall not be construed 

as granting any exemption in favour of any person other than an 

authority, institution or organization specified in subsection (1). Such 

persons may be possessing any vacant land which is owned by such 

authority, institution or organization. In other words, the Chapter is not 

applicable to vacant lands which are owned by an authority, institution or 

organization. Similarly, if any such authority, institution or organization 

possesses any vacant land belonging to a person, then, that person/ 

owner does not derive any benefit or advantage merely because the 

Chapter is not applicable since the vacant land is in possession of the 

authority, institution or organization. By Section 20 the power to exempt 

is conferred. Section 20 is reproduced herein below: 

"20. Power to exempt: 
(1) 
Notwithstanding anything contained in any of the 
foregoing provisions of this Chapter. -
(a) where any person holds vacant land in excess of 
the ceiling limit and the State Government is satisfied, 
either on its own motion or otherwise, that, having 
regard to the location of such land, the purpose for 
which such land is being or is proposed to be used and 
such other relevant factors as the circumstances of the 
case may require, it is necessary or expedient in the 
public interest so to do, that Government may, by 
order, exempt, subject to such conditions, if any, as 
may be specified in the order, such vacant land from 
the provisions of this Chapter. 
(b) where any person holds vacant land in excess of

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

the ceiling limit and the State Government, either on 
its own motion or otherwise, is satisfied that the 
application of the provisions of this Chapter would 
cause undue hardship to such person, that 
Government may by order, exempt subject to such 
conditions, if any, as may be specified in the order, 
such vacant land from the provisions of this Chapter: 

Provided that no order under this clause shall be made unless 
the reasons for doing so are recorded in writing. 

(2) 
If at any time the State Government is satisfied that 
any of the conditions subject to which any exemption 
under clause (a) or clause (b) of subsection (1) is 
granted is not complied with by any person, it shall 
be competent for the State Government to withdraw, 
by order, such exemption after giving a reasonable 
opportunity to such person for making a 
representation against the proposed withdrawal and 
thereupon the provisions of this Chapter shall apply 
accordingly." 

48 
A bare perusal of Section 20 would indicate that the power 

thereunder is conferred in the State. The State can exempt the vacant 

land in excess of ceiling limit from the provisions of the ChapterIII if it is 

satisfied in terms of clause (a) or (b) of subsection (1) that the 

exemption is required because of the location of land, the purpose for 

which such land is being used or proposed to be used and such other 

relevant factors as the circumstances of the case may require and that it is 

necessary and expedient in the public interest so to do. By clause (b) of 

subsection (1) of Section 20 to relieve undue hardship to a person 

holding the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit that the power to exempt 

is to be exercised. However, the power to exempt is exercised in relation 

to the excess vacant land. Therefore, such exemption being granted does

not mean that the excess vacant land is out of the purview of the Principal 

Act. That it is subject to the Principal Act is clear and is undisputed. That 

it being so subject to the Principal Act is, therefore, empowering the 

Government to exempt it from the provisions of ChapterIII thereof. That 

it is the excess vacant land and therefore, ChapterIII would govern the 

same, is not disputed before us. The question is whether such exemption 

being granted and after it being granted subject to any conditions will 

that exemption order survive the repeal of the Principal Act with all 

consequences or not? The Repeal Act reads thus:

and Regulation) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as 
the principal Act) is hereby repealed. 
3. 
Savings: -
(1) The repeal of the principal Act shall not affect 
(a) the vesting of any vacant land under 
subsection (3) of section 10, possession of which has

duly authorised by the State Government in this 
behalf or by the competent authority. 

5. 
Repeal and saving : -
(1) The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) 
Repeal Ordinance, 1999 (Ord. 5 of 1999) is hereby 
repealed. 
(2) Notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or 
any action taken under the said Ordinance shall be 
deemed to have been done or taken under the 
corresponding provisions of this Act." 

49 
To our mind if the intent and purpose was not to save the 

order of exemption with the attendant legal consequences, then, the 

Legislature was not required to mention or specify anything about its 

validity in the Repeal Act. The Legislature was then not required to save 

its validity as well. The argument is that the validity of exemption order is 

saved because vesting of excess vacant land of which possession alone is 

taken is saved and that has been specified in clause (a) of Section 3(1) of 

the Repeal Act. The vesting of such excess vacant lands cannot be 

questioned because, at one time they may be exempted from applicability 

of the provisions of ChapterIII, but that exemption was withdrawn and 

later they were subjected to the consequences specified by Section 10 and 

particularly subsections (3), (5) and (6) thereof, that the validity of the 

order exempting them has been saved. We do not think that this will be a 

sound and proper reading of the Repeal Act. Just as the Principal Act 

would have to be read as a whole, equally the Repeal Act as well. We 

cannot read the Repeal Act by omitting or leaving out therefrom anything 

which the Legislature has specifically incorporated or inserted. We, 

therefore, cannot hold that clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of 

the Repeal Act which is a saving clause having saved the vesting of the

*62* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

excess vacant land of which possession has been taken over and these 

vacant lands may be at one time exempted, that the Legislature inserted 

by way of abundant caution clauses (b) and (c) in subsection (1) of 

Section 3 of the Repeal Act. The argument of Mr.Naphade and other 

Senior Counsel is that this is by way of abundant caution and nothing 

more. 

50 
We are unable to agree with them because the excess vacant 

lands being at one time exempted, but such exemption being withdrawn 

later would equate such excess vacant lands with those in relation to 

which the power of exemption was never exercised and the Chapter was 

throughout applicable. Their status would be on par with those excess 

vacant lands in relation to which no attempt was made to seek an 

exemption or such attempt was made, exemption granted, but later on 

withdrawn and withdrawal never questioned by the affected parties. If in 

relation to such lands as well the necessary steps and in pursuance of 

Section 10(1) could have been taken and prior to the repeal had the 

possession of such lands been taken over, they would have vested in the 

State and that vesting is saved or survives the repeal of the Principal Act, 

then, there was absolutely no necessity of saving the exemption order and 

which has already been acted upon or in relation to which the 

consequences including those provided by Section 20(2) and ensuing the 

same have already followed. 

51 
Then, why is the validity of any order granting exemption 

under subsection (1) of Section 20 or any action taken thereunder 

notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary, saved? That is 

saved and with a purpose. That is because the power to exempt the land 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014

*63* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

and which could be exercised in a given case in public interest and not for 

any private purpose or benefit should be allowed to be pursued to its 

logical end. If the power is conferred and its exercise is contemplated for 

public good and in public interest, then, the consequences of the same 

ought to follow and equally in public interest and for public good. The 

Legislature while repealing the Principal Act was aware of the 

consequences that may follow the repeal. It was aware of the fact that if 

certain steps taken or the powers exercised under the Principal Act do not 

survive the repeal thereof, then, public good and public interest would be 

adversely affected. The power to exempt is coupled with a duty. If that is 

coupled with a duty and not an absolute power and is in the nature of a 

trust and is expected to be exercised in that manner, then, the Legislature 

was aware that the power having once exercised it must be allowed to 

take its full course. That is why whatever may be its fate in terms of the 

order of the Court, but notwithstanding that the validity of exemption 

order is saved and that is not to allow a person who may be a beneficiary 

thereof to escape the legal consequences ensuing the same. If that were 

not to be saved and was not to survive the repeal, then, clauses (b) and 

(c) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act were not required to 

be inserted. They are not surplusage or superfluous or inserted as and by 

way of abundant caution. The law in this regard is very clear and in the 

words of the Honourable Mr. Justice Patanjali Shastri, Chief Justice of 

India (as His Lordship then was) in the case of Aswini Kumar Ghose v/s 

Arabinda Bose reported in AIR 1952 SC 369, "it is not a sound principle 

of construction to brush aside words in a statute as being inapposite 

surplusage, if they can have appropriate application in circumstances 

conceivably within the contemplation of the statute." The Honourable 

Supreme Court has also held that it is incumbent on the court to avoid a

*64* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

construction, if reasonably permissible on the language, which would 

render a part of the statute devoid of any meaning or application. In other 

decision reported in AIR 1961 SC 1170 (J.K.Cotton Spinning & Weaving 

Mills Co. Ltd. v/s State of U.P.), it is held that "To harmonise is not to 

destroy. The courts always presume that the Legislature inserted every 

part thereof for a purpose and the legislative intention is that every part 

of the statute should have effect" (see para 7 at page 1174). The 

Legislature is deemed not to waste its words or to say anything in vain. 

Hence, it is not possible to easily attribute to the Legislature that a 

provision has been made or the words have been inserted just as a matter 

of caution or to chart a safe course. If the vesting of the land of which 

possession has been taken is saved and repeal of the Principal Act was not 

to affect it, then, nothing more was required to be stated or saved as the 

law has taken its course. If vesting of the vacant land under Section 

10(3), possession of which has been taken over by the State alone, is to 

be saved, then, making further provisions and incorporating them in the 

Repeal Act was unnecessary. 

52 
The above aspect becomes clear if we peruse the statement of 

objects and reasons to the Repeal Bill, 1999. That reads as under: 

"Statement of Objects and Reasons: 
The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 
was passed with a laudable social objective. The main 
purpose was to prevent concentration of urban land 
in a few hands and to provide affordable housing to 
the Economically Weaker Sections. It has on the 
contrary pushed up land prices, practically brought 
the housing industry to a stop and provided 
opportunities for corruption. There is a widespread 
demand for removing this irritant to land assembly 
and construction activity. During the implementation 
of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act,

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

1976, there have been a spate of litigations giving rise 
to serious hurdles in taking over possession of land, 
by the State Governments. Public opinion is nearly 
unanimous that the Act has failed to achieve its 
objectives as expected. 
2. 
Parliament has no power to repeal or amend the Act 
unless resolutions are passed by two or more State 
Legislatures as required under clause (2) of Article 
252. The Legislatures of Haryana and Punjab have 
passed resolutions empowering Parliament to repeal 
the Act in those States. The Act stands repealed in 
those States and in the Union territories immediately 
after promulgation of the repeal Ordinance and 
subsequently if State Legislatures adopt this Repeal 
Act by resolution, then the Urban Land (Ceiling and 
Regulation) Act, 1976 will stand repealed in those 
States, from the date of its adoption. 
3. 
The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Bill, 
1998 was examined by the Standing Committee on 
Urban and Rural Development. The Committee felt 
that the land which is yet to be put to use for the 
original purposes stated in the Act, under possession 
of the Government should not be restored to previous 
owners as such restoration may lead to avoidable 
discrimination. The Committee also suggested that the 
repeal Bill should contain a provision for abatement 
of proceedings in the different courts. Keeping in view 
the recommendations of the Committee, this Bill is 
being introduced to replace the Urban Land (Ceiling 
and Regulation) Repeal Ordinance, 1999 (Ord.5 of 
1999) notified on 11.01.1999 so that the State 
Governments would be free to have their own 
legislation commensurate with their needs and 
experiences. Till this Act is repealed, States have no 
power to legislate on this subject. 
4. 
The proposed repeal, along with some other incentives 
and simplification of administrative procedures, is 
expected to revive the stagnant housing industry. The 
repeal will facilitate construction of dwelling units 
both in the public and private sector and help 
achievement of targets contemplated under National 
Agenda for Governance. The repeal will not, however,

affect vesting of any vacant land under subsection 
(3) of Section 10 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and 
Regulation) Act, 1976 the possession of which has 
been taken over by the State Governments. It will not 
affect payments made to the State Governments for 
exemptions. The exemptions granted under Section 20 
of the Act will continue to be operative. The amounts 
paid out by the State Governments will become 
refundable before restoration of the land to the 
former owners. 
5. 
The Bill also seeks to facilitate land assembly and a 
flexible regime for administering urban land to suit 
the varying local conditions based on State level 
legislations or requirements." 

53 
If one peruses clause 4 of the Statement of objects and 

reasons carefully and particularly the part where the intent is not to affect 

by repeal the exemption under Section 20 of the Principal Act will and 

that continues to be operative. After adopting the Repeal Act, the States 

have a freedom to legislate on the same subject as is clear from Clause 3 

of the Statement of Objects and Reasons to the Repeal Act. That intent 

and purpose is not achieved or served by a mere insertion of clause (a) of 

subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. It is, therefore, that the 

Legislature did not exhaust itself and added clause (b) and that too to 

subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act and by inserting the words 

of wide import. It is with an intent of not affecting the exemptions 

granted, but continuing them so also preserving their validity that clause 

(b) has been so worded. In clause (b) not only the Legislature has saved 

the validity of exemption order or any action taken thereunder, but has 

protected or saved this validity notwithstanding anything to the contrary 

held by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Legislature was aware that 

the exemptions have been granted under Section 20 across the country by

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

several State Governments in exercise of their powers to exempt the 

excess vacant lands from applicability of ChapterIII of the Principal Act. 

These exemption orders have been passed bearing in mind the location of 

excess vacant land, the purpose for which it is used or intended to be 

used and such other relevant factors as the circumstances of the case may 

require. The power to exempt has been exercised after the Government 

reached this satisfaction and further that it is necessary and expedient in 

the public interest so to do. Under clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 

20, therefore, exemption to the excess vacant lands from the provisions of 

ChapterIII is not to benefit the land holder as is urged before us. It is to 

uphold and promote the larger public interest particularly of providing 

affordable living accommodation and for those who are in a poor state 

and entitled to public assistance. The Legislature was aware that 

exemption orders have also been passed in some cases to relieve the 

hardship to the persons holding excess vacant land on the requisite 

satisfaction reached by the Government. That satisfaction is that unless 

the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit held by such person is not 

exempted from the provisions of ChapterIII undue hardship would be 

caused to such person. The Legislature was equally aware while enacting 

the Repeal Act that several exemption orders under clauses (a) and (b) 

have been passed with conditions attached to them. The conditions may 

be of imposition of penalties for delay in completion and implementation 

of a housing project or scheme. The conditions imposed may interalia 

visit the person or holder with the consequence of withdrawal of the 

exemption and forfeiture of the amounts paid or deposited. Such 

conditional orders of exemption are in force and not withdrawn because 

the Government was of the opinion that the lands were being put to such 

use as would serve the object and purpose in enacting the Principal Act.

That the State Governments were aware that the schemes of housing for 

weaker sections in the society were promulgated and such excess vacant 

lands were to be utilized to provide cheap and affordable housing to the 

economically backward section or class of the society. The schemes of this 

nature were under several stages of implementation. The houses or 

tenements in such schemes or in housing projects earmarked for these 

sections of the society, were to be handed over or were to be taken over so 

as to reach the ultimate beneficiaries. It is with these objects and peculiar 

facts and circumstances of each case that the State allowed the exemption 

to remain in force. That at appropriate stages the extensions to the 

exemption orders have been granted. Therefore, if the exemption is 

granted firstly in public interest and secondly to relieve the undue 

hardship, then, such exemption orders being interfered with by the courts 

or struck down or quashed would cause serious prejudice and loss to the 

deprived sections of the society. When these states of affairs are to the 

knowledge of the Legislature, then, it is not possible to accept the 

contentions of Mr.Naphade that clauses (b) and (c) of subsection (1) of 

Section 3 of the Repeal Act are only added as and by way of abundant 

caution. We cannot attribute to the Legislature such surplusage. 

54 
The validity of exemption order is saved so as to ensure that 

the same serves the purpose for which it is granted. If that is what the 

Legislature had in mind, then, it is futile to suggest that the Legislature 

has left unaffected by repeal only the validity of the exemption order, but 

not its conditions. The argument that the conditions on which the 

exemption order is based or passed are no longer valid, but it is only the 

exemption order whose validity is saved, is required to be stated only for 

being rejected. While canvassing such an argument the counsel lost sight

*69* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

of clause (c) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. If as a 

condition for grant of exemption any payment has to be made to the State 

Government, then, the repeal of the Principal Act was not to affect such 

payment or condition under which the same is made. The insertion of the 

words "as a condition for granting exemption" in clause (c) of subsection 

(1) of Section 3 would demonstrate the legislative intent. If the payment 

made to the State Government as a condition for granting exemption and 

which may be incorporated in the exemption order is saved, then, there is 

no warrant to exclude from the provision in question the validity of other 

conditions in the exemption order. The entire order of exemption together 

with the conditions subject to which it has been granted is thus saved. 

That is because the Legislature was aware that the Principal Act was a 

social legislation. That its misuse and abuse by some sectors resulting in 

laudable social objective being not achieved that its repeal was 

necessitated. However, despite the repeal the validity of the exemption 

order or any action taken thereunder and notwithstanding anything to the 

contrary in any order of the court has been expressly saved. That could 

never have been inserted and merely to save the validity of the exemption 

order on paper. The validity of the order is saved so as not to affect the 

legal consequences of such valid order. To save them and the order as a 

whole together with the conditions incorporated therein that Section 3(1) 

(b) and (c) has been inserted in the Repeal Act. By that the State's powers 

incidental and ancillary to the power to exempt can thus, be exercised 

and despite the repeal. The exemption order, validity of which has been 

saved, can, therefore, be enforced, so also, its terms and conditions. These 

terms and conditions may have been incorporated simply to reaffirm that 

the power to exempt which is conferred in the highest executive 

functionary in the State, namely, Government is presumed to be exercised 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*70* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

for public good and in public interest. The exercise of such powers is, 

therefore, presumed to be bonafide and for achieving the object and 

purpose for which it is conferred. It is with these presumptions and which 

were always present to the Legislature that the validity of exemption 

order has been saved. Having said that and also saving the payment or 

monetary aspect related to the exemption, it was not necessary for the 

Parliament to then spell out separately all the legal consequences flowing 

from such valid order. Even otherwise, that there is no intention contrary 

to what is spelled out by Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is, 

therefore, apparent. There is no substance in the argument of the 

Petitioners that only the exemption order is saved, but not its terms and 

conditions and further by not referring to subsection (2) of Section 20 

the State's power to withdraw the exemption is taken away by repeal of 

the Principal Act. The argument is that the power to withdraw the 

exemption in terms of Section 20(2) of the Principal Act conferred in the 

State cannot be exercised because of repeal of the Principal Act. This 

argument is premised on the fact that once the State Government 

withdraws the exemption order the only consequence could be that the 

excess vacant land vests in the State under Section 10(3) of the Principal 

Act and that vesting cannot take place after repeal of the Principal Act. 

55 
In that regard if one notices Section 4 of the Repeal Act, that 

would denote that the proceedings under Sections 11 to 14 of the 

Principal Act are not affected by the abatement or the section in the 

Repeal Act causing abatement of pending proceedings or proceedings 

purported to be taken under the Principal Act. This itself throws light on 

the intent of the Parliament in not completely and totally obliterating the 

Principal Act. This itself shows that the Principal Act is not wiped out 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*71* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

from the statute book totally. Thus, after the deemed acquisition and 

vesting of the vacant land in the State if possession thereof is taken, 

recourse to these sections is permissible despite the Repeal of the 

Principal Act. 

56 
The fallacy in the above arguments can be demonstrated by 

perusing Section 20 of the Principal Act. The difference in the language 

in Section 19 and Section 20 is that Section 19 says that ChapterIII will 

not apply to certain vacant lands whereas what Section 20 sets out is the 

power to exempt the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit and which 

power can be exercised by the State Government in cases covered by 

clauses (a) and (b). That the said exemption can be withdrawn provided 

the Government records a satisfaction that any condition subject to which 

the exemption order is granted is not complied with by any person. 

Therefore, a conditional order of exemption can be withdrawn on 

reaching this satisfaction and conclusion. However, Section 20 does not 

mandate withdrawal, but confers a discretion in the Government to 

withdraw the exemption order after giving a reasonable opportunity to 

such person of making a representation against the proposed withdrawal. 

It is only when the power of withdrawal is exercised that the provisions of 

ChapterIII will apply. The language of section is, therefore, clear 

inasmuch as it is only when the exemption order is withdrawn that the 

ChapterIII of the Principal Act applies to the excess vacant land. So long 

as the exemption order is in force to protect its validity despite a contrary 

court order a saving provision in the Repeal Act will have to be inserted. 

The Legislature was aware that not only the terms and conditions of the 

exemption order need to be enforced, but if that order is acted upon by 

parties the validity as a whole must be saved. That needs to be saved so as

*72* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

to enable the State Government to apply the provisions of ChapterIII to 

the excess vacant land covered by the exemption order and the terms and 

conditions after it is noticed that the exemption is either misused or 

misutilized or not acted upon so as to subserve the larger public interest. 

A breach or violation of some of its vital conditions may result in its 

withdrawal and cancellation. If one way of applying ChapterIII is by 

withdrawing the exemption order, then, the power to withdraw the same 

which is implicit and inherent in the power to grant exemption is also 

saved and not affected by repeal of the Principal Act. That is because the 

vacant land held by a person is undisputedly in excess of ceiling limit. The 

power to exempt is exercised when a person holds the vacant land in 

excess of ceiling limit. That such power can be exercised even after 

declaration under Section 10(3) of the Principal Act is further undisputed. 

57 
In this backdrop if Section 20 is perused that confers a power 

to exempt and it opens with a nonobstante clause, namely, 

notwithstanding anything contained in any of the foregoing provisions of 

this Chapter, namely, ChapterIII. The clause (a) of subsection (1) of 

Section 20 refers to a person holding the vacant land in excess of ceiling 

limit. If the State Government is satisfied suo motu or otherwise that 

having regard to the location of such land, the purpose for which such 

land is used or is proposed to be used and such other relevant factors as 

the circumstances of the case may require and it is necessary or expedient 

in the public interest to do so, then, the Government may, by order, 

exempt, subject to such conditions as may be specified in the order, such 

vacant land from the provisions of ChapterIII. Thus, what is required for 

exemption firstly is that a person holds the vacant land in excess of ceiling 

limit, satisfaction of the State Government suo motu or otherwise that 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014

*73* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

having regard to the location of such land, purpose for which such land is 

being or is proposed to be used and such other relevant factors as the 

circumstances of the case may require, it is necessary or expedient in 

public interest so to do. Upon such satisfaction the Government may by 

order, exempt the vacant land from the provisions of ChapterIII by 

making an order and which could be conditional. The word "Exemption" 

means free from an obligation or liability. In Advanced Law Lexicon by 

P.Ramanatha Iyer, 3 rd Reprint 2007, the word "exempt" shows that a 

person is put beyond the application of law. It means to give freedom 

from liability, tax or duty like any exception. It is a privilege. 

58 
The argument of Mr.Naphade overlooks the position that 

when the power of exemption has to be exercised notwithstanding 

anything contained in any of the foregoing provisions of this Chapter, 

namely, ChapterIII, then, even Section 10 is included therein. Therefore, 

the land may have been notified in terms of subsection (3) of Section 10, 

yet the holder of such vacant land and which is in excess of ceiling limit 

can seek the Government's intervention and invoke the powers conferred 

in the State Government vide Section 20(1). Similarly, by clause (b) of 

subsection (1) of Section 20 where any person holds the vacant land in 

excess of ceiling limit and the State Government on its own motion or 

otherwise is satisfied that the application of the provisions of Chapter III 

would cause undue hardship to such person, that the Government may by 

an order, exempt, subject to such conditions as may be specified in the 

order, such vacant land from the provisions of this Chapter. However, the 

proviso clarifies that no orders under this clause, namely, clause (b) shall 

be made unless the reasons for the same are recorded in writing. 

59 
If the argument of Mr.Naphade is accepted, that would mean

*74* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

that the powers to exempt cannot be exercised when the land is already 

vested in the State in terms of Section 10. That the power under Section 

20(2) for withdrawal of exemption cannot be exercised after repeal of the 

Principal Act, presupposes that exemption itself cannot be granted after 

vesting takes place. Mr.Naphade and other counsel contend that effect of 

withdrawal of exemption is to vest the vacant land in the State in terms of 

Section 10 and after repeal that vesting is not possible or that even if the 

land is vested the further steps cannot be taken. Thus, the argument is 

premised on the basis that no application for exemption under Section 20 

can be filed by a person who holds the vacant land in excess of ceiling 

limit once it vests in the State. Precisely such an argument was canvassed 

before the Honourable Supreme Court and rejected in the case of Special 

Officer & Competent Authority, Urban Land Ceilings, Hyderabad v/s P.S. Rao 

reported in AIR 2000 SC 843 (see paragraphs 6 to 10). 

60 
Therefore, once the power of exemption can be exercised 

after the excess vacant land has vested in the State, then, equally the 

power to withdraw the exemption can also be exercised in case of such 

vacant land. 

61 
In the case of Smt.Darothi Clare Parreira v/s State of 

Maharashtra reported in AIR 1996 SC 2553 this is what is held by the 

Honourable Supreme Court: 

"5. Having considered the respective contentions, the 
question that arises for consideration is : Whether 
publication of the notification under Section 10(3) of 
the Act in the Gazette is in accordance with law? No 
doubt, this question was not squarely put in issue before 
the High Court in the manner in which Shri Naik and 
Shri Bobde have posed before us. Having considered the 
scheme of the Act, we find that there is no force in their

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

contentions. It is true that Section 3 postulates that 
except as otherwise provided in the Act, on and from the 
commencement of the Act, no person shall be entitled to 
hold any vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit in the 
territories to which the Act applies under subsection (2) 
of Section 3. Sections 6 to 10 prescribe the procedure for 
determination of the excess urban land. Admittedly after 
filing of statement, opportunity had been given they had 
been heard and excess land over the ceiling limit had 
been determined. Pursuant to the decision taken under 
Section 10(1) of the Act, objections came to be filed 
under Section 10(2) and objections also were considered 
and an opportunity was given before their consideration 
and objections came to be rejected. The question then is : 
whether the competent authority has to await the 
decision under Sections 20 and 21 before declaring and 
publishing the excess land under Section 10(3) by a 
notification in the Gazette. The scheme of the Act does 
indicate that until the date of the publication in the 
Gazette prescribing a date on and from which the excess 
land stands vested in the State, the owner continues to 
be the owner of the excess land and entitled to remain in 
possession thereof. On publication of the notification 
under Section 10(3) and after putting a date from 
which the land stands vested in the State and after 
publication of the notification in the Gazette and on and 
from the date mentioned therein, the excess vacant land 
stands vested in the State free from all encumbrances, 
subject to the decision in appeal, if any, filed according 
to law. 
6. The previous owner stands divested of right, title 
and interest in the land subject to the right to make 
application provided under Sections 20 and 21. It is 
difficult to accept the contention of the learned Counsel 
for the appellants that the competent authority has no 
power to have the notification under Section 10(3) 
published in the Gazette until the application either 
under Section 20 or 21 is disposed of. The very language 
of Sections 20 and 21 and the exercise of the power 
thereunder would arise only when the land stands vested 
in the Government. The power of examination and 
exemption would arise only when the Government

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

becomes the owner and the erstwhile owner seeks to 
obviate the hardships under Section 20 or to subserve 
the housing scheme for weaker sections under Section 21 
as envisaged thereunder. Thereat, the Government is 
required to consider whether the proposals made by the 
erstwhile owner for undertaking the scheme as envisaged 
under Section 21 or hardships as envisaged under 
Section 20 for exemption would merit consideration. In 
this case, admittedly, the application under Section 20 
came to be filed though that was suppressed before the 
High Court and this Court and came to be dismissed 
before notification under Section 10(3) of the Act was 
published. It also appears, as stated earlier, that 
application under Section 21 was filed on March 29, 
1979, the date on which the appellants had filed the 
writ petition in the High Court. It would, therefore, be 
seen that the application came to be filed much after the 
date of the vesting and publication of the notification 
under Section 10(3) of the Act. The effect of the vesting 
is not contingent upon filing an application for disposal 
under either Section 20 or 21. We do not go into the 
correctness of the order passed by the Government under 
Section 21 for the reason that it would be open to the 
Government and the Government have stated in their 
order that they have already decided to allot the land for 
another equally efficacious public purpose. Therefore, we 
cannot sit over the decision taken by the Government 
holding it illegal." 

62 
Following this view and principle in a later decision reported 

in Special Officer & Competent Authority, Urban Land Ceilings, Hyderabad 

and others v/s P.S. Rao reported in AIR 2000 SC 843, the Honourable 

Supreme Court held as under: 

"6. 
In our view, it is only after the excess land is actually 
determined under Section 10 that a person can know 
the exact extent of excess land in his holding and 
think of asking for exemption. There may, of course, 
be some cases where the extent is so large that a

*77* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

claimant may be able to seek exemption even at the 
time of filing the declaration but even in those cases, 
he cannot be definite about the actual extent of excess 
land. 
7. 
Learned Counsel, however, relied upon the definition 
of the words "to hold" in Subsection (1) of Section 
(2) to contend that once the final declaration is made 
and the excess vacant land has vested in the State, the 
person does not 'hold' the excess land and no 
application for exemption under Section 20 can be 
filed since Section 20 contemplates filing an 
application by a person who "holds vacant land in 
excess of the ceiling area". Section 2(1) states: 
"unless 
the 
context 
otherwise 
requires,........ 'to hold' with its grammatical 
variations, in relation to any vacant land means: 
(i) 
to own such land; or 
(ii) to possess such land as owner or as 
tenant or as mortgagee or under an irrevocable power 
of attorney or under a hire purchase agreement or 
partly in one of the said capacities and partly in any 
other of the said capacity or capacities. 
8. 
The definition of the words "to hold" in Section 2(1) 
is relevant at the time of computation of the ceiling 
area and at the stage of the preliminary 
determination of excess and the final determination, 
under Sections 8 and 9 of the Act, the excess is to be 
determined on the basis of the land permitted by the 
Act to be held by a person. 
9. 
But, the word "hold" in Section 20(1)(a) or Section 
20(1)(b) cannot, in our opinion, have the same 
meaning that can be attributed to it as in Section 
2(1). The very definition in Section 2(1) states that 
the subsection applies unless there is anything in the 
context which suggests a different meaning to be 
given. In our view, in the context of Section 20(1)(a) 
and Section 20(1)(b), the definition given in Section 
2(1) cannot be applied. The reason is that such a 
construction will make Section 20 unworkable and 
otiose. We have pointed out above that it is not 
possible to make any meaningful application for 
exemption under Section 20(1)(a) or (b) unless the 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*78* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

exact quantum of excess is determined under Section 
10 after following the various provisions of the Act 
relating to statutory deductions and mode of 
computation. If the contention of the State referred to 
above is to be accepted, then the peculiar position will 
be as follows. As stated by us, before the excess is 
determined, a person will not able to seek exemption 
because he does not know what is the actual excess 
land held and once the excess is determined, he 
cannot apply because he is not holding the excess 
land. Thus, the entire object of Section 20 will be 
frustrated. That is why we say that the definition of 
the words to hold in Section 2(1) cannot be applied 
in the context of Section 20(1)(a) or Section 20(1) 
(b). 
10. 
We are, therefore, unable to accept the contention of 
the learned Counsel for the State that an application 
for exemption can be maintained only before the 
excess is determined under Section 10. In our view, 
the scheme of the Act is to the contrary. The view 
taken by the High Court following the decision of this 
Court in T.R. Thandur v. Union of India, (1996) 3 
SCC 690 : (1996 AIR SCW 1700 : AIR 1996 SC 
1643), Darothi Clare Parreira (Smt.) v. State of 
Maharashtra, (1996) 9 SCC 633 : (1996 AIR SCW 
3179 : AIR 1996 SC 2553) and State of A. P. 
represented by Secretary to Govt., Revenue 
Department, Hyderabad v. Valluru Venkateswara 
Rao, (1997) 3 Andh. LT 417 does not call for any 
interference." 

63 
Once this legal position is noticed we do not see as to how 

absence of subsection (2) of Section 20 of the Principal Act in clause (b) 

of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act would enable us to hold 

that the power to withdraw the exemption is not saved. It is possible that 

the power to withdraw the exemption may not be exercised in every case. 

However, when the State exercises the power to exempt the vacant land

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*79* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

in excess of ceiling limit and which has already vested in it, then, there is 

no impediment in withdrawing the exemption from applicability of 

ChapterIII of the Principal Act in the case of such lands. The legal 

position, therefore, cannot be otherwise than what is held in the decisions 

of the Honourable Supreme Court and referred by us above and both of 

which have been rendered after the judgment in the case of T.R.Thandur 

v/s Union of India reported in (1996) 3 SCC 690. The argument of the 

learned Senior Counsel is that it would be inconsistent and contrary to 

the legislative intent if we hold that the power to withdraw the exemption 

conferred vide Section 20(2) of the Principal Act is saved despite the 

repeal. That would mean that possession of such lands can be taken post 

vesting and that is permissible even after repeal of the Principal Act. The 

argument is that it would be incongruous and even absurd to hold that 

the power to take possession conferred vide Section 10(5) and 10(6) of 

the Principal Act is saved despite repeal of the Principal Act. It is urged 

that same would make clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the 

Repeal Act wholly redundant and even meaningless. We must at once 

clarify that clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act is 

not dealing with only exempted lands. It is dealing with all excess vacant 

lands and which are subject matter of the declaration under Section 10(3) 

of the Principal Act. Their vesting will not be affected only if possession 

thereof is taken. Thus, clause (a) itself clarifies that the vesting of such 

lands would not be affected by repeal if their possession is taken. That 

only means that the Legislature was fully aware of the legal consequences 

of declaration under Section 10(3) of the Principal Act. That provides for 

deemed acquisition of the excess vacant land and their vesting in the 

State free from all encumbrances. They vest accordingly, but since 

possession thereof has not been taken that the Repeal Act enacts a

*80* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

provision whereunder these lands can be restored to any person provided 

he complies with subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. In the 

case of the lands which are subject matter of a valid exemption order and 

validity of which is not affected even by any court's order to the contrary 

and equally any action taken thereunder is not affected by repeal of the 

Principal Act and is saved though the same may not have been upheld by 

the Court, then, the intent and purpose is not to allow any person holding 

the excess vacant land and which is already vested in the State to escape 

the legal consequences resulting from the order of exemption. If that 

order is passed in order to subserve public interest and to uphold it and to 

relieve undue hardship, then, such an order of exemption which may be 

conditional visits the person with consequences. It is not an absolute right 

or privilege as is claimed. It may be a conditional exemption. It may allow 

the person to use the land for the stated purpose, but that is not relieving 

him or the land from the condition or obligation imposed by Law and 

equally any liability. It is not an advantage or benefit, if at all, which could 

be enjoyed absolutely. It is to fulfill the object or purpose of the user and 

to act in public interest or to avoid undue hardship. The applicability of 

Chapter III being expressly admitted, but seeking to avert the 

consequences of such applicability in exceptional circumstances that the 

request to exempt is considered and granted. The power in that behalf is 

to be exercised sparingly and as an exception. It is not a rule. It is a 

corresponding right of the State and to be exercised to uphold larger 

Public Interest. Thus, it is not a one sided right or privilege. It is not 

relieving the person from the legal consequences of the power to exempt 

and more so, if it is a conditional order. It is to safeguard public interest 

that such power is exercised and in a given case conditionally. If relieving 

somebody on account of his hardship or exempting the vacant land for a

*81* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

specific purpose by holding in abeyance the applicability of provisions of 

ChapterIII is the aim, then, that person cannot claim benefit or 

advantage in himself much less in absolute terms. It is a relief granted to 

relieve him from undue hardship caused by applicability of the provisions 

of ChapterIII. If that power under clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 

20 is exercised subject to such conditions, as can be imposed by the State 

bearing in mind the object and purpose of the Principal Act and if they 

are specified in the order, then, that can hardly be said to be an absolute 

right or privilege. That is a relief together with or appended with an 

obligation and liability. If that is incurred at the time of exercise of power 

of exemption, then, the Government can very well enforce the power to 

exempt by withdrawing the said order and equally without withdrawing it 

enforce the terms and conditions therein despite the repeal. It is for that 

purpose that clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3 is enacted. That is 

also recognition of the legal position that by exempting something from 

the provisions of an Act it is always understood that one is subjected to 

the Act or law. It is applicable but the exemption means one does not 

suffer the legal consequences so long as the exemption is operative. 

64 
The Legislature was aware that the excess vacant land may 

have been exempted bearing in mind its location and the purpose for 

which it is being used or proposed to be used. Clause (a) of subsection 

(1) of Section 20 is the power to exempt the excess vacant land from 

applicability of the provisions of ChapterIII and same is exercised 

because it is necessary and expedient in public interest to do so. 

Therefore, it is futile to urge that a person holding any vacant land in 

excess of ceiling limit derives advantage or benefit when such power is 

exercised by the State qua the excess vacant land or vacant land in excess

*82* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

of the ceiling limit, more so conditionally. Once the nature of the power is 

borne in mind, then, we do not see how repeal of the Principal Act will 

not save, but will affect the exercise of all powers and as we have held 

above which are incidental and ancillary to the main power of granting 

exemption. Thus, the conclusion can be reached and safely that the State 

exempts the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit from applicability of 

ChapterIII of the Principal Act in public interest in terms of clause (a) or 

bearing in mind the undue hardship caused to the person holding it 

exempts it from applicability of the same Chapter and in both events if 

the power is exercised also to pass a conditional order or grant 

conditional exemption, then, the right, if any, created in relation to such 

land in favour of the person holding it is not absolute and it is conditional 

upon fulfillment of the obligations and liabilities attached to it. If these 

conditions are not satisfied, but rather breached and violated, then, the 

State's power to withdraw the exemption survives the repeal of the 

Principal Act in all cases including where the power to exempt under 

Section 20(1) of the Principal Act is exercised post vesting of the lands in 

the State. It will also survive in those cases where the power is exercised 

so as to exempt the excess vacant land in terms of the same provision, but 

in relation to which the unconditional or conditional exemption order is 

still in force and not withdrawn. In either events the State can proceed 

despite repeal of the Principal Act because that power of the State 

survives the repeal. That power survives because despite the repeal the 

State can enforce the exemption orders as the persons holding such lands 

do not derive or get an absolute right or advantage or benefit and that is 

subject to the liabilities and obligations incurred by them. These survive 

the repeal of the Principal Act because had the intent was not to so 

protect or save, the Parliament would not have saved the validity of the

*83* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

exemption order or any action taken thereunder. Any action taken 

thereunder is also valid together with the exemption order more so if the 

action contemplates ensuring compliance with certain terms and 

conditions of the exemption order such as obtaining open spaces and 

amenities for the public, dwelling units so as to subserve larger public 

interest. We cannot and do not intend to exhaust the power of the State 

to enforce its order passed under Section 20(1)(a) and (b) of the 

Principal Act in the light of the Repeal Act. Further, the nature and ambit 

of the conditions may be such that their noncompliance and breach, 

beyond a certain period and intentionally would visit the person with 

either withdrawal of the exemption itself or any other penalty/ damages 

in addition to complying with the terms and obligations. Such obligations, 

liabilities and conditions voluntarily incurred and invited cannot be said 

to be invalid or inoperative. They bind the parties. If the State can call 

upon the person concerned to handover the tenements and units meant 

for either weaker section or its nominees to it or to comply with other 

such obligation and liability by legally permissible modes of compliance, 

then, all such steps and measures survive the repeal and can be initiated 

and taken to their logical end. 

65 
The order of exemption under Section 20(1) remains valid 

would mean that a person continues to hold the vacant land in excess of 

ceiling limit and to which none of the provisions in ChapterIII apply. 

ChapterIII confers some rights in the holder of excess vacant land as well. 

Those also cannot be exercised because the exemption order is valid and 

continues to be so despite the repeal. Nothing is gained by such a 

situation where the excess vacant land being exempted from the 

provisions of ChapterIII so as to permit the usage of the land by the

*84* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

holder or retain it as an exception, but neither the State being able to 

enforce the conditions if any subject to which exemption is granted or to 

withdraw the said exemption. Equally, the effect of the repeal being to 

save the validity of the order granting exemption under Section 20(1) or 

any action taken thereunder, the person in whose favour such exemption 

is granted will not be able to do anything in relation to such vacant land 

which except for the exemption may have vested already in the State by 

virtue of Section 10(3). He then cannot move the State and seek any 

payment for acquisition and vesting. Hence, when the Legislature had in 

mind the saving clause as is carved out by section 3(1)(b) and (c), its 

intent was not to take away any of the powers conferred in the State nor 

exclude applicability of the provisions of ChapterIII of the ULC Act to 

such an extent as would make it impossible for the person to seek 

payment in terms of Sections 11 to 14 or to seek enforcement of such 

conditions which are reciprocal and which are to be performed by both. 

Just as the State would be unable to enforce the conditions on which 

exemption is granted, equally the members of the public or person 

holding the excess vacant land would not be able to enforce the 

conditions which are incorporated therein so as to protect their interest. 

Such situation can never be envisaged by the Parliament. Such situation 

being created would render all the provisions of the Repeal Act 

redundant. The intent as is clear from a harmonious reading of the Repeal 

Act and in the backdrop of the aims and objects of the Principal Act is to 

save the applicability of the provisions contained in ChapterIII to the 

excess vacant lands which are subject matter of exemption under Section 

20(1). Section 3(1)(a) covers a situation where there is no exemption 

order passed under Section 20(1)(a) and (b). That covers the vacant 

lands which are not subject matter of any order of exemption or such

order being not in force on the date of the Repeal Act and in regard to 

which the provisions contained in ChapterIII were always applicable. 

Therefore, if the State does not complete the action in relation to these 

lands by taking possession thereof, their mere vesting and deemed 

acquisition by virtue of Section 10(3) is not saved. Section 3(1)(b) deals 

with a separate and distinct situation and that is applicable to the lands 

which are vacant and in excess of ceiling limit and in relation to which 

the order of exemption under Section 20(1) has been passed. The 

applicability of ChapterIII in relation to such lands is, thus, ruled out and 

so long as the exemption order is in force. If the order of exemption is 

withdrawn the ChapterIII becomes applicable and all consequences 

would follow. 

66 
We must at once note that way back in the year 1990 in the 

decision in the case of M/s Shantistar Builders v/s Narayan Khimalal 

Totame reported in AIR 1990 SC 630, a Three Judge Bench of the 

Honourable Supreme Court had framed the guidelines so as to enable 

construction over the exempted lands covered under Section 20 of the 

Principal Act. That is to ensure compliance with the constitutional 

mandate of shelter and guaranteed vide Article 21 of the Constitution of 

India. In that decision, the Honourable Supreme Court held as under: 

"5. 
Both Subsections 20 and 21 contain provisions that 
if Government or the competent authority, as the case 
may be, is satisfied that any of the conditions subject 
to which exemption was granted is not complied with, 
it shall be competent for it to withdraw the order 
under Section 20 or declare such land to be excess 
land under Section 21 and bring it within the 
mischief of the statute.

Basic needs of man have traditionally been accepted 
to be threefood, clothing and shelter. The right to life 
is guaranteed in any civilized society. That would take 
within its sweep the right to food, the right to 
clothing, the right to decent environment and a 
reasonable accommodation to live in. The difference 
between the need of an animal and a human being 
for shelter has to be kept in view. For the animal it is 
the bare protection of the body; for a human being it 
has to be a suitable accommodation which would 
allow him to grow in every aspect physical, mental 
and intellectual. The Constitution aims at ensuring 
fuller development of every child. That would be 
possible only if the child is in a proper home. It is not 
necessary that every citizen must be ensured of living 
in a well built comfortable house but a reasonable 
home particularly for people in India can even be 
mudbuilt thatched house or a mud built fireproof 
accommodation.

With the increase of population and the shift of the 
rural masses to urban areas over the decades the 
ratio of poor people without houses in the urban

areas has rapidly increased. This is a feature which 
has become more perceptible after independence. 
Apart from the fact that people in search of work 
move to urban agglomerations, availability of 
amenities and living conveniences also attract people 
to move from rural areas to cities. Industrialisation is 
equally responsible for concentration of population 
around industries. These are feature which are 
mainly responsible for increase in the homeless urban 
population. Millions of people today live on the 
pavements of different cities of India and a greater 
number live animal like existence in jhuggis. 
11. 
The Planning Commission took note of this situation 
and was struck by the fact that there was no 
corresponding rise in accommodation with the growth 
of population and the shift of the rural people to the 
cities. The growing realisation of this disparity led to 
the passing of the Act and acquisition of vacant sites 
for purposes of housing. Considerable attention has 
been given in recent years to increasing 
accommodation though whatever has been done is 
not at all adequate. The quick growth of urban 
population overshadows all attempts of increasing 
accommodation. Sections 20 and 21 of the Act vest 
power in the State Governments to exempt vacant 
sites from vesting under the Act for purposes of being 
taken over if housing schemes are undertaken by 
owners of vacant urban lands. Section 21 specifically 
emphasis upon weaker sections of the people. That 
term finds place in Article 46 of the Constitution and 
Section 21 uses the same language. 'Weaker sections' 
have, however, not been defined either in the 
Constitution or in the Act itself. An attempt was made 
in the Constitution Assembly to provide a definition 
but was given up. Attempts have thereafter been 
made from time to time to provide such definition but 
on account of controversies which arise once the 
exercise is undertaken, there has been no success. A 
suggestion for introducing economic criterion for 
explaining the term was made in the approach to the 
Seventh Five Year Plan (19851990) brought out by 
the Planning Commission and approved by the

National Development Council and the Union 
Government. A lot of controversy was raised in 
Parliament and the attempt, was dropped. In the 
absence of a definition perhaps a proper guideline 
could be indicated but no serious attention has been 
devoted to this aspect. 
12. 
Members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled 
Tribes have ordinarily been accepted as belonging to 
the weaker section. Attempt to bring in the test of 
economic means has often been tried but no guideline 
has been evolved. Undoubtedly, apart from the 
members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled 
Tribes, there would be millions of other citizens who 
would also belong to the weaker sections. The 
Constitution maker intended all citizens of India 
belonging to the weaker sections to be benefited when 
Article 46 was incorporated in the Constitution. 
Parliament in adopting the same language in Section 
21 of the Act also intended people of all weaker 
sections to have the advantage. It is, therefore, 
appropriate that the Central Government should 
come forward with an appropriate guideline to 
indicate who would be included within weaker 
sections of the society. 
13. 
In recent years on account of erosion of the value of 
the rupee, rampant prevalence of black money and 
dearth of urban land, the value of such land has gone 
up skyhigh. It has become impossible for any 
member of the weaker sections to have residential 
accommodation anywhere and much less in urban 
areas. Since a reasonable residence is an 
indispensable necessity for fulfilling the Constitutional 
goal in the matter of development of man and should 
be taken as included in 'life' in Article 21, greater 
social control is called for and exemptions granted 
under Sections 20 and 21 should have to be 
appropriately monitored to have the fullest benefit of 
the beneficial legislation. We, therefore, command to 
the Central Government to prescribe appropriate 
guidelines laying down the true scope of the term 
'weaker sections of the society' so that everyone 
charged with administering the statute would find it

convenient to implement the same. 
14. 
Respondents who claim to belong to weaker sections 
of the society maintain that they are entitled to 
allotment of 262 plus 558 flats. It is true that 
initially the claim was for a smaller number but the 
number has gone up when further petitions were filed 
before the High Court. There is, perhaps, some basis 
in the objection of the builders as also the stand taken 
by the State Government before us that the 
respondents' claim should undergo in depth scrutiny. 
We direct that the genuineness of the claim should be 
scrutinised in accordance with the guidelines which 
shall now be indicated but in the event of the claims 
being found tenable, the builders shall have a 
direction to provide accommodation in terms of the 
scheme for those who are found to be acceptable. To 
ensure implementation of this direction the builders 
are called upon not to make any commitment or 
allotments for flats until the claims of the 1420 
applicants are scrutinised and allotment of 
accommodation for such number of persons as are 
found entitled is provided. 
15. 
We shall now proceed to deal with the guidelines. The 
Government of Maharashtra by the Resolution No. 
WLC1090/3422 (D XIII) in the Housing and 
Special Assistance Department have laid down the 
guidelines. We shall refer to the preamble and some of 
the provisions thereof. The preamble indicates: 
"Close and effective monitoring of the 
implementation of weaker sections housing schemes 
sanctioned under Sections 20 and 21 of the Urban 
Land (Ceiling & Regulation) Act, 1976, is one of the 
most important duties of the competent authorities 
who have been entrusted with the task of 
implementing the Urban Land Ceiling Act, 1976, in 
the nine urban agglomerations in Maharashtra, viz. 
Bombay, Pune, Thane, Ulhasnagar, Kolhapur, 
Solapur, Sangli, Nasik and Nagpur. Competent 
authorities are required to ensure that construction of 
flats for the weaker sections of the society on land 
exempted under Sections 20 and 21 is completed 
within the timeframe stipulated in the exemption

order. They are also required to ensure that the terms 
and conditions of the exemption order such as issue of 
advertisements, giving particulars of the schemes, sale 
of fiats at the prices approved by government, sizes of 
flats, noneligibility of persons who already own a 
dwelling unit in the same urban agglomeration to 
purchase a flat from such schemes, handing over of 
land affected by development plan, reservations to the 
planning authority etc. are all complied with. 
Physical implementation of Weaker sections housing 
schemes in Maharashtra is one of the important 
issues on the agenda at the meetings of competent 
authorities convened by the Housing Department 
periodically. General and special instructions 
regarding effective monitoring of implementation of 
the housing schemes are given to competent 
authorities in such meetings. Government of 
Maharashtra have carefully considered the 
importance attaching to close and effective 
monitoring of the implementation of weaker sections 
housing schemes and is now pleased to direct by way 
of codification of earlier instructions on the subject 
that competent authorities should ensure that the 
following instructions are scrupulously complied 
with...." 
16. 
After this preamble, 16 paragraphs in what has been 
named as the Code and a copy of this Code is 
appended to the judgment as annexure for 
convenience indicate the guidelines. 
17. 
We are of the view that allotment shall be on the 
basis of 'one family one flat' and the family shall 
include husband, wife and dependent children. A 
family which has one flat in any urban 
agglomeration within the State shall not be entitled 
to allotment or acquisition by transfer of a flat under 
this Code. 
18. 
Government nominees contemplated under the Code 
must belong to weaker sections of the society and 
shall also be subjected to the rule of one family one 
flat. The number of Government nominees should not 
exceed 5% of the total accommodation available in 
any scheme.

19. 
Every builder shall maintain a register of applicants 
chronologically registering them on the basis of the 
date of receipt of the applications. The register should 
be uptodate and available for inspection by the 
authorities. As and when an application is received by 
the builder an appropriate receipt acknowledging 
acceptance of such application shall be issued to the 
applicant and in such receipt, the number in the 
Application Register shall be clearly indicated. 
Simultaneously, a copy of the application with its 
number shall be sent by the builder to the Committee 
for its record. 
20. 
As a working guideline we direct that a 'means test' 
for identifying 'weaker sections of the society shall be 
adopted and for the present income of the family of 
the applicant must not exceed Rs. 18,000/ (eighteen 
thousand) to come within the meaning of the term to 
qualify for allotment. The applicant shall be called 
upon to satisfy the Committee about the limit of 
income and the present prescription of Rs. 18,000/ 
may be varied from time to time by the State 
Government taking into consideration the fall of the 
value of the rupee, general improvement in the 
income of the people now within the annual income 
limit of Rs. 18,000/ and other relevant factors. It 
shall be open to the State Government to prescribe 
appropriate guideline in the matter of identifying the 
'weaker sections of the society'. 
21. 
'Competent authority' has been defined in Section 
2(9) of the Act. From the Code it appears that he is 
an officer subordinate to the Collector of the District 
so far as the State of Maharashtra is concerned as an 
appeal is contemplated from his orders to the 
Collector. The duties and responsibilities and powers 
vested in the competent authority under the Code are 
wide and considerable. We are of the opinion 
(without in any way casting any aspersion) that it 
would be difficult for the competent authority to 
exercise efficiently and to the satisfaction of everyone 
the duties cast upon him under the Code. In the 
matter of implementation of the scheme and with a 
view to providing satisfactory execution thereof and

fulfilling the laudable purpose stipulated under the 
Act and undertaken by the scheme, it is necessary that 
there should be a committee in respect of the schemes 
in every urban agglomeration for weaker sections 
sanctioned under Sections 20 and 21 of the Act for 
overseeing the implementation of every scheme, 
particularly in the matter of due compliance of the 
conditions under which exemption is granted, timely 
construction of the flats, appropriate advertisement as 
contemplated, registration of the applications in 
response to advertisements in a systematic manner, 
appropriate allotment of flats including priorities on 
the basis of registration, ensuring legitimate charges 
only being demanded and monitoring strict 
compliance to avoid underhand dealing or any unjust 
treatment. It should be handled by the competent 
authority in a committee consisting of himself, a 
judicial officer not below the rank of an Additional 
District Judge and a Government engineer not below 
the rank of Superintending Engineer. In the 
committee, the judicial officer shall function as the 
Chairman. 
22. 
This Committee shall have powers to scrutinise all 
relevant documents and give appropriate directions to 
the builders and applicants keeping the requirements 
of the schemes and the Code in view. To the extent we 
have indicated the powers conferred on the competent 
authority in terms of the State Code shall stand 
vested in the committee. The Bombay High Court 
shall take steps to ensure that in respect of schemes in 
every agglomeration undertaken and which the State 
Government may in future undertake, the services of 
an efficient judicial officer not below the rank of an 
Additional District Judge on such terms as the State 
Government and the High Court consider appropriate 
shall be made available for discharging the duties 
indicated and/or as may be provided. We would like 
to impress upon every Committee that fulfilment of 
the laudable purpose of the providing a home to the 
poor homeless depends upon its commitment to the 
goal and every effort should be made by it to ensure 
that the builder does not succeed in frustrating the

purpose. The State Government shall suitably modify 
its Code in the light of this judgment and recirculate 
the same to all concerned within four weeks from 
today." 

67 
A further order in terms of the guidelines formulated above 

has been passed by the Honourable Supreme Court in the year 1995 and 

to be precise on 17.11.1995. That order is reported in (1996) 1 SCC 233 

(Shantistar Builders v/s Narayan Khimalal Totame). Therefore, the Scheme 

formulated by the Honourable Supreme Court is in place. This order reads 

thus: 

"1. 
This Court by its judgment in Shantistar Builders v. 
Narayan Khimalal Totame, while disposing of the 
matter directed in paragraphs 21 and 22 the State 
Government to constitute a committee for monitoring 
allotment of the houses to the weaker sections, as per 
the scheme sanctioned while exempting the Urban 
land under Section 21 of the Urban Land (Ceiling & 
Regulation) Act, 1976 (for short "the Act"). One of the 
members of the committee suggested was Additional 
District Judge. The Bombay High Court was requested 
to ensure that an Additional District Judge be made 
available for enforcing the schemes in every 
agglomeration, so that the Committee constituted by 
the State Government would effectively implement the 
schemes. This Court also impressed upon every 
Committee to ensure fulfilment of the laudable 
purpose of providing a home to the poor homeless to 
effectuate its commitment to the constitutional goal 
and that every effort should be made by it to ensure 
that the builder does not succeed in frustrating the 
purpose. The State Government should suitably 
modify its scheme in the light of the judgment 
rendered in Shantistar Builders case and recirculate 
the same to all concerned within four weeks from the 
date of the judgment. 
2. 
The State had filed an affidavit on March 30, 1990,

seeking certain modification or clarifications of the 
order. One of the modifications sought was that under 
the Act, the Deputy Commissioner is the competent 
authority and an appeal was provided under the Act, 
except for Bombay and Pune, to the Additional 
Commissioner. For Pune and Bombay, the 
Commissioner would deal with the same. If the 
Additional District Judge was to supervise the 
functioning of the allotment as per the scheme 
sanctioned under Section 21 of the Act, it would be 
inconvenient to the appellate authority to consider the 
scheme under the Act. 
3. 
The entire thinking of the Government is wholly 
misconceived. The Committee had nothing to do with 
the provisions of the Urban Ceiling Act. After the 
exemption under Section 20 or 21 is granted, the 
Committee is required to implement the scheme in 
terms of the sanction made by the Government for 
construction of buildings by the builders and 
allotment to weaker section people. This Court 
intended to ensure that the builders would abide by 
the guidelines laid down by this Court in the light of 
the judgment. The Committee would supervise the 
allotment of the houses to the homeless weaker 
section people in the light of the guidelines laid down 
therein. The State Government was also directed to 
recirculate the revised schemes in the light of the 
above judgment. In the circumstances, the question of 
the Commissioner sitting in an appeal over the 
working of the Committee does not arise. 
4. 
It is submitted that the taking away of the 
discretionary power of the Government in allotment 
of the houses is not justified. We do not propose to 
modify our earlier direction. The Government is 
directed to comply with the Constitution of the 
Committee within 30 days from the date of the receipt 
of this order, since the same has already been delayed 
for more than five years from the date of the 
judgment constituting the committee."

68 
We have not been shown anything which would counter to 

this, but the attempt is to orally demonstrate that all this does not survive 

the repeal. 

69 
We have already referred to as to how the schemes devised 

for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the exemption orders may 

be at various stages of implementation. There are several conditions and 

which may have been varied from time to time so as to achieve the object 

of exemption. Since the exemption under clause (a) of subsection (1) of 

Section 20 of the Principal Act is to be granted bearing in mind the 

location of land, the purpose for which it is being used or proposed to be 

used and such other relevant factors so also it is necessary and expedient 

in public interest that the Government devised several schemes and 

embodied in the circulars and Government Resolutions. Some of the 

clauses in such schemes presented difficulties and which were resolved by 

the Honourable Supreme Court. Now the schemes have become part of 

the orders of the Honourable Supreme Court. These are not orders to the 

contrary as envisaged by Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act rather they are 

in consonance with the power to exempt and carry it further. If such 

orders are in place and the scheme is under various stages of 

implementation, then, the repeal of the Principal Act will not in any 

manner prevent the Government from enforcing the conditions and 

ensuring compliance with the obligations undertaken by the Developers 

and Builders. 

70 
The arguments of the Petitioners to the contrary do not take 

note of any of the above aspects. Even if one proceeds on the footing that 

the intent of the Parliament was not to save several other provisions, but 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014

*98* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

that does not mean that what is saved by the Repeal Act or what will not 

be affected by repeal of the Principal Act is exhaustive. Mr.Naphade places 

reliance upon Sections 21 and 22 of the Principal Act and submits that 

these provisions have not been saved, but his argument overlooks the fact 

that Section 21 is a provision whereunder a person holding the vacant 

land in excess of ceiling limit comes forward and declares in the 

prescribed manner before the competent authority that such land is to be 

utilized for construction of dwelling units of the size specified therein and 

for accommodation of weaker sections of the society in accordance with 

the scheme approved by such authority and then that land on inquiry is 

not to be treated as excess for the purpose of the Chapter. That is 

permission to such holder to continue to hold such land for the purpose 

aforesaid. That is also conditional upon interalia time to complete the 

construction. However, merely because this provision is not inserted in 

the Repeal Act ipsofacto will not mean that subsection (2) of Section 20 

of the Principal Act is not saved. Section 20 is a power to exempt and 

while exercising that power the Government cannot declare that the 

excess vacant land will not be treated as excess. Rather the foundation on 

which the power to exempt is exercised is that the land is vacant and in 

excess of the ceiling limit and the holder is aware and admits this 

position. Therefore, Sections 20 and 21 of the Principal Act operate in 

separate fields. Similar is the case with Section 22 where the vacant land 

is allowed to be retained under certain circumstances. Therefore, if 

retention for specified purpose as contemplated by Section 22(1) is where 

there is a building on the land held by the holder of the vacant land, but 

that building is demolished by him or demolished or destroyed solely due 

to natural causes and beyond the control of human agency and as a 

consequence thereof, then, in the circumstances set out in subsection (1)

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*99* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

of Section 22 the vacant land can be retained. Once again this provision 

cannot be equated with Section 20 and would operate in a different field. 

We need not repeat that the purpose to exempt the excess vacant land is 

for the reason that the land is located in a peculiar place or location and 

that the purpose for which it is being or is proposed to be used and such 

other relevant factors may make it necessary or expedient in public 

interest that the Government can exercise its discretionary power to 

exempt and not otherwise. One of the user or proposed user could be 

construction of tenements for the weaker or deprived sections of the 

society or handing over of constructed tenements or units to the 

Government nominees so as to enable the Government to mitigate 

hardship caused to such nominees. The Totame's case (supra) dealt with 

such nominees as well. Therefore, the laudable object and purpose being 

borne in mind it is apparent that in exceptional cases and in public 

interest the power to exempt is exercised and not as a matter of course. 

71 
The arguments of the Petitioners' counsel overlook the 

fundamental aspect that the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit has to 

be reckoned with effect from the date of commencement of the Act and as 

far as the State of Maharashtra is concerned that is 17.02.1976. In a Full 

Bench decision of this Court reported in AIR 1984 Bombay 122 

Prabhakar Narhar Pawar v/s State of Maharashtra, the Full Bench held as 

under: 

"11. There is no dispute that the vacant land has to be 
determined with reference to the date of 
commencement of the Act and the relevant date is 
17th February, 1976. So far as Subclause (I) is 
concerned, the question as to whether construction of 
a building is or is not permissible according to the 
building Regulations has to be determined with 
reference to 17th February, 1976. We have already

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

referred to the definitions of the words "building 
Regulations", which mean Regulations contained in 
the master plan, and the meaning of the expression 
"master plan" is also given in the Act itself in S. 2(h) 
and it means, in relation to an area within an urban 
agglomeration or any part thereof, the plan prepared 
under any law for the time being in force or in 
pursuance of an order made by the State Government 
for the development of such area or part thereof and 
providing for the stages by which such development 
shall be carried out. Now, when a question arises as to 
whether construction of a building is not permissible 
under the building Regulations in force, it is possible 
that there may be an absolute ban or prohibition 
under the relevant master plan where under no 
circumstances construction of building is possible on a 
given piece of land. Such piece of land may have been 
reserved for a purpose and on such reservation 
construction of a building would not at all be 
permissible. But, when we come to an instance like 
the present one in which there is an open plot of land 
which is admittedly a house site on which a building 
could be constructed, it is difficult to see how any part 
of the land can be excluded under Subclause. (I) of S. 
2(q) on hypothetical considerations. Section 3 of the 
Act and the procedural provisions thereof which are 
intended to implement the provisions of the said 
section contemplate the determination of the quantum 
of vacant land on facts as they exist on the date of 
commencement of the Act. Therefore, in a given case 
where the owners of a land claims that certain land 
which is owned by him should be excluded on the 
ground that construction of a building is not 
permissible under the building Regulations in force, it 
is obvious that he will have to show that the building 
regulations are attracted in his case. For a person, 
who, on the commencement date, never even intended 
to construct any building on his land or for a person 
who has not even submitted a plan for construction of 
any building, the relevant building Regulations are 
wholly irrelevant and he is not affected by the 
building Regulations. It appears to us that when sub

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

clause (I) refers to land on which construction of a 
building is not permissible under the building 
Regulations, it was contemplated that on the date of 
commencement of the Act, that is, 17th February, 
1976, the owner intended to construct a building on 
the plot in question and the plan of the building was 
either already sanctioned or he had submitted the 
plan for sanction. Where a building plan is already 
sanctioned and such sanctioned plan is operative on 
17th February, 1976 or a plan has already been 
submitted for sanction, it could be ascertained with 
certainty as to how much land could be identified as 
land on which construction of a building is not 
possible. Subclause (I) of S. 2(q) does not, in our 
view, contemplate a general exclusion of land from the 
purview of the Act to the extent of twothirds or one 
half or whatever may be the extent of land on which 
no building can be constructed under the relevant 
building Regulations in force in the area under 
consideration irrespective of whether a building is 
proposed to be constructed or not on the date of 
commencement of the Act. …........" 

72 
This decision in Prabhakar Pawar's case (supra) has been 

specifically approved by the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of 

State of Gujarat v/s Parshottamdas Ramdas Patel reported in AIR 1988 SC 

220. The arguments of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 

Petitioners in this case overlook the fact that when there is ceiling placed 

on holding of vacant lands and such lands which are vacant, but in excess 

of ceiling limit vest in the State, then, it would be futile to urge that the 

exemption confers an absolute right or privilege. If the exemption is a 

privilege as is held in the case of Southern Petrochemical Industries 

Company Limited v/s Electricity Inspector and E.T.I.O. reported in AIR 

2007 SC 1984 and it is further held by the Honourable Supreme Court 

that the right of exemption with a valid notification gives the right to

approve the rates, it is vested right and the word "privilege" has wider 

meaning, then, the right is, therefore, protected even after repeal of the 

Principal Act. It goes without saying that if such right is conditional the 

conditions attached are not wiped out or destroyed if the right or 

privilege is saved. In this regard, the Honourable Supreme Court holds 

that when such is the nature of the claim, then, the Court is obliged to 

consider as to whether the intention of the Legislature is to the contrary 

meaning thereby there is a different intention than what is spelled out by 

Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. In that regard this is what the 

Honourable Supreme Court has held: 

"108. We are also unable to agree with Mr. Andhyarujina 
that exemption from tax is a mere concession 
defeasible by Government and does not confer any 
accrued right to the recipient. Right of exemption 
with a valid notification issued gives rise to an 
accrued right. It is a vested right. Such right had been 
granted to them permanently. 'Permanence' would 
mean unless altered by statute. 
109. Thus, when a right is accrued or vested, the same can 
be taken away only by reason of a statute and not 
otherwise. Thus, a notification which was duly issued 
would continue to govern unless the same is repealed. 
110. Mr.Andhyarujina, however, would submit that 
reference to the words "anything duly done" should be 
given a restrictive meaning. He referred to "Statutory 
Interpretation A Code" by F.A.R. Bennion, Third 
Edition, page 229, wherein it was stated: 
"Paragraph 
(ii) 
This 
derives 
from 
Interpretation Act 1978 Section 16(1)(b). The 
reference to 'anything duly done' avoids the need for 
procedural matters, such as the giving of notices, to 
be done over again. 
Example 89.3 The Interpretation Act 1978 
Section preserved the effect of a noise nuisance notice 
served under the Control of Pollution Act, 1974, 
Section 58(1) before its repeal and replacement by 
the Environmental Protection Act, 1990, Sections 162

and 164(2) and Schedule 16 Pt. III." 
111. The treatment of the law, in our opinion, is not 
exhaustive as different consequences are required to 
be taken into consideration and applied having 
regard to the nature of the statutory provision. 
112. Mr.Andhyarujina also relied upon Maxwell on the 
Interpretation of Statutes, 12th edition, page 18, 
wherein it was stated: 
"When an Act is repealed, any delegated 
legislation made under the Act falls to the ground 
with the statute unless it is expressly preserved. Where 
the subordinate legislation is continued in force, 
however, the general rule is that its scope and 
construction are determined according to the repealed 
Act under which it was made." 
113. The statement of law therein does not militate against 
our findings aforementioned. Construction would 
vary from statute to statute. 
114. It is profitable to notice at this stage a decision of this 
Court in M/s. Universal Imports Agency (supra). In 
that case under the IndoFrench Agreement entered 
into by and between the two nations on 1st 
November, 1954, the entire Administration of French 
Settlement vested in the Government of India. The 
territory of Pondicherry, thus, became a free port 
without any restriction in case of most imports. 
However, by reason of a notification dated 30th 
October, 1954, the importers in Pondicherry were 
required to obtain validation of licences held by them 
to import goods as petitioners thereof did not have 
any merchandise imported by them stood confiscated. 
115. Clause 6 of the Agreement reads, thus: 
"Unless otherwise specifically provided in the 
Schedule, all laws in force in the French 
Establishments 
immediately 
before 
the 
commencement of the Order, which correspond to 
enactments specified in the Schedule, shall cease to 
have effect, save as respect things done or omitted to 
be done before such commencement." 
116. Analyzing the said provision, this Court held: 
"...The words things done in para 6 must be 
reasonably interpreted and, if so interpreted, they can 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*104* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

mean not only things done but also the legal 
consequences flowing therefrom. If the interpretation 
suggested by the learned Counsel for the respondents 
be accepted, the saving clause would become 
unnecessary. If what it saves is only the executed 
contracts i.e. the contracts whereunder the goods have 
been imported and received by the buyer before the 
merger, no further protection is necessary as 
ordinarily no question of enforcement of the contracts 
under the preexisting law would arise. The 
phraseology used is not an innovation but is copied 
from other statutory clauses. Section 6 of the General 
clauses Act (10 of 1897) says that unless a different 
intention appears, the repeal of an Act shall not affect 
anything duly done or suffered thereunder...." 
117. Thus, a liberal and extensive construction was given 
by this Court. 
118. To the same effect is also a decision of this Court in 
Shri Ram Prasad (supra) wherein power to make rule 
was held to be a thing done within the meaning of 
Article 357(2) of the Constitution of India. 
119. In Harnek Singh (supra), this Court held: 
"16. The words anything duly done or suffered 
thereunder used in Clause (b) of Section 6 are often 
used by the legislature in saving clause which is 
intended to provide that unless a different intention 
appears, the repeal of an Act would not affect 
anything duly done or suffered thereunder. This Court 
in Hasan Nurani Malak v. S.M. Ismail, Asstt. Charity 
Commr., Nagpur has held that the object of such a 
saving clause is to save what has been previously done 
under the statute repealed. The result of such a saving 
clause is that the preexisting law continues to govern 
the things done before a particular date from which 
the repeal of such a preexisting law takes effect. In 
Universal Imports Agency v. Chief Controller of 
Imports and Exports this Court while construing the 
words things done held that a proper interpretation 
of the expression things done was comprehensive 
enough to take in not only the things done but also 
the effect of the legal consequence flowing therefrom." 
120. Furthermore, exemption from payment of tax in

*105* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

favour of the appellants herein would also constitute 
a right or privilege. The expression "privilege" has a 
wider meaning than right. A right may be a vested 
right or an accrued right or an acquired right. Nature 
of such a right would depend upon and also vary 
from statute to statute. It has been so held by this 
Court, while construing Section 6 of the General 
Clauses Act, in M/s Gurcharan Singh Baldev Singh v. 
Yashwant Singh and Ors. [(1992) 1 SCC 428] in the 
following terms: 
"...The objective of the provision is to ensure 
protection of any right or privilege acquired under the 
repealed Act. The only exception to it is legislative 
intention to the contrary. That is, the repealing Act 
may expressly provide or it may impliedly provide 
against continuance of such right, obligation or 
liability...."" 

73 
Hence, Section 20(1) of the Principal Act and Section 3(1)(b) 

and (c) of the Repeal Act have to be read together and harmoneously. 

That would also save and protect the right of person to move under 

Sections 11 to 14 of the Principal Act. That is why there is a proviso 

which has been inserted in Section 4 of the Repeal Act. Equally, by clause 

(c) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act the intent was also to 

allow the State Government to retain the money/sum paid to it as 

condition for granting exemption under Section 20(1). All this shows that 

the excess vacant land continues to be subject to the Principal Act and its 

repeal does not affect applicability of the provisions of ChapterIII albeit 

to a limited extent with which we are concerned. The intent is not to 

allow recourse to Sections 21 and 22 of the Principal Act and that is 

clearly affected by the repeal of the Principal Act. However, a saving 

clause enacted in the Repeal Act and construed as above does not 

manifest an intent to destroy all rights and obligations. Therefore, Section

*106* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 can be taken assistance of. 

74 
While construing a repeal clause or Repeal Act or saving 

clause therein the application of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act 

would have to be considered in the light of the afore laid down principles. 

Therefore, if having found that when the order of exemption is passed, it 

is in force and conditional, then, the right or privilege created thereunder 

cannot partake a different character. It would then fall squarely within 

Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and in the present case we have not 

found a contrary intention. 

75 
We find that reliance placed by the learned Advocate General 

on the decision in the case of Bansidhar (supra) is apposite. There, the 

Honourable Supreme Court held that a saving provision in the repealing 

statute is not exhaustive of the rights and obligations so saved and they 

survive the repeal. 

76 
In Bansidhar's case (supra) the contentions of the Appellants 

before the Supreme Court were regarding the legality of certain 

proceedings for fixation of ceiling on agricultural holdings initiated and 

continued under the provisions of Chapter IIIB of the Rajasthan Tenancy 

Act, 1955. That Act particularly Section 5(6A) and Chapter IIIB 

thereunder was repealed by the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on 

Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973 (11 of 1973). The question was whether 

the proceedings under the 1955 Act survive the repeal and reenactment 

of the same in 1973. In that regard the Honourable Supreme Court held 

as under: 

"3. 
Chapter IIIB, pertaining to imposition of ceiling on 
agricultural holdings, in the State of Rajasthan, was

introduced into the '1955 Act' by the Rajasthan 
Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 1960. As a sequential 
necessity Section was amended by the introduction in 
it of Clause (6A) which defined "ceilingarea". The 
notifieddate, as originally fixed, was 1.4.1965; but 
owing to the uncertainties imparted to the 
implementation of the law by the challenged made to 
the provisions of Chapter IIIB before the High Court 
and the interimorders of the High Court staying the 
operation of the law, Government had had to re 
notify 1.4.1966 as the fresh notifieddate, after the 
challenge to the validity of Chapter IIIB had been 
repelled by the High Court. 
4. 
By the time, the '1973 Act' was brought into force 
disputes touching the determination of the ceiling 
areas in 33, 471 cases had come to be decided in 
accordance with the provisions of Chapter IIIB of the 
earlier '1955 Act'. After the '1973 Act' came into force 
on 1.1.1973, some 8,494 cases for the determination 
of 'ceilingareas' under IIIB of the '1955 Act. came to 
be initiated and were sought to be continued under 
said Chapter IIIB of the repealed '1955 Act' on the 
view that the repeal of Chapter IIIB of the 1955 Act 
by the '1973 Act' did not affect the rights accrued and 
liabilities incurred under the old law. Appellants' 
principal contention is that after the coming into 
force of the 1973 Act which, by its 40th Section, 
repealed Chapter IIIB of the '1955 Act', recourse 
could not be had to the repealedlaw for purposes of 
commencement, conduct and conclusion of any 
proceedings for fixation of ceiling as prescribed under 
the old law. This contention has been repelled by the 
full bench of the High Court in the judgment under 
appeal. The correctness of view of the full bench arises 
for consideration in these appeals. 
5. 
The factual antecedents in which the controversy 
arose before the High Court may be illustrated by the 
facts of one of the appeals. In CA 1003 [N] of 1977, 
the appellants' claim to have entered into possession 
and cultivation of certain parcels of land pursuant to 
alleged agreements to sell dated 28.4.1957 said to 
have been executed in their favour by the then land

holder, a certain Sri Had Singh. The sale deeds were 
passed only on 22,8.1966, after the notified date. 
Proceedings for the fixation of ceiling area in the 
hands of Sri Hari Singh were commenced under the 
Repealed Chapter IIIB of the '1955 Act'. Appellants' 
purchases were held to be hit by Section DD of the 
said Chapter IIIB, which prescribed certain 
residential qualifications, which appellants did not 
possess, for the eligibility for recognition of such 
transfers. Appellants' contention is that if the new law 
had been applied to the case of the vendor, the 
transfers in their favour would have been held valid 
and that 'invoking of Chapter IIIB of the repealed 
law was impermissible. Apart from the facts of 
individual cases and their particularities the basic 
question is one of construction whether the 
provisions of the old law are saved and survive to 
govern pending cases. 
6. 
We have heard Sri A.K. Sen, Sri Tarkunde and Sri 
Shanti Shushan, learned Senior Advocates for the 
appellants and Sri Lodha, learned Senior Advocate 
for the State of Rajasthan and its authorities. The 
appellants' principal contentionwhich we perceive as 
one of construction of statutesis that the later law 
made manifest, expressly and by necessary 
implication, an intention inconsistent with the 
continuance of the rights and obligations under the 
repealed law and that, accordingly after 1.1.1973, 
the date of coming into force of the '1973 Act', no 
proceedings under the old law could be initiated or 
continued. 
7. 
The points that fall for consideration in these appeals 
are whether: 
(a) the scheme contemplated by and the 
different criteria and standards for the determination 
of "ceilingarea" envisaged in the '1973 Act' and, in 
particular, having regard to the limited scope of the 
savingprovision of Section thereof which, quite 
significantly, omits to invoke and attract Section of 
the Rajasthan General Clauses Act 1955 to the Repeal 
of Section and Chapter IIIB of the '1955 Act' must be 
construed and held to manifest an intention contrary

to and inconsistent with the keeping alive or saving of 
the repealed law so as to be invoked in relation to 
and applied for the pending cases which had not been 
concluded under the old law before the repeal; and 
(b) that, at all events even if Section of the 
Rajasthan General Clauses Act 1955 was attracted 
and the old law was saved for the purpose, provisions 
of the oldlaw could not be invoked as no right had 
been "accrued" in favour of the State in relation to the 
surplus area determinable under the old law nor any 
liability "incurred" by the landholders under the old 
law so as to support the initiation of the proceedings 
for fixation of 'Ceilingarea' under the oldlaw after 
its repeal. 

Re : Contention (a) 
8. 
In order that this contention, which is presented with 
some perspicuity, is apprehended in its proper 
prospective a conspectus of the essential provisions of 
the earlier law and later law pertaining to 
prescription of ceiling on agricultural holdings is 
necessary. 
9. 
In 1955, The Rajasthan Tenancy Act 1955 was 
enacted. By the Rajasthan Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 
for the first time, provisions in Chapter IIIB 
prescribing a ceilings on holdings of agricultural 
lands got introduced into the '1955 Act', This 
amending Act of 1960 received Presidential assent on 
12th March 1960. The Chapter IIIB was, by an 
appropriate notification, brought into force with 
effect from 15th December, 1963. The notifieddate, 
under the '1955 Act' as stated earlier, was 1.4.1966. 
10. 
Section (6A) of the '1955 Act' defined 'Ceilingarea': 
"Ceiling area" in relation to land held 
anywhere throughout the State by a person in any 
capacity whatsoever shall mean the maximum area of 
land that may be fixed as ceiling area under Section C 
in relation to such person: 
11. 
Section B in Chapter IIIB provided: 
30B. DefinitionsFor the purposes of this 
Chapter 
(a) "family" shall mean a family consisting of a

husband and wife their children and grandchildren 
being dependent on them and the widowed mother of 
the husband so dependent and 
(b) "person" in the case of an individual, shall 
include the family of such individual. 

Section 30C providing for the extent of ceiling area 
said: 
30C. Extent of ceiling areaThe ceiling area for 
a family consisting of five or less than five members 
shall be thirty standard acres of land : 
Provided that, where the members of a family 
exceed five, the ceiling area in relation thereto shall 
be increased for each additional member by five 
standard acres, so however that it does not exceed 
sixty standard acres of land. 
ExplanationA 'standard acre' shall mean the 
area of land which, with reference to its productive 
capacity, situation, soil classification and other 
prescribed particulars is found in the prescribed 
manner to be likely to yield ten maunds of wheat 
yearly ; and in case of land not capable of producing 
wheat, the other likely produce thereof shall, for the 
purpose of calculating a standard acre, be determined 
according to the prescribed scale so as to be 
equivalent in terms of money value to ten maunds of 
wheat: 
Provided that, in determining a ceiling area in 
terms of standard acres the money value of the 
produce of wellirrigated (chahi) land shall be taken 
is being equivalent to the money value of the produce 
of an equal area of unirrigated (barani) land. 

In exercise of the Rule making powers under the 
'1955 Act', the State Government framed and 
promulgated. The Rajasthan Tenancy (Fixation of 
Ceiling of Land) Government Rules, 1963, which 
came into force on and with effect from 15.12.1963. 
Rule 9 required that in order to enable the Sub 
Divisional Officer to determine the ceiling area 
applicable to every person under Section C of the Act 
and to enforce the provision of Sections E, every land

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

holder and tenant in possession of lands, in excess of 
the ceiling area applicable to him, shall file a 
declaration within six months from the notifieddate. 
The law fixed 30 standard acres as the ceiling area. 
Thereafter, successive amendments were made to 
Chapter IIIB of the '1955 Act' which, while 
maintaining the ceiling at 30 standard acres, 
however, recognised certain transfers effected after 
1958, which were not originally so recognised in 
fixing the ceiling. Again (by an amendment) of the 
year 1970, Section was deleted. The 1955 Act itself 
came to be included in the IX Schedule to the 
Constitution by a Parliamentary law. The challenge to 
said inclusion was repelled by this Court. 

12. 
On 1.1.1973, the Governor of the State of Rajasthan 
promulgated The Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on 
Agricultural Holdings Ordinance, 1973 under Article 
213 of the Constitution of India. The Ordinance 
repealed the corresponding provisions relating to 
ceiling on agricultural holdings contained in Section 
and Chapter IIIB of the '1955 Act' except to the 
extent indicated in the Second Proviso to Section and 
Section of the said Ordinance. The Ordinance brought 
in to existence a new concept of and standards for 
the" ceilingarea". Certain transfers made by the land 
holders even during the operation of the old law were 
recognised as valid transfers for purposes of 
computation of ceiling area under the new 
dispensation brought about by the Ordinance. This 
Ordinance was replaced by the 1973 Act which was 
made operative retrospectively from 1.1.1973 being 
the date of promulgation of the Ordinance. Section of 
the '1973 Act' repealed as did the predecessor 
Ordinance, both the old law in Chapter IIIB of the 
'1955 Act' and the earlier Ordinance for which it 
substituted. 
13. 
Section Section 4(1), Second Proviso and Section of 
the 1973 Act require particular notice. 
14. 
Section 3 provides : 
"3. Act to override other laws, contracts, etc. 
The provisions of this Act shall have effect

notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in 
any other law for the time being in force, on any 
custom, usage or contract or decree or order of a 
court or other authority. 
15. 
The Second Proviso to the Explanation appended to 
Section 4(1) of the Act says: 
Provided further that if the ceiling area 
applicable to any person or family in accordance with 
this section exceeds the ceiling area applicable to such 
person or family according to the provisions of law 
repealed by Section in that case the ceiling area 
applicable to such person or family will be the same 
as was under the provisions of the said repealed law. 
16. 
Section 40 provides ; 
40. Repeal and savings(1) Except as provided 
in second proviso to Subsection (1) of Section and in 
Subsection (2) of Section of this Act, the provisions 
of Clause (6A) of Section and Chapter IIIB of the 
Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 (Rajasthan Act 3 of 
1955) are hereby repealed except in the Rajasthan 
Canal Project area wherein such provisions shall 
stand repealed on the date on which this Act comes 
into force in that area. 
(2) The Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on 
Agricultural Holdings Ordinance, 1973 Rajasthan 
(OrdinanceI of 1973) is hereby repealed. 
(3) Notwithstanding the repeal of the said 
Ordinance under Subsection (2), anything done or 
any action taken or any rules made under the said 
Ordinance shall be deemed to have been done taken 
or made under this Act and section of the Rajasthan 
General Clauses Act, 1955 (Rajasthan Act 8 of 1955) 
shall apply to such repeal and reenactment. 
17. 
Section contains a statutory declaration that the 'Act' 
is for giving effect to the directive principles of State 
policy towards securing the principles specified in 
Article 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution of India. 
18. 
Appellants' learned Counsel contend that when there 
is a repeal of a statute followed by a reenactment of 
a new law on the same subject with or without 
modifications Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is 
not attracted and the question as to the extent to

*113* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

which the repealed law is saved would be dependent 
upon the express provisions of the later statute or 
what must be held to be its necessary and compelling 
implications. It was urged that where the repeal is 
accompanied by a afresh Legislation on the same 
subject, the new law alone will determine if, and how 
far the old law is saved and that in the absence of an 
express appeal to Section 6 of the Genera Clauses Act 
or of express provisions similar effect in the new law 
itself, the provisions of the old law must be held to 
have been effaced except whatever had been done, or 
having effect as if done. This argument has the 
familiar ring of what Sulaiman, CJ. had said on the 
matter in B.Bansgopal v. Emperor. But, it must now 
be taken to be settled that the mere absence of an 
express reference to Section 6 of the General Clauses 
Act is not conclusive, unless such omission to invoke 
Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is attended with 
the circumstance that the provisions of the newlaw 
evince and make manifest an intention contrary to 
what would, otherwise, follow by the operation of 
Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, the incidents 
and consequences of Section 6 would follow. 
19. 
Appellants' learned Counsel submitted that the 
legislation in question pertaining, as it did, to the 
topic of agrarian reform was attendant with the 
difficulties naturally besetting a task so inextricably 
intermixed with complex and diverse and, indeed, 
often conflicting socioeconomic interests had to go 
through stages of empirical evolution and that having 
regard to the widediversity of policyoptions manifest 
between the earlier and the later legislations, the 
conclusion becomes inescapable that the later 
legislation, made manifest an intention inconsistent 
with and contrary to the continuance of the rights 
and obligations under the repealed law. It was agreed 
that with the experience gained in the 
implementation of the policy of agrarian reforms 
embodied in the repealed law, the new policy 
considerations -reflected in the new and basically 
different thinking on some of the vital components of 
the newpolicy -were evolved and incorporated in the

new law, so much so that the repealed and repealing 
laws represented two entirely different systems and 
approaches to the policy of agrarian reforms and the 
two systems, with their marked differences on 
basically and essential criteria underlying their 
policies, could not coexist. it was urged that the 
statement of objects and reasons appended to the 
1973 Bill recognised that the legislative policy and 
technique underlying the old law were ineffective in 
removing the great disparity that persisted in the 
holdings of agricultural lands or in diluting the 
concentration of agricultural wealth in the hands of a 
few and recognised the necessity "to reduce such 
disparity and to refix the ceiling area on the 
agricultural holdings so that agricultural land may be 
available for distribution to land less persons". It was 
pointed out that material criteria relevant to the 
effectuation of the newpolicy made manifest an 
intention contrary to the survival of the policy under 
the old law. The wide changes in the policy of the 
later law which reflected a new and basically different 
approach to the matter, included [i] a fundamental 
rethinking on the concept of the "ceilingarea" by 
reducing the 30 standard acres prescribed in the old 
law to 18 standard acres; [ii] the redefinition of the 
very concept of 'family' and 'separate unit'; [iii] the 
point of time with reference to which the composition 
and strength of the family would require to be 
ascertained; [vi] a rethinking, and a fresh policy as 
to the recognition of transfers made by landholders 
including even those transfers made during the period 
of operation of the old law; [v] the point of time of 
the vesting of the surplus land in Government; [vi] 
the redefining of the principles and priorities guiding 
the distribution of the surplus land to landless 
persons; and [vii] the amount to be paid to the land 
holders for the excess land vesting in the State under 
the new law. 
20. 
It was submitted that the two laws -the old and the 
new -envisaged two totally different sets of values 
and policies and were so disparate in their context 
and effect as to yield the inevitable inference that the

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

policy and the scheme of the later law, by reason 
alone of the peculiarities and distinction of its 
prescriptions, should be held to manifest an intention 
contrary to the saving of the old law even respecting 
pending cases. The ceiling laws, it was submitted, 
envisage and provide an integrated and inter 
connected set of provisions and the marked 
distinctions in the vital provisions in the two sets of 
laws rendered the continued applicability of the old 
law to any case, not already finally concluded 
thereunder, as impermissible in law as unreasonable 
in its consequences if permitted. It was urged that 
Section of the 1973 Act was a clinching indicator in 
this behalf when it provided that the provisions of the 
later law "shall have effect notwithstanding anything 
inconsistent contained in any other law for the time 
being in force, or any custom, usage, or contract or 
decree or order of a Court or other authority" 
(underlining supplied) and that the old Act, even if it 
was, otherwise, held to be in force in relation to 
pending cases, was clearly overborne by Section of 
the new law. 
21. 
When there is a repeal of a statute accompanied by 
reenactment of a law on the same subject, the 
provisions of the new enactment would have to be 
looked into not for the purpose of ascertaining 
whether the consequences envisaged by Section 6 of 
the General Clauses Act ensued or not -Section 6 
would indeed be attracted unless the new legislation 
manifests a contrary intention but only for the 
purpose of determining whether the provisions in the 
new statute indicate a different intention. Referring to 
the way in which such incompatibility with the 
preservation of old rights and liabilities is to be 
ascertained this Court in State of Punjab v. Mohar 
Singh said: 
...Such incompatibility would have to be 
ascertained from a consideration of all the relevant 
provisions of the new Law and the mere absence of a 
saving clause is by itself not material. The provisions 
of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act will apply to a 
case of repeal even if there is simultaneous enactment

unless a contrary intention can be gathered from the 
new enactment. Of course, the consequences laid 
down in Section 6 of the Act will apply only when a 
statute or regulation having the force of a statute is 
actually repealed. 
22. 
Addressing itself to the question whether, having 
regard to the particular provisions of the 1973 Act, 
the inference that the new law manifests such 
contrary intention could justifiably be drawn, the 
High Court observed: 
We have, therefore, to examine whether the 
new law expressly or otherwise manifests an intention 
to wipe out or sweep away those rights and liabilities 
which had accrued and incurred under the old Law... 
Having carefully gone through all the 
authorities cited by the parties as referred to above, 
we are of opinion that the new Act of 1973 does not 
have the sweeping effect of destroying all the rights 
accrued and liabilities incurred under the old law... 
23. 
One of the indicia that the old law was not effaced is 
in Section [2] of the new Act. It provides that if the 
State Government was satisfied that the 'ceilingarea' 
in relation to a person as fixed under the oldlaw had 
been determined in contravention of that law, a 
decided case could be reopened and inquired into it 
and the 'ceilingarea' and the 'surplus area' 
determined afresh in accordance with the provisions 
of the old law. Another indicium is in Section [1] 
read with the Second proviso to Section [1] of '1973 
Act' which provides that if the ceiling area applicable 
to a person or a family in accordance with the said 
Section [1] exceeds the 'ceilingarea' applicable to 
such person or family, under the old law, then, the 
'ceilingarea' applicable to such person or family 
would be the same as was provided under the 
provisions of the old law. 
24. 
The High Court relied upon and drew sustenance for 
its conclusion from, what it called, the internal 
evidence in the Act which, according to the High 
Court, indicated that pendingcases were governed 
only by the old law. The High Court referred to 
Section [2] inserted by Act No. 8 of 1976 and what,

*117* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

according to it, necessarily flowed from it in support 
of its conclusion, Section [2] inserted by Act NO. 8 of 
1976 runs thus: 
15(2) Without prejudice to any other remedy 
that may be available to it under the Rajasthan 
Tenancy Act, 1955 (Rajasthan Act 3 of 1955), if the 
State Government, after calling for the record or 
otherwise, is satisfied that any final order passed in 
any matter arising under the provisions repealed by 
Section is in contravention of such repealed provisions 
and that such order is prejudicial to the State 
Government or that on account of the discovery of 
new and important matter or evidence which has 
since come to its notice, such order is required to be 
reopened, it may, at any time within five years of the 
commencement of this Act, direct any officer 
subordinate to it to reopen such decided matter and 
to decide it afresh in accordance with such repealed 
provisions. 

25. 
The High Court referring to the opening words of the 
above provision observed: 
The opening words of the section "without 
prejudice to any other remedy that may be available 
to it under the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 (Act No. 
3 of 1955)", clearly show that the pending cases have 
to be governed by the old law. If transactions past and 
closed have to be reopened and decided afresh under 
the provisions of the repealed law, and the ceiling 
area under Chapter III of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 
1955, has to be fixed under its repealed provisions, 
then it must follow as a necessary corollary, that the 
pending cases must be decided under the old law. 
26. 
Sri Lodha, learned Counsel for the State of Rajasthan 
submitted that the 'ceilingarea' had to be fixed with 
reference to the notified date i.e. 1,4.1966 by the 
statutory standards prescribed under the Chapter III 
B of the '1955 Act'. The two legislations are 
complementary to each other and constitute two tier 
provisions. So far as the cases that attracted and fell 
within Chapter IIIB of 1955 Act, as on 1.4.1966, 
would continue to be governed by that law as the

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

rights and obligations created by the said Chapter III 
B amounted to create rights and incur liabilities. Sri 
Lodha submitted that the view taken by the High 
Court was unexceptionable. 
27. 
On a careful consideration of the matter, we are 
inclined to agree with the view taken by the High 
Court on the point. The reliance placed by appellants' 
learned Counsel on the provisions of Section of 1973 
Act as detracting from the tenability of the conclusion 
reached by the High Court on the point is, in our 
opinion, somewhat tenuous. The contention of the 
learned 
Counsel 
is 
that 
the 
expression 
"notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in 
any other law for the time being in force" in Section 
of the 1973 Act would exclude the operation of 
Chapter IIIB of the '1955 Act' which, according to the 
contention, even if kept alive would yet be a 'law for 
the time being in force' and, therefore, be excluded by 
virtue of Section This contention has been negatived 
by the High Court ...and in our opinion rightly ..by 
placing reliance on the pronouncements of this Court 
in Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh and Anr. v. The State of 
Vindhya Pradesh and Chief Inspector of Mines v. K.C. 
Thapar. The High Court held that the expression "law 
for the time being in force" does not take within its 
sweep a law 'deemed to be in force' and that, 
accordingly, the opening words of Section relied , 
upon by the Appellants' learned Counsel will not have 
an overriding effect so as to exclude the old law. 
28. 
A saving provision in a repealing statute is not 
exhaustive of the rights and obligations so saved or 
the rights that survive the repeal. It is observed by 
this Court in I.T. Commissioner v. Shah Sadiq & Sons 
: (SCC p. 524, para 15) 
...In other words whatever rights are expressly 
saved by the 'savings' provision stand saved. But, that 
does not mean that rights which are not saved by the 
'savings' provision are extinguished or stand ipso facto 
terminated by the mere fact that a new statute 
repealing the old statute is enacted. Rights which 
have accrued are saved unless they are taken away 
expressly. This is the principle behind Section 6[c],

General Clauses Act, 1897... 

We agree with the High Court that the scheme of the 
1973 Act does not manifest an intention contrary to, 
and inconsistent with, the saving of the repealed 
provisions of Section [6A] and Chapter IIIB of '1955 
Act' so far as pending cases are concerned and that 
the rights accrued and liabilities incurred under the 
old law are not effaced. Appellant's contention [a] is, 
in our opinion, insubstantial. 

Re : Contention (b): 
29. 
This takes us to the next question whether in the 
present cases even if the provisions of Section of the 
Rajasthan General Clauses Act, 1955. are attracted, 
the present cases did not involve any rights "accrued" 
or obligations "incurred" so as to attract the old law 
to them to support initiation or continuation of the 
proceedings against the landholders after the repeal. 
It was contended that even if the provisions of the old 
Act were held to have been saved it could not be said 
that there was any right accrued in favour of the 
State or any liability incurred by the land holders in 
the matter of determination of the 'ceilingarea' so as 
to attract to their cases the provisions of the old law. 
The point emphasised by the learned Counsel is that 
the excessland would vest in the State only after the 
completion of the proceedings and upon the land 
holder signifying his choice as to the identify of the 
land to be surrendered. Clauses [c] and [e] of Section 
of the Rajasthan General Clauses Act, 1955, provide, 
respectively, that the repeal of an enactment shall not, 
unless a different intention appears, "affect any right 
privilege, obligation, or liability, acquired, accrued, or 
incurred under any enactment so repealed" or "affect 
any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in 
respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, 
liability, fine, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as 
aforesaid". 
30. 
For purposes of these clauses the "right" must be 
"accrued" and not merely an inchoate one. The 
distinction between what is and what is not a right 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014

*120* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

preserved by Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, it is 
said, is often one of great fineness. What is unaffected 
by the repeal is a right 'acquired' or 'accrued' under 
the repealed statute and not "a mere hope or 
expectation" of acquiring a right or liberty to apply 
for a right. 
31. 
In Lalji Raja v. Firm Hansraj Nathuram this Court 
dealing with the distinction between the "abstract 
rights" and "specificrights" for the purpose of the 
operation of Section 6 of General Clauses Act said: 
(SCC p. 728, para 16) 
That a provision to preserve the right accrued 
under a repealed Act 'was not intended to preserve the 
abstract rights conferred by the repealed Act...It only 
applies to specific rights given to an individual upon 
happening of one or the other of the events specified 
in statute' -
See Lord Atkin's observations in 
Hamilton Gell v. White. The mere right, existed at the 
date of repealing statute, to take advantage of 
provisions of the statute repealed is not a 'right 
accrued' within the meaning of the usual saving 
clausesee Abbot v. Minister for Lands and G. Ogden 
Industries pty. Ltd. v. Lucas. 
32. 
…..... 
33. 
….... 
34. 
The rights and obligations under this provision had 
had to be determined with reference to the notified 
date i.e. 1.4.1966. Referring to analogous provision 
of the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands [Ceiling on 
Holdings] Act, 1961, this Court in Raghunath v. 
Maharashtra observed: (SCC p. 397, para 17) 
The scheme of the Act seems to be to determine 
the ceiling area of each person [including a family] 
with reference to the appointed day. The policy of the 
Act appears to be that on and after the appointed day 
no person in the State should be permitted to hold 
any land in excess of the ceiling area as determined 
under the Act and that ceiling area would be that 
which is determined as on the appointed day. 
35. 
Again in Bhikoba Shankar Dhumal v. Mohan Lal 
Punchand Thathed, it was observed: (SCC p.687, 
para 13) 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*121* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

A close reading of the aforesaid provisions of 
the Act shows that the determination of the extent of 
surplus land of a holder has to be made as on the 
appointed day. If any person has at any time after the 
fourth day of August, 1959, but before the appointed 
day held any land [including any exempted land] in 
excess of the ceiling area, such person should file a 
return within the prescribed period from the 
appointed day furnishing to each of the Collectors 
within whose jurisdiction any land in his holding is 
situated, in the form prescribed containing the 
particulars of all land held by him. If any person 
acquires, holds or comes into possession of any land 
including any exempted land in excess of the ceiling 
area on or after the appointed day, such person has to 
furnish a return as stated above within the prescribed 
period from the date of taking possession of any land 
in excess of the ceiling area. 
36. 
A contention similar to the one urged for the 
appellants here that the title respecting the surplus 
land would vest in the Government upon such land 
being taken possession of by Government after the 
declaration regarding the surplus was noticed in that 
case. But, it was held that the liability to surrender 
the surplus land would date back to the appointed 
day. This Court said: (SCC p.688, para 13) 
Any other construction would make the Act 
unworkable and the determination of the extent of 
surplus land of a holder ambulatory and indefinite. 

This was again reiterated in State of Maharashtra v. 
Annapurnabai. This Court said: (SCC p.275, para 4) 
Section 21 of the Act no doubt states that the 
title of the holder of the surplus land would become 
vested in the State Government only on such land 
being taken possession of after a declaration 
regarding the surplus land is published in Official 
Gazette. But the liability to surrender the surplus 
land relates back to the appointed day in case of those 
who held land in excess of the ceiling on the 
appointed day. Therefore, even if the holder dies 
before declaration of any part of his land as surplus

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

land, the surplus land is liable to be determined with 
reference to his holding on the appointed day... 
37. 
It is, therefore, seen that the right of the State to take 
over excess land vested in it as on the appointed day 
and only the quantification remained to be worked 
out. As observed by Lord Morris, in Director of Public 
Works v. Ho Po Sang : (ALL ER p.731) 
It may be, therefore, that under some repealed 
enactment, a right has been given, but that, in respect 
of it, some investigation or legal proceeding is 
necessary. The right is then unaffected and preserved, 
It will be preserved even if a process of quantification 
is necessary. But there is a manifest distinction 
between an investigation in respect of a right and an 
investigation which is to a decide whether some right 
should be or should not be given. On repeal the 
former is preserved by the Interpretation Act. The 
latter is not. 
38. 
The above passage was referred to with approval in 
M.S. Shivananda v. K.S.R.T.C.. 
39. 
We agree with the High Court that the right of the 
State to the excess land was not merely an inchoate 
right under the Act, but a right "accrued" within the 
meaning of Section [c] of the Rajasthan General 
Clauses Act, 1955, and the liability of the landowner 
to surrender the excess land as on 1.4.1966 was a 
liability "incurred" also within the meaning of the 
said provision. There is no substance in contention 
[b] either." 

77 
Mr.Naphade would urge that this judgment is distinguishable 

because it pertains to a ceiling on agricultural lands. Secondly, the 

judgment deals with a case where earlier law was repealed, but reenacted 

in a different form. Yet the Legislature retained the earlier law, namely, 

the Act of 1955. The factual matrix was, therefore, different. This 

judgment would have no application to the point before us.

78 
We are unable to agree with Mr.Naphade and for more than 

one reason. The judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court and laying 

down such principles cannot be brushed aside on a spacious plea that the 

statute which was subject matter of the judgment was repealed, but 

reenacted later. This is a judgment on Section 6 of the Rajasthan General 

Clauses Act, 1955 and which is identical to Section 6 of the General 

Clauses Act, 1897. Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 reads as 

under: 

"6. 
Effect of repeal: -Where this Act, or any [Central Act] 
or Regulation made after the commencement of this 
Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter 
to be made, then, unless a different intention appears, 
the repeal shall not -
(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the 
time at which the repeal takes effect; or 
(b) affect the previous operation of any enactment 
so repealed or anything duly done or suffered 
thereunder; or 
(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability 
acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment so 
repealed; or 
(d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment 
incurred in respect of any offence committed against 
any enactment so repealed; or 
(e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or 
remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, 
obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment 
as aforesaid; 

and any such investigation, legal proceeding or 
remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and 
any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be 
imposed as if the repealing Act or Regulation had not 
been passed."

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Section 6 of the General Clauses Act would show that the Honourable 

Supreme Court emphasized that a saving provision in the repealing 

statute is not exhaustive of the rights and obligations so saved or the 

rights that survive the repeal. The line of inquiry as has been repeatedly 

pointed out by the Honourable Supreme Court would be not whether the 

new Act expressly keeps alive the old rights and liabilities, but whether it 

manifests an intention to destroy them. Unless such an intention is 

manifested by the new Act, the rights and liabilities under the repealed 

Act will continue to exist by force of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. 

It is the repealing Act and not the Act repealed which is to manifest the 

contrary intention so as to exclude the operation of Section 6 of the 

General Clauses Act. The silence of the repealing Act is consistent and not 

inconsistent with Section 6 applying. That is how we are of the opinion 

that if this line of inquiry is carried forward it would show that the Repeal 

Act did not manifest an intention contrary to Section 6 of the General 

Clauses Act. The nature of right that is claimed or in other words the 

privilege being not absolute that all the more we are unable to accept 

Mr.Naphade's arguments. The Honourable Supreme Court holds that the 

scheme of the Act seems to be to determine the ceiling area of each 

person with reference to the appointed day. Hence, the rights and 

obligations under the provision had to be determined with reference to 

the notified date. If that is so and in this case if the lands are in excess of 

ceiling limit and some of them may have vested in the State already, then, 

the exemption claimed from applicability of ChapterIII would not mean 

that the character of the lands is in any way altered or their status is 

changed. The date with reference to which the lands have become excess, 

thus cannot be ignored while determining the nature of the rights and 

privilege. All the more if such privilege or right is conditional as noted

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

above. In these circumstances we see no reason to deviate from the 

principles in the case of Bansidhar (supra). 

80 
We are of the clear opinion that clauses (b) and (c) of Section 

6 of the General Clauses Act are thus, clearly attracted. Therefore, the 

repeal will not affect the previous operation of the Principal Act or 

anything duly done or suffered thereunder. 

81 
In that regard, assistance can be taken of the judgment of the 

Honourable Supreme Court in the case of M/s Universal Imports Agency 

v/s Chief Controller of Imports and Exports reported in AIR 1961 SC 41. 

In paragraphs 16 to 18 of this decision this is what is held: 

"16. 
What were the "things done" by the petitioners under 
the Pondicherry law ? The petitioners in the course of 
their import trade, having obtained authorization for 
the foreign exchange through their bankers, entered 
into firm contracts with foreign dealers on C.I.F. 
terms. In some cases irrevocable Letters of Credit were 
opened and in others bank drafts were sent towards 
the contracts. Under the terms of the contracts the 
sellers had to ship the goods from various foreign 
ports and the buyers were to have physical delivery of 
the goods after they had crossed the customs barrier 
in India. Pursuant to the terms of the contracts, the 
sellers placed the goods on board the various ships, 
some before and others after the merger, and the 
goods arrived at Pondicherry port after its merger 
with India. The prices for the goods were paid in full 
to the foreign sellers and the goods were taken 
delivery of by the buyers after examining them on 
arrival. Before the merger if the Customs Authorities 
had imposed any restrictions not authorized by law, 
the affected parties could have enforced the free entry 
of the goods in a court of law. On the said facts a 
short question arises whether paragraph 6 of the 
Order protects the petitioners. While learned counsel 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*126* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

for the petitioners contends that "things done" take in 
not only things done but also their legal consequences, 
learned counsel for the State contends that, as the 
goods were not brought into India before the merger, 
it was not a thing done before the merger and, 
therefore, would be governed by the enactments 
specified in the Schedule. It is not necessary to 
consider in this case whether the concept of import 
not only takes in the factual bringing of goods into 
India, but also the entire process of import 
commencing from the date of the application for 
permission to import and ending with the crossing of 
the customs barrier in India. The word "things done" 
in paragraph 6 must be reasonably interpreted and, if 
so interpreted, they can mean no only things done but 
also the legal consequences flowing there from. If the 
interpretation suggested by the learned counsel for the 
respondents be accepted, the saving clause would 
become unnecessary. If what it saves is only the 
executed contracts, i.e., the contracts whereunder the 
goods have been imported and received by the buyer 
before the merger, no further protection is necessary 
as ordinarily no question of enforcement of the 
contracts under the preexisting law would arise. The 
phraseology used is not an innovation but is copied 
from other statutory clauses. Section 6 of the General 
Clauses Act (X of 1897) says that unless a different 
intention appears, the repeal of an Act shall not affect 
anything duly done or suffered there under So too, the 
Public Health Act of 1875 (38 & 39 Vict. c. 55) which 
repealed the Public Health Act of 1848 contained a 
proviso to s. to the effect that the repeal "shall not 
affect anything duly done or suffered under the 
enactment hereby repealed". This proviso came under 
judicial scrutiny in The Queen v. Justices of the West 
Riding of Yorkshire There notice was given by a local 
board of health of intention to make a rate under the 
Public Health Act, 1848, and amending Acts. Before 
the notice had expired these Acts were repealed by the 
Public Health Act, 1875, which contained a saving of 
"anything duly done" under the repealed enactments 
and gave power to make a similar rate upon giving a

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*127* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

similar notice. The board, in ignorance of the repeal, 
made a rate purporting to be made under the 
repealed Acts. It was contended that as the rate was 
made after the repealing Act, the notice given under 
the repealed Act was not valid. The learned Judges 
held that as the notice was given before the Act, the 
making of the rate was also saved by the words 
"anything duly done" under the repealed enactments. 
This case illustrates the point that it is not necessary 
that an impugned thing in itself should have been 
done before the Act was repealed, but it would be 
enough if it was integrally connected with and was a 
legal consequence of a thing done before the said 
repeal. Under similar circumstances Lindley, L.J., in 
Heston and Isleworth Urban district Council v. Grout 
confirmed the validity of the rate made pursuant to a 
notice issued prior to the repeal. Adverting to the 
saving clause, the learned Judge tersely states the 
principle thus at p. 313 : "That to my mind preserves 
that notice and the effect of it". On that principle the 
Court of Appeal held that the rate which was the 
effect of the notice was good. 
17. 
It is suggested that the phraseology of the saving 
clause of the English Statutes and of the General 
Clauses Act of 1897 are of wider import than that of 
paragraph 6 of the Order and, therefore, the English 
decisions are not of any assistance in considering the 
scope of the saving clause of the Order. It is further 
stated that the English decisions apply only to a 
saving clause of an Act which repeals another but 
preserves the right created by the latter. We do not see 
any reason why the same construction cannot be 
placed upon the wording of paragraph 6 of the Order 
which is practically similar in terms as those found in 
the relevant saving clause of the English Statute and 
that of the General Clauses Act. 
18. 
Nor can we find any justification for the second 
criticism. In the instant case the legal position is 
exactly the same. By reason of the IndoFrench 
Agreement the Government of India made the Order 
under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act applying the Indian 
laws to Pondicherry. The effect of that Order was that 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*128* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

the French laws were repealed by the application of 
the Indian laws in the same field occupied by the 
French laws subject to a saving clause. The position is 
analogous to that of a statute repealing another with 
a saving clause. If the English decisions apply to the 
latter situation, we do not see how they do not apply 
to the former. In both the cases the preexisting law 
continues to govern the things done before a 
particular date. We, therefore, hold that the words 
"things done" in paragraph 6 of the Order are 
comprehensive enough to take in a transaction 
effected before the merger, though some of its legal 
effects and consequences projected into the post 
merger period." 

82 
Further in the case of Amadalavasa Cooperative Agricultural 

and Industrial Society Limited v/s Union of India reported in AIR 1976 SC 

958 in the context of compulsory insurance scheme and whether that 

survives with all attendant conditions upon repeal of the Principal Act, 

namely, the Emergency Risks (Factories) Insurance Act, 1962 the 

Honourable Supreme Court held as under: 

"18. 
The appellants challenged the finding of the High 
Court that the liability to pay the evaded premia 
arose during the currency of the Acts and contended 
that the liability itself was dependent on the 
ascertainment by the authorised officer of the 
insurable value of the factory or goods in accordance 
with the Third Schedule and that until the extent of 
the liability was so ascertained, there could be no 
liability and so, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 
was not attracted. In other words, the contention was 
that until the liability of the insured was determined 
by the authorized officer by ascertaining the correct 
insurable value in accordance with the provisions of 
the Third Schedule, no liability to pay the evaded 
premia arose and therefore, no liability was incurred 
before the expiry of the Acts which could be enforced 
under the provisions of Section 6 of the General

Clauses Act after their expiry. 
19. 
It is clear from the provisions of the Acts that the duty 
to take out insurance policy for the full insurable 
value of the factory or goods was mandatory and that 
the failure to do so was an offence. Be sides, in the 
case of failure to insure for the full insurable value, 
provisions were made for recovery of the relative 
premia. To effectuate this purpose, the procedure for 
determination of the insurable value of the factory or 
goods and of the premia evaded was also provided. 
20. 
There is no compulsion in a voluntary insurance that 
the cover should be made for the entire insurable 
value of the property. The premium collected in a 
voluntary insurance is related to the quantum of the 
risk undertaken in the light of the insurable value 
suggested by the insured. Generally, in a voluntary 
insurance the premium is paid in consideration of the 
cover provided. In other words, premium is paid in 
order to enable the insurer to indemnify the insured 
against loss or damage on account of the risk 
specified. The scheme of insurance envisaged by the 
Acts was different. There was no element of consensus 
on the fundamental terms of insurance in the scheme. 
The liability to take insurance policy for the full 
insurable value of the factory or goods was 
compulsory. The terms and conditions of the policy to 
be taken were governed solely by the provisions of the 
Acts and the Schemes. It is a mistake to assume that 
the rights and liabilities of the parties in this 
statutory scheme were similar, to those of a voluntary 
contract of insurance, If the liability to take the 
insurance policy for the full insurable value was 
absolute, and if the terms and conditions of insurance 
were settled by the terms of the statutes and the 
Schemes read with the Schedules, there is no merit in 
the contention of counsel for the appellants that the 
obligation of the President as insurer was same as 
that of an insurer in a contract of voluntary 
insurance. The liability to pay premia in case of 
undervaluation was not dependent upon the 
subsequent determination of the full insurable value 
of the factory or goods insured. If the factory or goods

was undervalued, when the insurance policy was 
taken, the liability to pay premia on the basis of the 
full insurable value arose at the time when the policy 
was taken. That liability was not dependent upon the 
ascertainment of the full insurable value by the 
authorised officer in accordance with the Third 
Schedule." 

83 
Once the repeal of the Principal Act has been understood not 

to affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability accrued or incurred 

under the Repealed Act, then, we do not find that the Repeal Act in this 

case has manifested an intention contrary to applicability of Section 6 of 

the General Clauses Act. 

84 
When the word and expression used is "obligation or liability 

incurred under any Repealed Act", then, the term "liability" is understood 

to be of large and comprehensive significance and when construed in its 

usual and ordinary sense in which it is commonly employed it expresses 

the state of being under obligation in law or in justice [see AIR 1959 

Punjab 328 (First National Bank Limited v/s Seth Sant Lal)]. 

85 
A Full Bench of Delhi High Court in the case of Mohd. Yaqub 

v/s Union of India reported in AIR 1971 Delhi 45 followed the above 

Punjab High Court's view and held that the liability is the state of being 

bound or obliged in law or justice. In Black's Law Dictionary the word 

"liability" is defined to mean "the state of being bound or obliged in law 

or justice to do, pay or make good something; legal responsibility". It is, 

therefore, a word of widest import meaning an obligation or duty to do 

something or to refrain from doing something. [see paras 13 to 16 of AIR 

1971 Delhi 45].

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

86 
We cannot, therefore, be unmindful of the fact that the words 

"liability incurred" have been construed as very general and 

comprehensive and ordinarily taking both civil and criminal liability. [See 

Kapur Chand Pokhraj v/s State of Bombay AIR 1958 SC 993]. 

87 
Such being the position in law we cannot accept 

Mr.Naphade's contentions that the judgment of the Honourable Supreme 

Court in the case of Bansidhar (supra) would not apply. 

88 
We are further not in agreement with Mr.Naphade that 

Bansidhar's case (supra) was confined to agricultural ceiling law and 

reenactment thereof. Even with regard to the Principal Act before us it has 

been held by our Court in Sadashiv Durgaji Ambhore v/s State of 

Maharashtra reported in 1992 Mh.L.J. 1300 as under: 

"8. 
Coming to the scheme of the U.L.C. Act it is crystal 
clear that no person can retain vacant land in urban 
area more than the prescribed ceiling limit. The excess 
or better still the surplus land has to vest in the State. 
There can thus be no question of escaping the 
prohibition imposed by the statute, the validity of 
which is already tested before. Therefore, once the 
surplus land is determined by the Competent 
Authority the original owner has no right over such 
land and in due course those lands must vest in the 
State. 
9. 
Looking to the aforestated objectives as well as the 
scheme of the U.L.C. Act, the lands which are found to 
be in excess of the prescribed limit can never revert 
back to the owner under any of the circumstances. It 
must end with the vesting of such surplus lands with 
the State Government. Otherwise the very object and 
purpose for which the Act has been enacted would 
frustrate and the holder of excess land would 
contravene the provisions of Section 3 exposing him

*132* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

to prosecution for offence under Section 38 of the Act. 
10. 
One more aspect that falls for consideration is the use 
of the word "may" in Subsection (3) of Section 10 of 
the U.L.C. Act. The said section reads as under: 
"10(3) At any time after the publication of the 
notification under Subsection (1) the competent 
authority may, by notification published in the 
Official Gazette of the State concerned declare that 
the excess: and referred to in the notification 
published under Subsection (1) shall, with effect 
from such date as may be specified in the declaration, 
be deemed to have been acquired by the State 
Government and upon the publication of such 
declaration, such land shall be deemed to have vested 
absolutely in the State Government free from all 
encumbrances with effect from the date so specified." 

The use of word "may" after the words "the competent 
authority" and before the words "by notification 
published in Official Gazette …......" will have to be 
construed as "shall" if the object and purpose of the 
U.L.C. Act as discussed above have to be achieved. The 
word "may" though primarily permissive is in certain 
circumstances to be treated as mandatory and those 
circumstances are available looking to the scheme of 
the Act." 

89 
Therefore, the land which is vacant and in excess of ceiling 

limit on the date of commencement of the Act is subject to ChapterIII of 

the Principal Act and its application thereto is undisputed. If such 

undisputed absolute application is the position emerging from the statute 

and because of an exceptional circumstance the applicability is held in 

abeyance, then, it is not open to those persons holding such lands to 

contend that the Principal Act has been repealed, therefore, it's 

applicability to the lands in question will not survive the repeal. If as 

contended by the learned Advocate General the exemption keeps in

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*133* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

abeyance the applicability of ChapterIII till such exemption order is in 

force and does not rule out the applicability of the Principal Act, then, we 

cannot accept the arguments of the learned Senior Counsel for the 

Petitioners to the contrary. Realizing this position, Mr.Naphade and other 

Senior Counsel toned down their submissions to some extent. They urged 

that Section 10 of the Principal Act is the heart of the Principal Act and 

once the consequences of subsection (3) of Section 10 of the Principal 

Act cannot be visited on the Petitioners after repeal of the Principal Act, 

then, a contrary intention is manifested. If we hold that such contrary 

intention is not manifested and Section 6 of the General Clauses Act 

applies to the repeal in question, then, that would result in inconsistency 

and absurdity. This argument is premised on the fact that subsection (2) 

of Section 20 of the Principal Act is not saved and that is not specifically 

referred in clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act and 

hence, the above result will follow. 

90 
For the reasons that we have set out hereinabove it will not 

be possible to accept any of these contentions. Firstly, as understood in 

the case of clause (a) of Section 20(1) of the Principal Act the exemption 

is granted qua the excess vacant land and bearing in mind the factors and 

circumstances indicated therein. Secondly, it is an exemption granted in 

public interest and to subserve it. Thirdly, even if the exemption is 

granted under clause (b) of Section 20(1) that is to relieve the undue 

hardship. Under both clauses the exemption order could be conditional. If 

the validity of the exemption order together with the conditions is saved 

and equally any action taken thereunder, then, it will not be proper to 

hold that the exemption order and conditions therein cannot be enforced 

by recourse to the Principal Act. That is because if the exemption is a right 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 ::: 


*134* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

as is claimed, then, it is conditional. It is a right accrued, but the 

conditions subject to which that right accrues cannot be ignored. Those 

conditions are linked to the right and privilege acquired or accrued. If 

that condition is in the nature of obligation or liability attached to the 

privilege or right, then, a different intention not being spelled out that is 

saved despite the repeal. The reasons, therefore, indicated above would 

take care of these submissions of the learned Senior Counsel appearing 

for the Petitioners and are enough to reject them. 

91 
If an intention was to the contrary as urged by the learned 

Senior Counsel for the Petitioners, then, there was no need for the 

Parliament to have save the validity of any exemption order under sub 

section (1) of Section 20 of the Principal Act or any action taken 

thereunder and declare the same to be not affected by repeal of the 

Principal Act notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary. 

There may have been cases before repeal of the Principal Act in which 

there was challenge to the exemption orders or to the conditions 

thereunder. Some of these challenges may have succeeded. The validity of 

the exemption order may have been put in issue and even such 

pronouncements of the court may affect the order granting exemption or 

any action taken thereunder. Now, because of Section 3(1)(b) of the 

Repeal Act, it is apparent that the order or condition or action is not 

invalid. It is declared to be valid by the Repeal Act and, therefore, the 

repeal of the Principal Act was not to affect the validity of such an order. 

In other words during subsistence of the Principal Act and when it was in 

force the exemption order or condition thereunder or any action taken 

thereunder may have been declared invalid by a court of law. Now, 

notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary the validity of 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*135* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

exemption order is saved. That is saved expressly so as to not take away 

its legal effects. The intent is not to affect adversely the legal 

consequences flowing from such valid order. Hence, far from manifesting 

or demonstrating a contrary intention, Section 3 of the Repeal Act is 

consistent and in consonance with the applicability of Section 6 of the 

General Clauses Act. In these circumstances we are of the view that the 

principle laid down in the afore noted cases including Bansidhar (supra) 

would squarely apply. 

92 
That leaves us with only one argument of Mr.Sridharan and 

he submits that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act will not apply 

because the Repeal Act has to be adopted in terms of subsection (3) of 

Section 1 of the Repeal Act by the States other than the States of Haryana 

and Punjab. He relied upon Article 252 of the Constitution of India and 

particularly clause (2) thereof. 

93 
We are unable to accept his contentions and for obvious 

reasons. Article 252 of the Constitution of India confers power in the 

Parliament to legislate for two or more States by consent and adoption of 

such legislation by any other State. Clause (2) thereof states that any Act 

passed by the Parliament may be amended or repealed by an Act of 

Parliament passed or adopted in like manner, namely, as set out in clause 

(1) of Article 252 of the Constitution of India by any State to which it 

applies, but the State Legislature of that State cannot amend or repeal 

any Act of the Parliament on its own. That it has to adopt it by resolution 

passed in that behalf is clear by clause (1) of Article 252. However, we do 

not find anything in the language of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act 

which would enable us to hold that the same does not apply in the

*136* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

situation with which we are concerned. It will have to be clarified that the 

Principal Act in the case is the Central Act. It has been made after 

commencement of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Equally, the Repeal Act 

is an Act of Parliament made after the General Clauses Act. Just as the 

Principal Act had the section of applicability and applied at once to some 

States, but had to be adopted by other States and a resolution had to be 

passed in that behalf, similarly, the Repeal Act also contains identical 

provisions. Merely because the Repeal Act has to be adopted and comes 

into force in the State which it adopts upon passing of the resolution by 

the House of that State will not mean that Section 6 of the General 

Clauses Act does not apply. The applicability of Section 6 of the General 

Clauses Act has to be seen qua the Repeal Act. Mr.Sridharan does not 

dispute that it applies to the Repeal Act. His argument is that because of 

adoption of the Repeal Act by resolution of the House of the State of 

Maharashtra, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act will not apply. The 

resolution merely adopts the Repeal Act made by the Parliament in the 

State. If Section 6 of the General Clauses Act applies to the Repeal Act 

and that is how its applicability is being tested, then, the argument of 

Mr.Sridharan need not detain us. 

94 
Reliance that Mr.Sridharan placed upon the judgment in the 

case of Kolhapur Canesugar Works Limited v/s Union of India reported in 

(2000) 2 SCC 536 is entirely misplaced. There, the Honourable Supreme 

Court was concerned with a situation as to whether Section 6 of the 

General Clauses Act, which is applicable to repeal of enactments by a 

Central Act or Regulation, would apply in the case of either omission or 

rule. The Constitution Bench held that this Section 6 cannot apply in case 

of omission of a rule and the term regulation in Section 6 of the General 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*137* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Clauses Act has specific legal connotation. That has been defined legally 

and in that regard the definitions of the terms "enactment", "regulation" 

and "Central Act" have been noted in paragraphs 18 and 19. These 

definitions are to be found in the General Clauses Act itself. Since a mere 

rule would not be covered by the term "regulation" as defined that the 

Constitution Bench held that going by Section 3(51) of the General 

Clauses Act Section 6 has no applicability in the case of omission of a rule. 

We do not see how this judgment can have any applicability in our case. 

Rather the observations in paragraph 32 of this judgment clarify the 

position that so long as a "Rule" takes its colour from the definition of the 

terms in the General Clauses Act the repeal of the same cannot be 

construed in the light of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. 

95 
In that regard, reliance placed by the learned Advocate 

General on the judgment of the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh 

High Court reported in AIR 1979 Madhya Pradesh 108 (Rajendra Kumar 

v/s State of Madhya Pradesh) is appropriate. In paragraph 7 of this 

decision the Division Bench clarified the legal position that when the 

Parliament passes an Act with the consent of States the Act so passed 

cannot be classified as a State Act. Further, the Division Bench clarified 

the legal position in the context of Article 252 of the Constitution of India 

as well. (See paras 4 and 8). Mr.Sridharan's arguments overlook the fact 

that the Repeal Act has merely been adopted by the State of Maharashtra 

by passing a resolution by the Legislature of that State and therefore, it is 

not the resolution of the State Assembly with regard to which we are 

looking at the applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. 

Mr.Sridharan, therefore, rightly canvassed alternate arguments and which 

are more or less on the same lines as that of Mr.Naphade and other Senior 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*138* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Counsel. Additionally, Mr.Sridharan submitted that Section 3 of the 

Repeal Act and particularly clause (b) of subsection (1) thereof is a 

special saving and saves only that which is specifically mentioned. There 

is no room for any implication or reading into it something which is not 

specifically mentioned therein. It is his argument that it is not a validating 

statute or clause. It saves a subordinate legislation according to him. 

96 
None of these arguments are sound in law. We are concerned 

with Section 3 of the Repeal Act which is titled "saving", but subsection 

(1) thereof states that the repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect and 

what it is not affected thereby is set out in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of sub 

section (1) of Section 3. By clause (a) the repeal will not affect the vesting 

of any vacant land under Section 10(3), possession of which has been 

taken over by the State Government. If the intention was to obliterate and 

wipe out everything, then, there was no need to insert clause (a) as well. 

Clause (a) has been inserted so as to save the vesting of the land under 

Section 10(3) and which is in possession of the State Government. The 

Legislature was aware that in the light of the repeal of the Principal Act it 

would be necessary to save the vesting inasmuch as subsection (3) of 

Section 10 of the Principal Act itself speaks of vesting of the excess vacant 

land in the State absolutely free from all encumbrances upon its deemed 

acquisition. That deemed acquisition results after a declaration is 

published in the official Gazette in terms of Section 10(3). The Parliament 

stepped into to save only such vesting which has resulted in the land 

being taken over by the State Government and not otherwise. By a mere 

declaration in terms of Section 10(3) the vesting which otherwise takes 

place would not be saved if in pursuance thereof the land is not taken 

over by the State. Therefore, it is incorrect to urge that Section 3 of the 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*139* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Repeal Act saves a subordinate legislation. Clause (a) of subsection (1) of 

Section 3 of the Repeal Act is a substantive provision and the repeal 

clearly affects the vesting of land of which possession has not been taken 

because by subsection (2) of Section 3 such land can be restored. Hence, 

a situation where there is a declaration issued and contained in the 

notification contemplated by Section 10(3) of the Principal Act, but the 

State failed to act in pursuance thereof and has not exercised it's power 

under subsections (5) and (6) of Section 10 of the Principal Act, is dealt 

with by Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. By clause (b) a substantive 

provision has been made and to deal with a different situation, namely, 

the excess vacant land and which may or may not be covered by 

declaration under Section 10(3), but which is exempted in exercise of the 

statutory power conferred vide Section 20(1) of the Principal Act. It is the 

exercise of that power to exempt and all consequences which follow a 

valid exemption order that are saved by clause (b). This is as set out 

above not only saving the validity of order granting exemption, but any 

action taken thereunder and notwithstanding anything in any judgment 

of any court to the contrary. One more aspect or matter is dealt with by 

clause (c) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act inasmuch as if 

for granting exemption under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act there is a 

condition to make payment to the State Government and if the payment 

is made in compliance thereof, then, that payment made to the State 

Government is also saved. Therefore, on reading Sections 3 and 4 of the 

Repeal Act it is not possible to accept the arguments of Mr.Sridharan that 

only a subordinate legislation is saved either by Repeal Act or Section 3. 

Had it not been so Mr.Sridharan would not have further alternatively 

argued and adopted the contentions of Mr.Naphade and others that the 

power to withdraw the exemption or initiate an action under Section 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*140* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

20(2) of the Principal Act is not saved or does not survive the repeal. 

97 
We have already dealt with that argument and rejected it for 

the reasons set out above. A faint attempt was made by Mr.Sridharan to 

show that clause (b) has been inserted in subsection (1) of Section 3 of 

the Repeal Act to protect the rights of innocent third parties or action 

under the exemption orders which may affect them. It is not a substantive 

provision and by no stretch of imagination revives the Principal Act is his 

argument. We fail to see as to how in the absence of clause (b) a power of 

exemption once exercised and when the Principal Act was in force, but 

that order or any action taken thereunder being declared invalid that 

could have survived the repeal even with the aid of Section 6 of the 

General Clauses Act, 1897. In other words, it could have been argued that 

not only there should be a power of exemption exercised, but the order in 

that behalf or any action taken thereunder should have been valid, lawful 

and subsisting on the date of the Repeal Act or at least when it came into 

force. It could have been then said that only in such a situation that the 

order would survive the repeal even without insertion of clause (b) in 

subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act with the aid of Section 6 of 

the General Clauses Act. To get over this situation and position a 

substantive provision has been made in the Repeal Act which says that the 

repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the validity of any order 

granting exemption under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act or any action 

taken thereunder notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the 

contrary. This is a substantive provision and read together with other 

clauses of subsections (1) and (2) of Section 3 and Section 4 of the 

Repeal Act, so also, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and 

harmoniously does not revive the Principal Act as is urged, but saves the

*141* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

exemption order in exercise of the powers conferred by the Principal Act 

or any action taken thereunder by declaring it to be valid notwithstanding 

any judgment of any court to the contrary. That would be the correct 

reading of the provisions or else Mr.Sridharan would not have still further 

argued that clause (c) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act 

does not save the liability incurred under the exemption order, but only 

saves the payment made to the State Government. This further alternate 

argument itself would show that Mr.Sridharan is not on a strong and 

sound legal footing in urging that Section 3 of the Repeal Act is not a 

substantive provision. That it is titled as "savings", but contains the 

substantive provisions which do not show any contrary intention to 

applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is what is held by us 

hereinabove. A correct and proper reading of clause (c) of Section 3(1) of 

the Repeal Act would be that the Legislature had in mind a conditional 

exemption order. One of the conditions could have been of making 

payment to the State Government for granting exemption under Section 

20(1) of the Principal Act. If the power to exempt does not survive the 

repeal, but the intent was to save the power to exempt already exercised 

conditionally or otherwise that the Legislature stepped in to save even 

payment made to the State Government for grant of such exemption. That 

is because a beneficiary of the exercise of power of exemption should not, 

post repeal of the Principal Act, urge that the State has no right to retain 

the amount paid by him, but must refund it. That he has already made 

payment and the power to exempt having been exercised when the 

Principal Act was in force that it is clarified that the payment made to the 

Government as a condition for granting exemption would survive the 

Repeal. That is to take care of the plea that such payment will no longer 

be valid as the exemption comes to an end post repeal. Therefore, in

*142* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

order to declare that the power of exemption once exercised would 

survive the repeal and equally the condition of payment thereunder that 

clauses (b) and (c) have been inserted. 

98 
We find that Mr.Sridharan is not right in placing reliance on 

the judgments of the Honourable Supreme Court firstly in the case of Shri 

Prithvi Cotton Mills Limited v/s Broach Borough Municipality reported in 

2000 (123) ELT page 3 (SC). There, the Honourable Supreme Court was 

considering a case of the rate on the lands and buildings imposed under 

the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act, 1925. Certain Assessees challenged 

the imposition of these rates and filed the Writ Petitions to question it and 

get the assessment cancelled. During the pendency of the Writ Petitions 

the Legislature of Gujarat passed the Gujarat Imposition of Taxes by 

Municipalities (Validation) Act, 1963. The Writ Petitions were, therefore, 

amended and the Validation Act was questioned. The Honourable 

Supreme Court, therefore, was considering the validity and legality of 

Section 3 of this Validation Act. It is in that context that the observations 

regarding a Validating Statute have been made. We do not see as to how 

this judgment can have any application in the light of our conclusions 

recorded hereinabove. This judgment is, therefore, clearly distinguishable. 

99 
Equally, misplaced is the reliance on the judgment of the 

Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v/s West Coast 

Paper Mills Limited reported in 2004 (164) ELT 375 (SC). There, the 

question was as to whether the appeal can be considered as continuation 

of the suit. We do not find how this judgment can assist Mr.Sridharan in 

his arguments on the Reference before us.

100 
Once we have held that neither the power to exempt can be 

said to be legislative nor can it be held that the Repeal Act saves the 

subordinate legislation, then, no assistance can be derived from the 

judgment in the case of Air India V/s Union of India reported in (1995) 4 

SCC 734. Rather some of the observations therein and particularly 

reference to Bennion on Statutory Interpretation in paragraph 7 of this 

judgment would assist us and reinforce our above conclusions. 

101 
We are not in agreement with Mr.Naphade that the power to 

exempt conferred by Section 20 of the Principal Act is legislative in 

nature. We are of the clear opinion that this power is QuasiJudicial in 

nature. The nature of this power is to exempt the excess vacant lands. In 

other words, they are vacant lands in excess of ceiling limit. They are 

exempted from the provisions or applicability of ChapterIII on the 

satisfaction reached and which is to be found in clause (a) and clause (b) 

of subsection (1) of this provision. In a decision reported in AIR 1982 

Madhya Pradesh 33 (Nandakishore v/s State of M.P.), the Division Bench 

of Madhya Pradesh High Court held as under: 

"5. 
…..... Clause (a) of Subsection (1) of Section 20 of 
the Act empowers the State Government to exempt 
any vacant land in public interest; whereas Clause (b) 
thereof empowers the State Government to grant 
exemption to any person who holds vacant land in 
excess of the ceiling limit, where such exemption is 
considered necessary to avoid undue hardship to such 
person. The second schedule to the Act inter alia 
prescribes Rs.10/ as courtfees stamp to be paid on 
an application for exemption of vacant land under 
Section 20 of the Act. The power to exempt so 
conferred on the State Government carries with it an 
obligation to exercise that power on a case being 
made out for the purpose. Of course, the power to 
exempt is exercisable by the State Government on its

own motion, but the same can be exercised otherwise 
also. This is what flows from the use of the expression 
"either on its own motion or otherwise" used in 
Clauses (a) and (b) of Section 20(1) of the Act. The 
words "or otherwise" cannot be construed ejusdem 
generis and are indicative of the fact that the power is 
exercisable on being invoked in any other manner. The 
natural corollary of this position of law is that the 
petitioners have right to submit a petition invoking 
the exercise of the power of exemption so conferred on 
the State Government. This Legislative intendment is 
also clear from the provision of courtfee on an 
application for exemption of vacant land under 
Section 20 of the Act made in Schedule as stated 
above. The power to exempt by its very nature in cases 
to which Clause (a) of Section 20(1) of the Act is 
applicable, appears to be exercisable in public interest; 
whereas so far as Clause (b) of Section 20(1) of the 
Act is concerned, the power is exercisable for the 
benefit of the holders so that undue hardship on 
account of operation of the Act may be avoided. In 
present case the petitioners appear to invoke the 
power vested in the State Government under Section 
20(1)(b) of the Act. Now, in order that the power to 
exempt may be exercised under the aforesaid Clause 
(b), it is necessary that the State Government should 
be satisfied that the application of the provisions of 
the Chapter III (in which Section 20 is placed) would 
cause undue hardship to the person who holds the 
vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit. On a case of 
undue hardship being made out, the State 
Government may by order exempt subject to such 
conditions, if any, as may be specified in the order, 
such vacant land from the provisions of the said 
Chapter. Thus in essence the provision is for the 
benefit of the holder and its object appears to be to 
grant exemption so as to avert causing of undue 
hardship to him by operation of the law. If the State 
Government feels satisfied that a case has been made 
out for grant of exemption claimed, then an order of 
exemption may be passed even without hearing the 
claimant. An order in favour of a party can be passed

*145* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

behind his back even. But the question is whether an 
order affecting the interests of the claimant adversely 
can be passed without hearing him. Having regard to 
the object which the provisions placed in Section 
20(1)(b) of the Act have to achieve and also having 
regard to the serious consequences which will ensue in 
case the claim for exemption is rejected without 
hearing the claimant, it has to be held that the 
claimant has to be heard before refusal of his claim 
for exemption, so that he may show that there will be 
undue hardship to him in case exemption is not 
granted. Section 20(1)(b) of the Act does not negate 
natural justice and in absence of express exclusion of 
the rule of audi alteram partem, it is fair, indeed 
fundamental, that the person claiming exemption 
should not be prejudiced by action without 
opportunity to show the contrary. 

6. 
The power of exemption has the effect of restoring the 
applicability of the general law by taking away the 
exemption to it created by the special law, 
Accordingly, the power to claim exemption is a 
valuable right. Where under the provisions of an Act 
an authority is empowered to grant exemption and a 
person has a right to claim it on fulfilment of 
statutory conditions, the authority is bound to hear 
him and pass a speaking order giving reasons in 
support of its finding that he is not entitled to the 
exemption. 

7. 
Faced with this situation Shri Kulshreshtra contended 
that the satisfaction postulated by the aforesaid 
provision is subjective satisfaction merely and that in 
absence of a corresponding provision in Clause (b) of 
Section 20(1) for giving an opportunity of hearing, as 
placed in Subsection (2) of Section 20 of the Act, 
hearing of the petitioners prior to passing of the 
impugned order was not necessary. 

8. 
Satisfaction of the State Government contemplated by 
cl. (b) of Section 20(1) of the Act has to be with 
regard to the nature of hardship, which would be

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*146* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

caused to the claimant. Accordingly, the satisfaction 
envisaged has to be objective in its character and 
cannot be subjective satisfaction merely, the 
touchstone for testing the validity or otherwise of the 
satisfaction having been provided by the law. The 
function of the State Government accordingly is of a 
quasijudicial character. 

9. 
It is true that unlike Subsection (2) of Section 20 in 
Clause (b) there is no specific provision for giving a 
reasonable opportunity to the person concerned, but 
from the language employed therein and in view of 
the object which the provision has to achieve it has to 
be regarded that acting upon the principle of natural 
justice regarding hearing of the claimant is necessary 
while deciding his claim for exemption thereunder. A 
bare perusal of the impugned order will show that it 
has been passed in accordance with the order passed 
by the State Government in the department of Land 
Records and Settlement on 2311980 rejecting the 
application of the petitioners for grant of exemption. 
It is not shown that the petitioners were either heard 
by the State Government prior to passing of the order 
conveyed vide Annexure R/5, to the Deputy 
Commissioner of Land Records and Settlement, who 
passed the order contained in Annexure P/2, in 
pursuance thereof . 

10. 
…... 

11. 
Another contention put forth by Shri Kulshrestra was 
that in view of the proviso to Clause (b), recording of 
reasons is necessary only in case of grant of 
exemption. This contention does not merit acceptance. 
The expression "no order under this clause" is wide 
enough to cover the order of grant as well as refusal. 
Even otherwise, if in case of granting exemption 
reasons are required to be stated it beats ones 
imagination how in cases of rejection a claim for 
exemption recording of reasons can be regarded to be 
unnecessary.

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

12. 
Lastly, it was contended by Shri Kulshrestra that the 
use of the word "may" in Clause (b) of Section 20(1) 
of the Act does show that the power is discretionary 
and if in its discretion the State Government have 
rejected the application no challenge can be 
entertained against the order of rejection. The 
contention advanced by Shri Kulshrestra on the point 
overlook the principle of law that when power is given 
to a public authority, there may be circumstances 
which couple with the power a duty to exercise it. 
Where a power is deposited with a public officer for 
this purpose of being used for the benefit of persons 
specifically pointed out with regard to whom a 
definition is supplied by the legislature of the 
conditions upon which they are entitled to call for its 
exercise, that power ought to be exercised. See 
Jullius v. Lord Bishon of Oxford, ((187480) ALL ER 
Rep. 43 (HL) at p.47. Viewed from this angle, it 
appears that the provisions placed in Section 20(1)(b) 
of the Act are for the benefit of holders and the power 
conferred thereby is exercisable for their benefit for 
averting undue hardship that would be caused to 
them if the land in respect of which exemption is 
claimed is not exempted from the operation of the Act. 
Accordingly, on case being made out, exemption has 
to be granted and the State Government cannot 
withhold the exemption claimed. As such, the word 
"may'' cannot be construed in a manner to clothe the 
State Government with arbitrary power to reject an 
application for exemption, even if the conditions for 
grant thereof stand made out."

This judgment has been followed by another Division Bench

State of Gujarat). We are not concerned with other findings and

"3. 
…....... The Government's satisfaction about granting 
or not granting the exemption under that provision 
obviously rests on objective facts. The factors which 
are required to be taken into account by the 
Government are (1) the location of the land, (2) the 
purpose for which such land was used at the time the 
application comes to be made or (3) the purpose for 
which such land is proposed to be used in future and 
(4) such other relevant factors as make the 
Government decide that it is necessary or expedient 
and that too in the public interest to grant the 
exemption. What is public interest is a matter difficult 
to be defined, but not difficult to be understood by 
description. A good deal of factors would be required 
to be examined by the Government under this head it 
is well said that in a complex spectrum of facts like 
the one required to be examined by the Government 
for the purpose of exercising its powers under S. 
20(1)(a) which powers are not absolute powers but 
are powers coupled with a duty. The Government 
must have proper presentation of materials before it 
More often than not if such a complex issue is taken 
on hand by the Government ex parte, incorrect or 
improper decision is likely to arise. It is, therefore, in 
the fitness of the things that the Government should 
ordinarily hear the applicant if the Government is 
prima facie and ex parte inclined to take a view that 
the exemption was not to be granted. If an applicant 
has specifically sought for an opportunity to present 
the case personally or through an agent in a situation 
like the one arising under S. 20(1)(a) of the Act it is 
all the more necessary for the State Government to 
hear the applicant. …........ When a citizen applies for 
exemption say for example, for establishing any 
industry and such proposed future user of the land is 
one of the relevant factors to be counted while dealing 
with an application under S. 20(1)(a) of the Act, the 
citizen in such a situation would be able to explain his 
difficulties more effectively if personal hearing is 
granted. It is because of this far reaching effect of the 
Governments decision on his prospects that we say 
that the hearing is required to be read as the implicit

requirement of the provisions of the S. 20(1)(a)(b) of 
the Act. 

5. 
It is no doubt true that the judgment of the Madhya 
Pradesh High Court was one relating to an 
application for exemption under sub cl (b) of sub s. 
(2) of S. 20 of the Act but the underlying principles 
remain the same. As a matter of fact some petitions in 
this group are the petitions for exemption under S. 
20(1)(b) itself. To our mind the underlying principles 
remain the same when the Government has to 
consider an application for exemption either under Cl 
(a) or Cl (b) of sub s. (1) of S. 20 of the Act. In this 
view of the matter these nine petitions beginning with 
the Special Civil Application No.2181/83 are required 
to be allowedby setting aside the orders of refusal to 
grant exemption. The outcome will he that the 
Government will afford a reasonable opportunity of 
audience to all these petitioners and then decide their 
applications afresh in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act. The extension of opportunity of audience 
can be best proved to have been given by the necessary 
corollary of giving reasons if the vigorous submission's 
of the applicants are dealt with by a reasonably 
reasoned order, It is in the interest of the Government 
also to give a reasoned order in order to escape the 
charge of non application of mind. We accordingly 
direct to give personal hearing to these petitioners and 
decide the matters by a reasonably reasoned order." 

103 
The above quoted observations of the Division Bench of the 

Gujarat High Court and prior thereto of the Madhya Pradesh High Court 

have our respectful concurrence. 

104 
Similar view has been taken by the learned Single Judge of 

Karnataka High Court in the judgment reported in AIR 1987 Karnataka 5

Authority, Mangalore). In paragraph 16 this is what is held: 

"16. 
It is true that unlike subsection (2) of Section 20, in 
clauses (a) and (b), there is no specific provision for 
giving a reasonable opportunity to the person 
concerned. But it seems to me from the language 
employed therein and also in view of the object sought 
to be achieved, it is to be regarded that acting upon 
the principles of natural justice regarding hearing of 
the claimant is necessary while deciding his claim for 
exemption thereunder. Satisfaction of the State 
Government contemplated under clauses (a) and (b) 
of subsection (1) of Section 20 of the Act has to, be 
with regard to the question of public interest or the 
nature of hard ship, which would be caused to the 
claimant. Having regard to these objects to be 
achieved, it must be reasonable to hold that the 
satisfaction envisaged has to be objective in its 
character and cannot be merely subjective satisfaction 
the touchstone for testing the validity or otherwise of 
the satisfaction having been provided by the law. In 
this view, the function of the State Government, 
appears to me, is of a quasijudicial character. The 
view I take gains support from a decision of the 
Madhya Pradesh High Court in Nandakishore v. 
State, AIR 1982 Madh. Pra. 33." 

105 
The above observations have been followed in a Division 

Bench judgment of this Court reported in 1988 Mh.L.J. 773 (Janardhan 

Gadekar v/s Assistant Collector and Competent Authority). (see para 13). 

106 
The above conclusions are enough to show that the power to 

exempt cannot be said to be legislative, but is held to be quasijudicial in 

nature. It is, therefore, clear that the said power can be invoked by the 

applicant/ individual also. Secondly, it requires an order to be passed in 

either event and which should be communicated to the party/ person.

This would outline the nature of the power and which surely cannot be 

said to be legislative in character. We need not, therefore, refer to any 

further decisions and which would set out the difference between the 

powers, namely, legislative and quasijudicial. 

107 
The judgments that have been cited by Mr.Naphade must 

now be noted. He strenuously urged that he is supported in his argument 

by the judgment of the learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh High 

Court in Writ Petition No.26474 of 2009 (Surendra Raj Jaiswal v/s 

Government of Andhra Pradesh) decided on 24.08.2011. There, the Writ 

Petition was filed challenging the rejection by the Government of the 

claim of the Petitioners and permission sought by them to construct a 

multiplex theatrecumshopping complex in the place of existing cinema 

theatre. It was their case that they had filed declaration declaring various 

extents of land held by them along with their father on the 

commencement of the Principal Act. They also filed an application before 

the Government seeking exemption from ChapterIII of the Principal Act 

so as to run an existing cinema theatre on their property called Deepak 

Mahal Cinema situate at Narayanguda in Hyderabad Urban 

Agglomeration. The order of exemption was passed and with a condition 

that the said land should be utilized only for running a cinema theatre 

and subject to further conditions which are incorporated in the order of 

exemption. It was by virtue of exemption order that cinema theatre was 

being run. Thereafter, the Principal Act was repealed in the State of 

Andhra Pradesh after adoption of the Repeal Act with effect from 

27.03.2008. It is in these circumstances that the Petitioners argued that 

they are entitled to use the property for construction of Multiplex Theatre 

cum shopping complex. We find that from paragraphs 2 to 6 the facts

*152* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

are noted. Thereafter, in paragraph 8 reference is made to the Principal 

Act and the power to exempt. Then in paragraph 9 reference is made to 

the Repeal Act. In paragraphs 10 and 11 the learned Single Judge held as 

under: 

"10. 
From a perusal of the aforesaid provisions under 
Sections 3 and 4 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and 
Regulation) Repeal Act of 1999, it is clear that the 
orders granting exemption under subsection (1) of 
Section 20 of the principal Act are saved. It is also 
clear from a perusal of the provision under Section 
3(1)(c) of the Repealing Act that repeal of the 
principal Act shall not affect any payments made to 
the State Government as a condition for granting 
exemption under subsection (1) of Section 20 of the 
principal Act. But, at the same time, the provision 
under subsection (2) of Section 20 is not saved. 
Section 20(1) of the principal Act empowers the 
Government to exempt any land subject to certain 
conditions, but under subsection (2) of Section 20 of 
the principal Act, the Government was empowered to 
withdraw such exemption in cases where conditions 
are violated. A harmonious reading of the provisions 
under Sections 20(1) and 20(2) of the principal Act, 
coupled with Section 3 of the Repealing Act, makes it 
clear that the order granting exemption is saved only 
with a view to avoid repayment of any amounts 
collected by the State Government, while granting 
exemptions. When the principal Act itself is repealed 
on the ground that it has failed to achieve the 
objective expected of it, it is not open for the 1 st 
respondentGovernment to refuse permission in the 
instant case, only on the ground that the conditions 
imposed in the order granting exemption shall 
continue to operate. In the absence of any saving 
clause, saving subsection (2) of Section 20 of the 
principal Act, even in cases where conditions are 
violated, Government is not empowered to withdraw 
the exemptions granted under Section 20(1) of the 
principal Act, after coming into force of the Urban 
Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999. In

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

the absence of such power, and further, in view of the 
Repealing Act itself, the conditions imposed in the 
order granting exemption, have become un 
enforceable and are nonest. In the absence of 
initiation of proceedings or withdrawal of exemption 
granted under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act 
before the enforcement of the Urban Land (Ceiling 
and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999, the land, which is 
exempted, will become a freehold land, and hence, the 
stand of the respondents that even after coming into 
force of the Repealing Act, 1999, the conditions 
imposed in the order granting exemption under 
Section 20(1) of the principal Act shall continue to 
operate, cannot be accepted. The said interpretation 
will run contra to the very objective of the Urban 
Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999. Said 
view also gains support from the other provisions of 
the Repealing Act, particularly Section 4, which states 
that all proceedings relating to any order made or 
purported to be made under the principal Act, 
pending immediately before the commencement of the 
Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act of 
1999, shall stand abate, except in cases where 
possession is taken by the State Government or any 
person duly authorized by the State Government on 
behalf of the competent authority. 

11. 
Having regard to the provisions under Section 20(1) 
and (2) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) 
Act, 1976 and the provisions under Sections 3 and 4 
of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal 
Act, 1999, it is to be held that in cases where the 
vacant land is exempted under Section 20 of the 
principal Act and where such exemption is not 
withdrawn before the enforcement of the Repealing 
Act, 1999, such land will become the freehold land 
irrespective of any conditions with regard to usage of 
the exempted land. As held above, as the land in 
question has become the freehold land in view of the 
Repealing Act, 1999, there appears no reason or 
justification for not granting permission to use the 
land covered by exemption proceedings, for the

purpose of multiplex theatrecum shopping complex. 
In a strict sense, no such permission is necessary, but, 
when the competent authority under the Greater 
Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act has not 
received the application, petitioner had to approach 
the Government, and as permission is denied by 
misconstruing the various provisions of the Repealing 
Act, 1999, the impugned order is liable to be set 
aside." 

108 
We do not see how firstly in the teeth of the factual position 

where apart from the controversy with regard to survival of the order of 

exemption and conditions thereunder post repeal, could the permission to 

construct a multiplex theatrecumshopping complex in place of the 

existing cinema theatre have been refused by the State Government. The 

user was more or less similar with the original one. Apart therefrom the 

learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh has not referred to any of the 

judgments of the Honourable Supreme Court on the point and 

particularly the decision in the case of Bansidhar (supra). The learned 

Single Judge's attention was not invited to several aspects of the 

controversy and which we have extensively noted above. The learned 

Single Judge, therefore, with greatest respect, was not right in holding 

that in the absence of any reference to subsection (2) of Section 20 of the 

Principal Act in clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal 

Act the conditions imposed in the order granting exemption do not 

continue to operate. We do not find any reference made to Section 6 of 

the General Clauses Act either. With greatest respect, we are unable to 

agree with the view taken by the learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh 

High Court in the decision referred above.

109 
While on this point we also do not agree with Mr.Gangal 

when he relies on the view taken by another Single Judge of Madras High 

Court in Writ Petition No.46091 of 2002 and W.P.M.P. No.30655 of 

2004 decided on 29.01.2007 (L.Kannappan and L. Thirunavukarasu v/s 

The Government of Tamil Nadu). There, the arguments were with regard 

to acquisition of agricultural lands. Therein the Petitioners represented by 

their father purchased the agricultural lands. After the property was 

purchased the same was cultivated. The land was always agricultural 

land. In relation to such an agricultural land the proceedings under the 

Tamil Nadu Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1978 were initiated 

and were sought to be continued. The Petitioners sought to make 

payment for obtaining extract from the records of right at which point of 

time it was informed that the lands have been acquired in the name of 

Dr.N.Sivasamy. In these circumstances and by holding that the acquisition 

under the said Ceiling Act when it was in force itself was invalid that the 

Writ Petition was allowed. Apart therefrom it was urged that since the 

Petitioners are in possession and enjoyment of the lands as reflected in 

the revenue records and possession was not taken from them the 

proceedings in that regard abate by virtue of the Repeal Act. This decision 

more or less is on applicability of Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act and 

not an authority on the point in the present case. It is, therefore, clearly 

distinguishable. 

110 
Mr.Naphade's reliance upon a judgment of the Delhi High 

Court in the case of Tej Pratap Singh v/s Union of India in Writ Petition 

(Civil) No.2455/1992 decided on 16.07.2009 must now be noted. 

There, a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court had before it a situation 

where the exemption was granted in terms of Section 20(1)(a) and 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*156* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Section 22 of the Principal Act on 02.07.1992 subject to the condition 

that the Petitioners before the Delhi High Court would make payment of 

Rs.18,37,74,528/ to the Land & Building Department, Delhi 

Administration within 45 days. Aggrieved and dissatisfied with this 

condition the Writ Petition was filed in the Delhi High Court in 1992 itself 

which was styled as Writ Petition (Civil) No.2455/1992. During the 

pendency thereof the Repeal Act came into force. The facts have been 

noted and particularly that the Petitioner was pursuing his claim for 

exemption for the purpose of redevelopment of the property. He rather 

invited a decision from the Authorities on his application. That was 

because his building plans were not sanctioned. A Division Bench of Delhi 

High Court passed the interim order in another Civil Writ Petition which 

is referred to in paragraph 4 of the judgment. That interim order was 

challenged before the Honourable Supreme Court and the Honourable 

Supreme Court passed an order directing the competent authority under 

the Principal Act to decide the Petitioner's application. That is how the 

order impugned in the subject Writ Petition was passed. The earlier Writ 

Petition was disposed of as infructuous in the light of the Repeal Act being 

brought into force. 

111 
The argument was that the conditional exemption granted 

would not survive the repeal of the Principal Act. At best and at the 

highest if a condition of payment is not satisfied, then, the State 

Government could have withdrawn the exemption order when the 

Principal Act was in force. But, now same having been repealed that is no 

longer possible. We find that this was an alternate argument, but the 

main argument was that because the Principal Act is repealed there is no 

question of any exemption sought being granted or the question of grant

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

of any exemption does not arise. Therefore, understood in the above 

perspective the controversy was whether the claim for exemption made 

by the Petitioner and the conditional order of exemption would survive 

post repeal. The Petitioner had challenged the condition imposed in the 

order of exemption and he had not abided by the condition admittedly. 

There was thus no exemption order in force. Yet in such a matter a 

Division Bench of Delhi High Court made the following observations: 

"11. The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 2 to 4 
submitted that Section 3(1)(b) of the Repealing Act 
would apply in this case whereby the exemption order 
has been specifically saved. Therefore, according to the 
learned counsel, the repeal of the ULCR Act would not 
affect the conditional exemption granted by virtue of the 
order dated 02.07.1992. The learned counsel for the 
respondent nos. 2 to 4 also submitted that the repeal is 
prospective and not retrospective. He also referred to 
Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which deals 
with the effect of repeal. The said Section stipulates that 
repeal of an enactment by a Repealing Act, unless a 
different intention appears, shall not, inter alia, affect 
any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, 
accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed. 
Consequently, it was submitted that the right of the 
petitioner to get an exemption under Section 20 (1) (a) 
was subject to the liability of making the said payment 
and other conditions which were imposed by the 
exemption order. According to him, by virtue of Section 
6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, the said liability, 
which had been incurred by the petitioner to make the 
said payment and to comply with the other conditions 
for the grant of exemption, was specifically saved by the 
Repealing Act. 

12. 
We have considered the arguments advanced by the 
counsel for the parties. One thing is clear that the ULCR 
Act has been repealed by the said Repealing Act. We have 
already quoted Sections 3 and 4 of the Repealing Act. 
Section 4 deals with abatement of legal proceedings and 
stipulates that all proceedings leading to any order made

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

or purported to be made under the principal Act pending 
immediately before the commencement of the Repealing 
Act before any court, tribunal or other authority shall 
abate. In other words, all such proceedings shall abate 
on and from the coming into force of the Repealing Act. 
There is a proviso to this Section which stipulates that it 
would not apply to proceedings relating to Sections 11, 
12, 13 and 14 of the ULCR Act insofar as such 
proceedings are relatable to the land, possession of 
which has been taken over by the State Government or 
any person duly authorized by the State Government in 
this behalf or by the competent authority. From a 
reading of the entire Section 4 of the Repealing Act, it is 
clear that all proceedings for declaring excess vacant 
land and acquisition of the said excess vacant land come 
to a halt except the proceedings pertaining to Sections 
11, 12, 13 and 14 of the ULCR Act provided possession 
of the land in question has not been taken over by the 
State Government. In other words, those lands which 
had not been taken into possession by the State 
Government are excluded even in respect of the 
proceedings relating to Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14. It is 
clear that the intent of the Legislature was not to 
implement the provisions of the ULCR Act any further if 
they had not already resulted in the taking over of 
possession of the lands in question. This is the general 
intent which is discernable from a plain reading of 
Section 4 of the Repealing Act. In the present case, it is 
an admitted position that the land in question, which is 
situated at 23, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi, has not 
been taken into possession by the State Government. In 
fact, the stage of the present case is that an order under 
Section 8(4) of the ULCR Act has been passed and a 
final statement has also been prepared under Section 9 
of the same Act. The matter has not proceeded to the 
stage of Section 10 which relates to acquisition of excess 
land and vesting of the said excess land in the State 
Government. There is, therefore, no question of the case 
having proceeded to any stage beyond Section 9 of the 
ULCR Act. 

13. 
This takes us to the consideration of the Savings Clause

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*159* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

provided in Section 3 of the Repealing Act. Section 3 (1) 
(a) clearly stipulates that the repeal of the ULCR Act 
shall not affect the vesting of any vacant land under sub 
section (3) of Section 10, possession of which has been 
taken over by the State Government or any person duly 
authorized by the State Government in this behalf or by 
the competent authority. We have noted above that the 
possession of the property in question is still with the 
petitioners and, therefore, this Clause is clearly 
inapplicable. Section 3 (1) (b) stipulates that the repeal 
shall not affect the validity of any order granting 
exemption under subsection (1) of Section 20 or any 
action taken thereunder, notwithstanding any judgment 
of any court to the contrary. Section 3 (1) (c) provides 
that the repeal shall not affect any payment made to the 
State Government as a condition for granting exemption 
under sub section (1) of Section 20. Reading sub 
sections 3 (1) (a), (b) and (c) together, it appears to us 
that the intention of the Legislature is that where an 
exemption has been granted in favour of a land holder, 
that is not to be disturbed notwithstanding any 
judgment of any court to the contrary. The further 
intention that can be discerned from the said provisions 
is that the payment made to the State Government as a 
part of a condition for granting exemption under Section 
20 (1) is also saved. From this, it can be understood 
that had it not been specifically provided that the 
payment made to the State Government as a condition 
for grant of exemption will not be affected by the repeal, 
the same would have been affected by the repeal. In 
other words, what this provision intends to save is the 
actual payment, if any, made to the State Government 
as a condition for granting exemption under Section 20 
(1) of ULCR Act and not the condition itself. In the 
context of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, 
the petitioner s right to exemption under section 20(1) 
" 
of the ULCR Act is specifically saved, but, not the 
"liability to make the payment, unless the payment had 
" 
already been made prior to the repeal. The General 
Clauses Act, 1897 would, therefore, apply subject to this 
intention. And, the intention of Parliament appears to 
be that: (1) if any payments are made to the State 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*160* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Government, that is not to be disturbed and (2) if any 
exemption has been granted, that is also not to be 
disturbed. It does appear to us that after the repeal, the 
conditions of exemption which remain unimplemented 
cannot now be implemented because they are not 
specifically saved. The reason behind this being that 
ceiling in respect of urban lands by itself has been 
repealed altogether." 

112 
For the reasons that we have recorded hereinabove, with 

greatest respect, we are unable to agree with the Division Bench of Delhi 

High Court. What has been held is that Section 3(1)(c) of the Repeal Act 

saves is the payment made to the State Government as a condition for 

granting exemption and not the condition itself. These observations are 

contrary to the further observations that by virtue of Section 6 of the 

General Clauses Act the Petitioner's right to exemption under Section 

20(1) of the Principal Act is specifically saved, but not the liability to 

make the payment unless payment had already been made prior to the 

repeal. We do not see how such conclusion can be reached by the Division 

Bench after holding that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 

applies to the repeal. To the extent that we have held to the contrary, with 

greatest respect, we are unable to agree with the Delhi High Court's 

judgment. 

113 
Equally, Mr.Naphade's reliance upon the judgments of the 

Honourable Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. v/s Hari Ram 

reported in (2013) 4 SCC 280, M/s Tata Coffee Limited v/s Government of 

Andhra Pradesh in Writ Petition No.11929 of 2013 decided on 

22.07.2013 (Andhra Pradesh High Court) and Gajanan Kamlya Patil v/s 

Additional Collector & Competent Authority in Civil Appeal

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

No.2069/2014 decided on 14.02.2014 by the Honourable Supreme 

Court, is misplaced. Hari Ram's case (supra) was directly concerned when 

the State fails to take possession of the excess vacant land pursuant to the 

notification under Section 10(3) of the Principal Act. This is a decision on 

applicability of Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. True it is that the 

Honourable Supreme Court held that the word "vesting" or "vested" may 

or may not include transfer of possession, but all such observations must 

be seen in the context of the controversy, namely, the land being not taken 

over physically. At the same time, the Honourable Supreme Court has 

clarified in paragraph 41 of this judgment that the question whether a 

right has been acquired or liability incurred under a statute before it is 

repealed will in each case depend on the construction of the statute and 

the facts of a particular case. 

114 
Similar is the situation with the judgment in the case of 

Gajanan Kamlya Patil (supra). There, the question was whether this Court 

was justified in relegating the parties to file a civil suit to recover the 

lands so as to get benefit of the Repeal Act. On facts it was found that the 

Government failed to take actual possession of the surplus land before 

29.11.2007. In this backdrop and following the judgment in Hari Ram 

(supra) that the order passed by the High Court was set aside and the 

Appeals were allowed. 

115 
M/s Tata Coffee Limited judgment (supra) is once again by 

the learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court and there, the 

controversy was more or less identical inasmuch as the application for 

exemption was filed. The exemption was granted and the land was to be 

put to a user as specified in the order. That was done by the predecessor

intitle of M/s Tata Coffee. Thereafter, the successor M/s Tata Coffee 

sought permission/ no objection certificate from the Joint Collector, 

Ranga Reddy district for utilization of the subject land for the purpose of 

development of housing scheme including providing of shelter to the 

weaker sections of the society. The Collector informed that the NOC 

cannot be granted unless the State Government accorded permission. 

That is how the representation was made to the State Government and 

which was rejected. For the reasons that we have recorded above, with 

greatest respect, we are unable to agree with the view taken by the 

learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court. 

116 
Mr.Naphade then placed reliance on the judgment of the 

Honourable Supreme Court in Synco Industries Limited v/s Assessing 

Officer, Income Tax, Mumbai reported in (2008) 4 SCC 22 wherein in the 

context of interpretation placed on the Income Tax Act and some of it's 

provisions, the Honourable Supreme Court held that where the 

predominant majority of High Courts have taken a particular view of the 

legal provision and interpreted it, the Supreme Court would lean in 

favour of this predominant view, but exceptions to this principle are also 

set out. Once we have set out the reasons for disagreeing with the views 

taken by other High Courts, we do not see how this principle can be of 

any assistance. 

117 
For the reasons that we have recorded above we do not find 

that the judgments relied upon by Mr.Naphade carry his submissions any 

further. 

118 
Now we are left with reliance placed by Mr.Naphade,

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Mr.Sathe and Mr.Devitre on the judgments of this Court. 

119 
Before that we would refer to some of the judgments which 

have been relied upon by the learned Advocate General. Apart from 

Bansidhar (supra) and the State of Punjab v/s Mohar Singh Pratap Singh 

reported in AIR 1955 SC 84, the learned Advocate General relied upon 

the judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Her 

Highness Maharani Shantidevi P. Gaikwad vs. Savjibhai Haribhai Patel and 

Others reported in (2001) 5 SCC 101. We at once clarify that for our 

purposes we are not required to decide as to whether the judgment of the 

Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Atia Mohammadi Begum 

v/s State of U.P. (supra) stands overruled and to what extent. What we 

find is that irrespective of whether Atia Begum (supra) is partially 

overruled or not, the fact remains that compliance with the provisions of 

the Principal Act is with reference to the date of it's commencement. The 

land will have to be determined with reference to this date and that is 

how it is treated and dealt with in the further provisions of the Principal 

Act. The extent of the excess vacant land may be a matter for 

determination and computation, but the time and period, so also, the date 

on which it is so reckoned is not in any way affected. Hence, reliance on 

the judgment in the case of Atia Begum (supra) and other judgments by 

Mr.Naphade and equally by the learned Advocate General need not detain 

us. 

120 
The learned Advocate General relied upon the judgment in 

Shantidevi Gaikwad (supra) to show that Bansidhar (supra) is followed 

and applied. That we find to be accurate on perusal of paragraphs 43 to 

45 of this judgment. Mr.Naphade also relied upon these paragraphs to 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*164* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

urge that a different intention appears in the Repeal Act involved in the 

present case. However, we find that the Honourable Supreme Court has 

reiterated the principle that a repealing statute is not exhaustive and does 

not automatically extinguish the accrued rights unless taken away 

expressly. 

121 
There is substance in the arguments of the learned Advocate 

General that if the Petitioners are claiming that the exemption confers in 

them a right or privilege, then, they cannot turn around and say that if it 

is conditional then the rights or privilege survive the repeal, but the 

conditions do not. If their arguments are accepted, then, even the right or 

privilege claimed would not survive. That would lead to absurd 

consequences. If relying upon the exemption order the excess vacant land 

is retained and put to use in accordance with the terms and conditions of 

the exemption order, then, the repeal of the Principal Act would mean the 

exemption order even if treated as valid would not survive. However, the 

exemption order is expressly saved and therefore, arriving at a conclusion 

that the exemption order is treated valid for all purposes, namely, the 

right that it creates and the obligation that it imposes on parties. It is only 

such an interpretation which would subserve the object of the Repeal Act 

and read as a whole. 

122 
For the reasons that we have recorded above and since this is 

the principle which can be culled out from the decisions relied upon by 

the learned Advocate General that reference to any further judgments on 

the same point is unnecessary. Suffice it to reiterate that reliance placed 

by the learned Advocate General on these judgments is well placed.

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

123 
We are also in agreement with the learned Advocate General 

when he relies on the judgments of the Honourable Supreme Court which 

have been referred to and followed the view taken in Bansidhar's case 

(supra). We have already reproduced the paragraphs of those judgments 

and as extracted in Bansidhar (supra). We agree with the emphasis by 

Mr.Khambata on the principle that the liability to handover the excess 

vacant land relates back to the appointed day or the date of 

commencement of the Principal Act in any event. Therefore, it is clear 

that these judgments and which are extensively referred in Bansidhar's 

case (supra) cannot be brushed aside by us. 

124 
Reliance has been further placed on the judgment in the case 

of Voltas Limited v/s Additional Collector & Competent Authority reported 

in 2008 (5) Bombay Cases Reporter 746. While it is true that the 

judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court in Bansidhar's case (supra) 

was cited before the Division Bench deciding Voltas, but we do not find 

any reference being made to the same. First of all this judgment is not 

interpreting Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act. It is a judgment and it 

remains a judgment analyzing and interpreting Section 3(1)(a) of the 

Repeal Act. Mr.Naphade heavily relies upon this judgment and to urge 

that this judgment supports his submission that the only consequence 

which would follow withdrawal of exemption order by exercising the 

powers under Section 20(2) of the Principal Act is to apply ChapterIII of 

the Principal Act and particularly the Section enabling vesting of the same 

free from all encumbrances in the State of Maharashtra. His submission 

presupposes that withdrawal is mandatory or that unless the exemption is 

withdrawn the terms and conditions, if any, in the exemption order 

cannot be enforced. We do not see how such absolute proposition 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*166* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

emerges from reading of the judgment in Voltas Limited (supra). If 

paragraph 11 of this judgment is carefully perused the Division Bench 

while analyzing Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act, so also, Section 3(2) 

thereof holds that the land owner will get back title of the land only on 

payment of the amount that he has received under the Principal Act from 

the Government. It is in these circumstances that we are of the opinion 

that this judgment must be seen as confined to this part of the Repeal Act 

and cannot, therefore, be said to be construing other provisions of the 

Repeal Act. The observations in paragraph 12 of this judgment in the 

context of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act must be also seen as being 

made so as to reinforce the conclusion with regard to applicability of 

Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. 

125 
Then, there is reliance placed on the judgment in the case of 

Vithabai Bama Bhandari v/s State of Maharashtra reported in 2009 (3) 

BCR 663. There, the facts are to be found from paragraphs 2 to 12. They 

would reveal that the essential relief was that the notice issued under 

Sections 9 and 10 of the Principal Act be declared as abated. The petition 

was by the holder of the land and more particularly described in the 

judgment. The Petitioner was declared as holding surplus land. She 

sought an exemption and the power under Section 20 was exercised with 

a condition that 31 tenements of 40 sq.mtrs. each i.e. 1180.04 sq.mtrs. to 

be sold to the Government nominees at fixed rate. The Petitioner, 

therefore, made an application proposing to develop the land so as to 

implement the scheme, but that proposal for development was rejected. 

The Appeals were filed under the Principal Act, namely, under Section 33 

and a fresh inquiry under Section 8(4) of the Principal Act was directed. 

In pursuance thereof the holding of the Petitioner was determined afresh.

*167* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

An application was made for implementation of the scheme under Section 

20 and in accordance with which the construction permission was 

granted, construction was commenced and was completed within the 

time frame prescribed for the same. It appears that the Petitioner 

requested the Government/ competent authority to take possession of the 

flats meant for the Government nominees, but before any further steps 

could be taken, the Petitioner was informed that the exemption granted 

under Section 20 itself was withdrawn. The Petitioner was served with a 

notice under Section 10(5) calling upon her to handover possession of 

surplus land due to non compliance of the conditions of exemption under 

Section 20 of the Principal Act. That notice was challenged in the petition. 

That is how the Petitioner relied upon the Repeal Act and in order to 

avoid the consequences which would flow from cancellation or 

withdrawal of the exemption order. The discussion in paragraphs 42, 43, 

44, 45 and 46 of the judgment would reveal that the Division Bench was 

only concerned with Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. Nothing else from 

the Repeal Act has been noticed far from any larger controversy. In such 

circumstances we do not think that this judgment is on the point and 

particularly which has been referred to us. Apart therefrom what we find 

is that the Division Bench did not allow the State to rely upon Section 

3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act because the exemption order had already been 

withdrawn. The question of saving such an order and when the State 

desired to take possession of the land despite repeal of the Principal Act 

and in the teeth of Section 3(1)(a) thereof, therefore, rightly did not 

arise. However, we find that the observations made by the Division Bench 

in paragraphs 38 to 51 to the extent of applicability of Section 6 of the 

General Clauses Act insofar as contrary to what we have held above, do 

not lay down the correct law.

126 
In the case of Mohan Gopalrao Mate v/s Principal Secretary 

reported in 2009 (1) Bom.C.R. 275, once again it must be noted that the 

Petitioner therein is an exMLA. He had challenged certain Government 

Resolutions which impact large number of housing schemes and affect 

large number of individual flat owners. That was in relation to handing 

over and sale to the Government nominees at the prescribed or 

predetermined rates for the Government quota flats. It was general 

grievance and projected in public interest which was dealt with by the 

Division Bench. Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of this judgment read as under: 

"3. 
Counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that 
the petitioner has filed the present petition in the 
interest of Public as the Government Resolutions 
dated 8.11.2007 and 12.4.2007 are against the 
Public Policy and would affect the citizens who are the 
original owners of the lands and were legally granted 
exemption to hold vacant lands in excess of the ceiling 
limit U/s. 20 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and 
Regulation) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as "the 
ULC Act", which has been repealed w.e.f. 29.11.2007 
by the Government by adopting the Urban Land 
(Ceiling And Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 
(hereinafter referred to as "the Repeal Act"). Though 
the ULC Act has been repealed intentionally and 
malafidely, Government has issued the aforesaid 
resolutions which are impugned in this petition. As a 
result, the Government, instead of ruling out 
manipulation, is giving opportunity to the respondent 
Nos. 2 and 3 to take arbitrary and malafide decision 
so as to harass the original land owners/scheme 
holders as well as a common man who has purchased 
the flats in the said Scheme. It is submitted that, after 
granting exemption to hold vacant land in excess of 
the ceiling limit under section 20 of the ULC Act, the 
land owners have to surrender certain portion of the 
vacant land to the Government free of cost. The 
Government, prior to adoption of Repeal Act, allowed

to utilize such lands by the original land owners 
under the provisions of section 23 of the said Act, if it 
was not possible to use such a land for any public 
purpose and was likely to be encroached. It is further 
submitted that considering inability of Government to 
protect the possession of said land, it was permissible 
to the land owners to buyback such lands vide 
Government Resolution No.ULC 10 (2004)/C 
No.93/ULCA2 dated 14.07.2004. However, for no 
cogent reason, Government has issued the impugned 
Resolution dated 8.11.2007 which is primafacie 
arbitrary, unjust and not in the public interest and 
therefore, the same is liable to be quashed and set 
aside. This decision of the Government is arbitrary 
and that would give rise to the respondent Nos. 2 and 
3 to allot such lands (surrendered lands) to the men 
of their choice. This has happened on a large scale, as 
has been specifically observed and pointed out by the 
"JUSTICE BATTA COMMISSION" and therefore, 
revoking the earlier decision i.e. buyback of 
surrendered land, again there would be accumulation 
of huge lands with the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 and 
there would be repetition of the malafide acts by the 
respondent Nos. 2 and 3. As a result of which, the 
main aim and object of the Special Act would be 
defeated. 

4. 
It is submitted by the learned counsel for the 
petitioner that Government has issued a G.R. dated 
31.07.2006, however, the effect and operation of said 
Government Resolution has been stayed by this Court 
in Writ Petition No.4966 of 2006 by passing the 
following orders: 

Order dt.4.10.2006 : 
"Heard Mr. C.V.Kale, Adv. for the petitioner. 
Notice returnable in three weeks. 
Mr.Agrawal, AGP waives notice on behalf of 
respondent nos. 1 to 3. 
In the meanwhile, the parties to maintain

Order dt. 7.11.2006 : 
"We grant adinterim relief in terms of prayer 
clause (ii) of the petition during the pendency of the

disposed of. 

Order dt. 8.12.2006 : 
"In the meantime, the authorities need not pass 
orders on the applications made under the scheme 
until further orders." 

5. 
However, the Government has issued a fresh G.R. dt. 
12.4.2007 flouting the aforesaid orders passed by 
this Court in Writ Petition No.4966 of 2006 and 
therefore, the Govt Resolution dt. 12.4.2007 is liable 
to be quashed and set aside." 

127 
Thereafter, the arguments of the Petitioner have been noted 

and which we find from paragraphs 8 to 21. From paragraph 22 onwards 

the Additional Government Pleader's arguments have been noted and 

from paragraph 37 onwards the rival contentions are analyzed. In 

paragraphs 40 to 42 the necessity to enact the Principal Act and its 

objectives have been discussed. Thereafter, reference is made to Sections 

20 and 21 of the Principal Act in paragraphs 43 to 46. In paragraph 47 

the Division Bench held that if there was breach of or violation of the 

terms and conditions of the Development Permission or Commencement 

Certificate issued under the Planning Law, then, the Government cannot 

cancel these permission/ sanction/ building permit in the garb of 

exercising the powers to withdraw the exemption. That is how paragraphs 

47 and 48 would read. We do not find anything in paragraph 48 which 

would enable us to hold that the Division Bench has decided any 

controversy and which is subject matter of the present reference. The 

whole issue was whether for breach of the terms and conditions on which

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

the order of exemption has been passed and one of which related to the 

permission to construct or develop the land, can the State while 

withdrawing the exemption under Section 20(1) also set aside or 

interfere with the permission under the Maharashtra Regional Town 

Planning Act, 1966 or related laws. Far from anything which would touch 

the issues involved in the present Reference we do not think that this 

judgment lays down or holds that the validity of the order of exemption 

under Section 20 or any action taken thereunder would not survive with 

all consequences despite the repeal. 

128 
The only reference then made to the Repeal Act is to be 

found in paragraphs 63 and 64. Paragraph 64 of the judgment reads as 

under: 

"64. 
In the case in hand, we are concerned with Subclause 
(b) of Section (3) of Repeal Act which contemplates that 
repeal of the principal Act shall not affect validity of any 
order granting exemption under subsection (1) of 
Section 20 or any action taken thereunder, not 
withstanding any judgment of any Court to the counter. 
It is, therefore, evident that validity of order granting 
exemption under subsection (1) of Section 20 of the ULC 
Act though passed prior to Repeal Act came into force, 
would continue in view of the said saving clause. 
Similarly, any action taken by the State Government 
under subsection (2) of Section 20 prior to the Repeal 
Act came into force is also continued to be valid even 
after the Repeal Act came into force. Perusal of 
provisions of Section 3 (1)(b) makes it evident that 
repeal of Principal Act shall not affect validity of any 
order granting exemption under subsection (1) of 
Section 20 or any action taken thereunder. Hence, to 
grant exemption in respect of land which was in excess 
of the ceiling limit as well as action, if any taken by the 
State Government thereunder in view of Section 20 (1) 
is saved. Similarly, any action taken by the State 
Government against the scheme holder under subclause

(2) of Section 20 prior to coming into force of the 
Repeal Act, is also saved. However, the power of the 
State Government to alter, change or modify the terms 
and conditions of any of the Schemes formulated prior 
to coming into force of the Repeal Act and on the basis 
thereof, sanction was granted by the Planning Authority 
is not saved by the saving clause." 

129 
We do not think that in the light of these conclusions on 

Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act, any assistance could be derived from 

this judgment and to answer the issues and questions posed before us. 

Rather, the same support our conclusion. 

130 
Then, we are left with the judgment on which reliance is 

placed by the Petitioners, namely, Sundersons and others v/s State of 

Maharashtra and others reported in 2008 (5) Bombay Cases Reporter 

85 : 2008(6) Mh.L.J. 332. We do not find that the said judgment dealt 

with the controversy which has been raised before us. Apart therefrom we 

find that not only in the said judgment, but in the further judgment of this 

Court in the case of Damodar Laxman Navare v/s State of Maharashtra in 

Writ Petition No.6300/2009 decided on 08.07.2010 the same Division 

Bench clarified in paragraph 10 that it is not inclined to look into the 

question and aspect of applicability of Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act. 

131 
Reference is then made to the judgment to which one of us is 

a party (S.C.Dharmadhikari, J.), reported in 2013(2) Mh.L.J. 224 (Manik 

M. Ragit v/s State of Maharashtra). There, the Division Bench was 

concerned with the issue post repeal of the Principal Act and particularly 

about changes in the revenue record. The prayer was to restore the name 

of the Petitioner in the revenue record pertaining to the land. Paragraph 2

*173* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

of this judgment would show that the vacant land in excess of ceiling 

limit was identified. The Petitioner before this Court sought an order of 

exemption under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act. He presented the 

scheme in relation to half portion of the excess vacant land that scheme 

was sanctioned by the competent authority. However, the scheme was not 

implemented at all. Later on an attempt was made to proceed against this 

excess vacant land, physical possession of which was always with the 

Petitioner. He, therefore, argued that Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act 

would not come into play and the fact situation is fully covered by Section 

3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. If the Respondent/ State cannot take physical 

possession of the excess vacant land because the scheme has failed in 

view of this express provision in the Repeal Act, then, the Petitioner's 

name deserves to be restored to the revenue record was the essential 

prayer. That has been granted and because there was no opposition from 

the State. It is in this context that the Division Bench in paragraph 7 

relied upon the Repeal Act and essentially Section 3(1)(a) of the same. 

Paragraph 7 of the judgment reads as under: 

"7. 
With the assistance of the learned counsel appearing 
for parties we have perused the Writ Petition and also 
the Division Bench judgment. Facts in our case are not 
disputed. There has been no step or action taken in 
pursuance of the order of exemption passed in favour 
of the petitioner. Thus, the scheme was not 
implemented. If it was not implemented, then, the 
Division Bench judgment in Vithabai's case takes the 
view that the consequence of passing an order under 
Section 20(1) results in exemption of surplus vacant 
land from the provisions of the Act. However, on 
withdrawal of the exemption under Section 20(2) of 
the Urban Land Ceiling Act, that does not provide that 
possession of surplus land would automatically or is 
deemed to have been taken by the Competent 
Authority. If the State of Maharashtra is required to 
resort to provisions of Chapter III of Urban Land

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Ceiling Act for taking possession and issue notice 
under Section 10 of the Act, then, they cannot urge 
that possession was not taken prior to the Repealing 
Act coming into force. In other words, if possession is 
not taken prior to Repeal Act coming into force, then, 
it will be restored to owner. The view taken is that 
Section 10, does not provide for different procedure to 
be adopted subsequent to the passing of an order 
under Section 20(2) of the Urban land Ceiling Act. 
Therefore, looking at the matter this way, even if the 
scheme has not been implemented or the exemption 
has been withdrawn, this judgment holds that the 
respondent could resort to Section 10 of the Un 
repealed Act. That having not been done in the case 
before us we are of the view that, the controversy is 
covered by the judgment of this Court in the judgment 
of Vithabai's case." 

132 
We are of the opinion that this judgment cannot be a 

precedent for answering the questions posed before us. We have already 

held that the observations in Vithabai's case (supra) to the extent they are 

contrary to what we have held hereinabove do not lay down the correct 

law. Therefore, firstly these observations must be seen as restricted to the 

facts of that case and to which only Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act 

applies. Secondly, this Court was not called upon to decide the ambit and 

scope of Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act in that judgment as the scheme 

never took off and was not acted upon. Once the exemption order was 

not acted upon by the Petitioner, but the State attempted to take 

possession of the surplus vacant land and after repeal that relief as prayed 

by the Petitioner was granted. This judgment, therefore, cannot be seen as 

answering the controversy. 

133 
Finally, in Mira Bhayander Developers and Welfare 

Association (supra) the controversy was with regard to the letter dated

23.06.2008 addressed by the State Government to the SubRegistrar of 

Assurances, Thane City. That letter directed the said Authority to ascertain 

at the time when the scheme holder presents a document for registration 

as to whether he has sought extension for implementation of the scheme 

meant for economically weaker sections of the society under Section 20 of 

the Principal Act and not to register the document otherwise. That was 

the letter impugned in the Writ Petition and the Division Bench in a short 

judgment held as under: 

"1. 
The above Petition is filed on behalf of the members of 
the Petitioner Association. The members of the Petitioner 
Association who are the builders and developers have 
taken benefit of the schemes meant for the Economically 
Weaker Section of the society under Section 20 of the 
Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 
[hereinafter referred to as "the said Act" for short]. The 
said Act was repealed by the Urban Land (Ceiling and 
Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 which came into force in 
the State of Maharashtra on 29.11.2007. Since a large 
number of schemes were sanctioned under Section 20 of 
the said Act, the State Government, with a view to see 
that the schemes are fully implemented, if partly 
implemented, after the repeal of the said Act, issued a 
letter dated 23.06.2008 to the SubRegistrar of 
Assurances, Thane City directing him to ascertain at the 
time when the scheme holder presents a document for 
registration, whether the scheme holder has sought for 
extension for implementation of the scheme or not; as 
otherwise not to register the documents in question. 
2. 
It is the said letter dated 23.06.2008, which is impugned 
in the present Petition. The principal ground on which 
the said letter is assailed is that such a condition cannot 
be imposed by the Registering Authority and that the 
registration cannot be refused on the said ground. 
3. 
On the other hand it is contended on behalf of the State 
by the learned AGP that on the repeal of the said Act, 
the scheme holders who may be builders/developers are 
trying to wriggle out of their obligations under the said 
sanctioned schemes, and therefore the impugned letter 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*176* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

came to be issued which has been issued to protect the 
schemes meant for the Economically Weaker Section, 
and also the Government revenue. 
4. 
We have considered the rival contentions. In our view, if 
the members of the Petitioners Association have taken 
benefit of the schemes under Section 20 of the said Act 
by constructing buildings, they now cannot wriggle out 
of their obligations to surrender flats to the Government 
which the Government could sell at a fixed rate. The 
entire tenor of the above Petition appears to be that the 
Petitioners do not want to fulfil their obligations under 
the said schemes viz surrendering the flats to the State 
Government and taking advantage of the repeal of the 
said Act want to contend that their obligations under the 
said schemes do not survive. In our view the impugned 
letter, as rightly contended by the learned AGP, has been 
issued to protect the public interest and Government 
revenue. It does not befit the Petitioners who have taken 
advantage of the said schemes now to contend that their 
obligations do not survive, and therefore there is no need 
for them to surrender the flats to the Government. We, 
therefore, do not find any merit in the challenge raised 
in the above Petition which is accordingly dismissed." 

134 
Though this judgment is based on the broad principles of 

equity and that no one can take advantage of his own wrong, yet we are 

of the opinion that the conclusion therein for the reasons recorded above 

is correct. The same is in consonance with the conclusions reached by us 

hereinabove. 

135 
As a result of the above discussion the questions referred to 

us are answered as under: 

(a) 
That the repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the 

validity of the order of exemption under Section 20(1) of the 

Principal Act and all consequences following the same 

including keeping intact the power to withdraw the said

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*177* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

exemption by recourse to Section 20(2) of the Principal Act. 

Further, merely because Section 20(2) is not specifically 

mentioned in the saving clause enacted by Section 3(1)(b) of 

the Repeal Act that does not mean that the power is not 

saved. The said power is also saved by virtue of applicability 

of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. That Section of 

the General Clauses Act, 1897 applies to Section 3(1)(b) of 

the Repeal Act. 

(b) 
Once having held that the power to withdraw the exemption 

also survives the repeal of the Principal Act, then, all 

consequences must follow and the said power can be 

exercised by the State Government in accordance with law. 

That power and equally all ancillary and incidental powers to 

the main power to impose conditions are also saved and 

survive the repeal. Meaning thereby the terms and conditions 

of the order of exemption can be enforced in accordance with 

law. 

(c) 
Question Nos.1 and 2 in the AFFIRMATIVE, by holding that 

Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 applies to the 

savings of the exemption order including all terms and 

conditions thereof, validity of which or any action taken 

thereunder has been saved by Section 3(1)(b) 

notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary. 

(d) 
Question Nos.3 and 4 will have to be answered as above, but 

by clarifying that though it would be open for the State to 

enforce the exemption order and terms and conditions 

thereof, validity of which is saved by the Repeal Act, but 

having regard to the language of Section 20(2) of the 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*178* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Principal Act it cannot be held that same can be enforced 

only by withdrawal of the order of exemption in terms of sub 

section (2) of Section 20, which power also survives the 

repeal of the Principal Act. In other words, though Section 

3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act read with Section 6 of the General 

Clauses Act, 1897 states that repeal of the Principal Act shall 

not affect the validity of the exemption order passed under 

Section 20(1) of the Principal Act or any action taken 

thereunder notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the 

contrary, still the obligations and liabilities incurred 

voluntarily under the exemption order by the person holding 

the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit need not be enforced 

only by exercise of powers under subsection (2) of Section 

20 of the Principal Act, but by all other legally permissible 

means. 

(e) 
We also clarify that though our answers to Questions 3 and 4 

would be as aforesaid, still whether any of these powers 

could be exercised and to what extent are all matters which 

must be decided in the facts and circumstances of each case. 

In the event the State desires to take any action in terms of 

Section 20(2) of the Principal Act it would be open for the 

aggrieved parties to urge that such an action is not 

permissible in the given facts and circumstances particularly 

because of enormous and unexplained delay, the parties 

having altered their position to their detriment, the 

proceedings as also the orders in that behalf are grossly 

unfair, unjust, arbitrary, high handed, malafide and violative 

of the principles of natural justice and of the Constitutional

mandate enshrined in Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21 and 300A of 

the Constitution of India. These and other contentions can 

always be raised and irrespective of our conclusions, 

individual orders can always be challenged and action 

thereunder impugned in appropriate legal proceedings 

including under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. 

(f) 
The aggrieved parties can also urge that while seeking to 

enforce the terms and conditions of the exemption order or 

recalling or withdrawing the exemption itself the competent 

authorities/ State has not adhered to the provisions of law 

applicable for such exercise. Meaning thereby there has to be 

a specific order in that behalf and mere issuance of 

administrative instructions or circulars will not suffice. All 

such objections can as well be raised and in individual cases. 

(g) 
By our answers to Questions 1 to 4 above, we should not be 

taken to have held that there is a mandate under the Repeal 

Act to withdraw the order of exemption passed under Section 

20(1) of the Principal Act and the Government is obliged to 

withdraw it in the event the said order or any terms or 

conditions thereof have not been satisfied rather violated or 

breached. In the light of the wording of Section 20(2) of the 

Principal Act the State is competent to withdraw, but only 

after giving a reasonable opportunity to the persons 

concerned for making representation against the proposed 

withdrawal. The Government is obliged to pass an order 

withdrawing any exemption and needless to clarify that in 

the event such an order is passed it can be impugned and 

challenged by the aggrieved parties in appropriate

proceedings on the grounds that it is unreasoned and/or in 

the given facts and circumstances such an order could not 

have been passed or need not be passed and the Government 

could have granted time to comply with the terms and 

conditions or that the terms and conditions relying on which 

and for breach of which the exemption order is withdrawn 

are not violated or breached, they were not mandatory and 

have been substantially complied with or were incapable of 

being complied with because of several factors, obstacles and 

hurdles each of which cannot be enumerated or termed as 

exhaustive in any manner. Therefore, if the Government is 

not mandated to withdraw the exemption order, but can 

ensure compliance of the terms and conditions without 

withdrawal of the exemption order or without recourse to 

Section 20(2) of the Principal Act, then, needless to clarify 

that all liabilities, obligations and equally the remedies 

available to the parties are unaffected by repeal and can be 

resorted to in the afore stated events. 

(h) 
In the light of our conclusions as enumerated in paragraph 

No.125 above we hold that the view taken by the Division 

Bench in Vithabai Bama Bhandari v/s State of Maharashtra 

and another reported in 2009(3) Bombay Cases Reporter 

663 (Writ Petition No.4241/2008 decided on 31 st March/ 16 th 

April, 2009) does not lay down the correct law and to the 

extent indicated hereinabove.

The Reference is answered accordingly. Each of these Writ 

Petitions shall now be placed before appropriate Division

Judgment (Per S.C. Gupte, J.) : 

1 
I have gone through the judgement prepared by my brother 

Dharmadhikari J. With greatest respect, I am afraid I am unable to agree 

with some of the key conclusions and reasons discussed in it. I have in 

the following judgment dealt with the conclusions in respect of which I 

differ from the views expressed by brother Dharmadhikari J. 

2 
The questions referred to the Full Bench and the submissions 

made by learned Counsel appearing on either sides have been elaborately 

set out by my brother Dharmadhikari J and need not be repeated here. I 

shall, wherever necessary, refer to these submissions in the context of my 

conclusions and reasons for the same. 

3 
Let me briefly dwell at the outset with the conflict in the 

decisions of Division Benches of our court, which led to the present Full 

Bench reference, so as to put the whole controversy in a proper 

perspective and make its context clear. What led to the conflict of the 

Division Bench decisions of this court were the circulars issued by various 

Competent Authorities under the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) 

Act, 1976 ("the Principal Act") after repeal by the Urban Land (Ceiling 

and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 ("the Repeal Act") to SubRegistrars of 

Assurances and planning authorities not to register documents presented 

by landholders for registration or sanction plans filed for development of 

lands unless no objection certificates were issued by these Competent 

Authorities. These directives were purportedly issued with a view to 

implement schemes sanctioned by Competent Authorities whilst granting 

exemptions to the concerned lands under Section 20 of the Principal Act. 

In some cases, the landholders would have breached the provisions of 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*183* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

these schemes, for example, by not completing the schemes within the 

stipulated periods, in which cases the concerned Competent Authorities 

would not issue no objection certificates, thereby ensuring compliance on 

the part of the landholders with the sanctioned schemes. These circulars 

were challenged before this Court in a number of petitions. 

4 
In Sundersons & Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. 1 , the 

Collector had issued instructions to Subregistrars of Assurances to insist 

upon an NOC from the competent authority, namely, the Collector before 

registering any document. 
A Division Bench of this Court held that 

persual of the circular did not disclose the source of the power under 

which it had been issued and that it was not open to the Collector to issue 

such instructions. 

5 
In Damodar Laxman Navare Vs. State of Maharashtra 2 , the 

Court was concerned with two letters -one by which authorities such as 

the Municipal Corporation and SubRegistrar were directed not to 

sanction plans or register documents presented by landholders and the 

other directing the petitioner landholder in that case to pay penalty for 

extension of time for completion of a scheme sanctioned under Section 20 

of the Principal Act. Both these letters were issued after the repeal of the 

Principal Act. The Division Bench hearing the petitioners' challenge to the 

two letters struck down these directions, holding them to be illegal and 

ultra vires the powers of the authorities under the Principal Act. The 

challenge to these circulars on the grounds of repeal of the Principal Act 

and the effect of the saving clause on the exemption orders passed under 

Section 20 or actions taken thereunder, was, however, not considered by

the Division Bench in Damodar Laxman Navare (supra). 

6 
Then came the decision of another Division Bench of our 

Court in Mira Bhayandar Builders and Developers Welfare Association 

Vs. Deputy Collector and Competent Authority. 1 In that case, members 

of the Petitioner Association, who were builders and developers, had 

taken benefit of the schemes meant for economically weaker sections of 

the society sanctioned under Section 20 of the Principal Act. The schemes 

were partly implemented on the date of the repeal of the Principal Act. 

The State Government issued a circular after the repeal, with a view to 

see that the schemes were fully implemented, to the SubRegistrar of 

Assurances. The circular directed the SubRegistrar to ascertain whether 

the scheme holder had sought extension of time for implementation of the 

scheme when the scheme holder presented a document for registration 

and not to register the document in question if such extension was not 

sought. The scheme holders challenged the circular inter alia on the 

ground that the obligations under the scheme did not survive the repeal. 

The Division Bench accepted the contention of the learned AGP that the 

impugned circular had been issued to protect the public interest by 

ensuring implementation of schemes meant for economically weaker 

sections. The Division Bench held that if the members of the Petitioner 

Association had taken benefit of the schemes under Section 20 by 

constructing buildings, they could not now wriggle out of their obligations 

to surrender flats to the Government which the Government could sell at 

fixed rates. The Division Bench accordingly rejected the Petitioners' 

challenge to the circular.

These were then the rulings on the subject, when another

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Division Bench of our Court -in Jayesh Tokarshi Shah Vs. Deputy 

Collector and Competent Authority 1 considered similar circulars issued 

by the Competent Authority after the repeal of the Principal Act, 

prohibiting registration of conveyances in respect of flats constructed 

under schemes sanctioned under Section 20 and sold without obtaining 

extension of periods of completion of the schemes or obtaining no 

objection certificates from the Competent Authority under the Principal 

Act. According to the Petitioners in that case, the circulars issued after the 

repeal of the Principal Act were without authority of law and also that the 

conditions of the exemption orders under Section 20 did not survive the 

repeal. On the other hand, the State contended that the circulars were 

issued for meaningful implementation of sanctions granted under Section 

20, as validity of such sanction orders remained saved from the rigours of 

the Repeal Act. According to the State, the Petitioners had yet to discharge 

their obligations under the schemes by handing over specified number of 

tenements to the Government and paying penalty for extension of time to 

complete the schemes. Based on the decision of our Court in Mira 

Bhayandar Builders' case (supra) it was contended by the State that it 

was not open to a party, who had taken advantage of a scheme sanctioned 

under Section 20 of the Principal Act, to contend that the obligations of 

the scheme did not survive the repeal of the Principal Act. The Division 

Bench in Jayesh Tokarshi Shah (supra) felt that the view expressed by 

our Court in Sundersons & Ors (supra) and Damodar Laxman Navare 

(supra) led to the premise that the Competent Authority under the 

Principal Act was not competent to issue such circulars, but that there was 

a conflict with such premise in the view expressed by our Court in Mira 

Bhayandar Builders' case (supra) where challenge to a similar circular 

was dispelled on the ground that the circular was issued to protect public

interest and having taken advantage of a scheme under Section 20 of the 

Principal Act, the Petitioners could not wriggle out of their obligations. 

The Court in Jayesh Tokarshi Shah (supra) referred to another decision 

of our Court in Mohal Gopal Mate Vs. Principal Secretary 1 , which held 

that the powers of the State under Section 20 in case of breach of a 

condition of an exemption order were limited to withdrawal of the 

exemption order only, whereupon provisions of Chapter III would apply to 

such land. The Court in Jayesh Tokarshi Shah (supra) also felt that going 

by strict interpretation of Sections 20 and 21 of the Principal Act, the 

power of the State in case of contravention of any of the conditions of the 

schemes sanctioned under these Sections by the scheme holders was 

limited to withdrawal of exemption, declaring such land to be excess 

vacant land and applying the provisions of Chapter III of the Principal Act 

for acquisition of the same. The Court, however, felt that such view would 

be in conflict with the view expressed by the Court in Mira Bhayander 

Builders' case (supra) and that therefore the controversy deserved to be 

resolved by a Full Bench of this Court. 

8 
That is how this reference has come before us. The principal 

controversy before us concerns the effect of the Repeal Act on the 

schemes sanctioned whilst granting exemptions under Section 20 of the 

Principal Act to excess vacant lands. Do the conditions of exemption 

orders survive the repeal and if so, can these conditions be enforced by 

the State after the date of the repeal, if necessary by withdrawing the 

exemption and applying the provisions of Chapter III to the lands which 

were the subject matter of such exemption orders and schemes.

Repeal Act may be necessary to understand the impact and reach of the 

Repeal Act and whatever is left untouched by it from the provisions of the 

Principal Act or actions taken thereunder. 

10 
The Principal Act was enacted for (i) imposition of a ceiling 

on vacant land in urban agglomerations, (ii) acquisition of land in excess 

of the ceiling limit, and (iii) regulation of construction of buildings on 

such land and for matters connected therewith. The declared objective of 

these provisions in the Principal Act was to (i) prevent concentration of 

urban land in the hands of a few persons and speculation and 

profiteering therein and (ii) bring about an equitable distribution of land 

in urban agglomerations to subserve the common good. 

11 
Chapter III of the Principal Act contains the key provisions 

for accomplishment of the aforesaid objectives. The Chapter consists of 

three sets of provisions, namely, (1) Sections 3 to 18 which provide for 

the ceiling limit, and ascertainment and acquisition of vacant land in 

excess of such ceiling limit, (2) Sections 19 to 22 dealing with non 

application or exemption from application of Chapter III to certain lands 

and (3) Sections 23 and 24 which deal with disposal of vacant land 

acquired under Chapter III. 

12 
Section 3, which is the pivotal section in the Chapter, 

proscribes any person from holding vacant land in excess of the ceiling 

limit in the territories covered by the Principal Act. The ceiling limits for 

various classes of agglomerations and the manner of calculating them for 

various classes of persons are provided in Section 4. Section 5 provides 

for a subsidiary rule for calculating the extent of vacant land in cases of

certain transfers (i.e. transfers between the appointed day and the date of 

commencement of the Principal Act) and also prohibits transfers after the 

date of commencement without furnishing a statement under Section 6 

and publication of a notification of excess land under Section 10(1). The 

machinery provisions for arriving at the extent of excess vacant land are 

contained in Sections 6 to 9. The entire determination process starts with 

a statement to be compulsorily filed by every person holding vacant land 

in excess of ceiling limit as on the date of commencement of the Principal 

Act, specifying the requisite particulars of such land. Section 7 contains 

subsidiary provisions concerning filing of such statement in case such land 

is situated within the jurisdiction of two or more competent authorities, 

whether in the same state or in two or more states to which the Principal 

Act applies. Section 8 provides for preparation of a draft statement by 

the competent authority. It also requires service of such draft statement 

on, and consideration of objections, if any, by, the concerned landholder. 

Section 9 provides for determination of excess vacant 
land and 

preparation and service of a final statement concerning such excess 

vacant land. Section 10 contains provisions concerning acquisition of 

such excess vacant land by the State Government. Under the scheme of 

Section 10, the competent authority has to first issue and publish a 

notification giving particulars of excess vacant land, proposing its 

acquisition and inviting claims of all persons interested in such land, 

under Subsection (1) of Section 10. Subsection (2) requires the 

competent authority to determine the nature and extent of such claims. 

Subsection (3) empowers the competent authority to declare by 

notification the acquisition of such excess vacant land with effect from a 

date specified in that behalf. Upon publication of such notification the 

land is deemed to be vested absolutely in the State Government with

effect from the date so specified. Subsection (4) of Section 10 provides 

for an embargo on transfer of land between the dates of the publication of 

the respective notifications under Subsections (1) and (3). Subsections 

(5) and (6) deal with taking over of possession of the land thus vesting in 

the State Government. 
Subsection (5) authorizes the competent 

authority to require by notice surrender or delivery of such land to the 

State Government. Subsection (6) empowers the competent authority to 

take possession by use of force in case of failure of the landholder to so 

surrender or deliver possession. Sections 11 to 14 contain provisions 

regarding payment of compensation by the State Government to the 

landholder whose land is so acquired by the State Government. Section 

11 contains provisions for determination of such compensation, Section 

12 provides for appeals to a tribunal from any determination under 

Section 11 and Section 13 provides for an appeal to the High Court from 

the decision of the tribunal. Section 14 provides for the mode of payment 

of such compensation. Sections 15 to 18 provide for subsidiary matters 

such as ceiling limit on future acquisition by inheritance, etc., filing of 

statement when the Principal Act is subsequently adopted by any State, 

the competent authority's power to enter upon any vacant land for 

carrying out the purposes of the Principal Act and penalty for 

concealment of particulars of vacant land, etc. 

13 
Section 19 provides cases in which the provisions of Chapter 

III do not apply to certain vacant lands, e.g. lands held by the Central or 

State Governments, banks, etc. Section 20 provides for the power of the 

State Government to exempt any vacant land on conditions and to 

withdraw such exemption on noncompliance of the conditions. (This 

Section will be dealt with in detail in the following order.) Section 21

provides for circumstances in which excess vacant land may not be 

treated as excess in certain cases. Section 22 provides for cases where a 

landholder under certain conditions may be permitted to retain excess 

vacant land. 

14 
Sections 23 and 24, as noted above, provide for disposal of 

vacant lands acquired by the State Government under the Principal Act. 

These Sections inter alia serve the objective of equitable distribution of 

land in public interest. 

15 
Chapter IV enacts provisions concerning regulations of 

transfers of land and use of urban property. Section 25 defines "plinth 

area". Section 26 provides for a notice to be given of any intended 

transfer of vacant land to the competent authority, which has the first 

option to purchase such land on behalf of the State Government. The 

section also contains machinery provisions for completing such sale in 

case the option is exercised by the competent authority. Section 27 enacts 

a prohibition on transfer of urban property. Section 28 makes subsidiary 

provisions for regulating registration of documents so as to effectively 

implement the provisions of Sections 26 and 27. Section 29 contains 

regulatory provisions for construction of buildings with dwelling units. 

Demolition and stoppage of buildings constructed / being constructed in 

contravention of the provisions of Section 29 is provided under Section 

30. 

16 
Chapter V contains miscellaneous provisions providing for 

powers of the competent authority (Section 31), jurisdiction of authorities 

and tribunals (Section 32), appeal (Section 33), Revision (Section 34),

power of the State Government to issue directions (Section 35), power of 

the Central Government to give directions (Section 36), returns and 

reports, offences and penalties, etc. Section 42 in this chapter provides for 

the overriding effect of the provisions of the Principal Act. 

17 
After the Principal Act came into force in the State of 

Maharashtra, statements under Section 6 thereof were filed by 

landholders. In some cases the land acquisition was completed and excess 

vacant lands were taken possession of after following the procedure laid 

down in Sections 8 to 10; whilst in other cases proceedings were pending 

at various stages provided under Sections 8 to 10 or the appellate and 

revisional stages under Sections 33 and 34 of the Principal Act. In respect 

of some lands orders were passed under Sections 20 and 21 sanctioning 

schemes presented by landholders and accordingly exemptions were 

granted on conditions or excess vacant land was directed not to be treated 

as excess, respectively, under Sections 20 and 21; and these schemes were 

either completed or were at different stages of completion. In some cases, 

where the conditions of exemption orders were breached, the exemptions 

were withdrawn and the procedure under Sections 8 to 10 of the Principal 

Act for acquisition of land thus rendered excess vacant land was being 

applied to such lands and was at varying stages of completion. This was 

the position in 1999, when the Parliament passed the Repeal Act. 

18 
On 11 January 1999, an ordinance to repeal the Principal Act 

was promulgated by the President. This was followed by a bill to repeal 

the Principal Act tabled in the Parliament, being Bill No.17/1999. The bill 

proposed repeal of the Principal Act in the same terms as the ordinance. 

The statement of objects and reasons contained in the bill is in the

following terms : 

" 
The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 
was passed with a laudable social objective. The main 
purpose was to prevent concentration of urban land 
in a few hands and to provide affordable housing to 
the Economically Weaker Sections. It has on the 
contrary pushed up land prices, practically brought 
the housing industry to a stop and provided 
opportunities for corruption. There is a widespread 
demand for removing this irritant to land assembly 
and construction activity. During the implementation 
of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 
1976, there have been a spate of litigations giving rise 
to serious hurdles in taking over possession of land, 
by the State Governments. Public opinion is nearly 
unanimous that the Act has failed to achieve its 
objectives as expected. 

2. 
Parliament has no power to repeal or amend the Act 
unless resolutions are passed by two or more State 
Legislatures as required under clause (2) of Article 
252. The Legislatures of Haryana and Punjab have 
passed resolutions empowering Parliament to repeal 
the Act in those States. The Act stands repealed in 
those States and in the Union territories immediately 
after promulgation of the repeal Ordinance and 
subsequently if State Legislatures adopt this Repeal 
Act by resolution, then the Urban Land (Ceiling and 
Regulation) Act, 1976 will stand repealed in those 
States, from the date of its adoption. 

3. 
The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Bill, 
1998 was examined by the Standing Committee on 
Urban and Rural Development. The Committee felt 
that the land which is yet to be put to use for the 
original purposes stated in the Act, under possession 
of the Government should not be restored to previous 
owners as such restoration may lead to avoidable 
discrimination. The Committee also suggested that the 
repeal Bill should contain a provision for abatement

of proceedings in the different courts. Keeping in view 
the recommendations of the Committee, this Bill is 
being introduced to replace the Urban Land (Ceiling 
and Regulation) Repeal Ordinance, 1999 (Ord.5 of 
1999) notified on 11.01.1999 so that the State 
Governments would be free to have their own 
legislation commensurate with their needs and 
experiences. Till this Act is repealed, States have no 
power to legislate on this subject. 

4. 
The proposed repeal, along with some other incentives 
and simplification of administrative procedures, is 
expected to revive the stagnant housing industry. The 
repeal will facilitate construction of dwelling units 
both in the public and private sector and help 
achievement of targets contemplated under National 
Agenda for Governance. The repeal will not, however, 
affect vesting of any vacant land under subsection 
(3) of Section 10 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and 
Regulation) Act, 1976 the possession of which has 
been taken over by the State Governments. It will not 
affect payments made to the State Governments for 
exemptions. The exemptions granted under Section 20 
of the Act will continue to be operative. The amounts 
paid out by the State Governments will become 
refundable before restoration of the land to the 
former owners. 

5. 
The Bill also seeks to facilitate land assembly and a 
flexible regime for administering urban land to suit 
the varying local conditions based on State level 
legislations or requirements." 

The bill was passed by the Parliament and the Repeal Act was enacted. 

The Repeal Act contains the following provisions :

The State of Maharashtra adopted the Repeal Act by a 

resolution passed and adopted by both houses of State Legislature under 

Article 252(2) of the Constitution of India on 29 November 2007. The 

resolution adopted by the State of Maharashtra is in the following terms : 

"MAHARASTHRA 
LEGISLATIVE 
ASSEMBLY 
RESOLUTION 

Whereas, the Maharashtra Legislative 
Assembly on 5 th October 1971 and the Maharashtra 
Legislative Council on the 7 th October 1971 had, in 
pursuance of clause (1) of article 252 of the 
Constitution of India, resolved that the imposition of 
ceiling on urban immovable property and acquisition 
of such property in excess of the ceiling and all 
matters connected therewith or ancillary and 
incidental thereto should be regulated in the State of 
Maharashtra by Parliament by law : 

And Whereas, the Parliament had 
thereafter enacted the Urban Land (Ceiling and 
Regulation) Act, 1976 (Central Act No. 33 of 1976); 

And Whereas, consequent upon the 
resolutions passed by the Houses of the Legislatures of 
the States of Haryana and Punjab, under article 
252(2) of the Constitution, that the Urban Land 
(Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, in its application 
to those States, be repealed by Parliament by law, the 

Parliament has enacted the Urban Land (Ceiling and 
Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 (Act No. 15 of 1999); 

And Whereas, subsection (2) of section 
1 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal 
Act, 1999, provides that the said Act shall apply to 
such other State which adopts the said Act by 
resolution passed in that behalf under clause (2) of

article 252 of the Constitution; 

And Whereas, the Government of 
Maharashtra is of the opinion that the Urban Land 
(Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 should be 
repealed, in its application to the State of 
Maharashtra, so that land in urban area may be 
available for housing; 

Now, therefore, in pursuance of clause 
(2) of article 252 of the Constitution of India, the 
Maharashtra Legislative Assembly hereby resolves 
that the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal 
Act, 1999, passed by the Parliament be adopted for 
this State." 

Accordingly, the Repeal Act was brought into force in the 

State of Maharashtra on 29 November 2007. 

20 
Under the common law rule, the consequence of repeal of a 

statute is that the statute is as completely obliterated as if it had never 

been enacted except of course as to transactions past and closed. The 

clearest statement of this law is contained in the judgment of Tindal J. in 

the case of Kay vs. Goodwin 1 to the following effect : 

'The effect of repealing a statute is to obliterate it as 
completely from the records of the parliament as if it had 
never been passed; and, it must be considered as a law that 
never existed, except for the purpose of those actions which 
were commenced, prosecuted, and concluded whilst it was an 
existing law.' 

The march of law since those days is noted by the Supreme 

Court in one of its oldest judgments on the point, in the case of State of 

1 1830 English Reports (Volume 130) at page 1403, Chief Justice Tindal

Punjab vs. Mohar Singh 1 , in the following words : 

" (6) 
Under the law of England, as it stood prior to the 
Interpretation Act of 1889, the effect of repealing a statute 
was said to be to obliterate it as completely from the 
records of Parliament as if it had never been passed, except 
for the purpose of those actions, which were commenced, 
prosecuted and concluded while it was an existing law :Vide 
Craies on Statute Law, 5th edn. page 323. A repeal 
therefore without any saving clause would destroy any 
proceeding whether not yet begun or whether pending at 
the time of the enactment of the Repealing Act and not 
already prosecuted to a final judgment so as to create a 
vested right: Vide Crawford on Statutory Constitution, pp. 
599600. To obviate such results a practice came into 
existence in England to insert a saving clause in the 
repealing statute with a view to preserve rights and 
liabilities already accrued or incurred under the repealed 
enactment. 
Later on, to dispense with the necessity of having to 
insert a saving clause on each occasion, section 38(2) was 
inserted in the Interpretation Act of 1889 which provides 
that a repeal, unless the contrary intention appears, does 
not affect the previous operation of the repealed enactment 
or anything duly done or suffered under it and any 
investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, 
continued or enforced in respect of any right, liability and 
penalty under the repealed Act as if the Repealing Act had 
not been passed. Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, as is 
well known, is on the same lines as section 38(2) of the 
Interpretation Act of England. " 

The net result then would be that though the repealed statute 

is obliterated from the statute book, to see what is saved despite the 

repeal, one has to go by the saving clause, if any, of the repealing statute 

and the provisions of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act insofar as they 

apply.

21 
The savings clause of the Repeal Act, in our case, saves firstly 

the vesting of any vacant land under subsection (3) of Section 10 of the 

Principal Act, but with a caveat. Such vesting is saved only if possession of 

such vacant land has already been taken over by the State Government or 

any person duly authorized by the State Government in this behalf or by 

the competent authority (Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act). Secondly, it 

saves the validity of any order granting exemption under subsection (1) 

of Section 20 or any action taken thereunder, and it saves such validity 

notwithstanding a judgment of any court to the contrary (Section 3(1)(b) 

of the Repeal Act). Thirdly, the savings clause saves any payment made to 

the State Government as a condition for granting exemption under Sub 

Section (1) of Section 20 (Section 3(1)(c) of the Repeal Act). A further 

saving provision is contained in subsection (2) of Section 3, which does 

not require restoration of any land which is deemed to have vested in the 

State Government under subsection (3) of Section 10 of the Principal 

Act, but possession of which has not been taken over, subject to two 

conditions -one, any amount has been paid by the State government with 

respect to such land and two, such amount has not been refunded to the 

State Government. In other words, if these two conditions are fulfilled, 

the vesting of such land continues and is saved from the effects of the 

repeal. Lastly, the savings clause saves proceedings relating to Sections 11, 

12, 13 and 14 of the Principal Act in so far as such proceedings are 

relatable to the land, possession of which has been taken over by the State 

Government or any person authorized by the State Government or any 

person authorized by the State Government or by the competent 

authority. This is a necessary corollary of saving the vesting of such land. 

If the land is vested and the vesting saved by the Repeal Act, the 

proceedings relating to such land for (I) determination of compensation

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

(Section 11), appeals to a tribunal from such determinations (Section 12), 

appeals to the High Court from the appellate orders of tribunals (Section 

13) and (ii) determination of mode of payment of compensation (Section 

14), are also saved. 

22 
The scheme of the Repeal Act is thus absolutely clear and 

there are unambiguous indications in this scheme that the Repeal Act was 

meant to completely do away with the Principal Act except in cases of 

actions taken under the Principal Act which had achieved a finality. In the 

first place, we may note the principal Section in the Repeal Act, i.e. 

Section 2, which repeals the Principal Act as a whole without any 

reservation. Secondly, the saving clause in Section 3(2) read with Section 

3(1) shows that any land which is deemed to be vested in the State 

Government under Section 10(3) of the Principal Act will stand restored 

to the owner of such land except in two cases. One, where the vesting is 

accompanied by taking over of possession of the land (i.e. where 

possession is surrendered to the State Government by the owner in 

pursuance of a notice under Section 10(5) or where possession is taken by 

the competent authority under Section 10(6) of the Principal Act). And 

the other, where possession is not taken but any amount has been paid by 

the State Government with respect to such land. In the latter case, such 

land shall not be restored unless the amount paid by the State 

Government is refunded to it. No vesting order except in the two 

contingencies noted above is saved by the Repeal Act. Thirdly, it may be 

noted that Section 3(1)(b) saves the validity of an order granting 

exemption under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act or any action taken 

thereunder. It does not in terms save any action to be taken thereunder, 

but saves validity of any action already taken thereunder. Fourthly, 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*201* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Section 3(1)(c) saves only the payment made to the State Government as 

a condition for granting exemption under Section 20(1) of the Principal 

Act. It must be noted that in clause 3(1) (c) it is not the condition of 

payment per se that is saved, but actual payment which is saved. The next 

important consequence provided by the Repeal Act is the abatement of all 

legal proceedings relating to any order made or purported to be made 

under the Principal Act. There is, however, an exception in case of 

proceedings relating to Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Principal Act -

but it is made clear that this saving applies only to proceedings relatable 

to the land, possession of which is taken over under the Principal Act after 

the vesting thereof in the State Government. 

23 
From these provisions, it is clear that apart from saving the 

validity of an exemption order under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act 

(the effect of which will be considered later), the scheme of the Repeal 

Act is that every consequence of a person holding excess land under the 

Principal Act is done away with except in these cases: 

(i) Where the land is not only vested in, but taken 

possession of by, the State Government under the 

Principal Act; 

(ii) Where the land is vested, though possession is 

not taken, but payment is made by the State 

Government in respect of such land; 

(iii) Where there is a payment made to the State 

Government or an action taken under an

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

exemption order under Section 20(1) of the 

Principal Act. 

In case (i), the Repeal Act has no effect whatsoever. It is to be 

treated as a transaction past and closed. It is fully saved despite the 

repeal. In case of (ii), the Repeal Act shall have an effect subject to refund 

being made to the State Government of the amount paid by it. If such 

refund is made, the Repeal Act will have its full effect and the vesting will 

not be saved at all. In case of (iii), the payment made or action taken, as 

the case may be, will be saved. 

24 
These provisions are clear and loud. They imply a complete 

repeal or obliteration of the law except in cases particularly provided for. 

But if and to the extent there is any ambiguity (thereby permitting 

external aids for interpretation of the repealing statute), we may have 

reference to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the repealing 

statute. The Statement of Objects, as noted above, shows that whereas the 

main purpose of the Principal Act was to prevent concentration of urban 

land in a few hands and provide affordable housing to economically 

weaker sections, the Act actually resulted in pushing up land prices, 

practically brought the housing industry to a stop and provided 

opportunities for corruption. The Objects and Reasons acknowledge a 

near unanimous public opinion that the Act has failed to achieve its 

objectives as expected. In these premises, the Repeal Act proposes a 

complete repeal without any reservation, saving only the consequences

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

the effect of the saving clause insofar as it saves the validity of an 

exemption order. At the outset, we may note that the very idea of saving 

from the effect of a repeal is to save something that is accrued or 

incurred under the repealed statute. It is the right or liability which is 

crystallized before the repeal. The effect of saving of an exemption order 

must be considered in that light. At the same time, it may be noted that it 

is the exemption order as a whole which is saved. The exemption order, as 

rightly noted by brother Dharmadhikari J, grants a privilege, but such 

privilege is granted on certain conditions. The entire exemption order 

would be valid, that is to say, both the privilege and the conditions would 

be valid. In the absence of any valid reasons, it cannot possibly be 

suggested that only the privilege is valid and not the conditions on which 

it is granted. 

26 
Now the question is, what are the consequences of such 

validity. The obvious consequences, which are provided in the Repeal Act 

itself, are (a) all actions taken under the exemption order are valid and 

(b) payment made thereunder to the State Government is valid. But what 

are the other consequences. Could it be that the breach of the conditions 

of a valid exemption order would attract the provisions of Section 20(2) 

and all provisions of Chapter III including those relating to vesting of the 

land would thereupon apply to such land (i.e. land becoming excess 

vacant land as a result of withdrawal of exemption under Section 20(2)). 

27 
There are clear indications in the Repeal Act that these 

consequences are not contemplated. In the first place, withdrawal of an 

exemption order renders the land 'excess vacant land' just as any other 

vacant land which is in excess of the ceiling limit and which is not subject

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

to an exemption order under Section 20(1). If such other vacant land 

could not continue to be vested in the State Government even after the 

provisions of Section 10(3) applied to it, if possession of the land was not 

already taken by the Government on the date of the repeal, there is no 

reason why the provisions of Section 20(2) and consequences of 

withdrawal of exemption thereunder should apply to a land which is 

exempted under Section 20(1), but conditions of such exemption are 

breached as on, or after, the date of the repeal. 

28 
If Chapter III were to apply to such land, which has become 

excess vacant land by reason of withdrawal of the exemption order in 

connection therewith, but not to other excess vacant lands, anomalous 

and incongruent consequences would follow. Take for example, the case 

of two pieces of land one where the exemption order has already been 

withdrawn before the repeal and a statement under Section 6 is filed in 

connection with such land, but no further steps have been taken and the 

other land, which had no exemption order at any time and therefore, was 

excess vacant land ever since the appointed day. In the case of this latter 

land, not only is a statement under Section 6 filed, but further 

proceedings have culminated into a declaration under Section 10(3) and 

this has resulted in deemed vesting of the land in the State Government. 

Yet the latter land stands restored to the land owner upon repeal , but the 

proceedings under Sections 8, 9 and 10 would have to continue in respect 

of the former land despite the repeal and that land at the conclusion of 

these proceedings could vest in, and would have to be surrendered to, 

and if not surrendered, forcibly taken possession of by, the State 

Government. It is difficult to see the rationale behind such anomalous and 

incongruent treatment to the two lands in our example.

29 
There has never been any controversy so far on the point that 

once the exemption order was withdrawn under Section 20(2), the land 

would count as excess vacant land and the provisions of Chapter III would 

apply to it. If in a given case, such land, upon withdrawal of exemption, 

was under acquisition under chapter III on the date of the repeal but 

possession of the same was not taken over under subsection (5) or (6) of 

Section 10 on that date, such land could not vest in the State Government 

after the date of the repeal. The case of Vithabai Bama Bhandari vs. 

State of Maharashtra 1 is one of the cases in point. In the case of 

Vithabai Bama Bhandari, the landholders had been granted exemption 

under Section 20 of the Principal Act on condition of a certain number of 

tenements having to be sold to Government nominees at a fixed rate. The 

Landholder completed the construction after the stipulated period for 

completion of the scheme was over and thereafter offered the possession 

of the flats to the Government. At that stage, the landholder was informed 

that the exemption granted under Section 20(1) had been withdrawn. 

Thereafter, further steps under Section 10 of the Principal Act were taken 

and finally the landholder was issued a notice under Section 10(5) to 

surrender possession of the excess vacant land. That notice was 

challenged before this Court in a writ petition. No physical possession 

was, however, taken of the excess vacant land by then. In the meanwhile, 

the Principal Act had been repealed by the Repeal Act. A Division Bench 

of this Court, after analyzing the scheme of the Principal Act and the 

Repeal Act, held that with the withdrawal of the exemption under Section 

20(2) of the Principal Act, provisions of Chapter III became applicable to 

the land; that the Competent Authority thereupon actually applied the 

provisions of Chapter III to the land and followed the procedure under

Section 10; that it was an admitted position that though a declaration was 

made under Section 10(3) followed by a notice under Section 10(5), 

actual physical possession was not taken over by the State Government or 

the Competent Authority under the Principal Act by the time the Repeal 

Act was brought in force; and that accordingly, the vesting of the land in 

the Government was not saved. The Division Bench relied upon a 

judgment of another Division Bench of our Court in Voltas Ltd. Vs. 

Additional Collector and Competent Authority 1 in this behalf. 

30 
The law stated in Vithabai Bama Bhandari (supra) in this 

behalf has not been contested by the State. The learned Advocate 

General, in his submissions, accepts that any land, earlier exempted under 

Section 20(1), but exemption of which was already withdrawn under 

Section 20(2) before the repeal of the Principal Act, cannot vest in the 

State Government after the repeal if possession of such land was not 

taken over by the State before the date of repeal. That indeed would be 

the effect of Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. Once this position is 

accepted, there is possibly no logic or justification for not applying this 

law to the land exempted under Section 20(1) but exemption of which is 

withdrawn after the date of repeal. If the power of the Government to 

acquire the land in the event of withdrawal of exemption before the 

repeal is not saved by the Repeal Act except in a case where the exercise 

of such power is completed by not just deemed vesting under Section 

10(3) but by taking over of physical possession under Section 10(5) or 

10(6), there is no reason why such power is saved for a land, the 

exemption of which is withdrawn after the repeal. 

31 
Even Section 4 of the Repeal Act is a pointer to show that

applicability of SubSection(2) of Section 20 of the Principal Act as also 

applicability of the provisions of Chapter III to lands earlier subject to 

exemptions under SubSection(1) of Section 20, but which exemptions 

were withdrawn either before or after the repeal, is not saved. Section 4 

makes it clear that all proceedings relating to any order made or 

purported to be made under the Principal Act shall lapse save and except 

proceedings under Section 11 to 14 in relation to land, possession of 

which has been taken over by the State Government under the Act. 

Section 4 does not make any distinction in respect of proceedings in 

relation to (i) land which has become excess vacant land by reason of 

withdrawal of exemption order Section 20(2) and (ii) all other excess 

vacant lands. Just as in the case of all other lands, where possession is not 

taken over, even in the case of lands, to which Chapter III is being applied 

by reason of withdrawal of the exemption order, the proceedings would 

clearly abate. Any other interpretation would be clearly contrary to the 

plain reading of Section 4. 

32 
The Repeal Act, thus, does not save any order passed or to be 

passed under Section 20(2) withdrawing exemption under Section 20(1) 

of the Principal Act and thereby applying Chapter III to the land in 

question. If anything, the repealing statute would have expressly provided 

so. It does not provide for saving of either Section 20(2) or any order 

passed under Section 20(2). When the applicability of the whole of 

Chapter III is done away with in relation to all excess vacant land other 

than land of which possession is taken by the State under that chapter, 

there is no discernible reason why that Chapter should apply to land 

exemption of which has been withdrawn under Section 20(2) of the 

Principal Act. Upon withdrawal of exemption, such land is like any other

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

excess vacant land and the provisions of the Principal Act including 

Chapter III will cease to apply to it unless the vesting of such land in the 

State Government is followed by taking over of possession. Thus, it is 

clear that the saving clause of the Repeal Act does not save the land once 

exempted under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act from the application of 

the repeal. 

33 
Let us now consider if it is saved by the provisions of Section 

6 of the General Clauses Act. Learned Advocate General relied upon the 

judgment of the Supreme Court in Bansidhar Vs. State of Rajasthan 1 

and submitted that a saving provision in a repealing statute is not 

exhaustive of the rights and liabilities which are saved or which survive 

the repeal, and Section 6 of the General Clauses Act can still be invoked 

so as to save other rights, privileges, obligations and liabilities which have 

been acquired or accrued or incurred under the repealed statute before 

the date of the repeal. The Court in that case reiterated the law laid 

down in I.T. Commissioner Vs. Shah Sadiq & Sons 2 , to the following 

effect: (SCC P. 524, para 15) 

" 
...In other words whatever rights are expressly 
saved by the 'savings' provision stand saved. But that does not 
mean that rights which are not saved by the 'savings' provision 
are extinguished or stand ipso facto terminated by the mere 
fact that a new statute repealing the old statute is enacted. 
Rights which have accrued are saved unless they are taken 
away expressly. This is the principle behind Section 6(c), 
General Clauses Act, 1897.... " 

But then as the Supreme Court has held in Bansidhar's case 

itself, as also in a numerous other cases, what we have to also see is,

whether the repealing statute exhibits a contrary intention. Section 6 of 

the General Clauses Act provides the various contingencies which a repeal 

does not affect, but prefaces that by providing: "unless a different 

intention appears". In Kalawati Devi Harlake Vs. The Commissioner of 

Income Tax, West Bengal 1 , the Supreme Court was concerned with the 

Income Tax Act, 1922, which was repealed by the Income Tax Act, 1961. 

The Commissioner of Income Tax in that case had issued a notice 

regarding incometax assessments of the assessee for the years 195253 to 

196061, which, according to the Commissioner, were erroneous and 

prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, and for which the Commissioner 

proposed to issue proceedings under Section 33 B of the Income Tax Act, 

1922. The assessee claimed that the Income Tax Act, 1922 was repealed 

by the Income Tax Act, 1961 which came into force on April 1, 1962, and 

that powers under the repealed Act under Section 33 B could not any 

longer be exercised. Section 297 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provided for 

the repeal of the 1922 Act and also provided savings therefrom. Section 

297 did not cover saving of the proceedings under Section 33B of the 

repealed Act after the repeal. The Department, however, relied upon 

Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. The Supreme Court noted that 

Section 297 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provided for various 

'proceedings' which may be initiated and prosecuted or continued in 

respect of any past matter or assessment. The Court observed that Section 

297 was meant to provide as far as possible for all contingencies which 

may arise out of the repeal of the 1922 Act and that Section 297 did not 

provide for saving of provisions regarding appeals, revisions etc. in 

respect of assessment orders already made or which were authorized to 

be made under that Section. The Income Tax department, however, 

argued that the Parliament had Section 6 of the General Clauses Act in

view and therefore no express provision was made dealing with appeals 

and revisions, etc. This contention was rejected the Supreme Court in the 

following words: (Pg 168 of AIR 1968 SC 162) 

" (15) 
The learned counsel for the appellant submits 
that Parliament had S. 6 of the General Clauses Act in 
view, and therefore no express provision was made 
dealing with appeals and revisions, etc. 
In our view 
Section 6 of the General Clauses Act would not apply 
because Section 297(2) evidences an intention to the 
contrary. 
In Union of India v. Madan Gopal Kabra, 
(1954) 24 ITR 58 = (AIR 1954 SC 158) while interpreting 
Section 13 of the Finance Act, 1950, already extracted 
above, this Court observed at p. 68 (of ITR) = (at p. 162 of 
AIR) : 

"Nor can section 6 of the General Clauses Act 
1897, serve to keep alive the liability to pay tax on the 
income of the year 194950 assuming it to have accrued 
under the repealed State law, for a "different intention" 
clearly appears in sections 2 and 13 of the Finance Act 
read together as indicated above." 

It is true that whether a different intention appears or not 
must depend on the language and content of Section 
297(2). It seems to us, however, that by providing for so 
many matters mentioned above some in accord with what 
would have been the result under Section 6 of the General 
Clauses Act and some contrary to what have been the result 
under Section 6, Parliament has clearly evidenced an 
intention to the contrary. " 

34 
The repealing statute in our case, as noted above, exhibits a 

contrary intention to not to save anything which is not expressly saved by 

the saving clauses contained in Sections 3 and 4 thereof. 

35 
Even otherwise, assuming that Clauses (a) to (e) of Section 6

of the General Clauses Act were to apply to acts, or rights and liabilities, 

or proceedings under the Principal Act after the repeal, it is difficult to see 

how the exemption order can be withdrawn or provisions of Chapter III 

can be applied to such land upon withdrawal of exemption. The argument 

of the State is that by virtue of Clause (c) of Section 6, rights, privileges, 

obligations or liabilities under the repealed Principal Act, are saved. 

Clause (c) talks about any right, privilege, obligation or liability "acquired, 

accrued or incurred" under the repealed enactment. Mere existence of a 

right, which has not been "acquired" or "accrued" on the date of the 

repeal, would not get protection under Clause (c) of Section 6. So also a 

liability cannot be enforced under the provisions of the repealed statute 

unless the same is "incurred". 

36 
In the case of Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd. Vs. Amrit 

Lal & Co. 1 , the Supreme Court explained the provision thus: 

" 25. The opening words of Section 6 specify the field over 
which it is operative. It is operative over all the enactments 
under the General Clauses Act, Central Act or regulations 
made after the commencement of General Clauses Act. It 
also clarifies in case of repeal of any provision under the 
aforesaid Act or regulation, unless a different intention 
appears from such repeal, it would have no effect over the 
matters covered in its clauses viz. (a) to (e). It clearly 
specifies that the repeal shall not revive anything not in 
force or in existence or affect the previous operation of any 
enactment so repealed or anything duly done or suffered or 
affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, 
accrued or incurred under the repealed statute, affect any

penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any 
offence committed under the repealed statute and also does 
not affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in 
respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, 
penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid. 
Thus the 
central theme which spells out is that any investigation or 
legal proceeding pending may be continued and enforced as 
if the repealing Act or regulation had not come into force. 

26. 
As a general rule, in view of Section 6, the repeal of a 
statute, which is not retrospective in operation, does not 
prima facie affect the pending proceedings which may be 
continued as if the repealed enactment were still in force. In 
other words, such repeal does not effect the pending cases 
which would continue to be concluded as if the enactment 
has not been repealed. In fact when a lis commences, all 
rights and obligations of the parties gets crystalised on that 
date. The mandate of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is 
simply to leave the pending proceedings unaffected which 
commenced under the unrepealed provisions unless 
contrary intention is expressed. We find clause (c) of 
Section 6, refers the words "any right, privilege, obligation... 
acquired or accrued" under the repealed statute would not 
be affected by the repealing statute. We may hasten to 
clarify here, mere existence of a right not being "acquired" 
or "accrued", on the date of the repeal, would not get 
protection of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. " 

In Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises (supra), the Supreme 

Court quoted its decision in M. S. Shivananda Vs. Karnataka SRTC 1 in 

this connection, which in turn quoted the eloquent observations of the 

Privy Council in the case of Director of Public Works Vs. Ho Po Sang 2 in 

this behalf, as follows: 

'It may be, therefore, that under some repealed 
enactment, a right has been given but that, in respect of it, 
some investigation or legal proceeding is necessary. The 
right is then unaffected and preserved. It will be preserved 
even if a process of quantification is necessary. But there 
is a manifest distinction between an investigation in respect 
of a right and an investigation which is to decide whether

*213* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

some right should be or should not be given. On a repeal, 
the former is preserved by the Interpretation Act. The latter 
is not.' 

(emphasis supplied) 

Even in Bansidhar's case the Supreme Court, whilst 

construing Clauses (c) and (e) of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 

had said this: 

" 30. For purposes of these clauses the 'right' 
must be 'accrued' and not merely an inchoate 
one. The distinction between what is and what 
is not a right preserved by Section 6 of the 
General Clauses Act, it is said, if often one of 
great fineness. What is unaffected by the repeal 
is a right 'acquired' or 'accrued' under the 
repealed statute and not 'a mere hope or 
expectation' of acquiring a right or liberty to 
apply for a right.' " 

37 
Now let us see, how the provisions of the Principal Act with 

which we are concerned in the present case, namely, Section 20(2) and 

generally the provisions of Chapter III, fare in the context of an order 

under Section 20(2), in this behalf. What is argued is that the landholder 

holding an exemption under Section 20(1) attracts the liability to have 

the exemption withdrawn and Chapter III of the Principal Act applied to 

the land. This may certainly be called an existing liability and the 

Government can be said to have a corresponding right to withdraw the 

exemption and apply Chapter III to the land in question. But the question 

is, is it an "incurred" or "accrued" right, as understood by law in the 

context of application of Section 6. The consequence of a purported non 

compliance with any of the conditions of an exemption order under 

Section 20(1) of the Principal Act is that "it shall be competent for the 

State Government to withdraw, by order, such exemption." Such order can 

be passed if "the State Government is satisfied" that any condition is not

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*214* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

complied with, and such satisfaction can be reached only "after giving a 

reasonable opportunity to such person for making a representation 

against the proposed withdrawal". And only after all this is done and an 

order of withdrawal of exemption is passed that "the provisions of this 

Chapter shall apply". Even application of Chapter III itself does not ispso 

facto imply vesting of the land in the State Government. It only means 

that the elaborate machinery of Section 6, 8, 9 and 10, including the 

hearings at each of these stages, will have to be gone through before the 

vesting can take place. It is not as if the exemption stands ispso facto 

withdrawn and the land is deemed to be vested in the State Government 

upon breach of a condition of exemption. 

38 
In the first place, whether there is a breach and therefore, a 

corresponding right to the State to acquire excess vacant land, will itself 

have to be ascertained. An investigation and a proceeding involving an 

opportunity to show cause to the defaulting landholder are required to 

enable the Government to pass an order withdrawing the exemption. 

Thereafter, further investigation and proceedings will have to be 

undertaken to ascertain if the land is excess vacant land and whether the 

land is to be acquired. During these proceedings, the landowner may even 

apply that the excess vacant land may not be treated as excess under the 

provisions of Section 21 or even present another Scheme under Section 

20 for exemption. In other words, before an "accrued" or "acquired" 

vesting right can be claimed by the State, a whole of gamut of 

investigation and proceedings will have to be gone through. Thus, neither 

is any divesting of the land to the State "incurred" by the landholder nor 

is the vesting "accrued" to, or "acquired" by, the State.

*215* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

39 
Thus, in the first place, there is no "withdrawal of exemption" 

under Section 20(2) "incurred" nor any right to withdraw exemption and 

apply Chapter III is "accrued" or "acquired" by the State. And as for 

'vesting' of the land in the State, there is not even a statable case that the 

'vesting' is in any way "acquired" or "accrued" in favour of the State at the 

stage of breach of a condition or even at the stage of withdrawal of the 

exemption. There is, in that case, no question of application of Section 

6(c) of the General Clauses Act to the breach of a condition of an 

exemption order and saving of the Government's power to withdraw the 

exemption or apply Chapter III or acquire the land thereunder. 

40 
Thus, neither the savings clause of the Repeal Act nor Section 

6 of the General Clauses Act saves the provisions of Section 20(2) or the 

applicability of Chapter III of the Principal Act in relation to an exemption 

order passed under Section 20(1). If the conditions of exemption granted 

under Section 20(1) are breached, neither can the exemption be 

withdrawn after the repeal nor could Chapter III be applied to the land 

upon withdrawal of such exemption after the repeal. There is no question 

of the State Government seeking to acquire such land any time after the 

repeal. 

41 
That still leaves the question: Are there any consequences 

(apart from the ones discussed above) of the validity of the exemption 

order saved under Section 3(1) (b) of the Repeal Act. We have noted that 

the validity of an exemption order covers both the privilege, namely, the 

exemption, and the conditions attached to that privilege. But we have also 

noted that breach of these conditions cannot be visited with the 

consequence of either withdrawal of exemption under Section 20(2) or

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

application of the other provisions of Chapter III after such withdrawal. If, 

however, the exemption order together with its conditions could be 

implemented or enforced by the State or any beneficiary of a scheme 

sanctioned under Section 20(1), otherwise than by recourse to Section 

20(2) or other provisions of Chapter III of the Principal Act, when the 

Principal Act was in force, there is no reason why such implementation or 

enforcement is not possible after the repeal. Take the case of an 

exemption order under Section 20(1) for a housing scheme with an 

express condition of handing over a specified number of tenements to the 

State Government. If the scheme is not implemented at all, the State has 

no means of implementing the condition except by recourse to Section 

20(2) by withdrawing the exemption and applying the provisions of 

Chapter III to the land. The Principal Act not being in force, this course is 

not available to the State after the repeal. But if the scheme is 

implemented, and a housing project is actually brought up on the land, 

but the tenements have not been handed over to the State Government, 

can the State Government not require the land owner to hand over the 

tenements to the State Government, without withdrawing the exemption 

under Section 20(2). The answer is yes. The State may go to a court of 

law or devise any other means, legislative or executive, acceptable to law 

to recover the possession of the tenements due to it. If the State could do 

it when the principal statute was in force, there is no reason why it cannot 

do so after the repeal, especially if the repealing statute expressly saves 

the validity of both the exemption and the conditions on which it is based. 

Take another case. An exemption order is issued under Section 20(1) in 

respect of a land on a condition that such land shall be used only for 

industrial purpose. This condition could have been implemented by the 

State otherwise than by recourse to Section 20(2) of the Principal Act, say

by not sanctioning any plans for a non -industrial user. If the State could 

do it before the repeal, it can do so even after the repeal. After all the 

exemption order and its conditions are valid even after the repeal. 

42 
In a sense, these are actions taken under the Principal Act 

which have achieved a finality. In the case of the housing scheme referred 

to in the example above, the housing scheme is completed. (It may even 

be substantially completed.) The liability to hand over the tenements to 

the Government has crystalized and has been incurred. The Government 

in turn has acquired an enforceable right to get the tenements. In the 

second case, namely, exemption on the condition of industrial user, the 

exemption is a completed act. The land has been exempted under the 

provisions of Section 20(1) on the condition that the only permissible user 

would be the industrial user. No further act is required either on the part 

of the landholder or the Government to make the condition enforceable. 

The liability to not to use the land for a nonindustrial user is incurred by 

the landholder and can be enforced by the Government in any manner 

known to law. 

43 
This, then, is the answer to the main question posed to the 

Full Bench. What is saved by the saving clause of the repealing statute is 

the validity of an exemption order, and it means the validity of both the 

exemption and the conditions on which it is granted. But that does not 

mean that the breach of any condition of the exemption order can be 

visited with the consequence of either withdrawal of exemption under 

Section 20(2) or application of Chapter III of the Principal Act to the land. 

At the same time, if it were permissible to implement or enforce the 

exemption order in any manner acceptable to law otherwise than by

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

recourse to Section 20(2) or Chapter III of the Principal Act, such 

implementation or enforcement is permissible even after the repeal. 

44 
To this extent, I am not in agreement with the view expressed 

by the Andhra Pradesh and Delhi High Courts, respectively, in Surendra 

Raj Jaiswal vs. Government of Andhra Pradesh 1 and Tej Pratap Singh 

vs. Union of India 2 . I am in respectful agreement with the view of the 

learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of 

Surendra Raj Jaiswal (supra) that on noncompliance of conditions of an 

exemption order, the State Government after the repeal of the Principal 

Act was not empowered to withdraw the exemption granted under 

Section 20(1). With respect, however, I do not agree with his view that in 

the absence of the power to withdraw the exemption, the conditions have 

become unenforceable and are nonest or that such land has become 

freehold land irrespective of any conditions with regard to the usage of 

the exempted land. So also, for the reasons discussed above, I am in 

respectful disagreement with the statement of law by the Delhi High 

Court in the case of Tej Pratap Singh (supra) that after the repeal, the 

conditions of exemption, which remain unimplemented, cannot be 

implemented because they are not specifically saved. The conditions are 

saved because the exemption order as a whole is saved. They can even be 

enforced, if the liability created thereby has been incurred, as discussed 

above. One of the reasons cited by the Delhi High Court whilst arriving at 

this conclusion was the provision of Section 3(1) (c) of the Repeal Act. In 

Tej Pratap Singh's case (supra) the exemption under Section 20(1) was 

granted on a condition requiring certain payment to be made to the State 

Government. The Delhi High Court held that under Section 3(1) (c) the

*219* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

actual payment was saved, but not the condition of payment. The Court 

felt that had it not been specifically provided that the payment made to 

the State Government was saved despite the repeal, the same would have 

been affected by the repeal. From this, the Court deduced that in the 

context of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, the landholder's right to 

exemption under Section 20(1) is specifically saved, but not the 'liability' 

to make the payment, unless the payment had already been made prior to 

the repeal. I am afraid that would not be a correct way of dealing with the 

question of validity of a condition or any liability created thereunder. As 

discussed by me above, and explained in the judgment of my brother 

Dharmadhikari J, the exemption order and its conditions are both valid. 

That is the consequence of Section 3(1) (b) itself. One need not have 

recourse to Section 3(1) (c) for that validity. Just as any other condition is 

valid, so is the condition requiring payment is valid. The question only is 

whether, and to what extent, this valid condition can be enforced. As 

explained by me above, if the scheme under which exemption was 

granted was not implemented or acted upon at all (or 
even 

substantially), the only consequence of noncompliance of such condition 

(say, of payment) would be to withdraw the exemption and apply Chapter 

III to the land. That is, as explained above, not permissible. But if it is 

implemented or substantially acted upon, then surely in a given case the 

condition can be enforced without withdrawal of exemption in a manner 

known to law, i.e. by any acceptable judicial, legislative or executive 

device. 

45. 
The only question is, why is then the provision of Section 

3(1) (c) at all necessary, for a completed payment, it may be argued, may 

be saved on the above logic under Section 3(1) (b) itself. The answer, to 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*220* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

my mind, is twofold. Firstly, one does not know whether in all cases of 

actual payment already made before the repeal, the scheme itself 

providing amongst other things payment to the Government is 

implemented or even substantially acted upon (other than making of such 

payment). It may be that only payment to the Government is made, but 

nothing else is acted upon. In that case, the payment may not be saved 

under the general clause, namely, Section 3(1) (b) and a special provision 

may be necessary to save such payment. Secondly, making a special 

provision by way of abundant caution despite application of the general 

provision, is a well known legislative device, which the legislature many a 

time adopts. In a case which is covered by reason of the general provision 

of Section 3(1) (b), the provision of Section 3(1) (c) acts ex majori 

cautela. Thus, the existence of Section 3(1) (c) can be justified in the face 

of Section 3(1) (b). 

46. 
In the light of the above discussion, my answers to the 

questions referred to the Full Bench are as follows : 

(a) 
Question No.(1) in the Affirmative. Section 3(1)(b) of the 

Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 saves the validity 

of the orders of exemption under Section 20(1) of the Urban Land 

(Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 including the validity of all terms and 

conditions thereof and all actions taken thereunder. Section 6 of the 

General Clauses Act, 1897 and Section 7 of the Bombay General Clauses 

Act, 1904 have no application in this behalf. 

(b) 
Question No.(2) in the Negative. Section 6 of the General 

Clauses Act, 1897 read with or without Section 7 of the Bombay General 

Clauses Act, 1904 does not apply to the repeal of the Urban Land (Ceiling

and Regulation) Act, 1976 by the Repealing Act, 1999. The application of 

these sections is excluded by the contrary intention expressed in the 

provisions of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999. 

(c) 
Question (3) (a) in the Negative. There is no question of 

enforcement of the order of exemption under Section 20(1) or its terms 

and conditions, in accordance with the provisions of the Urban Land 

(Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976. Neither can the exemption granted 

under Section 20(1) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 

1976 be withdrawn for breach of conditions under Section 20(2) nor can 

Chapter III be applied to the land exempted under Section 20(1) after 

withdrawal of the exemption under Section 20(2) of the Urban Land 

(Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976. 

(d) 
Question (3)(b) in the Affirmative, with a clarification that 

the order of exemption can be implemented or enforced in any manner 

acceptable to law, if, and to the extent, such order could be implemented 

or enforced otherwise than by recourse to the Urban Land (Ceiling and 

Regulation) Act, 1976. The State may enforce the order together with 

its conditions through a Court of law or devise any legislative or 

executive means to implement the order of exemption and its 

conditions. The enforceability of the order, and legality of the measure 

adopted for its implementation will, however, have to be decided in the 

facts and circumstances of each individual case. 

(e) 
Question No.(4) (a) in the Negative. The State cannot 

recall/cancel/modify any exemption order granted under Section 20 of 

the Principal Act at any time after the coming into force of the Repeal Act.

*222* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

(f) 
Question No.(4)(b) in the Affirmative, subject to a 

clarification that though enforceability of any circular issued for 

implementation of an order of exemption issued under Section 20 of the 

Principal Act is not affected by the repeal, whether, and to what extent, 

such circular is valid will have to be decided in the facts and 

circumstances of each case. It is not possible to lay down any general 

proposition with respect to its validity. 

(g) 
Question No.(4)(c) in the Negative. The State Government 

cannot acquire the land which was exempted under Section 20(1) of the 

Principal Act by issuing notification under Section 10(3) of the Principal 

Act. 

(h) 
Question No.(4)(d) in the Affirmative, but with a clarification 

that no action is possible at any time after the repeal of the Principal Act 

in respect of noncompliance/breach of an exemption order issued under 

Section 20(1) of the Principal Act under the provisions of either Section 

20(2) of the Principal Act or under Chapter III of the Principal Act in any 

manner whatsoever. 

(i) 
Answer to Question No.(5) as follows. The view taken in the 

case of Vithabai Bama Bhandari vs. State of Maharashtra sets out the 

correct legal position as regards the ambit and scope of Section 3(1)(b) of 

the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999. It has no 

conflict with the view taken by this Court in the case of Mira Bhayandar 

Builders and Developers Welfare Association vs. The Deputy Collector 

and Competent Authority, Thane Urban Agglomeration and others. 

The case of Damodar Laxman Navare and others vs. State of 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*223* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

Maharashtra and others deals with the question as to whether it was 

open to the Collector and Competent Authority in that case to issue 

instructions to the SubRegistrar of Assurances to not to register any 

document. The view taken in that case that it was not open to the 

Collector to issue such instructions as he had no Appellate, Supervisory 

or Revisional powers over the Registering Officer, is correct and in 

consonance with the law laid down by our Court in the case of 

Sundersons & Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. The judgment in 

Damodar Laxman Navare and others Vs. State of Maharashtra and 

others does not deal with the question as to whether any order passed 

before the repeal of the Principal Act under Section 10(1) or (3) in 

respect of a land, after its exemption under Section 20(1) was withdrawn 

under Section 20(2), is saved after the repeal. As held by me above, such 

order does not survive the repeal of the Principal Act. In so far as the 

judgment of our Court in Mira Bhayandar Builders and Developers 

Welfare Association vs. The Deputy Collector and Competent 

Authority is concerned, the view expressed therein that the landholders, 

who have taken the benefit of the schemes under Section 20 of the 

Principal Act by constructing buildings, cannot after the repeal of the 

Principal Act wriggle out of their obligations to surrender flats to the 

Government, is correct, but for the reasons discussed above. The legality 

of the means adopted by the State Government or any other person for 

holding the landholders to their respective obligations under such 

schemes will, however, have to be decided in each case having regard to 

the facts and circumstances of the individual case.

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

(Per G.S.Kulkarni, J): 
I have gone through the erudite judgment of my 

learned brother S.C.Dharmadhikari, J. While I am fully in agreement with the 

reasoning and conclusions as arrived by my learned brother, I wish to pen down 

few thoughts. 

1. 
The principal question is as to whether after the repeal of the Urban 

Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act 1976 (for short the 'Principal Act') what 

would be the legal position of an order granting exemption under sub-section (1) 

of section 20. To what extent Section 3 sub-section (1) (b) of the Urban Land 

(Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act 1999 (for short Repeal Act) saves the 

validity of such an exemption order or any action taken thereunder? This 

position is required to be ascertained from the examination of the provisions of 

the Repeal Act and mainly the provisions of Section 3 and 4 of the Repeal Act 

and the application of section 6 of the General Clauses Act vis-a-vis the 

Principal Act. 

2. 
The Repeal Act was brought into effect by the State Legislature w.e.f. 

29.11.2007. Section 3 is the saving clause which provides that the repeal of the 

principal Act shall not affect the following: 

(i) 
Vesting of any vacant land under sub-section (3) of section 10 

possession of which has been taken over by the State government or any 

person duly authorized by the State government in this behalf or by the 

competent authority; 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*225* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

(ii) the validity of any order granting exemption under sub-section (1) of 

section 20 or any action taken thereunder notwithstanding any judgment 

of any Court to the contrary; 

(iii) any payment made to the State Government as a condition for 

granting exemption under sub-section (1) of section 20, 

Sub-section (2) postulates that where any land is deemed to have vested 

in the State Government under sub section (3) of section 10 of the principal Act, 

but possession of which has not been taken over by the State Government, AND 

Any amount has been paid by the State Government with respect to such 

land then such land shall not be restored unless the amount paid if any has been 

refunded to the State Government. 

3. 
Section 4 of the Repeal Act provides for abatement of the legal 

proceedings and provides that all proceedings relating to any order or purporting 

to be made under the principal Act pending immediately before the 

commencement of the repeal Act before any Court, tribunal shall abate. 

The proviso to this section, stipulates that the section shall not apply to 

the provisions relating to section 11 to 14, of the principal Act in so far as such 

provisions are relatable to the land possession of which has been taken over by 

the State Government. 

4. 
The intention of the legislature in regard to the repeal of the principal 

Act is required to be gathered from the provisions of sections 1 to 4 of the 

Repeal Act. The Repeal Act is required to be seen in its entirety so as to find out 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*226* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

as to what is the true nature of the repeal as contemplated by the legislation. The 

intention of the legislature which can be gathered from these provisions is as 

under:-. 

(i) 
That the principal Act stands repealed. (Section 2) 

(ii) 
The repeal of the principal Act shall not affect the vesting of any vacant 

land under Sub-section (3) of Section 10, possession of which has been taken 

over by the State Government . (Section 3(1)(a)) 

(iii) The repeal of the principal Act shall not affect the validity of any order 

granting exemption under sub-section (1) of section 20 or any action taken 

thereunder, notwithstanding any judgment of any Court to the contrary. (Section 

3(1)(b)) 

(iv) The repeal of the principal Act shall not affect any payment made to the 

State Government as a condition for granting exemption under sub-section (1) of 

section 20. (Section 3(1)(c)) 

(v) 
The repeal of the principal Act shall not affect any land which is deemed 

to have been vested in the State Government under sub-section (3) of Section 10 

of the principal Act but possession of which has not been taken over by the State 

Government and any amount which has been paid by the State Government 

with respect to such land, then, such land shall not be restored unless the amount 

paid, if any, has been refunded to the State Government. 

(Section 3(2)(a) & (b)) 

(vi) That on the repeal of the principal Act all proceedings relating to any 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 ::: 


*227* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

order made or purported to be made under the principal Act pending 

immediately before the commencement of this Act, before any Court, tribunal or 

any other authority shall stand abated and that abatement shall not apply to the 

proceedings relating to Section 11 to 14 of the principal Act, insofar as such 

proceedings are relatable to the land, possession of which has been taken over by 

the State Government. (Section 4) 

7. 
The aforesaid consequences of the Repeal Act if seen in the context 

of Section 3 of the Repeal Act, it becomes apparent that firstly the Repeal Act in 

no uncertain terms saves vesting of any vacant land, possession of which has 

been taken over by the State Government; secondly, the validity of any order 

granting exemption under sub-section (1) of Section 20 or any action taken 

thereunder is also saved. 

8. 
The plain wordings of sub-clause (b) of Section 3(1) of the Repeal 

Act are required to be given due meaning as they deserve. The interpretation of 

sub-clause (b) of Section 3(1) is required to be meaningful so as to protect the 

object which the provision intends to achieve. What is sought to be achieved is 

the validity of an exemption order issued under sub-section (1) of Section 20 or 

any action taken thereunder. Not only the validity of Section 20(1) is saved but 

also any action taken thereunder notwithstanding any judgment of any Court to 

the contrary. 

9. 
To appreciate the meaning which needs to be attributed to Section 

3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act, an exemption order issued under Section 20(1) is 

required to be kept in mind. A sample copy of the exemption order has been 

tendered to the Court on behalf of the petitioners. A perusal of this exemption

order shows the following attributes:-

(i) 
That the beneficiary of an exemption order admittedly holds vacant land 

in excess of ceiling limit. This is by virtue of the application of the Principal Act 

more particularly Chapter III. 

(ii) 
The beneficiary applies for exemption under Section 20 of the Act in 

regard to the excess land for providing sites and services, core, house and 

construction of tenements as per the guidelines issued under the Government 

Resolutions, Housing & Special Assistance Department dated 22.8.1988. 

(iii) The beneficiary undertakes that the construction of tenements would be 

governed under the MOFA Act or the MCS Act,1960. 

(iv) On such application the Government takes an action of being satisfied 

that having regard to the location of the land the purpose for which the land is 

being proposed to be used and other relevant factors it is necessary in public 

interest to grant exemption and thus exempts the vacant land from the provisions 

of Chapter III of the ULC Act. 

(v) 
The exemption is granted by the State Government on several conditions 

inter alia being:-

(a) 
the land exempted shall be for the purpose of construction of tenements; 

(b) 
any change made in the user of the land would amount to breach of the 

conditions; 

(c) 
tenements to be constructed are required to be of a particular 

specification; 

(d) 
the beneficiary shall get the lay out of the building plan approved from 

the concerned planning authority; 

(e) 
that the construction is required to be commenced and completed as per 

the time limit as specified; 

(f) 
in case buildings are incomplete and/or construction is not completed, the

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

exemption shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and vacant land and such 

land with structures and the land appurtenant shall be acquired as per Chapter III 

of ULC Act,1976. 

(g) 
that the exempted land with or without building shall not be transferred 

except for the purpose of mortgage (in favour of financial institutions) failing 

which the exemption granted shall stand withdrawn. Necessary returns are 

required to be filed to the State Government in a prescribed form to show the 

progress of the work done by the beneficiary. In case of breach of the order, it 

shall be competent for the State Government to withdraw by an order exemption 

from the date specified in the order. 

(h) 
The beneficiary will advertise the entire scheme within six months from 

the date of sanction order of the State Government. 

An exemption order issued under Section 20(1) of the Principal 

Act stipulates these different conditions, and it is on these conditions the vacant 

land would cease to be out of the purview of Chapter III of the Principal Act. 

These conditions include the condition on the part of the beneficiary to subject 

himself 

to the provision of Chapter III in case there is breach of any conditions of the 

exemption order on his part. 

It is significant that the power to exempt as provided under section 20 of 

the principal Act begins with a non-obstante clause and reads thus: 

" 20. Power to exempt: (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any of 
the foregoing provisions of this Chapter,................".(Emphasis 
supplied) 

It is therefore clear that power under section 20 is an independent power 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:41 ::: 


*230* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

notwithstanding the other provisions as contained in Chapter III namely section 

3 to section 19 and Section 21 to section 24. 
If the Government exercises 

powers under section 20 sub-section (1) such an exercise would be an 

independent exercise, irrespective of the applicability of other provisions of the 

provisions of chapter III. It certainly cannot be construed that once an 

exemption order under section 20 sub-section (1) was issued, the land which is 

otherwise subject to the provision of section 3 to section 19 of the Principal Act, 

for the exemption becomes immune from the applicability of the said provisions, 

the consequences of which are deemed to have taken place the moment of the 

Act became applicable to such vacant land. Further once an exemption is granted 

under section 20 (1) it is an admitted position that the land is a vacant land and 

the beneficiary by his volition subjects himself to the terms and conditions of the 

exemption order. Once this position is established a beneficiary of section 20 (1) 

order cannot contend that everything under the exemption order has become 

redundant due to the repeal of the Act. Such contention in my opinion is wholly 

against the express provisions of section 3 (1) (b) of the Repeal Act which saves 

the validity of an exemption order. It is therefore seen that Section 20 is in the 

nature of an exception to the general rules as contained in Chapter III of the 

principal Act which deal with the ceiling on vacant land and the manner in which 

such lands would be dealt under the provisions of chapter III of the Act. 

The intention of the Legislature which is apparent from the 

wordings of Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act is to save in totality the validity of 

an order granting exemption under sub-section (1) of Section 20 of the Act or 

any action taken thereunder. When the legislature saves the validity of a Section 

20(1) order which includes all the conditions including the condition that in case 

of breach of any of the conditions provisions of Chapter III would become 

applicable, then it will not be possible to read into the provisions of Section 3(1) 

(b) of the Repeal Act that the legislature intended otherwise. In other words, the 

::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:41 ::: 


*231* 

FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw 

validity of an exemption order as saved by Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act 

cannot be read de hors its conditions inasmuch as the said provision mandates 

that an order granting exemption under Sub-section (1) of Section 20 is valid 

wholesomely. It would be an absurdity to say that such an exemption order 

would remain valid de hors the conditions on which it is issued. The word 

"validity" as used in Section 3(1)(b) is of considerable significance. Black Law 

Dictionary (8th Edition) would refer the word "valid" to mean as under:-

"legally sufficient, binding, a valid contract" 

If this is what the Legislature intended then necessarily the validity 

of an exemption order under Section 20(1) would include all attributes necessary 

to keep an exemption order valid and therefore would also include the 

applicability of Chapter III of the Principal Act. De hors the applicability of 

Chapter III which is one of the prime conditions of a Section 20(1) exemption 

order, the validity of such exemption order as saved by the provisions of Section 

3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act would be rendered meaningless. In any event the 

beneficiary of an exemption order can be the last person to quarrel about this 

proposition as he has accepted the exemption order in totality which includes 

acceptance to the applicability of Chapter III of the Principal Act. 

It is well settled that if the words used by the legislature in framing the 

legislation have a necessary meaning, it is the duty of the Court to construe the 

clause accordingly irrespective of the inconvenience that may be caused 

(Argumentum Ab Inconvenienti Plurimum Valet In Lege). In the context of a 

Section 20 exemption order and considering the plain reading of section 3 (1) (b) 

of the Repeal Act the interpretation as suggested by the petitioners would lead to 

extravagant results, away from the object which the saving provision intends to

achieve. 

It is settled that a saving provision in a repeal statute is not 

exhaustive of the rights, obligations so saved or rights that survives the repeal as 

is clear from the judgment of the Constitution Bench in the case of "Bansidhar 

& Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan & ors" reported in (1998) 2 SCC 557 It is, 

therefore, imperative that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act which provides 

for the effect of a repeal, stands completely attracted. Section 6(c) of the 

General Clauses Act provides that the repeal shall not affect any right, privilege, 

obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment was 

repealed unless a different intention appears. 

A proper examination of the provisions of the Repeal Act and more 

particularly the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 do not indicate that it would be 

the intention of the Legislature to save the validity of a Section 20(1) Exemption 

Order to exclude the enforcing power being applicability of Chapter III of the 

Principal Act being one of the conditions under the exemption order. It cannot 

be said that the rights accrued and the liabilities incurred under Section 20(1) 

exemption order stands completely effaced when the validity of such an 

exemption order has been saved by the provisions of Section 3(1)(b) of the 

Repeal Act. As no such contrary intention can be gathered from the provisions 

of the Repeal Act, the petitioner's contentions that the validity of the exemption 

order as saved by Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act is valid de hors the 

conditions of the exemption order cannot be accepted on the basis of the plain 

wordings of Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act. In the decision of the Supreme 

Court in the case of "Shantibai Gaikwad Vs. Shivajibhai Haribhai" reported in 

"2005(5) SCC 101", the Supreme Court has once again recognized the principle

that a repealing statute is not exhaustive and does not automatically extinguish 

accrued rights unless they are taken away completely. The Repeal Act in no 

manner expressly takes away the applicability of the conditions under Section 

20(1) exemption order. In fact the intention of the legislature is to wholesomely 

save the validity of an exemption order which ipso facto include the teeth 

namely to take action under Chapter III of the Principal Act in case of breach of 

the condition under which an exemption has been granted for the beneficiary of 

the Section 20(1) of the order. 

The petitioners contention that for some reason the scheme under a 

section 20 (1) order could not be completed and hence the exemption order 

cannot be enforced due to the repeal of the Principal Act, cannot be accepted. 

Once the legislature holds an exemption order issued under section 20 (1) to be 

valid, all incidental powers which are necessary to preserve its validity would be 

available to the State. This would be firstly by virtue of the clear provisions of 

section 3 (1) (b) of the Repeal Act and secondly by virtue of the provisions of 

section 6 of the General Clauses Act. Any other interpretation would be nothing 

short of doing a violence to the solemn intention of the legislature in saving the 

validity of an exception order by in view of the express provisions of section 3 

(1) (b) of the Repeal Act. 

In view of the aforesaid discussion, the legal position as would 

emerge can be summarized as under:-

(a) 
Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act saves the validity of an order 

granting exemption under sub-section (1) of Section 20 or any action taken 

thereunder, notwithstanding any judgment of any Court to the contrary.

(b) 
this would mean that the validity of Section 20(1) exemption order 

is saved in every regard so as to hold the same valid for all the purposes. 

(c) 
the phrase "validity" would mean that an exemption order would 

be construed to be valid in regard to all the rights and liability attached to such 

an exemption order. These rights and liabilities may be either of the beneficiary 

of the exemption order or the Government. 

(d) 
As Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act does not expressly bar or take 

away the rights and liabilities under an exemption order, Section 6 of the General 

Clauses Act becomes applicable with all its force, and hence, the repeal of the 

Principal Act, would not affect the rights, privileges, obligation or liability, 

acquired, accrued, or incurred under the Principal Act qua a Section 20(1) 

exemption order. 

(e) 
Any other interpretation would render Section 3(1)(b) of the 

Repeal Act to the extent it saves the validity of a Section 20(1) exemption order 

meaningless, as Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act not only saves the validity of 

Section 20(1) exemption order but also any action taken thereunder 

notwithstanding any judgment of any Court to the contrary. 

(f) 
If the Legislature in so many words has saved the validity of a 

section 20 (I) exemption order then it would be absurdity to say that on one hand 

the legislature has saved its validity and on the other hand such a validity would 

be required to be read as meaningless in view of repeal of the Principal Act. 

(g) 
The arguments of the petitioners that what is saved under Section 

3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act are only actions which stand completed and closed, is 

per se not acceptable for the reason that such interpretation would only be

possible when there is no saving clause in the repealing statute. More 

particularly it is also unacceptable in view of a saving clause of the nature 

section 3 (1) (b) of the Repeal Act provides. A plain reading of Section 3(1)(b) 

definitely cannot be construed to attribute such a meaning to Section 3(1)(b). 

(h) 
The Repeal Act, if construed in its entirety, manifest a clear 

intention of the Legislature to save the validity of a Section 20 (1) exemption 

order in totality including its enforceability as observed by my learned brother
