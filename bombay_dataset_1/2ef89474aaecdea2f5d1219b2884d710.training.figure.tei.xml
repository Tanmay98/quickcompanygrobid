            <figDesc>W.28 Dr. Shivanand Biradar supports the version of<lb/> this witness. The version of this witness corresponds with<lb/> the injuries stated in the injury certificate of Gyandeo and<lb/> also other six injured persons. Therefore, the evidence of<lb/> P.W.25 corresponds with the medical evidence.<lb/> His<lb/> evidence is fully trustworthy, reliable, truthful and not<lb/> shaken in any manner in his crossexamination and the<lb/> same can safely be accepted on all the points including<lb/> forming an unlawful assembly by the accused persons, who<lb/> are named in his evidence, in furtherance of their common<lb/> object to assault / cause grievous hurt to the family<lb/> members of the complainant in order to finish every member<lb/> of family of P.W.16 Baburao. The evidence of this witness<lb/> corroborates with the evidence of the complainant in all<lb/> material particulars. The evidence of the complainant and<lb/> also P.W.25 Vijaykumar corroborates each other and also<lb/> gets corroboration from medical evidence led by P.W.27<lb/> Dr.Pralhad Solanke and P.W.28 Dr. Shivanand Biradar.<lb/> 56]<lb/> The learned Counsel for the accused Shivaji<lb/> Kadaji Pawar, Namdeo Shivaji Pawar and Vilas Kadaji Pawar<lb/> was at pains to argue that, in view of the judgment of the<lb/> 414.11crapl<lb/> 100<lb/> Supreme Court in the case of Masalti (supra), where<lb/> factions prevail in villagers and murders are committed as a<lb/> result of enmity between such factions, criminal Courts<lb/> have to deal with evidence of a partisan type. The learned<lb/> Counsel for the accused relied on the observations of the<lb/> Supreme Court in paragraph 16 of the judgment in case of<lb/> Masalti (supra) and argued that where the criminal Court<lb/> has to deal with the evidence pertaining to commission of an<lb/> offence involving a large number of offenders and a large<lb/> number of victims, it is usual to adopt the test that the<lb/> conviction could be sustained only if it is supported by two<lb/> or three or more witnesses who give a consistent account of<lb/> the incident. In a sense, the test may be described as<lb/> mechanical; but it cannot be treated as irrational or<lb/> unreasonable. Therefore, in his submission, in the present<lb/> case, though evidence of P.W.25 Vijaykumar does not suffer<lb/> from omissions, contradictions and improvements, the<lb/> evidence of other prosecution witnesses, including the<lb/> complainant, suffers from contradictions, omissions and<lb/> improvements and, therefore, the evidence of P.W.25<lb/> Vijaykumar alone is not sufficient so as to sustain the<lb/> conviction of the accused.<lb/> </figDesc>

Since then there<lb/> are strained relations between complainant&apos;s group and<lb/> group of Shivaji Pawar. Persons from the side of Shivaji<lb/> Pawar used to threat to kill the complainant&apos;s persons and<lb/> they will not allow to conduct the work. He further stated<lb/> that, deceased Gyandeo was his real brother. Incident<lb/> occurred on 09.01.2008. It was next day of Vel Amawasya.<lb/> Dinner of Chicken Mutton was arranged at his house.

About 30 to 40 persons in the<lb/> 414.11crapl<lb/> 103<lb/> mob came at their house. Persons in the mob were holding<lb/> swords, sticks and iron rods.

From these portion<lb/> marks `A&apos; and `B&apos;, in our opinion, nothing useful to the<lb/> defence has been brought on record. On the contrary<lb/> this witness has reiterated his version in his<lb/> examinationinchief even in cross examination. It<lb/> appears that, the Investigating Officer stated in his<lb/> crossexamination that, this witness has not stated<lb/> before him the facts read over to him from para 3 of his<lb/> chiefexamination, lines no. 1 to 14. In fact there are no<lb/> third paragraph in his examinationinchief. In our<lb/> opinion, trial Court was not correct in allowing such<lb/> crossexamination.<lb/> 76]<lb/> At this juncture, it would be relevant to<lb/> observe that, the trial Court while marking portions<lb/> from the statements of the witnesses before Police<lb/> under section 161 of Code of Criminal Procedure, has<lb/> 414.11crapl<lb/> 139<lb/> not adhered to the procedure. The trial Court has not<lb/> properly appreciated, keeping in view the judgment of<lb/> the Supreme Court in the case of Tahsildar Singh<lb/> and another V/s State of U.P. 2 , what amounts to<lb/> omissions, contradictions and improvements. The<lb/> Supreme Court in the case of Tahsildar Singh and<lb/> another (supra) held that, the contradiction, under the<lb/> section, should be between what a witness asserted in<lb/> the witnessbox and what he stated before the police<lb/> officer, and not between what he said he had stated<lb/> before the policeofficer and what he actually made<lb/> before him. In such a case the question could not be<lb/> put at all: only questions to contradict can be put and<lb/> the question here posed does not contradict; it leads to<lb/> an answer which is contradicted by the police<lb/> statement. Section 145 of the Evidence Act indicates<lb/> the manner in which contradiction is brought out. The<lb/> crossexamining Counsel shall put the part or parts of<lb/> the statement which affirms the contrary to what is<lb/> 2 AIR 1959 SC 1012<lb/> </figDesc>

            <figDesc>prosecution has not placed on record satisfactory<lb/> evidence to prove that the accused persons did form an<lb/> unlawful assembly either prior to commission of offence or<lb/> at the time of commission of offence.<lb/> It is common<lb/> contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the accused<lb/> that the ingredients of sections 141, 142 and 149 of the IPC<lb/> are not attracted in the light of evidence brought on record<lb/> and, therefore, it cannot be held that the accused persons<lb/> formed an unlawful assembly in furtherance of their<lb/> common object to assault / cause grievous hurt in order to<lb/> kill every member of the family of the complainant as alleged<lb/> by the prosecution. In this respect, at this juncture it would<lb/> be apt once again to make reference to the exposition of the<lb/> Supreme Court in case of Masalti (supra) wherein the<lb/> Supreme Court while explaining scope of sections 141 to<lb/> 149 of IPC and also section 302 r/w 149 of IPC, in<lb/> paragraphs 16, 17 and 20 held, thus:</figDesc>

        </figure>


        <figure>

            <figDesc>evidence of the eye witnesses in detail. It is true that the<lb/> trial Court has convicted the accused Shivaji Kadaji Pawar<lb/> and Namdeo Shivaji Pawar for the offence punishable under<lb/> Section 302 of IPC and the accused Shivaji Kadaji Pawar,<lb/> Vilas s/o Kadaji Pawar and Namdeo Shivaji Pawar<lb/> have<lb/> been convicted for the offence punishable under Section 452<lb/> and 324 of IPC and sentenced them as stated herein above.<lb/> In all 35 accused faced the trial; out of which, accused<lb/> Dayanand Maruti Bhingole and Mahadeo Shivaji Pawar<lb/> absconded and their trial is separated by the trial Court.<lb/> The State and also the original complainant have filed two<lb/> separate appeals against acquittal of other accused and also<lb/> for enhancement of sentence of three accused who are<lb/> convicted by the trial Court. Since we are exercising our<lb/> appellate jurisdiction under Section 386 of Cr.P.C., it was<lb/> incumbent upon us to reappreciate the entire evidence in<lb/> minute details, since there are three appeals, one against<lb/> conviction and two against acquittal of the remaining<lb/> accused. The common argument advanced on behalf of the<lb/> acquitted accused is that in view of their acquittal by the<lb/> trial Court, their innocence is reinforced and therefore, this<lb/> 414.11crapl<lb/> 172<lb/> Court may not interfere in their acquittal order. In that<lb/> respect, it would be worthwhile to refer the observations of<lb/> the Supreme Court in case of State of U.P. vs. Babu &amp;<lb/> Ors. 4 , in paragraph 10 of the judgment which reads, thus:<lb/> &quot;10. Recently in State of Punjab v. Karnail Singh<lb/> (2003 AIR SCW 4065) it was observed that there is no<lb/> embargo on the Appellate Court reviewing the<lb/> evidence upon which an order of acquittal is based.</figDesc>
        </figure>


        <figure>

            <figDesc>These aspects were highlighted by this<lb/> Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade and another v.<lb/> State of Maharashtra (1973 (2) SCC 793), Ramesh<lb/> Babulal Doshi v. State of Gujarat (1996 (9) SCC 225)<lb/> 414.11crapl<lb/> 173<lb/> and Jaswant Singh v. State of Haryana (2000 (4) JT<lb/> (SC) 114).&quot;<lb/> Therefore, the paramount consideration of this<lb/> Court while exercising the jurisdiction under Section 386<lb/> Cr.P.C. is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is prevented.<lb/> As observed by the Supreme Court, miscarriage of justice<lb/> which may arise from acquittal of the guilty is no less than<lb/> from the conviction of an innocent.<lb/> In a case where<lb/> admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is cast upon the<lb/> Appellate Court to reappreciate the evidence even where<lb/> the accused has been acquitted, for the purpose of<lb/> ascertaining as to whether any of the accused committed<lb/> any offence or not.<lb/> Therefore, in the light of these<lb/> observations of the Supreme Court, as already observed, we<lb/> have reappreciated the entire evidence brought on record<lb/> by the prosecution.<lb/> (Underline supplied).<lb/> 97]<lb/> After discussing the evidence of the eye<lb/> witnesses, medical evidence, spot panchanama, inquest<lb/> panchanama and other evidence placed on record by the<lb/> prosecution, we are of the opinion that, the prosecution did<lb/> firmly establish that the incident had taken place in the<lb/> </figDesc>

Therefore, it is not<lb/> necessary to repeat the same once again. In order to hold<lb/> that the assembly was unlawful, it is necessary to meet the<lb/> ingredients of sections 141 and 142 of IPC. In the present<lb/> case, the prosecution has established beyond doubt that<lb/> there was assembly of more than five persons and the case<lb/> in hand would be covered by the provisions of section 141 of<lb/> IPC. Section 141 of IPC reads, thus:<lb/> &quot; 141. Unlawful assembly.An assembly of five or<lb/> more persons is designated an &quot;unlawful assembly&quot;, if<lb/> the common object of the persons composing that<lb/> assembly is<lb/> First.To overawe by criminal force, or show of<lb/> criminal force, or the Central or any State<lb/> Government or Parliament or the Legislature of any<lb/> State, or any public servant in the exercise of the<lb/> lawful power of such public servant; or<lb/> Second.To resist the execution of any law, or of any<lb/> legal process; or<lb/> Third.To commit any mischief or criminal trespass,<lb/> or other offence; or<lb/> Fourth.By means of criminal force, or show of<lb/> criminal force, to any person to take or obtain<lb/> possession of any property, or to deprive any person<lb/> </figDesc>

            <figDesc>that Namdeo assaulted with a<lb/> sword not only to the deceased Gyandeo but, even to other<lb/> witnesses. Since the evidence of all the witnesses have been<lb/> already discussed in detail, it is not necessary to repeat the<lb/> same. Suffice it to say that, as regards accused Namdeo<lb/> Shivaji Pawar is concerned, eye witnesses namely, P.W.16,<lb/> P.W.17, P.W.18, attributed overtacts to accused Namdeo<lb/> that he inflicted Jambiya blows to Gyandeo deceased and<lb/> Vijaykumar -injured, P.W.20 attributed that he inflicted<lb/> Jambiya blow to Gyandeo P.W.21 stated that he gave<lb/> Jambiya blow to<lb/> Shahuraj, P.W.22, P.W.23, P.W.24,<lb/> P.W.25, P.W.26 attributed overtacts to accused Namdeo<lb/> that he gave Jambiya blow to deceased Gyandeo. P.W.25<lb/> also attributed overtacts to Namdeo that he gave Jambiya<lb/> blow him i.e. P.W.25 Vijaykumar.<lb/> Suffice it to say that by applying the test in the<lb/> case of Masalti (supra), there is overwhelming evidence<lb/> regarding involvement of Namdeo Shivaji Pawar in the<lb/> commission of offence.<lb/> The eye witness account gets<lb/> corroboration from the medical evidence. The other eye<lb/> 414.11crapl<lb/> 183<lb/> witnesses have also stated about his involvement. Though<lb/> it was argued by the learned Counsel for the accused that<lb/> Namdeo is not named in the FIR or complaint, FIR is not an<lb/> encyclopedia and evidence of eleven eye witnesses is before<lb/> us and involvement of Namdeo is proved by the prosecution<lb/> beyond reasonable doubt. The eye witness account gets<lb/> corroboration from medical evidence and other evidence on<lb/> record.<lb/> 103]<lb/> P.W.25 Vijaykumar, P.W.21 Mahadev, P.W.22<lb/> Shahuraj and P.W.16 Baburao i.e. complainant and almost<lb/> all eye witnesses have stated about presence of Vimalbai<lb/> Pawar in the unlawful assembly. Not only that, a specific<lb/> overtact has been attributed to her that she assaulted on<lb/> the ribs of Gyandeo with a knife. If medical evidence is<lb/> perused carefully and in particular, Injury No.5 sustained<lb/> by deceased Gyandeo, the evidence of prosecution witnesses<lb/> about the overtact played by Vimalbai Pawar gets<lb/> corroboration from medical evidence.<lb/> As far as accused Vimalbai Pawar is concerned,<lb/> P.W.16, P.W.18, P.W.20, P.W.21, P.W.22, P.W.23, P.W.24,<lb/> </figDesc>

            <figDesc>e. complainant are consistent in their deposition<lb/> that the above mentioned three accused caught hold<lb/> Gyandeo and then Shivaji Pawar inflicted sword blow on left<lb/> chest of Gyandeo.

The other witnesses have<lb/> also stated that after Gyandeo fell down, Satish Baburao<lb/> Pawar, Vaijinath Pawar, Venkat Vaijinath Pawar caught<lb/> hold P.W.25 Vijaykumar.

Therefore,<lb/> Chhattisgarh High Court maintained order of conviction of<lb/> the accused therein.<lb/> In case of Manilal vs. State of Kerala, 12 the Kerala<lb/> High Court while explaining scope of section 149 of IPC,<lb/> held that even if the identity of some of the accused forming<lb/> part of the unlawful assembly is not established or even if<lb/> 11 2014 CRI.L.J.4704;<lb/> 12 ILR2014(2)Kerala871; 2014(2)KLT800;<lb/> 414.11crapl<lb/> 204<lb/> one or more of the accused are acquitted granting benefit of<lb/> doubt, that does not absolve the other accused from being<lb/> proceeded against under Section 149 of the Indian Penal<lb/> Code.<lb/> The facts in the case in hand and those in case of Om<lb/> Prakash vs. State of Haryana, 13 are almost similar. In<lb/> the said case, the Supreme Court, while considering the<lb/> provisions of Section 141, 142, 148 and 149 and also<lb/> sections 302 and 319 of IPC, held that there was no delay in<lb/> lodging FIR.<lb/> Ocular testimony gets corroborated from<lb/> medical evidence. All accused persons came together armed<lb/> with lathis and gun.<lb/> Eye witnesses who are natural<lb/> witnesses, being brothers, have deposed in unequivocal<lb/> manner about assault by all accused persons. Common<lb/> object is clearly evident. In such situation, attribution of<lb/> specific individual overt act has no role to play. All requisite<lb/> tests to attract section 149 established by prosecution and<lb/> the contentions raised by appellants therein were rejected<lb/> and the Supreme Court upheld the order of conviction<lb/> passed by the High Court.
