			<figure>conditions may be instituted, continued and<lb/> enforced?<lb/> (4)<lb/> Whether in view of the repeal of the Principal Act by<lb/> the Repeal Act, the Government of Maharashtra can:<lb/> (a) recall/ cancel/ modify the exemption order<lb/> granted either under Section 20 of the Principal Act;<lb/> (b) enforce circulars for implementation of<lb/> exemption orders issued under Section 20 of the<lb/> Principal Act prior to the repeal of the Principal Act;<lb/> (c) acquire the land by issuing notification under<lb/> Section 10(3) of the Principal Act; and<lb/> (d) take any action of whatsoever nature on<lb/> account of noncompliance/ breach of exemption<lb/> order issued under Section 20(1) of the Principal<lb/> taken in Mira Bhayandar Builders and Developers<lb/> Welfare Association v/s the Deputy Collector and<lb/> Competent Authority, Thane Urban Agglomeration and<lb/> others in Writ Petition No.5745/2009 dated 27 th<lb/> August, 2009 to the contrary should be held to be<lb/> laying down the correct principle of law?<lb/> 2<lb/> Since both sides have canvassed arguments on legal issues, in<lb/> order to appreciate them a few facts are required to be noted. We take the<lb/> facts from a lead case, namely, Writ Petition No.9872/2010. That is a Writ<lb/> Petition which has been filed by the Maharashtra Chamber of Housing<lb/> Industry and its various Units. These are associations established to<lb/> promote the housing and real estate industry. The Writ Petition is filed in<lb/> the interest of members of these Associations and real estate industry and<lb/> in the circumstances which are set out in paragraph 4 of the memo of<lb/> Writ Petition.<lb/> 3<lb/> It is the case of the Petitioners that the State of Maharashtra<lb/> and Competent Authorities under the Urban Land (Ceiling and<lb/> Regulation) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;THE PRINCIPAL ACT&quot;)<lb/> continue to enforce and apply the provisions thereof despite enactment of<lb/> the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 (hereinafter<lb/> referred to as &quot;THE REPEAL ACT&quot;). The Repeal Act has been brought into<lb/> effect and is in force in the State of Maharashtra from 29.11.2007.<lb/> 4<lb/> The grievance of the Petitioners is that there is a circular<lb/> dated 18.03.2009 issued by the State Government, copy of which is at<lb/> AnnexureA. That circular states that the Repeal Act has been brought into<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> force in the State of Maharashtra w.e.f. 29.11.2007. The same expressly<lb/> saves the vesting of excess vacant land in the State as also validity of an<lb/> exemption order passed under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Meaning thereby, the repeal of the Principal Act does not affect the<lb/> vesting of excess vacant land in the State provided its possession has been<lb/> taken, so also, validity of an exemption order passed under Section 20(1)<lb/></p>

			<p>of the Principal Act. Therefore, such excess vacant lands of which<lb/> possession has not been taken, but which are subjected to certain<lb/> concessions under the order of exemption passed in terms of Section<lb/> 20(1) of the Principal Act and which are particularly to utilize the lands<lb/> for residential purpose, for implementing residential housing scheme, for<lb/> industry and it&apos;s expansion, shall not be transferred without prior<lb/> permission of the State and there are restrictions placed on change of user<lb/> thereof. The permission for change of user will not be granted unless<lb/> premium is paid to the Government.<lb/></p>

			<figure>5<lb/> A reference is made in this circular and the steps taken to<lb/> implement the Repeal Act. The steps include two communications from<lb/> the Government dated 01.03.2008 and 03.03.2008 which outline the<lb/> scheme for development of these lands or their transfer.<lb/> 6<lb/> It has been revealed that the exempted lands are being dealt<lb/> with and for the purpose of implementation of the Slum Rehabilitation<lb/> Scheme, Rental Housing Scheme, etc.. Further, the reservations in respect<lb/> of these lands have been changed or altered from industry/ agriculture<lb/> without any reference to the Government/ Competent Authority. The<lb/> permissions in that regard have been granted without any prior approval<lb/> from the competent authorities under the Principal Act. Therefore, the<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> Government has directed that the exempted lands cannot be used for any<lb/> other purpose nor their reservation can be changed unless the approvals/<lb/> remarks are called for from the competent authority under the Principal<lb/> Act. Any violation of such requirement would visit the persons concerned<lb/> with all consequences and at their costs.<lb/> 7<lb/> Prior to this circular there are certain Government<lb/> Resolutions and which enable utilization of Transferable Development<lb/> Rights (TDR) so as to use the lands for construction of houses for weaker<lb/> sections and equally to grant development permissions in relation thereto.<lb/> This is a Government Resolution dated 30.06.2007.<lb/> 8<lb/> There is also an order and which has been referred to<lb/> because it is the case of the Petitioners that their members had to obtain<lb/> several permissions from the Respondent Nos.1 and 2 for carrying out the<lb/> development. It is contended that the Government Resolutions referred by<lb/> us including dated 30.06.2007 and emphasis by the authorities on<lb/> compliance of the same continues despite the Repeal Act brought into<lb/> force with effect from 29.11.2007. There are several instances which have<lb/> been given and copies of the exemption orders passed under Section<lb/> 20(1) of the Principal Act are referred to in paragraph 7 of the memo of<lb/> Writ Petition No.9872/2010.<lb/> 9<lb/></figure>

			<p>The grievance is that though the order of exemption was<lb/> passed exempting the excess vacant land from the purview of ChapterIII<lb/> of the Principal Act, when that Act was in force, but now after it&apos;s repeal<lb/> the exemption order would not survive. In other words, the steps taken by<lb/> the Authorities to give effect to the order of exemption even after repeal<lb/></p>

			<figure>::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> of the Principal Act in the State of Maharashtra are wholly illegal. The<lb/> Authorities cannot compel parties like the Petitioners to seek any<lb/> extension of time to complete the scheme or to comply with the<lb/> conditions on which the order of exemption under Section 20(1) of the<lb/> Principal Act has been passed. The stand taken is that the Respondents<lb/> have no powers to enforce the Principal Act directly or indirectly. Several<lb/> instances of such alleged attempts are set out. There is reference made to<lb/> the legal provisions and finally what is prayed is that this Court must<lb/> restrain by an appropriate writ, order or direction under Article 226 of the<lb/> Constitution of India, the Respondents from enforcing the provisions of<lb/> the Principal Act insofar as such exemption orders and their terms and<lb/> conditions.<lb/> The attention of the Division Bench in Writ Petition<lb/> No.3815/2010 (Jayesh Tokarshi Shah v/s Deputy Collector and Competent<lb/> Authority, Thane Urban Agglomeration) was invited to all these judgments<lb/> and orders and stated to be conflicting. The Division Bench, therefore, in<lb/> its judgment dated 22 nd December, 2010 in the aforesaid matter observed<lb/> as under:<lb/></figure>

			<p>15.<lb/></p>

			<p>This prompts an answer in favour of a premise that the<lb/> Additional District Collector, Thane and Competent<lb/> Authority was not competent to issue the said Circular,<lb/> and as such the efficacy of the said Circular<lb/> commanding the Registering Officer to refuse the<lb/> registration of the documents referred to therein remains<lb/> questionable. A view congenial to the said premise is<lb/> found expressed in some of the judgments Sunderson &amp;<lb/> Ors Vs. State of <ref type="biblio">Maharashtra &amp; Ors. 2008(5)</ref></p>

 Bombay<lb/> Cases Reporter 85, Damodar Laxman Navre &amp; 4 others<lb/> Vs. State of Maharashtra &amp; 4 others Writ Petition No.<lb/> 6300 of 2009, delivered previously by the Division<lb/> Bench of this Court. However, there is a conflicting view<lb/> expressed in the judgments delivered by the Division<lb/> Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No.5745 of 2009<lb/> Mira Bhayander Builders &amp; Developers Welfare<lb/> Association Vs. Dy. Collector &amp; Competent Authority,<lb/> Thane and 3 others. The Circular dated 23.6.2008 was<lb/> the epicentre of controversy in Mira Bhayander Builders<lb/> &amp; Developers Welfare Association <ref type="biblio">(Supra)</ref>. The State<lb/> contended as in the present case that the scheme holders<lb/> were trying to wriggle out of their obligations under the<lb/> scheme sanctioned under Section 20 of U.L.C. Act, and<lb/> therefore, the said Circular came to be issued to protect<lb/> the schemes meant for economically weaker sections,<lb/> and also the government . The Division Bench after<lb/> considering the rival contentions observed thus:<lb/> &quot;In our view, if the members of the petitioners&apos;<lb/> association have taken benefit of the schemes under<lb/> Section 20 of the said Act by constructing buildings, they<lb/> now cannot wiggle out of their obligations to surrender<lb/> flats to the government which the government could sell<lb/> at fixed rate. The entire tenor of the above petitioners<lb/> *12*<lb/> appears to be that the petitioners do not want to fulfil<lb/> their obligations under the said Schemes viz.<lb/> surrendering the flats to the State Government and<lb/> taking advantage of the repeal of the said Act want to<lb/> contend that their obligations under the said schemes do<lb/> not survive. In our view the impugned letter as rightly<lb/> contended by the learned AGP has been issued to protect<lb/> the public interest and government revenue. It does not<lb/> befit the Petitioners who have taken advantage of the<lb/> said scheme now contend that their obligations do not<lb/> survive, and therefore, there is no need for them to<lb/> surrender flats to the government. We, therefore, do not<lb/> find any merit in the challenge raised in the above<lb/> petition which is accordingly dismissed.&quot;<lb/> 16.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the instant case similar situation is portrayed in the<lb/> affidavit in reply filed by the State. Referring to the<lb/> Mohan Gopal Mate case (Supra) reported in 2008(<ref type="formula">6</ref>)<lb/> ALL MR 41, the learned Advocate for the Petitioner<lb/> submitted that a pertinent question regarding the extent<lb/> of power of the State under Sections 20 and 21 of U.L.C.<lb/> Act in the case of breach of conditions of the scheme by<lb/> the scheme holder has been clearly answered as follows:<lb/> &quot;Powers of the State under Section 20 in case of<lb/> breach of condition of the order of exemption is limited<lb/> to withdraw exemption order only and so far as Section<lb/> 21 is concerned, declare the land which is not to be<lb/> treated as excess land in view of the SubSection (1) in<lb/> case of breach of condition State can declare such land<lb/> to be excess in view of SubSection (2) of Section 21.<lb/> Thereupon, the provisions of Chapter III will apply to<lb/> the said land.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>17.<lb/></head>

			<p>Going by strict interpretation of the Sections 20 and 21<lb/> of the ULC Act, the power of the State in case of<lb/> contravention of any of the conditions of the scheme by<lb/> scheme holder remains limited to withdrawal of the<lb/> exemption and declaring the exempted land as excess<lb/> land and to application of the provisions of the Chapter<lb/> III of the said Act for acquisition of the said land as<lb/> contemplated under SubSection (2) of Section 21<lb/> therein.<lb/></p>

			<p>18.<lb/> This view is in conflict with the view expressed by the<lb/> Division Bench in Mira Bhayander Builders &amp;<lb/> Developers Welfare Association (Supra), and as such the<lb/> controversy raised by such conflict deserves to be<lb/> resolved by the Full Bench of this Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>19.<lb/> This Petition is, therefore, referred to the Hon&apos;ble the<lb/> Chief Justice for passing appropriate directions in the<lb/> matter.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>12<lb/> It is in view of these events that a Full Bench was constituted<lb/> and the above formulated questions await an answer from us.<lb/></p>

			<p>13<lb/> At the outset we must clarify that we would be only<lb/> answering the question/s formulated and reproduced hereinabove. We<lb/> would not be expressing any opinion on the rival contentions insofar as<lb/> merits of individual petitions. Each of these petitions thereafter would be<lb/> placed before the appropriate Division Benches and for a decision on<lb/> merits and in accordance with law. Our observations and findings,<lb/> therefore, shall not be construed as expression of any opinion on the<lb/> merits of the Writ Petitions referred above or pending in this Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>of exemption or any action taken thereunder is valid notwithstanding<lb/> anything contrary held in any judgment or order of the competent court,<lb/> yet the Repeal Act saves only validity of the order of exemption and<lb/> nothing more. Such saving would not permit the State Government or<lb/> competent authority to withdraw the order of exemption or enforce the<lb/> terms and conditions thereof or to subject the excess vacant land to the<lb/> consequences under the Principal Act. The saving is thus not absolute, but<lb/> restricted in nature. Thirdly, it is urged that there being a Repealing Act<lb/> containing such restricted saving clause, the same rules out applicability<lb/> of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 or its parimateria provision<lb/> in the Bombay General Clauses <ref type="biblio">Act, 1904.<lb/> 15<lb/></ref> We shall now elaborate these contentions as articulated by<lb/> Mr.Naphade, learned Senior Counsel and adopted with some additions by<lb/> Mr.Sathe, Mr.Sridharan, Mr.Devitre, Mr.Samdani, learned Senior Counsel<lb/> and Mr.Gangal, Mr.Joshi and Ms.GadreRajyadhyaksha, learned counsel<lb/> appearing for the Petitioners.<lb/></p>

			<head>16<lb/></head>

			<p>Mr.Naphade firstly submitted that for understanding the<lb/> Repeal Act we must have a look at the Principal Act. The Principal Act,<lb/> according to Mr.Naphade, contains several provisions, but material<lb/> therefrom are Sections 3, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 38. Mr.Naphade also took us<lb/> through Section 11 of the Principal Act before coming to Section 20. In<lb/> his submission the scheme of the Principal Act is that no one shall hold<lb/> the vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit. The return or statement has<lb/> to be filed so as to determine the extent of excess vacant land. In other<lb/> words, Mr.Naphade submits that except as otherwise provided in the<lb/> Principal Act, on and from the commencement of the Act, no person shall<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/></figure>

			<p>be entitled to hold any vacant land in excess of ceiling limit in the<lb/> territories to which the Principal Act applies. Mr.Naphade submits that<lb/> Section 4 sets out the ceiling limit. He submits that the transfer of vacant<lb/> land is also an aspect which is taken care of by Section 5. The persons<lb/> holding the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit have to file the<lb/> statement. He submits that further provisions enable scrutiny of<lb/> particulars, preparing a draft statement as regards the vacant land in<lb/> excess of ceiling limit and the final statement. Mr.Naphade submits that<lb/> Section 10 is entitled &quot;Acquisition of vacant land in excess of ceiling<lb/> limit&quot;. The extent of the vacant land held by a person in excess of ceiling<lb/> limit has to be specified by subsection (1) of Section 10 and the purpose<lb/> of same is to enable acquisition of the same eventually. That is an aspect<lb/> dealt with by subsections (2) and (<ref type="formula">3</ref>) of Section 10. The vesting of such<lb/> excess vacant land free from all encumbrances and with effect from the<lb/> date of publication of a notification under subsection (3) results in<lb/> enabling the Government to take possession of the land. In these<lb/> circumstances, according to Mr.Naphade, only consequence of not filing a<lb/> return or statement, but which is not accepted in totality is provided by<lb/> Section 10. There is also a provision, namely, Section 38 which makes<lb/> such act a punishable offence and Mr.Naphade invites our attention to<lb/> subsections (1) to (4) of Section 38 in that regard. Mr.Naphade&apos;s attempt<lb/> was to show that even if the vacant land is in excess of ceiling limit and<lb/> there is no compliance with the provisions requiring filing a statement of<lb/> such vacant land, still the owner is not deprived of his rights in the same.<lb/></p>

			<p>Mr.Naphade in that regard invites our attention to Section 15 of the<lb/> Principal Act and submits that it reflects the legislative intent. There is no<lb/> loss of ownership on promulgation of the Principal Act. In these<lb/> circumstances all that the Principal Act does is to create some sort of clog<lb/> or cloud on the rights of a person to hold the land. His ownership rights<lb/> therein are not affected.<lb/> 17<lb/> Mr.Naphade, therefore, submits that the power to exempt the<lb/> excess vacant land from applicability of ChapterIII of the Principal Act is<lb/> exercised by the Government either on its own motion or otherwise and<lb/> that is also clear by Sections 21 and 22 which permits the excess vacant<lb/> land not to be treated as such in certain cases and it&apos;s retention under<lb/> certain circumstances. Therefore, merely because a holder of the excess<lb/> vacant land seeks exemption from applicability of ChapterIII or the State<lb/> exempts such vacant land from applicability thereof will not mean that<lb/> the right and particularly ownership therein is surrendered much less<lb/> waived. Mr.Naphade&apos;s attempt was to show that the State seeks to put the<lb/> excess vacant land beyond application of ChapterIII, but keeping all his<lb/> rights and options intact. The reference, therefore, will have to be<lb/> answered by us bearing in mind this vital aspect, is the submission of<lb/> Mr.Naphade.<lb/></p>

			<head>18<lb/></head>

			<p>Mr.Naphade elaborated this aspect by submitting that once<lb/> the land is exempted, it is out of the purview of the Principal Act. The<lb/> right to hold it conditionally remains unaffected. The power to exempt is<lb/> limited in nature. It is legislative in character. By no stretch of imagination<lb/> it is a right conferred in the Government nor exercise of powers to exempt<lb/> creates any right in the Government in respect of such excess vacant land.<lb/></p>

			<p>In these circumstances and if Sections 20(2) and 21(2) are read together<lb/> it would be apparent that neither any action under subsection (1) of<lb/> Section 21 or the power under subsection (2) is saved by repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act. In fact the Repeal Act does not save Section 21 at all.<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/></figure>

			<p>Hence, when the Repeal Act in Section 3(1)(b) refers to the validity of<lb/> exemption order, it deliberately omits to include or refer subsection (2)<lb/> of Section 20. Hence, there is no power to withdraw the exemption order<lb/> under Section 20(1) after repeal of the Principal Act. Hence, even breach<lb/> or violation of the condition in the exemption order will not result in its<lb/> cancellation or withdrawal. Apart therefrom any breach or violation of<lb/> the condition on which the exemption order was granted does not result<lb/> in automatic withdrawal or cancellation thereof. That is apparent from<lb/> Section 20(2). It is, therefore, clear that the Repeal Act does not save this<lb/> power and by omitting subsection (2) of Section 20 from clause (b) of<lb/> subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. The legislature was aware<lb/> that the power to withdraw the exemption order will have to be exercised<lb/> only after giving a reasonable opportunity to such person who has<lb/> violated the conditions subject to which the exemption under clause (a)<lb/></p>

			<p>and (b) of subsection (1) of Section 20 is granted. That reasonable<lb/> opportunity is to make representation against the proposed withdrawal. It<lb/> is the only consequence of either not complying with the conditions<lb/> subject to which the exemption is granted or not being able to satisfy the<lb/> Government that such exemption should not be withdrawn or from<lb/> applicability of ChapterIII to the excess vacant land. Meaning thereby<lb/> same is capable of being acquired and thereafter, vested in the<lb/> Government. Once that power cannot be exercised post repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act, then, we would be in complete error if we hold that the<lb/> repeal of the Principal Act does not affect the power to withdraw the<lb/> exemption or to enforce the terms and conditions thereof.<lb/></p>

			<figure>19<lb/> In that regard, Mr.Naphade has taken us through Sections<lb/> 20(2), 21(2) and 22(2) of the Principal Act. He submits that subsection<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/></figure>

			<p>(2) of Section 20 confers discretion in the Government and it may not<lb/> withdraw the exemption order despite the conditions subject to which the<lb/> same is granted are not complied with by any person. Whereas, sub<lb/> section (2) of Section 21 mandates declaring the vacant land to be excess.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is submitted that there are distinct consequences and which are taken<lb/></p>

			<figure>care of by subsection (2) of Section 22. Thus, the power of exemption<lb/> has different parameters and the legislature was aware that such power<lb/> cannot survive the repeal of the Principal Act. Hence, in the teeth of this<lb/> clear language of the Repeal Act recourse to Section 6 of the General<lb/> Clauses Act, 1897 is impermissible. Once a different intention appears<lb/> from the provisions contained in the Repeal Act, then, Section 6 of the<lb/> General Clauses Act, 1897 would not apply. The question of liberal<lb/> construction of Section 3 of the Repeal Act, therefore, does not arise at<lb/> all.<lb/> 20<lb/> Mr.Naphade thereafter took us extensively through the<lb/> Repeal Act to submit that what is saved is specific. By clause (a) of sub<lb/> section (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act the vesting of land of which<lb/> possession has been taken by the State is saved. Meaning thereby, any<lb/> vacant land which is subject matter of declaration under Section 10(3) of<lb/> which possession has not been taken by the State Government, then its<lb/> vesting is not saved by the Repeal Act. Such land of which possession has<lb/> not been taken will have to be restored post repeal after the requirement<lb/> stipulated in subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act is complied<lb/> with. Therefore, there is no collision between clause (a) and clause (b).<lb/> What clause (b) saves is only validity of the order granting exemption<lb/> under Section 20(1) or any action taken thereunder. The power to<lb/> withdraw the exemption is not saved. If it is held to be saved, then, clause<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> (a) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act would be rendered<lb/> redundant. Only consequence of exemption being withdrawn is to subject<lb/> the land to applicability of ChapterIII of the Principal Act and particularly<lb/> Section 10(3) thereof. If possession of such excess vacant land cannot be<lb/> taken even after withdrawal of exemption in terms of subsection (2) of<lb/></figure>

			<p>Section 20 of the Principal Act, then, there was no point in saving its<lb/> validity. Therefore, the validity of the order of exemption is saved, but<lb/> neither that saving will enable the State to withdraw the exemption post<lb/> repeal nor will the State be in a position to give effect to the order of<lb/> withdrawal of the exemption if cannot take possession of the excess<lb/> vacant land. That is the reason why the power to withdraw the exemption<lb/> has not been saved. Section 4 of the Repeal Act, therefore, would throw<lb/> light on the interpretation of clauses (b) and (c) of subsection (1) of<lb/> Section 3 of the Repeal Act. That Section 4 provides for abatement of<lb/> legal proceedings. If the legal proceedings abate on the date on which the<lb/> Repeal Act came into force, then, the intent could never be to save the<lb/> power to withdraw the exemption. Therefore, the words, appearing in<lb/> clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3, after Section 20 should be read<lb/> accordingly and that would be consistent with the object and purpose<lb/> sought to be achieved in enacting the Repeal Act. None of the proceedings<lb/> relating to any order made or purported to be made under the Principal<lb/> Act pending immediately before commencement of the Repeal Act are<lb/> saved. Even if they are pending before any court or tribunal or any other<lb/> authority they shall abate. In these circumstances the Legislature clearly<lb/> intended that any past or closed or conclusive action alone is saved.<lb/></p>

			<p>Anything in the pipeline or inchoate is affected and not saved. This is<lb/> because the Principal Act is a self contained code. It contains substantive<lb/> and procedural provisions and even creates a forum for the purpose of<lb/></p>

			<figure>::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> enforcing and exercising substantive rights and powers and equally<lb/> procedural one. A forum is created so as to make and enact a complete<lb/> code. Nothing beyond the Principal Act can be seen. If the Repeal Act is<lb/> construed in this manner, then, it envisages complete destruction of the<lb/> rights under the Principal Act. Any right which is crystallized and which is<lb/> not a mere hope or chance is alone saved.<lb/> 21<lb/> Mr.Naphade also submits that Section 6 of the General<lb/> Clauses Act cannot be imported into and read when the Repeal Act is so<lb/> specific and clear. Alternatively and without prejudice to this submission<lb/> Mr.Naphade submits that if Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is<lb/> analyzed, it by clauses (a) to (e) saves something which is in force or<lb/> existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect. It does not affect<lb/> previous operation of the Act so repealed or anything duly done or<lb/> suffered thereunder. The repeal does not affect any right, privilege,<lb/> obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the repealed<lb/> enactment. Mr.Naphade submits that clause (b) would, therefore, refer to<lb/> past or complete act and not something which is intended and<lb/> incomplete. The liabilities that are crystallized under the enactment which<lb/> is repealed alone are unaffected by repeal of the original or Principal Act<lb/> and that is clarified by clause (c). This clause cannot be imported in the<lb/> present Repealing Act for the simple reason that it would create<lb/> inconsistency. Mr.Naphade submits that clause (e) of Section 6 of the<lb/> General Clauses Act would have saved Section 20(2) of the Principal Act<lb/> had Sections 3 and 4 been not enacted in the Repeal Act. That being<lb/> clearly enacted there will be inconsistency if one imports clause (e) of<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act in Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act.<lb/> For all these reasons Mr.Naphade would submit that the view taken by the<lb/> Andhra Pradesh High Court, Delhi High Court and Madras High Court<lb/> follows the Division Bench judgments of this Court from which Mira<lb/> Bhayander (supra) differs. That is the only view possible in the present<lb/> legal backdrop and we must, therefore, hold that Mira Bhayander (supra)<lb/></figure>

			<p>does not lay down the correct law and should be overruled. Mr.Naphade<lb/> submits that when three or four High Courts in the country have taken a<lb/> consistent view of the provision contained in a Central Act, then, that<lb/> view ought to be followed so as to bring comity and consistency in<lb/> interpretation of a Parliamentary statute. The reference, therefore, be<lb/> answered accordingly.<lb/></p>

Section 20(2) of the Principal Act<lb/> envisages withdrawal of exemption and after such withdrawal what<lb/> follows is the vesting of the land in terms of Section 10(3) and its<lb/> possession as envisaged by Section 10(5) and (6).

			<p>contention is that what is specifically saved is the validity of the order of<lb/> exemption and the crucial words are to be found in clause (b) of sub<lb/> section (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act to this effect that the validity of<lb/> any order granting exemption under Section 20(1) or any action taken<lb/> thereunder is saved notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the<lb/> contrary. Therefore, even if the Court declares the order of exemption or<lb/> any action taken thereunder to be bad or invalid that is unaffected by<lb/> repeal of the Principal Act.

In that<lb/> regard Mr.Gangal relied upon the following judgments:<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> 1<lb/> Shanti Bhardwaj v/s State of U.P., reported in<lb/> (2004) 10 SCC 130.<lb/> 2<lb/> L.

			<figure>This is envisaged by Section 1(2) of the Repeal Act. The Repeal Act comes<lb/> into force in other States after other States adopt the Repeal Act by<lb/> resolution passed in that behalf under Article 252(2) of the Constitution<lb/> of India. Mr.Sridharan, therefore, submits that this aspect must be borne<lb/> in mind while considering the submission or stand of the State regarding<lb/> applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. Mr.Sridharan<lb/> submits that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act applies only when<lb/> either the General Clauses Act or any Central Act or Regulation made<lb/> after commencement of the General Clauses Act repeals any enactment<lb/> made prior to the General Clauses Act coming into force or thereafter. In<lb/> the present case the State Government has adopted by resolution passed<lb/> under Article 252 of the Constitution of India the Repeal Act in the State<lb/> of Maharashtra with effect from 29.11.2007. In the light of such adoption<lb/> by resolution of the State Assembly the Section 6 of the General Clauses<lb/> Act cannot be resorted to or applied. That applies only when either the<lb/> General Clauses Act or any Central Act or Regulation made after<lb/> commencement of the General Clauses Act repeals any enactment made<lb/> or to be made by the Parliament. Both are Parliamentary Statues and in<lb/> such circumstances by virtue of Article 252(2) of the Constitution of India<lb/> the applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is ruled out.<lb/> 26<lb/> Alternatively, Mr.Sridharan submits that Section 3(1)(b) of<lb/> the Repeal Act is a special saving clause demonstrating a clear different<lb/> intention. Therefore, Section 3 of the Repeal Act saves only what is<lb/> specifically mentioned therein. There is no room for applying Section 6 of<lb/> the General Clauses Act, 1897 by implication or impliedly. Mr.Sridharan<lb/> also submits that in true sense we are not construing a validating statute<lb/> or clause. What is saved by clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3 is an<lb/> order under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act and the exemptions which<lb/> are subject matter of the same. All actions under the same are saved, but<lb/></figure>

			<p>that does not mean that the power to take action under Section 20(2) is<lb/> also saved. The saving in the present case is only to protect the rights of<lb/> innocent third parties. Even the actions under the exemption are saved<lb/> with a view to ensure such protection. This is not a substantive provision<lb/> and therefore, it cannot be construed with reference to the Principal Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>By no stretch of imagination it revives the Principal Act. This is apparent<lb/> from reading of Section 4 of the Repeal Act because even the proceedings<lb/> as initiated abate on Principal Act coming into force. By clause (c) of sub<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">section (1) of Section 3 the liability incurred under the exemption order is<lb/> not saved, but only the payment made to the State Government as a<lb/> condition for granting exemption under Section 20(1) is unaffected and<lb/> thus, saved. Beyond all this we should not read anything into the Repeal<lb/> Act. Mr.Sridharan relied upon the following decisions in support of the<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> above contentions:<lb/> 1<lb/> Kolhapur Canesugar Works Limited v/s Union of<lb/> India, reported in (2000) 2 SCC 536.<lb/> 2<lb/> Air India v/s Union of India, reported in (1995) 4<lb/> SCC 734.<lb/> 3<lb/> Union of India v/s West Coast Paper Mills Limited,<lb/> reported in 2004 (164) E.L.T. 375 (SC).<lb/> 4<lb/> Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Limited v/s Broach<lb/> Borough Municipality, reported in 2000 (123) ELT 3<lb/> (SC).<lb/> 27<lb/> It is pertinent to note that Mr.Sridharan&apos;s main argument has<lb/> not been supported or adopted by any counsel. It is clear that<lb/> Mr.Naphade&apos;s contentions and submissions as adopted by Mr.Sathe are<lb/> further adopted and elaborated by Mr.Devitre, learned Senior Counsel<lb/> appearing in the Original Side Writ Petition No.37/2010 and Mr.Samdani,<lb/> learned Senior Counsel appearing in Writ Petition No.346/2011. Both of<lb/> them have urged that a different intention appears in clause (b) of sub<lb/> section (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act and therefore, Section 6 of the<lb/> General Clauses Act has no application. The specific saving is for the<lb/> benefit of the land holders and therefore, there is no scope for construing<lb/> clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act on equitable<lb/> principles. Once there is no room for equitable considerations and<lb/> particularly as Mr.Samdani urges because of the Principal Act being<lb/> expropriatory in nature and providing for compulsory acquisition, then,<lb/> all the more any liberal construction is ruled out. Mr.Samdani submits<lb/> that even the saving clause has to be strictly construed in this case and<lb/> the repeal of the Principal Act wipes out the same and obliterates it from<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> the statute book completely. For all these reasons the Reference should be<lb/> answered accordingly.<lb/> 28<lb/> Mr.Devitre and Mr.Samdani relied upon the following<lb/> decisions:<lb/> 1<lb/> Mohan Gopalrao Mate v/s Principal Secretary,<lb/> reported in 2009 (1) Bom.

By indirect<lb/> process we cannot, therefore, save what is not expressly saved by the<lb/> Repeal Act. Once the power to exempt cannot be exercised and not<lb/> available after the Repeal Act, then, merely because such power is<lb/> exercised during the subsistence of the Principal Act and prior to the<lb/> Repeal Act coming into force does not mean that further or incidental<lb/> power envisaged by the primary power to exempt is saved. Even this<lb/> incidental or ancillary power is unavailable after repeal of the Principal<lb/> Act. This argument is built more or less on the wording of Section 21 of<lb/> the General Clauses Act, 1897.<lb/> 30<lb/> Ms.GadreRajyadhyaksha, learned counsel appearing for the<lb/> Petitioners in Writ Petition No.556/2010, while adopting all arguments of<lb/> all the Senior Counsel only submitted that when more than one High<lb/> Court in this country have placed an interpretation on the Parliamentary<lb/> Statute or construed its provisions in a particular way, then, for the sake<lb/> of consistency and certainty this Court must follow the reasoning of the<lb/> Delhi High Court, Madras High Court and Andhra Pradesh High Court.<lb/> 31<lb/> Mr.Joshi and Ms.GadreRajyadhyaksha relied upon the<lb/> following judgments in support of the above submissions:<lb/> 1<lb/> Damodar Laxman Navare v/s State of Maharashtra,<lb/> in Writ Petition No.6300/2009 decided on<lb/> 08.07.2010 by the Bombay High Court : Reported in<lb/> 2010(6) Bom.

The State has throughout maintained<lb/> that in terms of the Preamble of the Principal Act and Constitutional<lb/> philosophy as enshrined by Articles 21 and 39(b) and (c) of the<lb/> Constitution of India a ceiling has been placed by the Principal Act on the<lb/> holding of vacant land within the urban agglomeration. This ceiling limit,<lb/> as is reflected from the Principal Act and which cannot be disputed, is<lb/> placed by a statutory prescription that is to be found in Section 4 of the<lb/> Principal Act. ChapterIII of the Principal Act is titled as &quot;ceiling on vacant<lb/> land&quot;. Except as otherwise provided in the Principal Act on and from the<lb/> commencement of the Principal Act no person shall be entitled to hold<lb/> any vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit in the territories to which<lb/> this Act applies under subsection (2) of Section 1. The obligation under<lb/> the statute is, therefore, clear and absolute. It relates and dates back to<lb/> the commencement of the Principal Act. None can dispute that what is<lb/> exempted from the purview of ChapterIII and by a overriding power<lb/> conferred in the State Government is the applicability of ChapterIII to the<lb/> vacant land in excess of ceiling limit. Therefore, when the excess vacant<lb/> land is exempted in exceptional circumstances and which have been also<lb/> specified by the statute, then, all that happens is that the excess vacant<lb/> land is exempted from the provisions of ChapterIII either conditionally or<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/></figure>

			<figure>unconditionally and in terms of the satisfaction in clauses (a) and (b) of<lb/> subsection (1) of Section 20 of the Principal Act. The power to exempt is<lb/> exercised by the State suomotu or otherwise meaning thereby on the<lb/> Application of the person holding the excess vacant land. The request is<lb/> not to apply the Chapter in the light of the factors and circumstances<lb/> specified therein. This request is made and granted only on the<lb/> satisfaction reached and not as a matter of course. Thus, application of<lb/> the chapter is a rule and its nonapplication is an exception. Despite<lb/> repeal of the Principal Act if the validity of the order granting exemption<lb/> under subsection (1) of Section 20 is saved by Section 3 of the Repeal<lb/> Act and such validity remains unaffected notwithstanding anything to the<lb/> contrary contained in the order of the competent court, then, full effect<lb/> will have to be given to the language of the Repeal Act. Once the Repeal<lb/> Act is so clear and does not evince anything contrary to the principles<lb/> enshrined in Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, then, on the strength of<lb/> the wording of the Repeal Act and in any event with the assistance of<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act it can safely be held that there is no<lb/> intention to destroy the rights and liabilities or consequences which flow<lb/> from a valid exemption order. In fact the language of Section 3 of the<lb/> Repeal Act supplements Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. Nothing in<lb/> Section 3 of the Repeal Act takes away applicability of the Principal Act to<lb/> the extent of enforcing the obligations in terms of the conditions imposed<lb/> in the order of exemption. The learned Advocate General submits that the<lb/> arguments of the Petitioners revolve around the saving clause enacted by<lb/> Section 3 of the Repeal Act. The submissions are that the Repeal Act<lb/> shows intention contrary to the applicability of Section 6 of the General<lb/> Clauses Act inasmuch as neither the exemption order nor any of the terms<lb/> and conditions therein can be enforced post repeal.<lb/> The learned Advocate General submitted that the provisions<lb/> of the Repeal Act and particularly Section 3(1) clauses (b) and (c) require<lb/> a harmonious interpretation. By reading these clauses together what is<lb/> apparent is that by clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal<lb/> Act it is clarified that repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the<lb/> vesting of any vacant land under Section 10(3) of the Principal Act,<lb/> possession of which has been taken over by the State Government or any<lb/> person duly authorized by the State in this behalf or by the competent<lb/> authority. Thus, if the steps as contemplated by subsection (3) of Section<lb/> 10 of the Principal Act and equally by subsections (5) and (6) thereof are<lb/> taken, then, the vesting of excess vacant land referred to in a Notification<lb/> published under Section 10(1) in terms of subsection (3) thereof is not<lb/> affected by repeal of the Principal Act. No person then can claim that the<lb/> excess vacant land to which the Principal Act admittedly applies and<lb/> which is deemed to have been acquired by the State does not belong to it<lb/> or the State is not entitled to it because the Principal Act has been<lb/> repealed and the vesting comes to an end. The vesting is of vacant land in<lb/> excess of ceiling limit. Undisputedly, if the land in excess of ceiling limit<lb/> can vest after the notification in terms of Section 10(1) is published in the<lb/> official Gazette, then, the declaration which is postulated or contemplated<lb/> by subsection (3) is in relation to such excess vacant land. What sub<lb/> section (3) of Section 10 really contemplates and envisages is that the<lb/> State can declare that the excess vacant land is deemed to have been<lb/> acquired by it upon publication of the declaration and particularly with<lb/> effect from the dates specified therein. By such deemed acquisition the<lb/> land is further deemed to have vested absolutely in the State free from all<lb/> encumbrances with effect from the date specified in the declaration. By<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> the repeal what has been clarified is that unless the State has taken over<lb/> possession of such excess vacant land and as referred to in the<lb/> Notification under Section 10(1) either by itself or through any person<lb/> duly authorized by it in this behalf or by the competent authority, its plain<lb/> and simple vesting will not enable the Government to take over<lb/> possession of the excess vacant land after coming into force of the Repeal<lb/> Act. This coming into force or commencing is reckoned in terms of sub<lb/> sections (2) and (3) of Section 1 of the Repeal Act. Thus, the State is<lb/> disabled from taking possession of the excess vacant land which has<lb/> already vested in it if it has failed to take possession. Thereupon the land<lb/> can be restored and that is how subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Repeal<lb/> Act would read. Therefore, this is not a restricted or limited saving clause<lb/> in any sense of the term. Though Section 3 is titled &quot;saving&quot; it contains<lb/> the substantive provisions. The Legislature or the Parliament did not<lb/> intend a vacuum. It did not stop by only stating that if possession of the<lb/> land vested in the State in terms of Section 10(3) is not taken, then, that<lb/> cannot be taken or the land cannot be made over to the Government after<lb/> repeal of the Principal Act. It enacts a further provision by which it is<lb/> possible for the State to restore the land to the holder and that is why<lb/> restoration is contemplated by virtue of Section 3(2). That restoration is<lb/> conditional upon repayment of an amount to the State Government by<lb/> the holder. Section 11 of the Principal Act talks of payment of amount for<lb/> the vacant land acquired under Section 10(3). That payment can be<lb/> claimed even without the land being handed over or without the<lb/> possession of the excess vacant land being taken. The deemed acquisition<lb/> by virtue of Section 10(3) enables the person or persons having interest in<lb/> the excess vacant land to claim the amount under Section 11. If any<lb/> payment has been made after such deemed acquisition, then, that amount<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> has to be returned to the Government and only then the excess vacant<lb/> land of which possession has not been taken will be restored to any<lb/> person or the holder as the case may be. If this was a complete<lb/> obliteration or destruction of the rights and liabilities under the Principal<lb/> Act, then, such substantive provision enabling restoration would not have<lb/> been inserted or incorporated is the submission of the learned Advocate<lb/> General. The refund of such amount and which has been paid to the<lb/> person or persons interested in the excess vacant land in terms of Section<lb/> 11 of the Principal Act alone entitles such person to claim restoration of<lb/> the land to him. If the repeal had been simplicitor and without such<lb/> substantive provision, then, it would not have been possible for the holder<lb/> or any person interested in the excess vacant land to claim its restoration.<lb/> It is, therefore, erroneous to urge that the Repeal Act evidences an<lb/> intention contrary to the applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses<lb/> Act, 1897.<lb/> 34<lb/> Inviting our attention to clauses (b) and (c) of subsection<lb/></figure>

			<p>(1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act the learned Advocate General submits<lb/> that the true nature of the power to exempt under the Principal Act would<lb/> have to be properly and completely appreciated. He submits that the basis<lb/> on which the power to exempt is exercised is that the person is holding<lb/> the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit. It is in case of such vacant land<lb/> that the State Government must be satisfied either on its own motion or<lb/> otherwise that having regard to its location, purpose for which such land<lb/> is being or is proposed to be used and such other relevant factors as the<lb/> circumstances of the case may require, it is necessary or expedient in the<lb/> public interest so to do that the Government is conferred with discretion<lb/> to pass an order exempting such vacant land from the provisions of<lb/></p>

			<figure>::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> ChapterIII either conditionally or otherwise. The learned Advocate<lb/> General submits that it is not just having regard to location of the land,<lb/> purpose for which the excess vacant land is being or is proposed to be<lb/> used and such other relevant factors as the circumstances of the case may<lb/> require, but it is necessary and expedient in the public interest that the<lb/> discretion to exempt such land has to be exercised. That is in terms of<lb/> clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 20. Whereas, in terms of clause<lb/> (b) of subsection (1) of Section 20, the State is satisfied either on its own<lb/> motion or otherwise that the application of the provisions of ChapterIII<lb/> would cause undue hardship to the persons holding the vacant land in<lb/> excess of ceiling limit that the Government may by order exempt<lb/> conditionally or unconditionally the vacant land from the provisions of<lb/> ChapterIII. Further the order under clause (b) cannot be made unless the<lb/> reasons for doing so are recorded in writing. That is because clause (b)<lb/> contemplates relieving the person holding the excess vacant land from<lb/> undue hardship. Clause (a) necessarily postulates an exercise of powers to<lb/> exempt the excess vacant land in public interest. When such is the ambit<lb/> and scope of the powers and it is vacant land in excess of ceiling limit<lb/> which is exempted from the provisions of ChapterIII that too in<lb/> exceptional circumstances, then, it is futile to contend that the State<lb/> Government despite validity of its Act or order being saved by the Repeal<lb/> Act, would not be able to do anything in relation to such land post repeal<lb/> of the Principal Act. The learned Advocate General submits that in this<lb/> case the power of exemption and which is to be exercised for public good<lb/> and in public interest is so exercised by making an order in that behalf.<lb/> That the validity of such an order is saved though the Principal Act is<lb/> repealed, but the legal consequences flowing from exercise of such clause<lb/> are not saved, would be an incorrect, improper and legally untenable<lb/> reading of the saving clause and the Repeal Act itself. The true nature of<lb/> the power to exempt has not been appreciated in making such<lb/> submissions. The Petitioners&apos; arguments proceed on an unsound and<lb/> erroneous basis and namely that the power to exempt in terms of Section<lb/> 20(1) of the Principal Act is exercised by the State Government only to<lb/> benefit the holder. The argument is that it is to relieve the holder from the<lb/> consequences of applicability of ChapterIII that the State exercises such<lb/> power and therefore, nothing further can be done in pursuance of the<lb/> valid order of exemption post repeal of the Principal Act.<lb/> 35<lb/> The learned Advocate General submits that implicit and<lb/> inherent in this is the assumption that even conditional order of<lb/> exemption, though valid after repeal, cannot be enforced in any manner<lb/> post such repeal or post commencement of the Repeal Act. Meaning<lb/> thereby the condition incorporated in the order of exemption though<lb/> valid or any action taken in pursuance of such valid exemption order or<lb/> condition gets saved still further acts and consequences would not ensue<lb/> post repeal of the Principal Act. This construction of such Section 3(1)<lb/> ignores clause (c) of the said subsection totally. In that clause any<lb/> payment made to the State Government as a condition for granting<lb/> exemption under subsection (1) of Section 20 is not affected. The<lb/> condition of payment and which is for granting exemption is not affected<lb/> post repeal of the Principal Act. Then that condition can be enforced,<lb/> would be the sequitur. If that logically follows and qua one condition one<lb/> fails to understand as to why the Parliament would enact a Repealing Act<lb/> not only to save the validity of any order granting exemption under<lb/> Section 20(1) of the Principal Act or any action taken thereunder<lb/> notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary, but to save<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> only conditional payment and leaving out all other conditions. It would<lb/> mean that a condition of payment incorporated in the order granting<lb/> exemption is valid and validity of such condition shall not be affected by<lb/> repeal, but the conditions other than payment are affected by repeal of<lb/> the Principal Act though Section 3(1)(b) saves the validity of the order<lb/> granting exemption. Such construction of the Repeal Act would lead to<lb/> absurdity and every interpretation which leads or results in such absurdity<lb/> must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, when the repeal of the Principal<lb/> Act shall not affect the validity of any order granting exemption under<lb/> Section 20(1) it means the order as whole including the conditions<lb/> incorporated therein is valid notwithstanding any judgment of any court<lb/> to the contrary. Equally any action taken thereunder is also valid<lb/> notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary. The action<lb/> taken under the exemption order could be of enforcing it or any of its<lb/> conditions or withdrawing it. The repeal of the Principal Act shall not<lb/> affect the validity of all this notwithstanding any judgment of any court to<lb/> the contrary. The Parliament is presumed to be aware of the ambit and<lb/> scope of the power to exempt conferred by the Principal Act in the State<lb/> Government. It is further presumed to be aware of the fact that such<lb/> exemption orders are in force or were in force. Therefore, when the<lb/> repeal of the Principal Act is to take effect from the date of adoption of<lb/> the Repeal Act, then, the Parliament plainly intended that the repeal of<lb/> the Principal Act shall not affect the validity of any order granting<lb/> exemption under Section 20(1) or any action taken thereunder. The<lb/> Parliament was equally aware of the fact that such exemption order or<lb/> any action taken thereunder may have been declared as invalid by any<lb/> judgment of any court. Therefore, it did not stop at merely saving and not<lb/> affecting any order of exemption under subsection (1) of Section 20 or<lb/> any action taken thereunder, but by a nonobstante clause declared that<lb/> the validity of any order granting exemption or any action taken<lb/> thereunder shall not be affected by repeal of the Principal Act<lb/> notwithstanding any judgment of any Court to the contrary. Far from<lb/> evincing or demonstrating any contrary intention the saving clause vide<lb/> Section 3 protects and saves not only the initial order of exemption or any<lb/> action taken thereunder, but the exemption order or any action taken<lb/> thereunder is declared valid and expressly saved notwithstanding any<lb/> judgment of any court to the contrary. Equally, any payment made to the<lb/> State Government as a condition for granting exemption under sub<lb/> section (1) of Section 20 is saved and shall not be affected. Thus, both the<lb/> condition and the payment under same shall not be affected by repeal of<lb/> the Principal Act.<lb/> 36<lb/> The learned Advocate General submits that correct and true<lb/> understanding of the saving clause is what is the real issue. The<lb/> Petitioners&apos; arguments are based on erroneous and incorrect<lb/> understanding of such clause. A saving clause is used to preserve from<lb/> destruction certain rights, remedies or privileges already existing. It<lb/> means that it saves all the rights the party previously had. It does not give<lb/> him any new rights. The saving clauses are introduced into the Acts which<lb/> repeal others to safeguard the rights which, but for the savings, would be<lb/> lost. The Legislature may have termed Section 3 as saving provision or<lb/></figure>

			<p>clause, but it is well settled that the description of the provision cannot be<lb/> decisive of its true meaning or interpretation which must depend on the<lb/> words used therein. But, when two interpretations are sought to be put<lb/> on a provision which fits the description and which the Legislature has<lb/> chosen to apply it, is according to sound canons of constructions, to be<lb/> adopted, provided of course, it is consistent with the language employed.<lb/></p>

			<p>That is to be preferred to the one which attributes to the provision a<lb/> different effect.</p>

			<figure>(See: State of Bombay v/s United Motors (India) Limited<lb/> AIR 1953 SC 252). Therefore, it is not safe to hold that Section 3 of the<lb/> Repeal Act saves only limited rights or consequences.<lb/> 37<lb/> Taking us through Section 4 of the Repeal Act and<lb/> particularly its proviso the learned Advocate General submitted that all<lb/> proceedings relating to Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Principal Act<lb/> insofar as such proceedings are relatable to the vacant land, possession of<lb/> which has been taken over by the State Government, do not abate. This is<lb/> not a total abatement of legal proceedings as is contended. If the<lb/> interpretation or construction placed on the Repeal Act by the Petitioners<lb/> is accepted that would mean that the vesting of any vacant land of which<lb/> possession is taken by the State Government is not affected and therefore,<lb/> that power or right of the Government is saved. The repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act shall not affect such vesting as is clear from clause (a) of<lb/> subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. However, because of such<lb/> deemed acquisition and vesting of excess vacant land of which possession<lb/> is taken by the State Government or competent authority the person<lb/> holding the vacant land would stand to lose completely. He would not be<lb/> entitled to claim any payment of the deemed acquisition and vesting of<lb/> the land in the State Government free from all encumbrances and which<lb/> is unaffected by the repeal of the Principal Act. He would be totally<lb/> remedyless. Since the Principal Act is repealed Sections 11 to 14 also<lb/> would be taken as obliterated from the statute book. If they stand<lb/> obliterated and removed, then, a person holding the vacant land in excess<lb/> of ceiling limit though entitled to payment or compensation under the<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:38 :::<lb/> Principal Act would not be so entitled because the Principal Act is<lb/> repealed. Without the proviso, the duty of the State to compensate for<lb/> such vesting, may not have been saved or survived the repeal. It could<lb/> have been urged that the right to seek compensation from the State is lost<lb/> as the Principal Act is repealed and all proceedings thereunder abate on<lb/> the Repeal Act taking effect. That is why the Legislature by proviso to<lb/> Section 4 of the Repeal Act clarified that such excess vacant land of which<lb/> possession has been taken and its vesting is saved despite repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act does not mean that a person holding such land need not be<lb/> or cannot be compensated. He can claim payment and the proceedings<lb/> relating to Sections 11 to 14 of the Principal Act insofar as they relate to<lb/> the vacant land of which possession has been taken, do not abate. This<lb/> proviso is completely overlooked while arguing in support of the principle<lb/> of total destruction or obliteration of the rights and liabilities under the<lb/> Principal Act so also the remedies. If this is demonstrative of a positive<lb/> legislative intent and which is duly reflected in the statement of objects<lb/> and reasons of the Repeal Act, then, it would not be proper to accept the<lb/> contentions of Mr.Naphade and other Senior Counsel. If the intent and<lb/></figure>

			<p>purpose is to save all rights and liabilities in relation to the excess vacant<lb/> land of which possession is taken, then, it would be safe to proceed and<lb/> hold that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and its applicability is not<lb/> ruled out or that the saving section demonstrates a contrary intention and<lb/> of non applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act.<lb/></p>

			<head>38<lb/></head>

			<p>The learned Advocate General also submitted that when the<lb/> rights, obligations and liabilities are intended to be saved it is not the<lb/> saving of only vested rights, but those of the nature specified in Section 6<lb/> of the General Clauses Act, 1897. He, therefore, submits that understood<lb/> thus and in the context of the power to exempt the excess vacant land<lb/> from applicability of ChapterIII of the Principal Act, then, the only<lb/> conclusion that can be reached is that not only Section 20(1) of the<lb/> Principal Act, but subsection (2) thereof is also saved and remains<lb/> unaffected by repeal of the Principal Act. He submits that an order of<lb/> exemption does not take the vacant land out of the purview of the<lb/> Principal Act or rules out its applicability to it totally. All that results after<lb/> such power is exercised is that, but for the duration of the exemption, the<lb/> vacant land in excess of ceiling limit continues to be treated and dealt<lb/> with as such. Its nature continues to be the same. It also continues to be<lb/> subject to the Principal Act. All that happens is that such an order of<lb/> exemption keeps in abeyance the operation of ChapterIII of the Principal<lb/> Act. As a result of such abeyance and by exercise of a statutory power the<lb/> rights and liabilities attached to the excess vacant land remain unaffected.<lb/></p>

			<p>In that regard it must not be lost sight that none can hold the excess<lb/> vacant land beyond the ceiling limit on and from the commencement of<lb/> the Principal Act. If that is the statutory position and which is recognized<lb/> even by the Repeal Act, so also, the exemption order only keeping in<lb/> abeyance the operation or applicability of ChapterIII to such lands, then,<lb/></p>

				<formula>all</formula>

			<figure>original rights, liabilities in relation thereto remain unaffected. The<lb/> Repeal Act saves such rights and liabilities and which are accrued and<lb/> incurred on commencement of the Principal Act. That is why by clause (a)<lb/> of subsection (1) of Section 3 it was declared by the Parliament that the<lb/> repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the vesting of any vacant land<lb/> under Section 10(3) the possession of which has been taken over by the<lb/> State Government otherwise, but for such express declaration it could<lb/> have been asserted that the Principal Act having been repealed the<lb/> vesting comes to an end or is obliterated. By clause (b) which cannot be<lb/> termed as merely a validating clause or saving theoretically the validity of<lb/> the exemption order, the Legislature declares that the said order is saved<lb/> with all legal consequences. This is in consonance with the object and<lb/> purpose in enacting the Repeal Act and saving from such repeal or leaving<lb/> unaffected by the repeal the exercise of some of the vital powers<lb/> conferred by the Principal Act and the actions taken thereunder.<lb/> 39<lb/> The learned Advocate General then submitted that it is not<lb/> correct to urge that the power to exempt is legislative in character. In that<lb/> behalf he took us once again through Sections 20(1) and (2), Sections 21<lb/> and 22 of the Principal Act, so also, the scheme of the Principal Act to<lb/> urge that it is an administrative order passed in the case of a excess<lb/> vacant land. Equally, the conditions imposed are inextricably linked to the<lb/> said exemption order. The public interest is paramount in imposing such<lb/> conditions and equally the Preamble of the Principal Act acts as a guide in<lb/> passing the orders of exemption under clauses (a) and (b) of subsection<lb/> (1) of Section 20. In such circumstances and when the order must contain<lb/> the reasons when it is made under clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section<lb/> 20, that order can be made on reaching the requisite satisfaction alone<lb/> and that withdrawal of the order of this nature is only after compliance<lb/> with the principles of natural justice, then, that rules out the possibility of<lb/> the power being termed as legislative in character, that submission of<lb/> Mr.Naphade has no substance. In these circumstances and when the point<lb/> is concluded by the judgment of the Constitution Bench of the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Bansidhar v/s State of Rajasthan<lb/> reported in (1989) 2 SCC 557, then, the reference cannot be answered,<lb/> but by holding that both subsections (1) and (2) of Section 20 of the<lb/> Principal Act are saved and not affected by repeal of the Principal Act. It is<lb/> fallacious to contend that withdrawal of the exemption order is axiomatic<lb/> or automatic on the satisfaction in terms of Section 20(2) being reached.<lb/> On the other hand what subsection (2) of Section 20 states is that it shall<lb/> be competent for the State Government to withdraw by order the<lb/> exemption if it is satisfied that any of the condition subject to which any<lb/> exemption under clause (a) or clause (b) of subsection (1) is not<lb/> complied with by any person. Further part of subsection (<ref type="formula">2</ref>) is that the<lb/> exemption can be withdrawn by an order, but after giving reasonable<lb/> opportunity to such person of making representation against the proposed<lb/> withdrawal. This means that the said person can make a representation<lb/> against the proposed withdrawal and the Government is obliged to<lb/> consider it. If the State Government is so obliged and it may withdraw the<lb/> order of exemption though fully competent to do so that would falsify all<lb/> the contentions to the contrary. If the withdrawal is not automatic or<lb/> axiomatic or only outcome or result upon the satisfaction under sub<lb/> section (2) being reached, then, it is further fallacious to contend that if<lb/> there is non compliance with any of the conditions subject to which<lb/> exemption has been granted, then, the only consequence of such non<lb/> compliance or breach would be applicability of Section 10(3) of the<lb/> Principal Act. That is not the only consequence because the State<lb/> Government may or may not withdraw the exemption, but by an order<lb/> under subsection (2) of Section 20 stipulate that if the condition is not<lb/> complied with within the time extended or provided in the further order<lb/> the exemption may be withdrawn. The Government can also in the order<lb/> state that some of the terms and conditions have been complied with<lb/> whereas others are not and since the order of exemption is not complied<lb/> with in its totality, additional time is being granted for such compliance<lb/> failing which the State may proceed to withdraw the order and take all<lb/> such and further actions as are permissible in law. Therefore, it is not as if<lb/> subsection (2) of Section 20 being not referred in the saving clause<lb/> enacted by Section 3 of the Repeal Act would mean the Legislature never<lb/> intended to save it. Rather it was not necessary to be mentioned because<lb/> if the validity of the order of exemption or any action taken thereunder is<lb/> saved that means the exemption order is valid, but not its conditions and<lb/> they cannot be enforced or only the exemption order is valid or any action<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">taken thereunder, but other consequences flowing from such valid<lb/> exemption order or any valid action taken thereunder are ruled out, that<lb/> is an erroneous submission. Relying on Bansidhar&apos;s case (supra) it is<lb/> submitted that intention contrary to the applicability of Section 6 of the<lb/> General Clauses Act is not to be assumed only with reference to what is<lb/> expressly saved and it cannot be further assumed that what is not<lb/> expressly saved stands destroyed or obliterated. An express saving clause<lb/> necessarily does not reflect intention contrary to the applicability of<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. Therefore, the reference needs to be<lb/> answered accordingly.<lb/> 40<lb/> The learned Advocate General while ending his submissions<lb/> urged that the decisions in the case of Voltas Limited v/s Additional<lb/> Collector &amp; Competent Authority reported in 2008(5) Bom.C.R. 746,<lb/> Vithabai Bama Bhandari v/s State of Maharashtra reported in 2009(3)<lb/> Bom. C.R. 663 and Sundersons and others v/s State of Maharashtra and<lb/> others reported in 2008 (5) Bombay Cases Reporter 85 or any<lb/> observations therein are not binding on construction and interpretation of<lb/> Section 3(1)(b) and (c) of the Repeal Act. At best, the observations and<lb/> findings in these decisions can be applied to a case falling under Section<lb/> 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. In that regard as well some further conclusions<lb/> rendered in Voltas Case (supra) and all above decisions contrary to what<lb/> is held in Bansidhar&apos;s Case (supra) do not lay down the correct law. In<lb/> fact Bansidhar&apos;s case (supra) was cited before the Division Bench in Votlas<lb/> Case (supra), but the Division Bench completely omitted it from<lb/> consideration and made some sweeping observations. These observations,<lb/> findings and conclusions in Voltas (supra) have been followed in Vithabai<lb/> (supra), Sundersons (supra) and in Mohan Gopalrao Mate v/s Principal<lb/> Secretary and others reported in 2009(1) Bom. C.R. 275, all of which,<lb/> therefore and to the extent indicated above must be held to be not laying<lb/> down the correct law.<lb/> 41<lb/> These submissions of the learned Advocate General are fully<lb/> adopted by Mr.P.K.Dhakephalkar, learned Senior Counsel appearing in<lb/> some of the petitions for the State. He has take us through the scheme of<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and particularly the words of clause<lb/> (b) thereof to urge that the exemption order including the conditions<lb/> thereunder and all legal consequences survive the repeal of the Principal<lb/> Act. That is the only construction which can be placed on Section 3 of the<lb/> Repeal Act.<lb/> 42<lb/> The learned Advocate General and Mr.Dhakephalkar have<lb/> relied upon the following decisions:<lb/> 1<lb/> State of Punjab v/s Mohar Singh Pratap Singh,<lb/> reported in AIR 1955 SC 84.<lb/> 2<lb/> Brihan Maharashtra Sugar Syndicate v/s Janardan<lb/> Ramchandra Kulkarni, reported in AIR 1960 SC<lb/> 794.<lb/> 3<lb/> Her Highness Maharani Shantidevi P.

Therefore,<lb/> Bansidhar&apos;s case (supra) and other judgments are distinguishable. Even<lb/> otherwise the judgments are not to be read like statutes. One cannot<lb/> construe the Repeal Act and as clear in the present case to mean reviving<lb/> the Principal Act. In Bansidhar (supra) and other cases cited there was no<lb/> plain and express repeal, but a reenactment of the earlier legislation or<lb/> law. The Rajasthan Ceiling Act of 1955 was replaced or repealed by a<lb/> later Ceiling Act. That is, therefore, a case of reenactment. In the<lb/> reenacted statute there was a saving clause, namely, Section 15 of the<lb/> Rajasthan Act No.VIII of 1976. That indicated that earlier Ceiling Law,<lb/> namely, Act of 1955 was still on the statute book albeit for a limited<lb/> purpose. That is how paragraph 24 of Bansidhar&apos;s judgment (supra)<lb/> would read. Thus, the factual matrix was different. In the present case,<lb/> the Repeal Act destroys many provisions of the Principal Act. Sections 21<lb/> and 22 of the Principal Act are not saved and therefore, parimateria<lb/> provision like Section 20(2) cannot be held to be saved. Similarly all cases<lb/> which have been cited by the learned Advocate General on the law<lb/> enacting ceiling on agricultural lands are inapplicable because firstly<lb/> those Acts are not parimateria. Secondly, interpretation on the provisions<lb/> of those Acts was placed by the Honourable Supreme Court when the said<lb/> Acts were existing on the statute book and not repealed. That is why<lb/> these judgments cannot be cited as precedent for applicability of Section 6<lb/> of the General Clauses Act to the present case. Lastly, Mr.Naphade would<lb/> submit that the learned Advocate General was in error in placing reliance<lb/> on the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Atia<lb/> Mohammadi Begum v/s State of U.P. reported in AIR 1993 SC 2465<lb/> because this decision is expressly dissented from in a later decision of the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court in Her Highness Maharani Shantidevi P.<lb/> Gaikwad vs. Savjibhai Haribhai Patel and Others reported in (2001) 5 SCC<lb/> 101. It is overruled. Thus, if ChapterIII of the Principal Act is the heart of<lb/> the said law and its applicability is ruled out completely and not<lb/> temporarily as urged, then, the said ChapterIII does not survive repeal of<lb/> the Principal Act. For these reasons the Reference must be answered in<lb/> terms urged by the Petitioners.<lb/> 44<lb/> For properly appreciating the rival contentions a reference<lb/> firstly to the Principal Act and thereafter, the Repeal Act is necessary. In<lb/> AIR 1979 SC 1415 (Union of India v/s Valluri Basavaiah Chouwdhary),<lb/> the Honourable Supreme Court outlined the object and purpose of the<lb/> Principal Act in the following words:<lb/> &quot;6.<lb/> The primary object and the purpose of the Urban<lb/> Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, &apos;the Act&apos;, as<lb/> the long title and the preamble show, is to provide for<lb/> the imposition of a ceiling on vacant land in urban<lb/> agglomerations, for the acquisition of such land in<lb/> excess of the ceiling limit, to regulate the construction<lb/> of buildings on such land and for matters connected<lb/> therewith, with a view to preventing the<lb/> concentration of urban land in the hands of a few<lb/> persons and speculation and profiteering therein, and<lb/> with a view to bringing about an equitable<lb/> distribution of land in urban agglomerations to<lb/> subserve the common good, in furtherance of the<lb/> directive principles of Art.39(b) and (c).&quot;<lb/> 45<lb/> ChapterI of the Principal Act contains preliminary<lb/> provisions. Firstly, by Section 1 short title, application and<lb/> commencement is set out and by virtue of subsection (2) thereof the<lb/> Principal Act becomes applicable to the State of Maharashtra in the first<lb/></figure>

			<p>instance. Then, in Section 2 there are certain definitions. For our purpose<lb/> the definitions of the term &quot;appointed day&quot; appearing in Section 2(a),<lb/> &quot;ceiling limit&quot; in Section 2(c), &quot;to hold&quot; in Section 2(l), &quot;urban land&quot; as<lb/> defined in Section 2(o) and &quot;vacant land&quot; appearing in Section 2(q) are<lb/> relevant. On perusal of these definitions further provisions of the Principal<lb/> Act can be properly appreciated. The Principal Act, therefore, must be<lb/> seen as applicable to the vacant land and within an urban agglomeration.<lb/></p>

			<p>A person holding such land or possessing it in any of the capacities<lb/> referred to in Section 2(l) shall be bound by the ceiling limit as specified<lb/> in Section 4(1) and further subsections of that Section. By Section 3 it is<lb/> mandated that on and from the commencement of the Principal Act<lb/> except as otherwise provided therein no person shall be entitled to hold<lb/> any vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit in the territories to which the<lb/> Principal Act applies under subsection (2) of Section 1. Further<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">provision, namely, Section 5 sets out as to what are the consequences on<lb/> such vacant land being transferred at any time during the period<lb/> commencing on the appointed day and ending with the commencement<lb/> of the Principal Act. Then, Section 6 requires the persons holding vacant<lb/> land in excess of ceiling limit to file a statement. Section 6 of the Principal<lb/> Act reads as under:<lb/> &quot;6.<lb/> Persons holding vacant land in excess of ceiling limit<lb/> to file statement:<lb/> (1)<lb/> Every person holding vacant land in excess of the<lb/> ceiling limit at the commencement of this Act shall,<lb/> within such period as may be prescribed, file a<lb/> statement before the competent authority having<lb/> jurisdiction specifying the location, extent, value and<lb/> such other particulars as may be prescribed of all<lb/> vacant lands and of any other land on which there is<lb/> a building, whether or not with a dwelling unit<lb/> therein, held by him (including the nature of his<lb/> right, title or interest therein) and also specifying the<lb/> vacant lands within the ceiling limit which he desires<lb/> to retain:<lb/> Provided that in relation to any State to which this<lb/> Act applies in the first instance, the provisions of this<lb/> subsection shall have effect as if for the words &quot;Every<lb/> person holding vacant land in excess of the ceiling<lb/> limit and the commencement of this Act&quot;, the words,<lb/> figures and letters &quot;Every person who held vacant<lb/> land in excess of the ceiling limit on or after the 17th<lb/> day of February, 1975 and before the commencement<lb/> of this Act and every person holding vacant land in<lb/> excess of the ceiling limit at such commencement&quot; had<lb/> been substituted.<lb/> Explanation. -In this section, &quot;commencement of this Act&quot;<lb/> means, -<lb/>(i)<lb/> the date on which this Act comes into force in<lb/> any State;<lb/> (ii) where any land, not being vacant land,<lb/> situated in a State in which this Act is in force has<lb/> become vacant land by any reason whatsoever, the<lb/> date on which such land becomes vacant land;<lb/> (iii) where any notification has been issued under<lb/> clause (n) of section 2 in respect of any area in a<lb/> State in which this Act is in force; the date of<lb/> publication of such notification.<lb/> (2)<lb/> If the competent authority is of opinion that -<lb/>(a) in any State to which this Act applies in the<lb/> first instance, any person held on or after the 17th<lb/> day of February, 1975 and before the commencement<lb/> of this Act or holds at such commencement; or<lb/> (b) in any State which adopts this Act under clause<lb/> (1) of Article 252 of the Constitution, any person<lb/> holds at the commencement of this Act,<lb/> vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit, then,<lb/> notwithstanding anything contained in subsection<lb/> (1), it may serve a notice upon such person requiring<lb/> him to file, within such period as may be specified in<lb/> the notice, the statement referred to in subsection<lb/> (1).<lb/> (3)<lb/> The competent authority may, if it is satisfied that it<lb/> is necessary so to do, extend the date for filing the<lb/> statement under this section by such further period or<lb/> periods as it may think fit; so, however, that the<lb/> period or the aggregate of the periods of such<lb/> extension shall not exceed three months.<lb/> (4)<lb/> The statement under this section shall be filed, -<lb/>(a) in the case of an individual, by the individual<lb/> himself; where the individual is absent from India, by<lb/> the Individual concerned or by some person duly<lb/> authorised by him in this behalf; and where the<lb/> individual is mentally incapacitated from attending<lb/> to his affairs, by his guardian or any other person<lb/> competent to act on his behalf;<lb/> (b) in the case of a family, by the husband or wife<lb/> and where the husband or wife is absent from India<lb/> or is mentally incapacitated from attending to his or<lb/> her affairs, by the husband or wife who is not so<lb/> absent or mentally incapacitated and where both the<lb/> husband and the wife are absent from India or are<lb/> mentally incapacitated from attending to their<lb/> affairs, by any other person competent to act on<lb/> behalf of the husband or wife or both;<lb/> (c) in the case of a company, by the principal<lb/> officer thereof;<lb/> (d) in the case of a firm, by any partner thereof;<lb/> (e) in the case of any other association, by any<lb/> member of the association or the principal officer<lb/> thereof; and<lb/> (f)<lb/> in the case of any other person, by that person<lb/> or by a person competent to act on his behalf.<lb/> Explanation. -For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;principal<lb/> officer&quot;, -<lb/>(i)<lb/> in relation to a company, means the secretary,<lb/> manager or managingdirector of the company;<lb/> (ii) in relation to any association, means the<lb/> secretary, treasurer, manager or agent of the<lb/> association,<lb/></figure>

			<p>and includes any person connected with the<lb/> management of the affairs of the company or the<lb/> association, as the case may be, upon whom the<lb/> competent authority has served a notice of his<lb/> intention of treating him as the principal officer<lb/> thereof.&quot;<lb/> A bare perusal thereof would indicate as to how the filing of<lb/> statement is compulsory and by a person holding vacant land in excess of<lb/> ceiling limit at the commencement of the Principal Act. He being required<lb/> to file within the prescribed period a statement before the competent<lb/> authority having jurisdiction specifying the location, extent, value and<lb/> such other particulars as may be prescribed of all vacant land and of any<lb/> other land on which there is a building, whether or not with a dwelling<lb/> unit therein held by him including the nature of his right, title and<lb/> interest therein and also specifying the vacant land within the ceiling limit<lb/> which he desires to retain, that we are of the view that such statement is<lb/> contemplated by law so as not to allow the holder of excess vacant land to<lb/> escape the consequence of law. This aspect would become clear if one<lb/> peruses Sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Principal Act. It is not as if the<lb/> competent authority does not make any inquiry on the statement filed<lb/> under Section 6. That such an inquiry has to be made because it is the<lb/> competent authority who has to prepare the draft statement. The<lb/> statement gets finality by virtue of Section 9 and thereafter, the<lb/> consequences follow and those are to be found in Section 10. Much<lb/> emphasis has been laid on the said provision, namely, Section 10. It is<lb/> reproduced herein below:<lb/> &quot;10. Acquisition of vacant land in excess of ceiling limit:<lb/></p>

			<p>(1)<lb/></p>

			<p>As soon as may be after the service of the statement<lb/> under section 9 on the person concerned, the<lb/> competent authority shall cause a notification giving<lb/> the particulars of the vacant land held by such person<lb/> in excess of the ceiling limit and stating that -<lb/>(i)<lb/> such vacant land is so be acquired by the<lb/> concerned State <ref type="biblio">Government; and<lb/> (ii)</ref> the claims of all persons interested in such<lb/> vacant land may be made by them personally or by<lb/> their agents giving particulars of the nature of their<lb/> interests in such land,<lb/> to be published for the information of the general<lb/> public in the Official Gazette of the State concerned<lb/> and in such other manner as may be prescribed.<lb/></p>

			<p>(2)<lb/></p>

			<p>After considering the claims of the persons interested<lb/> in the vacant land, made to the competent authority<lb/> in pursuance of the notification published under sub<lb/> section (1), the competent authority shall determine<lb/> the nature and extent of such claims and pass such<lb/> orders as it deems fit.<lb/></p>

			<p>(</p>

			<figure type="table">3)<lb/> At any time after the publication of the notification<lb/> under subsection (1), the competent authority may,<lb/> by notification published in the Official Gazette of the<lb/> State concerned, declare that the excess vacant land<lb/> referred to in the notification published under sub<lb/> section (1) shall, with effect from such date as may be<lb/> specified in the declaration, be deemed to have been<lb/> acquired by the State Government and upon the<lb/> publication of such declaration, such land shall be<lb/> deemed to have vested absolutely in the State<lb/> Government free from all encumbrances with effect<lb/> from the date so specified.<lb/> (4)<lb/> During the period commencing on the date of<lb/> publication of the notification under subsection (1)<lb/> and ending with the date specified in the declaration<lb/> made under subsection (3) -<lb/>(i)<lb/> no person shall transfer by way of sale,<lb/> mortgage, gift, lease or otherwise any excess vacant<lb/> land (including any part thereof) specified in the<lb/> notification aforesaid and any such transfer made in<lb/> contravention of this provision shall be deemed to be<lb/> null and void; and<lb/> (ii) no person shall alter or cause to be altered the<lb/> use of such excess vacant land.<lb/> (5)<lb/> Where any vacant land is vested in the State<lb/> Government under subsection (3), the competent<lb/> authority may, by notice in writing, order any person<lb/> who may be in possession of it to surrender or deliver<lb/> possession thereof to the State Government or to any<lb/> person duly authorised by the State Government in<lb/> this behalf within thirty days of the service of the<lb/> notice.<lb/> (6)<lb/> If any person refuses or fails to comply with an order<lb/> made under subsection (5), the competent authority<lb/> may take possession of the vacant land or cause it to<lb/> be given to the concerned State Government or to any<lb/> person duly authorised by such State Government in<lb/> this behalf and may for that purpose use such force as<lb/> may be necessary.<lb/> Explanation. -In this section, in subsection (1) of section 11<lb/> and in sections 14 and 23, &quot;State Government&quot;, in<lb/> relation to -<lb/>(a) any vacant land owned by the Central<lb/> Government, means the Central Government;<lb/> (b) any vacant land owned by any State<lb/> Government and situated in a Union territory or<lb/> within the local limits of a cantonment declared as<lb/> such under section 3 of the Cantonments Act, 1924,<lb/> (2 of 1924), means that State Government.&quot;<lb/> 47<lb/> A bare perusal thereof would indicate that it is providing for<lb/> acquisition of vacant land in excess of ceiling limit. Sections 11 to 14<lb/> create a mechanism for the purpose of payment of amount for vacant<lb/> lands acquired in terms of Section 10. By Section 15 there is a ceiling<lb/> limit on future acquisition by inheritance, bequest or by sale in execution<lb/> of decrees, etc. Then, there are other consequences which are to be found<lb/> when the Principal Act is adopted subsequently by any State. Then the<lb/> persons can file the statement and in relation to such State within the<lb/> time specified by Section 16. By Section 17 the power is given to enter<lb/> upon any vacant land. By Section 18 there are penalties provided for<lb/> concealment etc. of particulars or furnishing inaccurate particulars of<lb/> *57*<lb/> FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw<lb/> vacant land. Section 19 states that the Chapter will not apply to certain<lb/> vacant lands and those are specified in subsection (1) of Section 19. By<lb/> subsection (2) of Section 19 the intent of the legislature is further<lb/> clarified inasmuch as there is distinction between the Chapter not<lb/> applying to certain vacant lands and exemption to vacant lands from the<lb/> provisions of the Chapter. By subsection (2) of Section 19 it is clarified<lb/> that the provisions of subsection (1) of Section 19 shall not be construed<lb/> as granting any exemption in favour of any person other than an<lb/> authority, institution or organization specified in subsection (1). Such<lb/> persons may be possessing any vacant land which is owned by such<lb/> authority, institution or organization. In other words, the Chapter is not<lb/> applicable to vacant lands which are owned by an authority, institution or<lb/> organization. Similarly, if any such authority, institution or organization<lb/> possesses any vacant land belonging to a person, then, that person/<lb/> owner does not derive any benefit or advantage merely because the<lb/> Chapter is not applicable since the vacant land is in possession of the<lb/> authority, institution or organization. By Section 20 the power to exempt<lb/> is conferred. Section 20 is reproduced herein below:<lb/> &quot;20. Power to exempt:<lb/> (1)<lb/> Notwithstanding anything contained in any of the<lb/> foregoing provisions of this Chapter. -<lb/>(a) where any person holds vacant land in excess of<lb/> the ceiling limit and the State Government is satisfied,<lb/> either on its own motion or otherwise, that, having<lb/> regard to the location of such land, the purpose for<lb/> which such land is being or is proposed to be used and<lb/> such other relevant factors as the circumstances of the<lb/> case may require, it is necessary or expedient in the<lb/> public interest so to do, that Government may, by<lb/> order, exempt, subject to such conditions, if any, as<lb/> may be specified in the order, such vacant land from<lb/> the provisions of this Chapter.<lb/> (b) where any person holds vacant land in excess of<lb/> *58*<lb/> the ceiling limit and the State Government, either on<lb/> its own motion or otherwise, is satisfied that the<lb/> application of the provisions of this Chapter would<lb/> cause undue hardship to such person, that<lb/> Government may by order, exempt subject to such<lb/> conditions, if any, as may be specified in the order,<lb/> such vacant land from the provisions of this Chapter:<lb/> Provided that no order under this clause shall be made unless<lb/> the reasons for doing so are recorded in writing.<lb/> (2)<lb/> If at any time the State Government is satisfied that<lb/> any of the conditions subject to which any exemption<lb/> under clause (a) or clause (b) of subsection (1) is<lb/> granted is not complied with by any person, it shall<lb/> be competent for the State Government to withdraw,<lb/> by order, such exemption after giving a reasonable<lb/> opportunity to such person for making a<lb/> representation against the proposed withdrawal and<lb/> thereupon the provisions of this Chapter shall apply<lb/> accordingly.&quot;<lb/> 48<lb/> A bare perusal of Section 20 would indicate that the power<lb/> thereunder is conferred in the State. The State can exempt the vacant<lb/> land in excess of ceiling limit from the provisions of the ChapterIII if it is<lb/> satisfied in terms of clause (a) or (b) of subsection (1) that the<lb/> exemption is required because of the location of land, the purpose for<lb/> which such land is being used or proposed to be used and such other<lb/> relevant factors as the circumstances of the case may require and that it is<lb/> necessary and expedient in the public interest so to do. By clause (b) of<lb/> subsection (1) of Section 20 to relieve undue hardship to a person<lb/></figure>

			<p>holding the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit that the power to exempt<lb/> is to be exercised. However, the power to exempt is exercised in relation<lb/> to the excess vacant land. Therefore, such exemption being granted does<lb/> not mean that the excess vacant land is out of the purview of the Principal<lb/> Act. That it is subject to the Principal Act is clear and is undisputed. That<lb/> it being so subject to the Principal Act is, therefore, empowering the<lb/> Government to exempt it from the provisions of ChapterIII thereof. That<lb/> it is the excess vacant land and therefore, ChapterIII would govern the<lb/> same, is not disputed before us. The question is whether such exemption<lb/> being granted and after it being granted subject to any conditions will<lb/> that exemption order survive the repeal of the Principal Act with all<lb/> consequences or not? The Repeal Act reads thus:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Act, 1999. (15 of 1999)</ref></p>

.<lb/> An Act to repeal the Urban Land (Ceiling and<lb/> Regulation) Act, 1976.<lb/> BE it enacted by Parliament in the Fiftieth Year of the<lb/> Republic of India as follows: -<lb/>1.<lb/> Short title and application commencement: -<lb/>(1) This Act may be called the Urban Land (Ceiling<lb/> and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999.<lb/> (2) It applies in the first instance to the whole of<lb/> the States of Haryana and Punjab and to all the<lb/> Union territories; and it shall apply to such other<lb/> State which adopts this Act by resolution passed in<lb/> that behalf under clause (2) of article 252 of the<lb/> Constitution.<lb/> (3) It shall be deemed to have come into force in<lb/> the States of Haryana and Punjab and in all the<lb/> Union territories on the 11th day of January, 1999<lb/> and in any other State which adopts this Act under<lb/> clause (2) of article 252 of the Constitution on the<lb/> date of such adoption; and the reference to repeal of<lb/> the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976<lb/> shall, in relation to any State or Union territory,<lb/> mean the date on which this Act comes into force in<lb/> such State or Union territory.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Repeal of Act 33 of 1976: -The Urban Land (Ceiling<lb/> and Regulation) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as<lb/> the principal Act) is hereby repealed.<lb/> 3.<lb/> Savings: -<lb/>(1) The repeal of the principal Act shall not affect<lb/> (a) the vesting of any vacant land under<lb/> subsection (3) of section 10, possession of which has<lb/> been taken over by the State Government or any<lb/> person duly authorised by the State Government in<lb/> this behalf or by the competent authority;<lb/> (b) the validity of any order granting<lb/> exemption under subsection (1) of section 20 or any<lb/> action taken thereunder, notwithstanding any<lb/> judgment of any court to the contrary;<lb/> (c) any payment made to the State<lb/> Government as a condition for granting exemption<lb/> under subsection (1) of section 20.<lb/> (2) Where-<lb/>(a) any land is deemed to have vested in the<lb/> State Government under subsection (3) of section 10<lb/> of the principal Act but possession of which has not<lb/> been taken over by the State Government or any<lb/> person duly authorised by the State Government in<lb/> this behalf or by the competent authority; and<lb/> (b) any amount has been paid by the State<lb/> Government with respect to such land,<lb/> then, such land shall not be restored unless the<lb/> amount paid, if any, has been refunded to the State<lb/> Government.<lb/></figure>

			<head>4.<lb/></head>

			<p>Abatement of legal proceedings : -<lb/>All proceedings relating to any order made or<lb/> purported to be made under the principal Act pending<lb/> immediately before the commencement of this Act,<lb/> before any court, tribunal or other authority shall<lb/> abate:<lb/> Provided that this section shall not apply to the<lb/> proceedings relating to sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 of<lb/> the principal Act in so far as such proceedings are<lb/> relatable to the land, possession of which has been<lb/> taken over by the State Government or any person<lb/> duly authorised by the State Government in this<lb/> behalf or by the competent authority.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/></head>

			<p>Repeal and saving : -<lb/>(1) The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation)<lb/> Repeal <ref type="biblio">Ordinance, 1999 (Ord. 5 of 1999)</ref> is hereby<lb/> repealed.<lb/></p>

			<p>(2) Notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or<lb/> any action taken under the said Ordinance shall be<lb/> deemed to have been done or taken under the<lb/> corresponding provisions of this Act.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>49<lb/></head>

			<p>To our mind if the intent and purpose was not to save the<lb/> order of exemption with the attendant legal consequences, then, the<lb/> Legislature was not required to mention or specify anything about its<lb/> validity in the Repeal Act. The Legislature was then not required to save<lb/> its validity as well. The argument is that the validity of exemption order is<lb/> saved because vesting of excess vacant land of which possession alone is<lb/> taken is saved and that has been specified in clause (a) of Section 3(1) of<lb/> the Repeal Act. The vesting of such excess vacant lands cannot be<lb/> questioned because, at one time they may be exempted from applicability<lb/> of the provisions of ChapterIII, but that exemption was withdrawn and<lb/> later they were subjected to the consequences specified by Section 10 and<lb/> particularly subsections (3), (<ref type="formula">5</ref>) and (<ref type="formula">6</ref>) thereof, that the validity of the<lb/> order exempting them has been saved. We do not think that this will be a<lb/> sound and proper reading of the Repeal Act. Just as the Principal Act<lb/> would have to be read as a whole, equally the Repeal Act as well. We<lb/></p>

			<figure>cannot read the Repeal Act by omitting or leaving out therefrom anything<lb/> which the Legislature has specifically incorporated or inserted. We,<lb/> therefore, cannot hold that clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of<lb/> the Repeal Act which is a saving clause having saved the vesting of the<lb/> excess vacant land of which possession has been taken over and these<lb/> vacant lands may be at one time exempted, that the Legislature inserted<lb/> by way of abundant caution clauses (b) and (c) in subsection (1) of<lb/> Section 3 of the Repeal Act. The argument of Mr.Naphade and other<lb/> Senior Counsel is that this is by way of abundant caution and nothing<lb/> more.<lb/> 50<lb/> We are unable to agree with them because the excess vacant<lb/> lands being at one time exempted, but such exemption being withdrawn<lb/> later would equate such excess vacant lands with those in relation to<lb/> which the power of exemption was never exercised and the Chapter was<lb/> throughout applicable. Their status would be on par with those excess<lb/> vacant lands in relation to which no attempt was made to seek an<lb/> exemption or such attempt was made, exemption granted, but later on<lb/> withdrawn and withdrawal never questioned by the affected parties. If in<lb/> relation to such lands as well the necessary steps and in pursuance of<lb/> Section 10(1) could have been taken and prior to the repeal had the<lb/> possession of such lands been taken over, they would have vested in the<lb/> State and that vesting is saved or survives the repeal of the Principal Act,<lb/> then, there was absolutely no necessity of saving the exemption order and<lb/> which has already been acted upon or in relation to which the<lb/> consequences including those provided by Section 20(2) and ensuing the<lb/> same have already followed.<lb/></figure>

			<p>51<lb/> Then, why is the validity of any order granting exemption<lb/> under subsection (1) of Section 20 or any action taken thereunder<lb/> notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary, saved? That is<lb/> saved and with a purpose. That is because the power to exempt the land<lb/> and which could be exercised in a given case in public interest and not for<lb/> any private purpose or benefit should be allowed to be pursued to its<lb/> logical end. If the power is conferred and its exercise is contemplated for<lb/> public good and in public interest, then, the consequences of the same<lb/> ought to follow and equally in public interest and for public good. The<lb/> Legislature while repealing the Principal Act was aware of the<lb/> consequences that may follow the repeal. It was aware of the fact that if<lb/> certain steps taken or the powers exercised under the Principal Act do not<lb/> survive the repeal thereof, then, public good and public interest would be<lb/> adversely affected. The power to exempt is coupled with a duty. If that is<lb/> coupled with a duty and not an absolute power and is in the nature of a<lb/> trust and is expected to be exercised in that manner, then, the Legislature<lb/> was aware that the power having once exercised it must be allowed to<lb/> take its full course. That is why whatever may be its fate in terms of the<lb/> order of the Court, but notwithstanding that the validity of exemption<lb/> order is saved and that is not to allow a person who may be a beneficiary<lb/> thereof to escape the legal consequences ensuing the same. If that were<lb/> not to be saved and was not to survive the repeal, then, clauses (b) and<lb/> (c) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act were not required to<lb/> be inserted.</p>

			<figure type="table">They are not surplusage or superfluous or inserted as and by<lb/> way of abundant caution. The law in this regard is very clear and in the<lb/> words of the Honourable Mr. Justice Patanjali Shastri, Chief Justice of<lb/> India (as His Lordship then was) in the case of Aswini Kumar Ghose v/s<lb/> Arabinda Bose reported in AIR 1952 SC 369, &quot;it is not a sound principle<lb/> of construction to brush aside words in a statute as being inapposite<lb/> surplusage, if they can have appropriate application in circumstances<lb/> conceivably within the contemplation of the statute.&quot; The Honourable<lb/> Supreme Court has also held that it is incumbent on the court to avoid a<lb/> construction, if reasonably permissible on the language, which would<lb/> render a part of the statute devoid of any meaning or application. In other<lb/> decision reported in AIR 1961 SC 1170 (J.K.Cotton Spinning &amp; Weaving<lb/> Mills Co. Ltd. v/s State of U.P.), it is held that &quot;To harmonise is not to<lb/> destroy. The courts always presume that the Legislature inserted every<lb/> part thereof for a purpose and the legislative intention is that every part<lb/> of the statute should have effect&quot; (see para 7 at page 1174). The<lb/> Legislature is deemed not to waste its words or to say anything in vain.<lb/> Hence, it is not possible to easily attribute to the Legislature that a<lb/> provision has been made or the words have been inserted just as a matter<lb/> of caution or to chart a safe course. If the vesting of the land of which<lb/> possession has been taken is saved and repeal of the Principal Act was not<lb/> to affect it, then, nothing more was required to be stated or saved as the<lb/> law has taken its course. If vesting of the vacant land under Section<lb/> 10(3), possession of which has been taken over by the State alone, is to<lb/> be saved, then, making further provisions and incorporating them in the<lb/> Repeal Act was unnecessary.<lb/> 52<lb/> The above aspect becomes clear if we peruse the statement of<lb/> objects and reasons to the Repeal Bill, 1999. That reads as under:<lb/> &quot;Statement of Objects and Reasons:<lb/> The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976<lb/> was passed with a laudable social objective. The main<lb/> purpose was to prevent concentration of urban land<lb/> in a few hands and to provide affordable housing to<lb/> the Economically Weaker Sections. It has on the<lb/> contrary pushed up land prices, practically brought<lb/> the housing industry to a stop and provided<lb/> opportunities for corruption. There is a widespread<lb/> demand for removing this irritant to land assembly<lb/> and construction activity. During the implementation<lb/> of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act,<lb/> 1976, there have been a spate of litigations giving rise<lb/> to serious hurdles in taking over possession of land,<lb/> by the State Governments. Public opinion is nearly<lb/> unanimous that the Act has failed to achieve its<lb/> objectives as expected.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Parliament has no power to repeal or amend the Act<lb/> unless resolutions are passed by two or more State<lb/> Legislatures as required under clause (2) of Article<lb/> 252. The Legislatures of Haryana and Punjab have<lb/> passed resolutions empowering Parliament to repeal<lb/> the Act in those States. The Act stands repealed in<lb/> those States and in the Union territories immediately<lb/> after promulgation of the repeal Ordinance and<lb/> subsequently if State Legislatures adopt this Repeal<lb/> Act by resolution, then the Urban Land (Ceiling and<lb/> Regulation) Act, 1976 will stand repealed in those<lb/> States, from the date of its adoption.<lb/></figure>

			<figure>3.<lb/> The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Bill,<lb/> 1998 was examined by the Standing Committee on<lb/> Urban and Rural Development. The Committee felt<lb/> that the land which is yet to be put to use for the<lb/> original purposes stated in the Act, under possession<lb/> of the Government should not be restored to previous<lb/> owners as such restoration may lead to avoidable<lb/> discrimination. The Committee also suggested that the<lb/> repeal Bill should contain a provision for abatement<lb/> of proceedings in the different courts. Keeping in view<lb/> the recommendations of the Committee, this Bill is<lb/> being introduced to replace the Urban Land (Ceiling<lb/> and Regulation) Repeal Ordinance, 1999 (Ord.5 of<lb/> 1999) notified on 11.01.1999 so that the State<lb/> Governments would be free to have their own<lb/> legislation commensurate with their needs and<lb/> experiences. Till this Act is repealed, States have no<lb/> power to legislate on this subject.<lb/> 4.<lb/> The proposed repeal, along with some other incentives<lb/> and simplification of administrative procedures, is<lb/> expected to revive the stagnant housing industry. The<lb/> repeal will facilitate construction of dwelling units<lb/> both in the public and private sector and help<lb/> achievement of targets contemplated under National<lb/> Agenda for Governance. The repeal will not, however,<lb/> affect vesting of any vacant land under subsection<lb/> (3) of Section 10 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and<lb/> Regulation) Act, 1976 the possession of which has<lb/> been taken over by the State Governments. It will not<lb/> affect payments made to the State Governments for<lb/> exemptions. The exemptions granted under Section 20<lb/> of the Act will continue to be operative. The amounts<lb/> paid out by the State Governments will become<lb/> refundable before restoration of the land to the<lb/> former owners.<lb/> 5.<lb/> The Bill also seeks to facilitate land assembly and a<lb/> flexible regime for administering urban land to suit<lb/> the varying local conditions based on State level<lb/> legislations or requirements.&quot;<lb/> 53<lb/> If one peruses clause 4 of the Statement of objects and<lb/> reasons carefully and particularly the part where the intent is not to affect<lb/> by repeal the exemption under Section 20 of the Principal Act will and<lb/> that continues to be operative. After adopting the Repeal Act, the States<lb/> have a freedom to legislate on the same subject as is clear from Clause 3<lb/> of the Statement of Objects and Reasons to the Repeal Act. That intent<lb/> and purpose is not achieved or served by a mere insertion of clause (a) of<lb/> subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. It is, therefore, that the<lb/> Legislature did not exhaust itself and added clause (b) and that too to<lb/> subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act and by inserting the words<lb/> of wide import. It is with an intent of not affecting the exemptions<lb/> granted, but continuing them so also preserving their validity that clause<lb/> (b) has been so worded. In clause (b) not only the Legislature has saved<lb/> the validity of exemption order or any action taken thereunder, but has<lb/> protected or saved this validity notwithstanding anything to the contrary<lb/> held by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Legislature was aware that<lb/> the exemptions have been granted under Section 20 across the country by<lb/> several State Governments in exercise of their powers to exempt the<lb/> excess vacant lands from applicability of ChapterIII of the Principal Act.<lb/> These exemption orders have been passed bearing in mind the location of<lb/> excess vacant land, the purpose for which it is used or intended to be<lb/> used and such other relevant factors as the circumstances of the case may<lb/> require. The power to exempt has been exercised after the Government<lb/> reached this satisfaction and further that it is necessary and expedient in<lb/> the public interest so to do. Under clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section<lb/> 20, therefore, exemption to the excess vacant lands from the provisions of<lb/> ChapterIII is not to benefit the land holder as is urged before us. It is to<lb/> uphold and promote the larger public interest particularly of providing<lb/> affordable living accommodation and for those who are in a poor state<lb/> and entitled to public assistance. The Legislature was aware that<lb/> exemption orders have also been passed in some cases to relieve the<lb/> hardship to the persons holding excess vacant land on the requisite<lb/> satisfaction reached by the Government. That satisfaction is that unless<lb/> the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit held by such person is not<lb/> exempted from the provisions of ChapterIII undue hardship would be<lb/> caused to such person. The Legislature was equally aware while enacting<lb/> the Repeal Act that several exemption orders under clauses (a) and (b)<lb/> have been passed with conditions attached to them. The conditions may<lb/> be of imposition of penalties for delay in completion and implementation<lb/> of a housing project or scheme. The conditions imposed may interalia<lb/> visit the person or holder with the consequence of withdrawal of the<lb/> exemption and forfeiture of the amounts paid or deposited. Such<lb/> conditional orders of exemption are in force and not withdrawn because<lb/> the Government was of the opinion that the lands were being put to such<lb/> use as would serve the object and purpose in enacting the Principal Act.<lb/> That the State Governments were aware that the schemes of housing for<lb/> weaker sections in the society were promulgated and such excess vacant<lb/> lands were to be utilized to provide cheap and affordable housing to the<lb/> economically backward section or class of the society. The schemes of this<lb/> nature were under several stages of implementation. The houses or<lb/> tenements in such schemes or in housing projects earmarked for these<lb/> sections of the society, were to be handed over or were to be taken over so<lb/> as to reach the ultimate beneficiaries. It is with these objects and peculiar<lb/> facts and circumstances of each case that the State allowed the exemption<lb/> to remain in force. That at appropriate stages the extensions to the<lb/> exemption orders have been granted. Therefore, if the exemption is<lb/> granted firstly in public interest and secondly to relieve the undue<lb/> hardship, then, such exemption orders being interfered with by the courts<lb/> or struck down or quashed would cause serious prejudice and loss to the<lb/> deprived sections of the society. When these states of affairs are to the<lb/> knowledge of the Legislature, then, it is not possible to accept the<lb/> contentions of Mr.Naphade that clauses (b) and (c) of subsection (1) of<lb/> Section 3 of the Repeal Act are only added as and by way of abundant<lb/> caution. We cannot attribute to the Legislature such surplusage.<lb/> 54<lb/> The validity of exemption order is saved so as to ensure that<lb/> the same serves the purpose for which it is granted. If that is what the<lb/> Legislature had in mind, then, it is futile to suggest that the Legislature<lb/> has left unaffected by repeal only the validity of the exemption order, but<lb/> not its conditions. The argument that the conditions on which the<lb/> exemption order is based or passed are no longer valid, but it is only the<lb/> exemption order whose validity is saved, is required to be stated only for<lb/> being rejected. While canvassing such an argument the counsel lost sight<lb/> of clause (c) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. If as a<lb/> condition for grant of exemption any payment has to be made to the State<lb/> Government, then, the repeal of the Principal Act was not to affect such<lb/> payment or condition under which the same is made. The insertion of the<lb/> words &quot;as a condition for granting exemption&quot; in clause (c) of subsection<lb/> (1) of Section 3 would demonstrate the legislative intent. If the payment<lb/> made to the State Government as a condition for granting exemption and<lb/></figure>

			<p>which may be incorporated in the exemption order is saved, then, there is<lb/> no warrant to exclude from the provision in question the validity of other<lb/> conditions in the exemption order. The entire order of exemption together<lb/> with the conditions subject to which it has been granted is thus saved.<lb/></p>

			<p>That is because the Legislature was aware that the Principal Act was a<lb/> social legislation. That its misuse and abuse by some sectors resulting in<lb/> laudable social objective being not achieved that its repeal was<lb/> necessitated. However, despite the repeal the validity of the exemption<lb/> order or any action taken thereunder and notwithstanding anything to the<lb/> contrary in any order of the court has been expressly saved. That could<lb/> never have been inserted and merely to save the validity of the exemption<lb/> order on paper. The validity of the order is saved so as not to affect the<lb/> legal consequences of such valid order. To save them and the order as a<lb/> whole together with the conditions incorporated therein that Section 3(1)<lb/> (b) and (c) has been inserted in the Repeal Act. By that the State&apos;s powers<lb/> incidental and ancillary to the power to exempt can thus, be exercised<lb/> and despite the repeal. The exemption order, validity of which has been<lb/> saved, can, therefore, be enforced, so also, its terms and conditions. These<lb/> terms and conditions may have been incorporated simply to reaffirm that<lb/> the power to exempt which is conferred in the highest executive<lb/> functionary in the State, namely, Government is presumed to be exercised<lb/></p>

			<figure>for public good and in public interest. The exercise of such powers is,<lb/> therefore, presumed to be bonafide and for achieving the object and<lb/> purpose for which it is conferred. It is with these presumptions and which<lb/> were always present to the Legislature that the validity of exemption<lb/> order has been saved. Having said that and also saving the payment or<lb/> monetary aspect related to the exemption, it was not necessary for the<lb/> Parliament to then spell out separately all the legal consequences flowing<lb/> from such valid order. Even otherwise, that there is no intention contrary<lb/> to what is spelled out by Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is,<lb/> therefore, apparent. There is no substance in the argument of the<lb/> Petitioners that only the exemption order is saved, but not its terms and<lb/> conditions and further by not referring to subsection (2) of Section 20<lb/> the State&apos;s power to withdraw the exemption is taken away by repeal of<lb/> the Principal Act. The argument is that the power to withdraw the<lb/> exemption in terms of Section 20(2) of the Principal Act conferred in the<lb/> State cannot be exercised because of repeal of the Principal Act. This<lb/> argument is premised on the fact that once the State Government<lb/> withdraws the exemption order the only consequence could be that the<lb/> excess vacant land vests in the State under Section 10(3) of the Principal<lb/> Act and that vesting cannot take place after repeal of the Principal Act.<lb/> 55<lb/> In that regard if one notices Section 4 of the Repeal Act, that<lb/> would denote that the proceedings under Sections 11 to 14 of the<lb/> Principal Act are not affected by the abatement or the section in the<lb/> Repeal Act causing abatement of pending proceedings or proceedings<lb/> purported to be taken under the Principal Act. This itself throws light on<lb/> the intent of the Parliament in not completely and totally obliterating the<lb/> Principal Act. This itself shows that the Principal Act is not wiped out<lb/> from the statute book totally. Thus, after the deemed acquisition and<lb/> vesting of the vacant land in the State if possession thereof is taken,<lb/> recourse to these sections is permissible despite the Repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act.<lb/> 56<lb/> The fallacy in the above arguments can be demonstrated by<lb/> perusing Section 20 of the Principal Act. The difference in the language<lb/> in Section 19 and Section 20 is that Section 19 says that ChapterIII will<lb/> not apply to certain vacant lands whereas what Section 20 sets out is the<lb/> power to exempt the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit and which<lb/> power can be exercised by the State Government in cases covered by<lb/> clauses (a) and (b). That the said exemption can be withdrawn provided<lb/></figure>

			<p>the Government records a satisfaction that any condition subject to which<lb/> the exemption order is granted is not complied with by any person.<lb/></p>

			<p>Therefore, a conditional order of exemption can be withdrawn on<lb/> reaching this satisfaction and conclusion. However, Section 20 does not<lb/> mandate withdrawal, but confers a discretion in the Government to<lb/> withdraw the exemption order after giving a reasonable opportunity to<lb/> such person of making a representation against the proposed withdrawal.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is only when the power of withdrawal is exercised that the provisions of<lb/> ChapterIII will apply. The language of section is, therefore, clear<lb/> inasmuch as it is only when the exemption order is withdrawn that the<lb/> ChapterIII of the Principal Act applies to the excess vacant land. So long<lb/> as the exemption order is in force to protect its validity despite a contrary<lb/> court order a saving provision in the Repeal Act will have to be inserted.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Legislature was aware that not only the terms and conditions of the<lb/> exemption order need to be enforced, but if that order is acted upon by<lb/> parties the validity as a whole must be saved. That needs to be saved so as<lb/> to enable the State Government to apply the provisions of ChapterIII to<lb/> the excess vacant land covered by the exemption order and the terms and<lb/> conditions after it is noticed that the exemption is either misused or<lb/> misutilized or not acted upon so as to subserve the larger public interest.<lb/></p>

			<p>A breach or violation of some of its vital conditions may result in its<lb/> withdrawal and cancellation. If one way of applying ChapterIII is by<lb/> withdrawing the exemption order, then, the power to withdraw the same<lb/> which is implicit and inherent in the power to grant exemption is also<lb/> saved and not affected by repeal of the Principal Act. That is because the<lb/> vacant land held by a person is undisputedly in excess of ceiling limit. The<lb/> power to exempt is exercised when a person holds the vacant land in<lb/> excess of ceiling limit. That such power can be exercised even after<lb/></p>

			<figure>declaration under Section 10(3) of the Principal Act is further undisputed.<lb/> 57<lb/> In this backdrop if Section 20 is perused that confers a power<lb/> to exempt and it opens with a nonobstante clause, namely,<lb/> notwithstanding anything contained in any of the foregoing provisions of<lb/> this Chapter, namely, ChapterIII. The clause (a) of subsection (1) of<lb/> Section 20 refers to a person holding the vacant land in excess of ceiling<lb/> limit. If the State Government is satisfied suo motu or otherwise that<lb/> having regard to the location of such land, the purpose for which such<lb/> land is used or is proposed to be used and such other relevant factors as<lb/> the circumstances of the case may require and it is necessary or expedient<lb/> in the public interest to do so, then, the Government may, by order,<lb/> exempt, subject to such conditions as may be specified in the order, such<lb/> vacant land from the provisions of ChapterIII. Thus, what is required for<lb/> exemption firstly is that a person holds the vacant land in excess of ceiling<lb/> limit, satisfaction of the State Government suo motu or otherwise that<lb/> having regard to the location of such land, purpose for which such land is<lb/> being or is proposed to be used and such other relevant factors as the<lb/> circumstances of the case may require, it is necessary or expedient in<lb/> public interest so to do. Upon such satisfaction the Government may by<lb/> order, exempt the vacant land from the provisions of ChapterIII by<lb/> making an order and which could be conditional. The word &quot;Exemption&quot;<lb/> means free from an obligation or liability. In Advanced Law Lexicon by<lb/> P.Ramanatha Iyer, 3 rd Reprint 2007, the word &quot;exempt&quot; shows that a<lb/> person is put beyond the application of law. It means to give freedom<lb/> from liability, tax or duty like any exception. It is a privilege.<lb/> 58<lb/> The argument of Mr.Naphade overlooks the position that<lb/> when the power of exemption has to be exercised notwithstanding<lb/> anything contained in any of the foregoing provisions of this Chapter,<lb/> namely, ChapterIII, then, even Section 10 is included therein. Therefore,<lb/> the land may have been notified in terms of subsection (3) of Section 10,<lb/> yet the holder of such vacant land and which is in excess of ceiling limit<lb/> can seek the Government&apos;s intervention and invoke the powers conferred<lb/> in the State Government vide Section 20(1). Similarly, by clause (b) of<lb/> subsection (1) of Section 20 where any person holds the vacant land in<lb/> excess of ceiling limit and the State Government on its own motion or<lb/> otherwise is satisfied that the application of the provisions of Chapter III<lb/> would cause undue hardship to such person, that the Government may by<lb/> an order, exempt, subject to such conditions as may be specified in the<lb/> order, such vacant land from the provisions of this Chapter. However, the<lb/> proviso clarifies that no orders under this clause, namely, clause (b) shall<lb/> be made unless the reasons for the same are recorded in writing.<lb/> 59<lb/> If the argument of Mr.Naphade is accepted, that would mean<lb/> that the powers to exempt cannot be exercised when the land is already<lb/> vested in the State in terms of Section 10. That the power under Section<lb/> 20(2) for withdrawal of exemption cannot be exercised after repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act, presupposes that exemption itself cannot be granted after<lb/> vesting takes place. Mr.Naphade and other counsel contend that effect of<lb/> withdrawal of exemption is to vest the vacant land in the State in terms of<lb/></figure>

			<p>Section 10 and after repeal that vesting is not possible or that even if the<lb/> land is vested the further steps cannot be taken. Thus, the argument is<lb/> premised on the basis that no application for exemption under Section 20<lb/> can be filed by a person who holds the vacant land in excess of ceiling<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">limit once it vests in the State. Precisely such an argument was canvassed<lb/> before the Honourable Supreme Court and rejected in the case of Special<lb/> Officer &amp; Competent Authority, Urban Land Ceilings, Hyderabad v/s P.S. Rao<lb/> reported in AIR 2000 SC 843 (see paragraphs 6 to 10).<lb/> 60<lb/> Therefore, once the power of exemption can be exercised<lb/> after the excess vacant land has vested in the State, then, equally the<lb/> power to withdraw the exemption can also be exercised in case of such<lb/> vacant land.<lb/> 61<lb/> In the case of Smt.Darothi Clare Parreira v/s State of<lb/> Maharashtra reported in AIR 1996 SC 2553 this is what is held by the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court:<lb/> &quot;5. Having considered the respective contentions, the<lb/> question that arises for consideration is : Whether<lb/> publication of the notification under Section 10(3) of<lb/> the Act in the Gazette is in accordance with law? No<lb/> doubt, this question was not squarely put in issue before<lb/> the High Court in the manner in which Shri Naik and<lb/> Shri Bobde have posed before us.</figure>

			<p>Having considered the<lb/> scheme of the Act, we find that there is no force in their<lb/> contentions. It is true that Section 3 postulates that<lb/> except as otherwise provided in the Act, on and from the<lb/> commencement of the Act, no person shall be entitled to<lb/> hold any vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit in the<lb/> territories to which the Act applies under subsection (2)<lb/> of Section 3. Sections 6 to 10 prescribe the procedure for<lb/> determination of the excess urban land. Admittedly after<lb/> filing of statement, opportunity had been given they had<lb/> been heard and excess land over the ceiling limit had<lb/> been determined. Pursuant to the decision taken under<lb/> Section 10(1) of the Act, objections came to be filed<lb/> under Section 10(<ref type="formula">2</ref>) and objections also were considered<lb/> and an opportunity was given before their consideration<lb/> and objections came to be rejected. The question then is :<lb/></p>

			<figure>whether the competent authority has to await the<lb/> decision under Sections 20 and 21 before declaring and<lb/> publishing the excess land under Section 10(3) by a<lb/> notification in the Gazette. The scheme of the Act does<lb/> indicate that until the date of the publication in the<lb/> Gazette prescribing a date on and from which the excess<lb/> land stands vested in the State, the owner continues to<lb/> be the owner of the excess land and entitled to remain in<lb/> possession thereof. On publication of the notification<lb/> under Section 10(3) and after putting a date from<lb/> which the land stands vested in the State and after<lb/> publication of the notification in the Gazette and on and<lb/> from the date mentioned therein, the excess vacant land<lb/> stands vested in the State free from all encumbrances,<lb/> subject to the decision in appeal, if any, filed according<lb/> to law.<lb/> 6. The previous owner stands divested of right, title<lb/> and interest in the land subject to the right to make<lb/> application provided under Sections 20 and 21. It is<lb/> difficult to accept the contention of the learned Counsel<lb/> for the appellants that the competent authority has no<lb/> power to have the notification under Section 10(3)<lb/> published in the Gazette until the application either<lb/> under Section 20 or 21 is disposed of. The very language<lb/> of Sections 20 and 21 and the exercise of the power<lb/> thereunder would arise only when the land stands vested<lb/> in the Government. The power of examination and<lb/> exemption would arise only when the Government<lb/> becomes the owner and the erstwhile owner seeks to<lb/> obviate the hardships under Section 20 or to subserve<lb/> the housing scheme for weaker sections under Section 21<lb/> as envisaged thereunder. Thereat, the Government is<lb/> required to consider whether the proposals made by the<lb/> erstwhile owner for undertaking the scheme as envisaged<lb/> under Section 21 or hardships as envisaged under<lb/> Section 20 for exemption would merit consideration. In<lb/> this case, admittedly, the application under Section 20<lb/> came to be filed though that was suppressed before the<lb/> High Court and this Court and came to be dismissed<lb/> before notification under Section 10(3) of the Act was<lb/> published. It also appears, as stated earlier, that<lb/> application under Section 21 was filed on March 29,<lb/> 1979, the date on which the appellants had filed the<lb/> writ petition in the High Court. It would, therefore, be<lb/> seen that the application came to be filed much after the<lb/> date of the vesting and publication of the notification<lb/> under Section 10(3) of the Act. The effect of the vesting<lb/> is not contingent upon filing an application for disposal<lb/> under either Section 20 or 21. We do not go into the<lb/> correctness of the order passed by the Government under<lb/> Section 21 for the reason that it would be open to the<lb/> Government and the Government have stated in their<lb/> order that they have already decided to allot the land for<lb/> another equally efficacious public purpose. Therefore, we<lb/> cannot sit over the decision taken by the Government<lb/> holding it illegal.&quot;<lb/> 62<lb/> Following this view and principle in a later decision reported<lb/> in Special Officer &amp; Competent Authority, Urban Land Ceilings, Hyderabad<lb/> and others v/s P.S. Rao reported in AIR 2000 SC 843, the Honourable<lb/> Supreme Court held as under:<lb/></figure>

			<p>&quot;6.<lb/></p>

			<p>In our view, it is only after the excess land is actually<lb/> determined under Section 10 that a person can know<lb/> the exact extent of excess land in his holding and<lb/> think of asking for exemption. There may, of course,<lb/> be some cases where the extent is so large that a<lb/> claimant may be able to seek exemption even at the<lb/> time of filing the declaration but even in those cases,<lb/> he cannot be definite about the actual extent of excess<lb/> land.<lb/> 7.<lb/></p>

			<p>Learned Counsel, however, relied upon the definition<lb/> of the words &quot;to hold&quot; in Subsection (1) of Section<lb/> (<ref type="formula">2</ref>) to contend that once the final declaration is made<lb/> and the excess vacant land has vested in the State, the<lb/> person does not &apos;hold&apos; the excess land and no<lb/> application for exemption under Section 20 can be<lb/> filed since Section 20 contemplates filing an<lb/> application by a person who &quot;holds vacant land in<lb/> excess of the ceiling area&quot;. Section 2(1) states:<lb/> &quot;unless<lb/> the<lb/> context<lb/> otherwise<lb/> requires,.....</p>

			<head>... &apos;to hold&apos; with its grammatical<lb/> variations, in relation to any vacant land means:<lb/></head>

			<p>(i)<lb/> to own such land; or<lb/> (ii) to possess such land as owner or as<lb/> tenant or as mortgagee or under an irrevocable power<lb/> of attorney or under a hire purchase agreement or<lb/> partly in one of the said capacities and partly in any<lb/> other of the said capacity or capacities.<lb/> 8.<lb/></p>

			<p>The definition of the words &quot;to hold&quot; in Section 2(<ref type="formula">1</ref>)<lb/> is relevant at the time of computation of the ceiling<lb/> area and at the stage of the preliminary<lb/> determination of excess and the final determination,<lb/> under Sections 8 and 9 of the Act, the excess is to be<lb/> determined on the basis of the land permitted by the<lb/> Act to be held by a person.<lb/> 9.<lb/></p>

			<p>But, the word &quot;hold&quot; in Section 20(1)(a) or Section<lb/> 20(1)(b) cannot, in our opinion, have the same<lb/> meaning that can be attributed to it as in Section<lb/> 2(1). The very definition in Section 2(1) states that<lb/> the subsection applies unless there is anything in the<lb/> context which suggests a different meaning to be<lb/> given. In our view, in the context of Section 20(1)(a)<lb/> and Section 20(1)(b), the definition given in Section<lb/> 2(1) cannot be applied. The reason is that such a<lb/> construction will make Section 20 unworkable and<lb/> otiose. We have pointed out above that it is not<lb/> possible to make any meaningful application for<lb/> exemption under Section 20(1)(a) or (b) unless the<lb/> exact quantum of excess is determined under Section<lb/> 10 after following the various provisions of the Act<lb/> relating to statutory deductions and mode of<lb/> computation. If the contention of the State referred to<lb/> above is to be accepted, then the peculiar position will<lb/> be as follows. As stated by us, before the excess is<lb/> determined, a person will not able to seek exemption<lb/> because he does not know what is the actual excess<lb/> land held and once the excess is determined, he<lb/> cannot apply because he is not holding the excess<lb/> land. Thus, the entire object of Section 20 will be<lb/> frustrated. That is why we say that the definition of<lb/> the words to hold in Section 2(<ref type="formula">1</ref>) cannot be applied<lb/> in the context of Section 20(1)(a) or Section 20(1)<lb/> (b).<lb/> 10.<lb/></p>

			<p>We are, therefore, unable to accept the contention of<lb/> the learned Counsel for the State that an application<lb/> for exemption can be maintained only before the<lb/> excess is determined under Section 10. In our view,<lb/> the scheme of the Act is to the contrary</p>

			<figure>. The view<lb/> taken by the High Court following the decision of this<lb/> Court in T.R. Thandur v. Union of India, (1996) 3<lb/> SCC 690 : (1996 AIR SCW 1700 : AIR 1996 SC<lb/> 1643), Darothi Clare Parreira (Smt.) v. State of<lb/> Maharashtra, (1996) 9 SCC 633 : (1996 AIR SCW<lb/> 3179 : AIR 1996 SC 2553) and State of A. P.<lb/> represented by Secretary to Govt., Revenue<lb/> Department, Hyderabad v. Valluru Venkateswara<lb/> Rao, (1997) 3 Andh. LT 417 does not call for any<lb/> interference.&quot;<lb/> 63<lb/> Once this legal position is noticed we do not see as to how<lb/> absence of subsection (2) of Section 20 of the Principal Act in clause (b)<lb/></figure>

			<p>of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act would enable us to hold<lb/> that the power to withdraw the exemption is not saved. It is possible that<lb/> the power to withdraw the exemption may not be exercised in every case.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, when the State exercises the power to exempt the vacant land<lb/></p>

			<figure>in excess of ceiling limit and which has already vested in it, then, there is<lb/> no impediment in withdrawing the exemption from applicability of<lb/> ChapterIII of the Principal Act in the case of such lands. The legal<lb/> position, therefore, cannot be otherwise than what is held in the decisions<lb/> of the Honourable Supreme Court and referred by us above and both of<lb/> which have been rendered after the judgment in the case of T.R.Thandur<lb/> v/s Union of India reported in (1996) 3 SCC 690. The argument of the<lb/> learned Senior Counsel is that it would be inconsistent and contrary to<lb/> the legislative intent if we hold that the power to withdraw the exemption<lb/> conferred vide Section 20(2) of the Principal Act is saved despite the<lb/> repeal. That would mean that possession of such lands can be taken post<lb/> vesting and that is permissible even after repeal of the Principal Act. The<lb/> argument is that it would be incongruous and even absurd to hold that<lb/> the power to take possession conferred vide Section 10(5) and 10(6) of<lb/> the Principal Act is saved despite repeal of the Principal Act. It is urged<lb/> that same would make clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the<lb/> Repeal Act wholly redundant and even meaningless. We must at once<lb/> clarify that clause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act is<lb/> not dealing with only exempted lands. It is dealing with all excess vacant<lb/> lands and which are subject matter of the declaration under Section 10(3)<lb/> of the Principal Act. Their vesting will not be affected only if possession<lb/> thereof is taken. Thus, clause (a) itself clarifies that the vesting of such<lb/> lands would not be affected by repeal if their possession is taken. That<lb/> only means that the Legislature was fully aware of the legal consequences<lb/> of declaration under Section 10(3) of the Principal Act. That provides for<lb/> deemed acquisition of the excess vacant land and their vesting in the<lb/> State free from all encumbrances. They vest accordingly, but since<lb/> possession thereof has not been taken that the Repeal Act enacts a<lb/> provision whereunder these lands can be restored to any person provided<lb/> he complies with subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. In the<lb/> case of the lands which are subject matter of a valid exemption order and<lb/> validity of which is not affected even by any court&apos;s order to the contrary<lb/> and equally any action taken thereunder is not affected by repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act and is saved though the same may not have been upheld by<lb/> the Court, then, the intent and purpose is not to allow any person holding<lb/> the excess vacant land and which is already vested in the State to escape<lb/> the legal consequences resulting from the order of exemption. If that<lb/> order is passed in order to subserve public interest and to uphold it and to<lb/> relieve undue hardship, then, such an order of exemption which may be<lb/> conditional visits the person with consequences. It is not an absolute right<lb/> or privilege as is claimed. It may be a conditional exemption. It may allow<lb/> the person to use the land for the stated purpose, but that is not relieving<lb/> him or the land from the condition or obligation imposed by Law and<lb/> equally any liability. It is not an advantage or benefit, if at all, which could<lb/> be enjoyed absolutely. It is to fulfill the object or purpose of the user and<lb/> to act in public interest or to avoid undue hardship. The applicability of<lb/> Chapter III being expressly admitted, but seeking to avert the<lb/> consequences of such applicability in exceptional circumstances that the<lb/> request to exempt is considered and granted. The power in that behalf is<lb/> to be exercised sparingly and as an exception. It is not a rule. It is a<lb/> corresponding right of the State and to be exercised to uphold larger<lb/> Public Interest. Thus, it is not a one sided right or privilege. It is not<lb/> relieving the person from the legal consequences of the power to exempt<lb/> and more so, if it is a conditional order. It is to safeguard public interest<lb/> that such power is exercised and in a given case conditionally. If relieving<lb/> somebody on account of his hardship or exempting the vacant land for a<lb/> specific purpose by holding in abeyance the applicability of provisions of<lb/> ChapterIII is the aim, then, that person cannot claim benefit or<lb/> advantage in himself much less in absolute terms. It is a relief granted to<lb/> relieve him from undue hardship caused by applicability of the provisions<lb/> of ChapterIII. If that power under clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section<lb/> 20 is exercised subject to such conditions, as can be imposed by the State<lb/> bearing in mind the object and purpose of the Principal Act and if they<lb/></figure>

			<p>are specified in the order, then, that can hardly be said to be an absolute<lb/> right or privilege. That is a relief together with or appended with an<lb/> obligation and liability. If that is incurred at the time of exercise of power<lb/> of exemption, then, the Government can very well enforce the power to<lb/> exempt by withdrawing the said order and equally without withdrawing it<lb/> enforce the terms and conditions therein despite the repeal. It is for that<lb/> purpose that clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3 is enacted. That is<lb/> also recognition of the legal position that by exempting something from<lb/> the provisions of an Act it is always understood that one is subjected to<lb/> the Act or law. It is applicable but the exemption means one does not<lb/> suffer the legal consequences so long as the exemption is operative.<lb/></p>

			<head>64<lb/></head>

			<p>The Legislature was aware that the excess vacant land may<lb/> have been exempted bearing in mind its location and the purpose for<lb/> which it is being used or proposed to be used. Clause (a) of subsection<lb/></p>

			<p>(1) of Section 20 is the power to exempt the excess vacant land from<lb/> applicability of the provisions of ChapterIII and same is exercised<lb/> because it is necessary and expedient in public interest to do so.<lb/></p>

			<p>Therefore, it is futile to urge that a person holding any vacant land in<lb/> excess of ceiling limit derives advantage or benefit when such power is<lb/> exercised by the State qua the excess vacant land or vacant land in excess<lb/> of the ceiling limit, more so conditionally. Once the nature of the power is<lb/> borne in mind, then, we do not see how repeal of the Principal Act will<lb/> not save, but will affect the exercise of all powers and as we have held<lb/></p>

			<figure>above which are incidental and ancillary to the main power of granting<lb/> exemption. Thus, the conclusion can be reached and safely that the State<lb/> exempts the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit from applicability of<lb/> ChapterIII of the Principal Act in public interest in terms of clause (a) or<lb/> bearing in mind the undue hardship caused to the person holding it<lb/> exempts it from applicability of the same Chapter and in both events if<lb/> the power is exercised also to pass a conditional order or grant<lb/> conditional exemption, then, the right, if any, created in relation to such<lb/> land in favour of the person holding it is not absolute and it is conditional<lb/> upon fulfillment of the obligations and liabilities attached to it. If these<lb/> conditions are not satisfied, but rather breached and violated, then, the<lb/> State&apos;s power to withdraw the exemption survives the repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act in all cases including where the power to exempt under<lb/> Section 20(1) of the Principal Act is exercised post vesting of the lands in<lb/> the State. It will also survive in those cases where the power is exercised<lb/> so as to exempt the excess vacant land in terms of the same provision, but<lb/> in relation to which the unconditional or conditional exemption order is<lb/> still in force and not withdrawn. In either events the State can proceed<lb/> despite repeal of the Principal Act because that power of the State<lb/> survives the repeal. That power survives because despite the repeal the<lb/> State can enforce the exemption orders as the persons holding such lands<lb/> do not derive or get an absolute right or advantage or benefit and that is<lb/> subject to the liabilities and obligations incurred by them. These survive<lb/> the repeal of the Principal Act because had the intent was not to so<lb/> protect or save, the Parliament would not have saved the validity of the<lb/> exemption order or any action taken thereunder. Any action taken<lb/> thereunder is also valid together with the exemption order more so if the<lb/> action contemplates ensuring compliance with certain terms and<lb/> conditions of the exemption order such as obtaining open spaces and<lb/> amenities for the public, dwelling units so as to subserve larger public<lb/> interest. We cannot and do not intend to exhaust the power of the State<lb/> to enforce its order passed under Section 20(1)(a) and (b) of the<lb/> Principal Act in the light of the Repeal Act. Further, the nature and ambit<lb/> of the conditions may be such that their noncompliance and breach,<lb/> beyond a certain period and intentionally would visit the person with<lb/> either withdrawal of the exemption itself or any other penalty/ damages<lb/> in addition to complying with the terms and obligations. Such obligations,<lb/> liabilities and conditions voluntarily incurred and invited cannot be said<lb/> to be invalid or inoperative. They bind the parties. If the State can call<lb/> upon the person concerned to handover the tenements and units meant<lb/> for either weaker section or its nominees to it or to comply with other<lb/> such obligation and liability by legally permissible modes of compliance,<lb/></figure>

			<p>then, all such steps and measures survive the repeal and can be initiated<lb/> and taken to their logical end.<lb/></p>

			<head>65<lb/></head>

			<p>The order of exemption under Section 20(1) remains valid<lb/> would mean that a person continues to hold the vacant land in excess of<lb/> ceiling limit and to which none of the provisions in ChapterIII apply.<lb/></p>

			<p>ChapterIII confers some rights in the holder of excess vacant land as well.<lb/></p>

			<p>Those also cannot be exercised because the exemption order is valid and<lb/> continues to be so despite the repeal. Nothing is gained by such a<lb/> situation where the excess vacant land being exempted from the<lb/> provisions of ChapterIII so as to permit the usage of the land by the<lb/></p>

			<figure>holder or retain it as an exception, but neither the State being able to<lb/> enforce the conditions if any subject to which exemption is granted or to<lb/> withdraw the said exemption. Equally, the effect of the repeal being to<lb/> save the validity of the order granting exemption under Section 20(1) or<lb/> any action taken thereunder, the person in whose favour such exemption<lb/> is granted will not be able to do anything in relation to such vacant land<lb/> which except for the exemption may have vested already in the State by<lb/> virtue of Section 10(3). He then cannot move the State and seek any<lb/> payment for acquisition and vesting. Hence, when the Legislature had in<lb/> mind the saving clause as is carved out by section 3(1)(b) and (c), its<lb/> intent was not to take away any of the powers conferred in the State nor<lb/> exclude applicability of the provisions of ChapterIII of the ULC Act to<lb/> such an extent as would make it impossible for the person to seek<lb/> payment in terms of Sections 11 to 14 or to seek enforcement of such<lb/> conditions which are reciprocal and which are to be performed by both.<lb/> Just as the State would be unable to enforce the conditions on which<lb/> exemption is granted, equally the members of the public or person<lb/> holding the excess vacant land would not be able to enforce the<lb/> conditions which are incorporated therein so as to protect their interest.<lb/> Such situation can never be envisaged by the Parliament. Such situation<lb/> being created would render all the provisions of the Repeal Act<lb/> redundant. The intent as is clear from a harmonious reading of the Repeal<lb/> Act and in the backdrop of the aims and objects of the Principal Act is to<lb/> save the applicability of the provisions contained in ChapterIII to the<lb/> excess vacant lands which are subject matter of exemption under Section<lb/> 20(1). Section 3(1)(a) covers a situation where there is no exemption<lb/> order passed under Section 20(1)(a) and (b). That covers the vacant<lb/> lands which are not subject matter of any order of exemption or such<lb/> order being not in force on the date of the Repeal Act and in regard to<lb/> which the provisions contained in ChapterIII were always applicable.<lb/> Therefore, if the State does not complete the action in relation to these<lb/> lands by taking possession thereof, their mere vesting and deemed<lb/> acquisition by virtue of Section 10(3) is not saved. Section 3(1)(b) deals<lb/> with a separate and distinct situation and that is applicable to the lands<lb/> which are vacant and in excess of ceiling limit and in relation to which<lb/> the order of exemption under Section 20(1) has been passed.</figure>

			<figure type="table">The<lb/> applicability of ChapterIII in relation to such lands is, thus, ruled out and<lb/> so long as the exemption order is in force. If the order of exemption is<lb/> withdrawn the ChapterIII becomes applicable and all consequences<lb/> would follow.<lb/> 66<lb/> We must at once note that way back in the year 1990 in the<lb/> decision in the case of M/s Shantistar Builders v/s Narayan Khimalal<lb/> Totame reported in AIR 1990 SC 630, a Three Judge Bench of the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court had framed the guidelines so as to enable<lb/> construction over the exempted lands covered under Section 20 of the<lb/> Principal Act. That is to ensure compliance with the constitutional<lb/> mandate of shelter and guaranteed vide Article 21 of the Constitution of<lb/> India. In that decision, the Honourable Supreme Court held as under:<lb/> &quot;5.<lb/> Both Subsections 20 and 21 contain provisions that<lb/> if Government or the competent authority, as the case<lb/> may be, is satisfied that any of the conditions subject<lb/> to which exemption was granted is not complied with,<lb/> it shall be competent for it to withdraw the order<lb/> under Section 20 or declare such land to be excess<lb/> land under Section 21 and bring it within the<lb/> mischief of the statute.<lb/> 6.<lb/> In the instant case on January 11, 1978, on the basis<lb/> of an application made on 24th October, 1987, the<lb/> State Government made an order of exemption, the<lb/> salient portions of which are extracted for<lb/> convenience:<lb/> GOVERNMENT OF MAHARASHTRA<lb/> NO. HWE1077/XXXV<lb/> GENERAL ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT,<lb/> MANTRALAYA, BOMBAY400032.<lb/> 11TH JANUARY, 1978.<lb/> ORDER<lb/> WHEREAS (1) Shri Kumarpal Vadilal Shah (2)<lb/> Shri Navinchandra Vadilal Shah (3) Smt.<lb/> Champaben w/o Vadilal Shah (4) Shri Vasantlal<lb/> Vadilal Shah (5) Shri Babulal Vadilal Shah (6) Smt.<lb/> Pushpa Mangaldas Shah (7) Smt.

			<p>AND WHEREAS, the said persons have<lb/> mentioned in their application, that their Scheme of<lb/> construction of houses for Weaker Section will be<lb/> executed by them, through Messers STAR BUILDERS,<lb/> 302, Sharda Chambers, 15 New Marine Lines,<lb/> Bombay 20.<lb/></p>

			<p>NOW THEREFORE, in exercise of the powers<lb/> conferred by Subsection (1) of Section 20 of the said<lb/> Act, after having recorded in writing the reasons for<lb/> making this Order, the Government of Maharashtra<lb/> hereby exempts the said vacant lands, from the<lb/> provisions of Chapter III of the said Act, subject to the<lb/> following conditions viz.:<lb/> 1) The lands exempted under this exemption order<lb/> shall be used by the said persons for the purpose of<lb/> housing for weaker section comprising 1700<lb/> (seventeen thousand) tenements consisting of 3,000<lb/> (three thousand) tenements of plinth area, not<lb/> exceeding 20.00 sq. metrs., 10,000 (ten thousand)<lb/> tenements of plinth area, not exceeding 30.00 sq.<lb/> metrs., 3,000 (three thousand) tenements of plinth<lb/> area, not exceeding 44.00 sq. mtrs. and 1,000 (one<lb/> thousand) tenements of plinth area, not exceeding<lb/> 57.00 sq. mtrs. Any change made in the user of the<lb/> land shall amount to a breach of this condition.<lb/></p>

			<p>2) The said persons shall make full utilization of the<lb/> land so exempted for the purpose aforesaid, by<lb/> constructing on the land the 17,000 tenements as<lb/> specified in the condition No. 2 above. The said<lb/> persons shall commence construction of the tenements<lb/> within a period of one year from the date of this<lb/> exemption order and shall complete the construction<lb/> work within a period of five years from that date,<lb/> failing which the exemption shall stand withdrawn. If<lb/> only a part of land is utilized and a part remains<lb/> vacant at the end of period of five years, exemption<lb/> shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.<lb/></p>

			<p>3) The final selling price, all inclusive of each of the<lb/> dwelling units shall not exceed Rs.50/ (Rs. fifty only)<lb/> per sq. ft. of plinth area. Each tenement is to be<lb/> provided with all the amenities as mentioned in the<lb/></p>

			<figure>Schedule &apos;B&apos; attached to this Order and as mentioned<lb/> in the State Government Scheme, announced on 2nd<lb/> October, 1977 for construction of houses for Weaker<lb/> Sections of Society on surplus vacant land by the land<lb/> holder. The details of construction shall not be<lb/> inferior to those already mentioned in the<lb/> application. The actual construction and the quality<lb/> of construction, will be subject to the building<lb/> regulations of the local authorities, and subject to<lb/> such other conditions as may be imposed, by the<lb/> Collector of Thane, Town Planning Authority and the<lb/> B.M.R.D.A and other Statutory Regulation.<lb/> 4) to 6) ....<lb/> 7) The said persons shall not transfer the exempted<lb/> lands (with or without buildings thereon) or any part<lb/> thereof to any other persons, except for the purpose of<lb/> mortgage in favour of any financial institution,<lb/> specified in Subsection (1) of Section 19 of the said<lb/> Act, for raising finances for the purposes of<lb/> construction or any one of the tenements mentioned<lb/> above. Breach of this condition shall mean that the<lb/> exemption granted under this Order stands<lb/> withdrawn.<lb/> 8) &amp; 9) ....<lb/> 10) The construction work under the scheme, will be<lb/> further subject to all other conditions incorporated in<lb/> the Scheme of Weaker Section Housing announced by<lb/> the State Government on 2nd October, 1977 and<lb/> subject to such other conditions as may be imposed by<lb/> the local authorities, Collector of Thane, Town<lb/> Planning Authorities and the B.M.R.D</figure>

			<figure type="table">.A.<lb/> 11) If at any time, the State Government is satisfied<lb/> that there is a breach of any of the condition<lb/> mentioned in this Order, it shall be competent for the<lb/> State Government by order to withdraw the<lb/> exemption from the date specified in the Order:<lb/> 7.<lb/> ….....<lb/> 8.<lb/> ….....<lb/> 9.<lb/> Basic needs of man have traditionally been accepted<lb/> to be threefood, clothing and shelter. The right to life<lb/> is guaranteed in any civilized society. That would take<lb/> within its sweep the right to food, the right to<lb/> clothing, the right to decent environment and a<lb/> reasonable accommodation to live in. The difference<lb/> between the need of an animal and a human being<lb/> for shelter has to be kept in view. For the animal it is<lb/> the bare protection of the body; for a human being it<lb/> has to be a suitable accommodation which would<lb/> allow him to grow in every aspect physical, mental<lb/> and intellectual. The Constitution aims at ensuring<lb/> fuller development of every child. That would be<lb/> possible only if the child is in a proper home. It is not<lb/> necessary that every citizen must be ensured of living<lb/> in a well built comfortable house but a reasonable<lb/> home particularly for people in India can even be<lb/> mudbuilt thatched house or a mud built fireproof<lb/> accommodation.<lb/> 10.<lb/> With the increase of population and the shift of the<lb/> rural masses to urban areas over the decades the<lb/> ratio of poor people without houses in the urban<lb/> areas has rapidly increased. This is a feature which<lb/> has become more perceptible after independence.<lb/> Apart from the fact that people in search of work<lb/> move to urban agglomerations, availability of<lb/> amenities and living conveniences also attract people<lb/> to move from rural areas to cities. Industrialisation is<lb/> equally responsible for concentration of population<lb/> around industries. These are feature which are<lb/> mainly responsible for increase in the homeless urban<lb/> population. Millions of people today live on the<lb/> pavements of different cities of India and a greater<lb/> number live animal like existence in jhuggis.<lb/> 11.<lb/> The Planning Commission took note of this situation<lb/> and was struck by the fact that there was no<lb/> corresponding rise in accommodation with the growth<lb/> of population and the shift of the rural people to the<lb/> cities. The growing realisation of this disparity led to<lb/> the passing of the Act and acquisition of vacant sites<lb/> for purposes of housing. Considerable attention has<lb/> been given in recent years to increasing<lb/> accommodation though whatever has been done is<lb/> not at all adequate. The quick growth of urban<lb/> population overshadows all attempts of increasing<lb/> accommodation. Sections 20 and 21 of the Act vest<lb/> power in the State Governments to exempt vacant<lb/> sites from vesting under the Act for purposes of being<lb/> taken over if housing schemes are undertaken by<lb/> owners of vacant urban lands. Section 21 specifically<lb/> emphasis upon weaker sections of the people. That<lb/> term finds place in Article 46 of the Constitution and<lb/> Section 21 uses the same language. &apos;Weaker sections&apos;<lb/> have, however, not been defined either in the<lb/> Constitution or in the Act itself. An attempt was made<lb/> in the Constitution Assembly to provide a definition<lb/> but was given up. Attempts have thereafter been<lb/> made from time to time to provide such definition but<lb/> on account of controversies which arise once the<lb/> exercise is undertaken, there has been no success. A<lb/> suggestion for introducing economic criterion for<lb/> explaining the term was made in the approach to the<lb/> Seventh Five Year Plan (19851990) brought out by<lb/> the Planning Commission and approved by the<lb/> National Development Council and the Union<lb/> Government. A lot of controversy was raised in<lb/> Parliament and the attempt, was dropped. In the<lb/> absence of a definition perhaps a proper guideline<lb/> could be indicated but no serious attention has been<lb/> devoted to this aspect.<lb/> 12.<lb/> Members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled<lb/> Tribes have ordinarily been accepted as belonging to<lb/> the weaker section. Attempt to bring in the test of<lb/> economic means has often been tried but no guideline<lb/> has been evolved. Undoubtedly, apart from the<lb/> members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled<lb/> Tribes, there would be millions of other citizens who<lb/> would also belong to the weaker sections. The<lb/> Constitution maker intended all citizens of India<lb/> belonging to the weaker sections to be benefited when<lb/> Article 46 was incorporated in the Constitution.<lb/> Parliament in adopting the same language in Section<lb/> 21 of the Act also intended people of all weaker<lb/> sections to have the advantage. It is, therefore,<lb/> appropriate that the Central Government should<lb/> come forward with an appropriate guideline to<lb/> indicate who would be included within weaker<lb/> sections of the society.<lb/> 13.<lb/> In recent years on account of erosion of the value of<lb/> the rupee, rampant prevalence of black money and<lb/> dearth of urban land, the value of such land has gone<lb/> up skyhigh. It has become impossible for any<lb/> member of the weaker sections to have residential<lb/> accommodation anywhere and much less in urban<lb/> areas. Since a reasonable residence is an<lb/> indispensable necessity for fulfilling the Constitutional<lb/> goal in the matter of development of man and should<lb/> be taken as included in &apos;life&apos; in Article 21, greater<lb/> social control is called for and exemptions granted<lb/> under Sections 20 and 21 should have to be<lb/> appropriately monitored to have the fullest benefit of<lb/> the beneficial legislation. We, therefore, command to<lb/> the Central Government to prescribe appropriate<lb/> guidelines laying down the true scope of the term<lb/> &apos;weaker sections of the society&apos; so that everyone<lb/> charged with administering the statute would find it<lb/> convenient to implement the same.<lb/> 14.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Respondents who claim to belong to weaker sections<lb/> of the society maintain that they are entitled to<lb/> allotment of 262 plus 558 flats. It is true that<lb/> initially the claim was for a smaller number but the<lb/> number has gone up when further petitions were filed<lb/> before the High Court. There is, perhaps, some basis<lb/> in the objection of the builders as also the stand taken<lb/> by the State Government before us that the<lb/> respondents&apos; claim should undergo in depth scrutiny.<lb/></p>

			<p>We direct that the genuineness of the claim should be<lb/> scrutinised in accordance with the guidelines which<lb/> shall now be indicated but in the event of the claims<lb/> being found tenable, the builders shall have a<lb/> direction to provide accommodation in terms of the<lb/> scheme for those who are found to be acceptable. To<lb/> ensure implementation of this direction the builders<lb/> are called upon not to make any commitment or<lb/> allotments for flats until the claims of the 1420<lb/> applicants are scrutinised and allotment of<lb/> accommodation for such number of persons as are<lb/> found entitled is provided.<lb/> 15.<lb/></p>

			<p>We shall now proceed to deal with the guidelines</p>

			<figure>. The<lb/> Government of Maharashtra by the Resolution No.<lb/> WLC1090/3422 (D XIII) in the Housing and<lb/> Special Assistance Department have laid down the<lb/> guidelines. We shall refer to the preamble and some of<lb/> the provisions thereof. The preamble indicates:<lb/> &quot;Close and effective monitoring of the<lb/> implementation of weaker sections housing schemes<lb/> sanctioned under Sections 20 and 21 of the Urban<lb/> Land (Ceiling &amp; Regulation) Act, 1976, is one of the<lb/> most important duties of the competent authorities<lb/> who have been entrusted with the task of<lb/> implementing the Urban Land Ceiling Act, 1976, in<lb/> the nine urban agglomerations in Maharashtra, viz.<lb/> Bombay, Pune, Thane, Ulhasnagar, Kolhapur,<lb/> Solapur, Sangli, Nasik and Nagpur. Competent<lb/> authorities are required to ensure that construction of<lb/> flats for the weaker sections of the society on land<lb/> exempted under Sections 20 and 21 is completed<lb/> within the timeframe stipulated in the exemption<lb/> order. They are also required to ensure that the terms<lb/> and conditions of the exemption order such as issue of<lb/> advertisements, giving particulars of the schemes, sale<lb/> of fiats at the prices approved by government, sizes of<lb/> flats, noneligibility of persons who already own a<lb/> dwelling unit in the same urban agglomeration to<lb/> purchase a flat from such schemes, handing over of<lb/> land affected by development plan, reservations to the<lb/> planning authority etc. are all complied with.<lb/> Physical implementation of Weaker sections housing<lb/> schemes in Maharashtra is one of the important<lb/> issues on the agenda at the meetings of competent<lb/> authorities convened by the Housing Department<lb/> periodically. General and special instructions<lb/> regarding effective monitoring of implementation of<lb/> the housing schemes are given to competent<lb/> authorities in such meetings. Government of<lb/> Maharashtra have carefully considered the<lb/> importance attaching to close and effective<lb/> monitoring of the implementation of weaker sections<lb/> housing schemes and is now pleased to direct by way<lb/> of codification of earlier instructions on the subject<lb/> that competent authorities should ensure that the<lb/> following instructions are scrupulously complied<lb/> with....</figure>

			<figure type="table">&quot;<lb/> 16.<lb/> After this preamble, 16 paragraphs in what has been<lb/> named as the Code and a copy of this Code is<lb/> appended to the judgment as annexure for<lb/> convenience indicate the guidelines.<lb/> 17.<lb/> We are of the view that allotment shall be on the<lb/> basis of &apos;one family one flat&apos; and the family shall<lb/> include husband, wife and dependent children. A<lb/> family which has one flat in any urban<lb/> agglomeration within the State shall not be entitled<lb/> to allotment or acquisition by transfer of a flat under<lb/> this Code.<lb/> 18.<lb/> Government nominees contemplated under the Code<lb/> must belong to weaker sections of the society and<lb/> shall also be subjected to the rule of one family one<lb/> flat. The number of Government nominees should not<lb/> exceed 5% of the total accommodation available in<lb/> any scheme.<lb/> 19.<lb/> Every builder shall maintain a register of applicants<lb/> chronologically registering them on the basis of the<lb/> date of receipt of the applications. The register should<lb/> be uptodate and available for inspection by the<lb/> authorities. As and when an application is received by<lb/> the builder an appropriate receipt acknowledging<lb/> acceptance of such application shall be issued to the<lb/> applicant and in such receipt, the number in the<lb/> Application Register shall be clearly indicated.<lb/> Simultaneously, a copy of the application with its<lb/> number shall be sent by the builder to the Committee<lb/> for its record.<lb/> 20.<lb/> As a working guideline we direct that a &apos;means test&apos;<lb/> for identifying &apos;weaker sections of the society shall be<lb/> adopted and for the present income of the family of<lb/> the applicant must not exceed Rs. 18,000/ (eighteen<lb/> thousand) to come within the meaning of the term to<lb/> qualify for allotment. The applicant shall be called<lb/> upon to satisfy the Committee about the limit of<lb/> income and the present prescription of Rs. 18,000/<lb/> may be varied from time to time by the State<lb/> Government taking into consideration the fall of the<lb/> value of the rupee, general improvement in the<lb/> income of the people now within the annual income<lb/> limit of Rs. 18,000/ and other relevant factors. It<lb/> shall be open to the State Government to prescribe<lb/> appropriate guideline in the matter of identifying the<lb/> &apos;weaker sections of the society&apos;.<lb/> 21.<lb/> &apos;Competent authority&apos; has been defined in Section<lb/> 2(9) of the Act. From the Code it appears that he is<lb/> an officer subordinate to the Collector of the District<lb/> so far as the State of Maharashtra is concerned as an<lb/> appeal is contemplated from his orders to the<lb/> Collector. The duties and responsibilities and powers<lb/> vested in the competent authority under the Code are<lb/> wide and considerable. We are of the opinion<lb/> (without in any way casting any aspersion) that it<lb/> would be difficult for the competent authority to<lb/> exercise efficiently and to the satisfaction of everyone<lb/> the duties cast upon him under the Code. In the<lb/> matter of implementation of the scheme and with a<lb/> view to providing satisfactory execution thereof and<lb/> fulfilling the laudable purpose stipulated under the<lb/> Act and undertaken by the scheme, it is necessary that<lb/> there should be a committee in respect of the schemes<lb/> in every urban agglomeration for weaker sections<lb/> sanctioned under Sections 20 and 21 of the Act for<lb/> overseeing the implementation of every scheme,<lb/> particularly in the matter of due compliance of the<lb/> conditions under which exemption is granted, timely<lb/> construction of the flats, appropriate advertisement as<lb/> contemplated, registration of the applications in<lb/> response to advertisements in a systematic manner,<lb/> appropriate allotment of flats including priorities on<lb/> the basis of registration, ensuring legitimate charges<lb/> only being demanded and monitoring strict<lb/> compliance to avoid underhand dealing or any unjust<lb/> treatment. It should be handled by the competent<lb/> authority in a committee consisting of himself, a<lb/> judicial officer not below the rank of an Additional<lb/> District Judge and a Government engineer not below<lb/> the rank of Superintending Engineer. In the<lb/> committee, the judicial officer shall function as the<lb/> Chairman.<lb/> 22.<lb/> This Committee shall have powers to scrutinise all<lb/> relevant documents and give appropriate directions to<lb/> the builders and applicants keeping the requirements<lb/> of the schemes and the Code in view. To the extent we<lb/> have indicated the powers conferred on the competent<lb/> authority in terms of the State Code shall stand<lb/> vested in the committee. The Bombay High Court<lb/> shall take steps to ensure that in respect of schemes in<lb/> every agglomeration undertaken and which the State<lb/> Government may in future undertake, the services of<lb/> an efficient judicial officer not below the rank of an<lb/> Additional District Judge on such terms as the State<lb/> Government and the High Court consider appropriate<lb/> shall be made available for discharging the duties<lb/> indicated and/or as may be provided. We would like<lb/> to impress upon every Committee that fulfilment of<lb/> the laudable purpose of the providing a home to the<lb/> poor homeless depends upon its commitment to the<lb/> goal and every effort should be made by it to ensure<lb/> that the builder does not succeed in frustrating the<lb/> purpose. The State Government shall suitably modify<lb/> its Code in the light of this judgment and recirculate<lb/> the same to all concerned within four weeks from<lb/> today.&quot;<lb/> 67<lb/> A further order in terms of the guidelines formulated above<lb/> has been passed by the Honourable Supreme Court in the year 1995 and<lb/> to be precise on 17.11.1995. That order is reported in (1996) 1 SCC 233<lb/> (Shantistar Builders v/s Narayan Khimalal Totame). Therefore, the Scheme<lb/> formulated by the Honourable Supreme Court is in place. This order reads<lb/> thus:<lb/> &quot;1.<lb/> This Court by its judgment in Shantistar Builders v.<lb/> Narayan Khimalal Totame, while disposing of the<lb/> matter directed in paragraphs 21 and 22 the State<lb/> Government to constitute a committee for monitoring<lb/> allotment of the houses to the weaker sections, as per<lb/> the scheme sanctioned while exempting the Urban<lb/> land under Section 21 of the Urban Land (Ceiling &amp;<lb/> Regulation) Act, 1976 (for short &quot;the Act&quot;). One of the<lb/> members of the committee suggested was Additional<lb/> District Judge. The Bombay High Court was requested<lb/> to ensure that an Additional District Judge be made<lb/> available for enforcing the schemes in every<lb/> agglomeration, so that the Committee constituted by<lb/> the State Government would effectively implement the<lb/> schemes. This Court also impressed upon every<lb/> Committee to ensure fulfilment of the laudable<lb/> purpose of providing a home to the poor homeless to<lb/> effectuate its commitment to the constitutional goal<lb/> and that every effort should be made by it to ensure<lb/> that the builder does not succeed in frustrating the<lb/> purpose. The State Government should suitably<lb/> modify its scheme in the light of the judgment<lb/> rendered in Shantistar Builders case and recirculate<lb/> the same to all concerned within four weeks from the<lb/> date of the judgment.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The State had filed an affidavit on March 30, 1990,<lb/> seeking certain modification or clarifications of the<lb/> order. One of the modifications sought was that under<lb/> the Act, the Deputy Commissioner is the competent<lb/> authority and an appeal was provided under the Act,<lb/> except for Bombay and Pune, to the Additional<lb/> Commissioner. For Pune and Bombay, the<lb/> Commissioner would deal with the same. If the<lb/> Additional District Judge was to supervise the<lb/> functioning of the allotment as per the scheme<lb/> sanctioned under Section 21 of the Act, it would be<lb/> inconvenient to the appellate authority to consider the<lb/> scheme under the Act.<lb/> 3.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The entire thinking of the Government is wholly<lb/> misconceived. The Committee had nothing to do with<lb/> the provisions of the Urban Ceiling Act. After the<lb/> exemption under Section 20 or 21 is granted, the<lb/> Committee is required to implement the scheme in<lb/> terms of the sanction made by the Government for<lb/> construction of buildings by the builders and<lb/> allotment to weaker section people. This Court<lb/> intended to ensure that the builders would abide by<lb/> the guidelines laid down by this Court in the light of<lb/> the judgment. The Committee would supervise the<lb/> allotment of the houses to the homeless weaker<lb/> section people in the light of the guidelines laid down<lb/> therein. The State Government was also directed to<lb/> recirculate the revised schemes in the light of the<lb/> above judgment. In the circumstances, the question of<lb/> the Commissioner sitting in an appeal over the<lb/> working of the Committee does not arise.<lb/> 4.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is submitted that the taking away of the<lb/> discretionary power of the Government in allotment<lb/> of the houses is not justified. We do not propose to<lb/> modify our earlier direction. The Government is<lb/> directed to comply with the Constitution of the<lb/> Committee within 30 days from the date of the receipt<lb/> of this order, since the same has already been delayed<lb/> for more than five years from the date of the<lb/> judgment constituting the committee.&quot;<lb/> We have not been shown anything which would counter to<lb/> this, but the attempt is to orally demonstrate that all this does not survive<lb/> the repeal.<lb/></p>

			<figure>69<lb/> We have already referred to as to how the schemes devised<lb/> for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the exemption orders may<lb/> be at various stages of implementation. There are several conditions and<lb/> which may have been varied from time to time so as to achieve the object<lb/> of exemption. Since the exemption under clause (a) of subsection (1) of<lb/> Section 20 of the Principal Act is to be granted bearing in mind the<lb/> location of land, the purpose for which it is being used or proposed to be<lb/> used and such other relevant factors so also it is necessary and expedient<lb/> in public interest that the Government devised several schemes and<lb/> embodied in the circulars and Government Resolutions. Some of the<lb/> clauses in such schemes presented difficulties and which were resolved by<lb/> the Honourable Supreme Court. Now the schemes have become part of<lb/> the orders of the Honourable Supreme Court. These are not orders to the<lb/> contrary as envisaged by Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act rather they are<lb/> in consonance with the power to exempt and carry it further. If such<lb/> orders are in place and the scheme is under various stages of<lb/> implementation, then, the repeal of the Principal Act will not in any<lb/> manner prevent the Government from enforcing the conditions and<lb/> ensuring compliance with the obligations undertaken by the Developers<lb/> and Builders.<lb/> 70<lb/> The arguments of the Petitioners to the contrary do not take<lb/> note of any of the above aspects. Even if one proceeds on the footing that<lb/> the intent of the Parliament was not to save several other provisions, but<lb/> that does not mean that what is saved by the Repeal Act or what will not<lb/> be affected by repeal of the Principal Act is exhaustive. Mr.Naphade places<lb/> reliance upon Sections 21 and 22 of the Principal Act and submits that<lb/> these provisions have not been saved, but his argument overlooks the fact<lb/></figure>

			<p>that Section 21 is a provision whereunder a person holding the vacant<lb/> land in excess of ceiling limit comes forward and declares in the<lb/> prescribed manner before the competent authority that such land is to be<lb/> utilized for construction of dwelling units of the size specified therein and<lb/> for accommodation of weaker sections of the society in accordance with<lb/> the scheme approved by such authority and then that land on inquiry is<lb/> not to be treated as excess for the purpose of the Chapter. That is<lb/> permission to such holder to continue to hold such land for the purpose<lb/> aforesaid. That is also conditional upon interalia time to complete the<lb/> construction. However, merely because this provision is not inserted in<lb/> the Repeal Act ipsofacto will not mean that subsection (2) of Section 20<lb/> of the Principal Act is not saved. Section 20 is a power to exempt and<lb/> while exercising that power the Government cannot declare that the<lb/> excess vacant land will not be treated as excess. Rather the foundation on<lb/> which the power to exempt is exercised is that the land is vacant and in<lb/> excess of the ceiling limit and the holder is aware and admits this<lb/> position. Therefore, Sections 20 and 21 of the Principal Act operate in<lb/> separate fields. Similar is the case with Section 22 where the vacant land<lb/> is allowed to be retained under certain circumstances. Therefore, if<lb/> retention for specified purpose as contemplated by Section 22(1) is where<lb/> there is a building on the land held by the holder of the vacant land, but<lb/> that building is demolished by him or demolished or destroyed solely due<lb/> to natural causes and beyond the control of human agency and as a<lb/> consequence thereof, then, in the circumstances set out in subsection (1)<lb/></p>

			<p>of Section 22 the vacant land can be retained. Once again this provision<lb/> cannot be equated with Section 20 and would operate in a different field.<lb/></p>

			<p>We need not repeat that the purpose to exempt the excess vacant land is<lb/> for the reason that the land is located in a peculiar place or location and<lb/> that the purpose for which it is being or is proposed to be used and such<lb/> other relevant factors may make it necessary or expedient in public<lb/> interest that the Government can exercise its discretionary power to<lb/> exempt and not otherwise. One of the user or proposed user could be<lb/> construction of tenements for the weaker or deprived sections of the<lb/> society or handing over of constructed tenements or units to the<lb/> Government nominees so as to enable the Government to mitigate<lb/> hardship caused to such nominees. The Totame&apos;s case (supra) dealt with<lb/> such nominees as well. Therefore, the laudable object and purpose being<lb/> borne in mind it is apparent that in exceptional cases and in public<lb/> interest the power to exempt is exercised and not as a matter of course.<lb/></p>

			<head>71<lb/></head>

			<p>The arguments of the Petitioners&apos; counsel overlook the<lb/> fundamental aspect that the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit has to<lb/> be reckoned with effect from the date of commencement of the Act and as<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">far as the State of Maharashtra is concerned that is 17.02.1976. In a Full<lb/> Bench decision of this Court reported in AIR 1984 Bombay 122<lb/> Prabhakar Narhar Pawar v/s State of Maharashtra, the Full Bench held as<lb/> under:<lb/></figure>

			<p>&quot;11. There is no dispute that the vacant land has to be<lb/> determined with reference to the date of<lb/> commencement of the Act and the relevant date is<lb/> 17th February, 1976. So far as Subclause (I) is<lb/> concerned, the question as to whether construction of<lb/> a building is or is not permissible according to the<lb/> building Regulations has to be determined with<lb/> reference to 17th February, 1976. We have already<lb/> referred to the definitions of the words &quot;building<lb/> Regulations&quot;, which mean Regulations contained in<lb/> the master plan, and the meaning of the expression<lb/> &quot;master plan&quot; is also given in the Act itself in S. 2(h)<lb/> and it means, in relation to an area within an urban<lb/> agglomeration or any part thereof, the plan prepared<lb/> under any law for the time being in force or in<lb/> pursuance of an order made by the State Government<lb/> for the development of such area or part thereof and<lb/> providing for the stages by which such development<lb/> shall be carried out. Now, when a question arises as to<lb/> whether construction of a building is not permissible<lb/> under the building Regulations in force, it is possible<lb/> that there may be an absolute ban or prohibition<lb/> under the relevant master plan where under no<lb/> circumstances construction of building is possible on a<lb/> given piece of land. Such piece of land may have been<lb/> reserved for a purpose and on such reservation<lb/> construction of a building would not at all be<lb/> permissible. But, when we come to an instance like<lb/> the present one in which there is an open plot of land<lb/> which is admittedly a house site on which a building<lb/> could be constructed, it is difficult to see how any part<lb/> of the land can be excluded under Subclause. (I) of S.<lb/> 2(q) on hypothetical considerations. Section 3 of the<lb/> Act and the procedural provisions thereof which are<lb/> intended to implement the provisions of the said<lb/> section contemplate the determination of the quantum<lb/> of vacant land on facts as they exist on the date of<lb/> commencement of the Act. Therefore, in a given case<lb/> where the owners of a land claims that certain land<lb/> which is owned by him should be excluded on the<lb/> ground that construction of a building is not<lb/> permissible under the building Regulations in force, it<lb/> is obvious that he will have to show that the building<lb/> regulations are attracted in his case. For a person,<lb/> who, on the commencement date, never even intended<lb/> to construct any building on his land or for a person<lb/> who has not even submitted a plan for construction of<lb/> any building, the relevant building Regulations are<lb/> wholly irrelevant and he is not affected by the<lb/> building Regulations. It appears to us that when sub<lb/> clause (I) refers to land on which construction of a<lb/> building is not permissible under the building<lb/> Regulations, it was contemplated that on the date of<lb/> commencement of the Act, that is, 17th February,<lb/> 1976, the owner intended to construct a building on<lb/> the plot in question and the plan of the building was<lb/> either already sanctioned or he had submitted the<lb/> plan for sanction. Where a building plan is already<lb/> sanctioned and such sanctioned plan is operative on<lb/> 17th February, 1976 or a plan has already been<lb/> submitted for sanction, it could be ascertained with<lb/> certainty as to how much land could be identified as<lb/> land on which construction of a building is not<lb/> possible. Subclause (I) of S. 2(q) does not, in our<lb/> view, contemplate a general exclusion of land from the<lb/> purview of the Act to the extent of twothirds or one<lb/> half or whatever may be the extent of land on which<lb/> no building can be constructed under the relevant<lb/> building Regulations in force in the area under<lb/> consideration irrespective of whether a building is<lb/> proposed to be constructed or not on the date of<lb/> commencement of the Act. ….</p>

			<figure type="table">.......&quot;<lb/> 72<lb/> This decision in Prabhakar Pawar&apos;s case (supra) has been<lb/> specifically approved by the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of<lb/> State of Gujarat v/s Parshottamdas Ramdas Patel reported in AIR 1988 SC<lb/> 220. The arguments of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the<lb/> Petitioners in this case overlook the fact that when there is ceiling placed<lb/> on holding of vacant lands and such lands which are vacant, but in excess<lb/> of ceiling limit vest in the State, then, it would be futile to urge that the<lb/> exemption confers an absolute right or privilege. If the exemption is a<lb/> privilege as is held in the case of Southern Petrochemical Industries<lb/> Company Limited v/s Electricity Inspector and E.T.I.O. reported in AIR<lb/> 2007 SC 1984 and it is further held by the Honourable Supreme Court<lb/> that the right of exemption with a valid notification gives the right to<lb/> approve the rates, it is vested right and the word &quot;privilege&quot; has wider<lb/> meaning, then, the right is, therefore, protected even after repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act. It goes without saying that if such right is conditional the<lb/> conditions attached are not wiped out or destroyed if the right or<lb/> privilege is saved. In this regard, the Honourable Supreme Court holds<lb/> that when such is the nature of the claim, then, the Court is obliged to<lb/> consider as to whether the intention of the Legislature is to the contrary<lb/> meaning thereby there is a different intention than what is spelled out by<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. In that regard this is what the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court has held:<lb/> &quot;108. We are also unable to agree with Mr. Andhyarujina<lb/> that exemption from tax is a mere concession<lb/> defeasible by Government and does not confer any<lb/> accrued right to the recipient. Right of exemption<lb/> with a valid notification issued gives rise to an<lb/> accrued right. It is a vested right. Such right had been<lb/> granted to them permanently. &apos;Permanence&apos; would<lb/> mean unless altered by statute.<lb/> 109. Thus, when a right is accrued or vested, the same can<lb/> be taken away only by reason of a statute and not<lb/> otherwise. Thus, a notification which was duly issued<lb/> would continue to govern unless the same is repealed.<lb/> 110. Mr.Andhyarujina, however, would submit that<lb/> reference to the words &quot;anything duly done&quot; should be<lb/> given a restrictive meaning. He referred to &quot;Statutory<lb/> Interpretation A Code&quot; by F.A.R. Bennion, Third<lb/> Edition, page 229, wherein it was stated:<lb/> &quot;Paragraph<lb/> (ii)<lb/> This<lb/> derives<lb/> from<lb/> Interpretation Act 1978 Section 16(1)(b). The<lb/> reference to &apos;anything duly done&apos; avoids the need for<lb/> procedural matters, such as the giving of notices, to<lb/> be done over again.<lb/> Example 89.3 The Interpretation Act 1978<lb/> Section preserved the effect of a noise nuisance notice<lb/> served under the Control of Pollution Act, 1974,<lb/> Section 58(1) before its repeal and replacement by<lb/> the Environmental Protection Act, 1990, Sections 162<lb/> and 164(2) and Schedule 16 Pt. III.&quot;<lb/> 111. The treatment of the law, in our opinion, is not<lb/> exhaustive as different consequences are required to<lb/> be taken into consideration and applied having<lb/> regard to the nature of the statutory provision.<lb/> 112. Mr.Andhyarujina also relied upon Maxwell on the<lb/> Interpretation of Statutes, 12th edition, page 18,<lb/> wherein it was stated:<lb/> &quot;When an Act is repealed, any delegated<lb/> legislation made under the Act falls to the ground<lb/> with the statute unless it is expressly preserved. Where<lb/> the subordinate legislation is continued in force,<lb/> however, the general rule is that its scope and<lb/> construction are determined according to the repealed<lb/> Act under which it was made.&quot;<lb/> 113. The statement of law therein does not militate against<lb/> our findings aforementioned. Construction would<lb/> vary from statute to statute.<lb/> 114. It is profitable to notice at this stage a decision of this<lb/> Court in M/s. Universal Imports Agency (supra). In<lb/> that case under the IndoFrench Agreement entered<lb/> into by and between the two nations on 1st<lb/> November, 1954, the entire Administration of French<lb/> Settlement vested in the Government of India. The<lb/> territory of Pondicherry, thus, became a free port<lb/> without any restriction in case of most imports.<lb/> However, by reason of a notification dated 30th<lb/> October, 1954, the importers in Pondicherry were<lb/> required to obtain validation of licences held by them<lb/> to import goods as petitioners thereof did not have<lb/> any merchandise imported by them stood confiscated.<lb/> 115. Clause 6 of the Agreement reads, thus:<lb/> &quot;Unless otherwise specifically provided in the<lb/> Schedule, all laws in force in the French<lb/> Establishments<lb/> immediately<lb/> before<lb/> the<lb/> commencement of the Order, which correspond to<lb/> enactments specified in the Schedule, shall cease to<lb/> have effect, save as respect things done or omitted to<lb/> be done before such commencement.&quot;<lb/> 116. Analyzing the said provision, this Court held:<lb/> &quot;...The words things done in para 6 must be<lb/> reasonably interpreted and, if so interpreted, they can<lb/></figure>

			<figure>mean not only things done but also the legal<lb/> consequences flowing therefrom. If the interpretation<lb/> suggested by the learned Counsel for the respondents<lb/> be accepted, the saving clause would become<lb/> unnecessary. If what it saves is only the executed<lb/> contracts i.e. the contracts whereunder the goods have<lb/> been imported and received by the buyer before the<lb/> merger, no further protection is necessary as<lb/> ordinarily no question of enforcement of the contracts<lb/> under the preexisting law would arise. The<lb/> phraseology used is not an innovation but is copied<lb/> from other statutory clauses. Section 6 of the General<lb/> clauses Act (10 of 1897) says that unless a different<lb/> intention appears, the repeal of an Act shall not affect<lb/> anything duly done or suffered thereunder....&quot;<lb/> 117. Thus, a liberal and extensive construction was given<lb/> by this Court.<lb/> 118. To the same effect is also a decision of this Court in<lb/> Shri Ram Prasad (supra) wherein power to make rule<lb/> was held to be a thing done within the meaning of<lb/> Article 357(2) of the Constitution of India.<lb/> 119. In Harnek Singh (supra), this Court held:<lb/> &quot;16. The words anything duly done or suffered<lb/> thereunder used in Clause (b) of Section 6 are often<lb/> used by the legislature in saving clause which is<lb/> intended to provide that unless a different intention<lb/> appears, the repeal of an Act would not affect<lb/> anything duly done or suffered thereunder. This Court<lb/> in Hasan Nurani Malak v. S.M. Ismail, Asstt. Charity<lb/> Commr., Nagpur has held that the object of such a<lb/> saving clause is to save what has been previously done<lb/> under the statute repealed. The result of such a saving<lb/> clause is that the preexisting law continues to govern<lb/> the things done before a particular date from which<lb/> the repeal of such a preexisting law takes effect. In<lb/> Universal Imports Agency v. Chief Controller of<lb/> Imports and Exports this Court while construing the<lb/> words things done held that a proper interpretation<lb/> of the expression things done was comprehensive<lb/> enough to take in not only the things done but also<lb/> the effect of the legal consequence flowing therefrom.&quot;<lb/> 120. Furthermore, exemption from payment of tax in<lb/> favour of the appellants herein would also constitute<lb/> a right or privilege. The expression &quot;privilege&quot; has a<lb/> wider meaning than right. A right may be a vested<lb/> right or an accrued right or an acquired right. Nature<lb/> of such a right would depend upon and also vary<lb/> from statute to statute. It has been so held by this<lb/> Court, while construing Section 6 of the General<lb/> Clauses Act, in M/s Gurcharan Singh Baldev Singh v.<lb/> Yashwant Singh and Ors. [(1992) 1 SCC 428] in the<lb/> following terms:<lb/> &quot;...The objective of the provision is to ensure<lb/> protection of any right or privilege acquired under the<lb/> repealed Act. The only exception to it is legislative<lb/> intention to the contrary. That is, the repealing Act<lb/> may expressly provide or it may impliedly provide<lb/> against continuance of such right, obligation or<lb/> liability....&quot;&quot;<lb/> 73<lb/> Hence, Section 20(1) of the Principal Act and Section 3(1)(b)<lb/> and (c) of the Repeal Act have to be read together and harmoneously.<lb/> That would also save and protect the right of person to move under<lb/> Sections 11 to 14 of the Principal Act. That is why there is a proviso<lb/> which has been inserted in Section 4 of the Repeal Act. Equally, by clause<lb/> (c) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act the intent was also to<lb/> allow the State Government to retain the money/sum paid to it as<lb/> condition for granting exemption under Section 20(1). All this shows that<lb/> the excess vacant land continues to be subject to the Principal Act and its<lb/> repeal does not affect applicability of the provisions of ChapterIII albeit<lb/> to a limited extent with which we are concerned. The intent is not to<lb/> allow recourse to Sections 21 and 22 of the Principal Act and that is<lb/> clearly affected by the repeal of the Principal Act. However, a saving<lb/> clause enacted in the Repeal Act and construed as above does not<lb/> manifest an intent to destroy all rights and obligations. Therefore, Section<lb/> 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 can be taken assistance of.<lb/> 74<lb/> While construing a repeal clause or Repeal Act or saving<lb/> clause therein the application of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act<lb/> would have to be considered in the light of the afore laid down principles.<lb/> Therefore, if having found that when the order of exemption is passed, it<lb/> is in force and conditional, then, the right or privilege created thereunder<lb/> cannot partake a different character. It would then fall squarely within<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and in the present case we have not<lb/> found a contrary intention.<lb/> 75<lb/> We find that reliance placed by the learned Advocate General<lb/> on the decision in the case of Bansidhar (supra) is apposite. There, the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court held that a saving provision in the repealing<lb/> statute is not exhaustive of the rights and obligations so saved and they<lb/> survive the repeal.<lb/> 76<lb/> In Bansidhar&apos;s case (supra) the contentions of the Appellants<lb/> before the Supreme Court were regarding the legality of certain<lb/> proceedings for fixation of ceiling on agricultural holdings initiated and<lb/> continued under the provisions of Chapter IIIB of the Rajasthan Tenancy<lb/> Act, 1955. That Act particularly Section 5(6A) and Chapter IIIB<lb/> thereunder was repealed by the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on<lb/> Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973 (11 of 1973). The question was whether<lb/> the proceedings under the 1955 Act survive the repeal and reenactment<lb/> of the same in 1973. In that regard the Honourable Supreme Court held<lb/> as under:<lb/> &quot;3.<lb/> Chapter IIIB, pertaining to imposition of ceiling on<lb/> agricultural holdings, in the State of Rajasthan, was<lb/> introduced into the &apos;1955 Act&apos; by the Rajasthan<lb/> Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 1960. As a sequential<lb/> necessity Section was amended by the introduction in<lb/> it of Clause (6A) which defined &quot;ceilingarea&quot;. The<lb/> notifieddate, as originally fixed, was 1.4.1965; but<lb/> owing to the uncertainties imparted to the<lb/> implementation of the law by the challenged made to<lb/> the provisions of Chapter IIIB before the High Court<lb/> and the interimorders of the High Court staying the<lb/> operation of the law, Government had had to re<lb/> notify 1.4.1966 as the fresh notifieddate, after the<lb/> challenge to the validity of Chapter IIIB had been<lb/> repelled by the High Court.<lb/> 4.<lb/> By the time, the &apos;1973 Act&apos; was brought into force<lb/> disputes touching the determination of the ceiling<lb/> areas in 33, 471 cases had come to be decided in<lb/> accordance with the provisions of Chapter IIIB of the<lb/> earlier &apos;1955 Act&apos;. After the &apos;1973 Act&apos; came into force<lb/> on 1.1.1973, some 8,494 cases for the determination<lb/> of &apos;ceilingareas&apos; under IIIB of the &apos;1955 Act. came to<lb/> be initiated and were sought to be continued under<lb/> said Chapter IIIB of the repealed &apos;1955 Act&apos; on the<lb/> view that the repeal of Chapter IIIB of the 1955 Act<lb/> by the &apos;1973 Act&apos; did not affect the rights accrued and<lb/> liabilities incurred under the old law. Appellants&apos;<lb/> principal contention is that after the coming into<lb/> force of the 1973 Act which, by its 40th Section,<lb/> repealed Chapter IIIB of the &apos;1955 Act&apos;, recourse<lb/> could not be had to the repealedlaw for purposes of<lb/> commencement, conduct and conclusion of any<lb/> proceedings for fixation of ceiling as prescribed under<lb/> the old law. This contention has been repelled by the<lb/> full bench of the High Court in the judgment under<lb/> appeal. The correctness of view of the full bench arises<lb/> for consideration in these appeals.<lb/> 5.<lb/> The factual antecedents in which the controversy<lb/> arose before the High Court may be illustrated by the<lb/> facts of one of the appeals. In CA 1003 [N] of 1977,<lb/> the appellants&apos; claim to have entered into possession<lb/> and cultivation of certain parcels of land pursuant to<lb/> alleged agreements to sell dated 28.4.1957 said to<lb/> have been executed in their favour by the then land<lb/> holder, a certain Sri Had Singh. The sale deeds were<lb/> passed only on 22,8.1966, after the notified date.<lb/> Proceedings for the fixation of ceiling area in the<lb/> hands of Sri Hari Singh were commenced under the<lb/> Repealed Chapter IIIB of the &apos;1955 Act&apos;. Appellants&apos;<lb/> purchases were held to be hit by Section DD of the<lb/> said Chapter IIIB, which prescribed certain<lb/> residential qualifications, which appellants did not<lb/> possess, for the eligibility for recognition of such<lb/> transfers. Appellants&apos; contention is that if the new law<lb/> had been applied to the case of the vendor, the<lb/> transfers in their favour would have been held valid<lb/> and that &apos;invoking of Chapter IIIB of the repealed<lb/> law was impermissible. Apart from the facts of<lb/> individual cases and their particularities the basic<lb/> question is one of construction whether the<lb/> provisions of the old law are saved and survive to<lb/> govern pending cases.<lb/> 6.<lb/></figure>

			<p>We have heard Sri A.K. Sen, Sri Tarkunde and Sri<lb/> Shanti Shushan, learned Senior Advocates for the<lb/> appellants and Sri Lodha, learned Senior Advocate<lb/> for the State of Rajasthan and its authorities. The<lb/> appellants&apos; principal contentionwhich we perceive as<lb/> one of construction of statutesis that the later law<lb/> made manifest, expressly and by necessary<lb/> implication, an intention inconsistent with the<lb/> continuance of the rights and obligations under the<lb/> repealed law and that, accordingly after 1.1.1973,<lb/> the date of coming into force of the &apos;1973 Act&apos;, no<lb/> proceedings under the old law could be initiated or<lb/> continued.<lb/> 7.<lb/></p>

			<p>The points that fall for consideration in these appeals<lb/> are whether:<lb/> (a) the scheme contemplated by and the<lb/> different criteria and standards for the determination<lb/> of &quot;ceilingarea&quot; envisaged in the <ref type="biblio">&apos;1973 Act&apos; and, in<lb/> particular</ref>, having regard to the limited scope of the<lb/> savingprovision of Section thereof which, quite<lb/> significantly, omits to invoke and attract Section of<lb/> the Rajasthan General Clauses Act 1955 to the Repeal<lb/> of Section and Chapter IIIB of the &apos;1955 Act&apos; must be<lb/> construed and held to manifest an intention contrary<lb/> to and inconsistent with the keeping alive or saving of<lb/> the repealed law so as to be invoked in relation to<lb/> and applied for the pending cases which had not been<lb/> concluded under the old law before the repeal; and<lb/></p>

			<p>(b) that, at all events even if Section of the<lb/> Rajasthan General Clauses Act 1955 was attracted<lb/> and the old law was saved for the purpose, provisions<lb/> of the oldlaw could not be invoked as no right had<lb/> been &quot;accrued&quot; in favour of the State in relation to the<lb/> surplus area determinable under the old law nor any<lb/> liability &quot;incurred&quot; by the landholders under the old<lb/> law so as to support the initiation of the proceedings<lb/> for fixation of &apos;Ceilingarea&apos; under the oldlaw after<lb/> its repeal.<lb/></p>

			<p>Re : Contention (a)<lb/> 8.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order that this contention, which is presented with<lb/> some perspicuity, is apprehended in its proper<lb/> prospective a conspectus of the essential provisions of<lb/> the earlier law and later law pertaining to<lb/> prescription of ceiling on agricultural holdings is<lb/> necessary.<lb/> 9.<lb/></p>

			<p>In</p>

			<figure type="table">1955, The Rajasthan Tenancy Act 1955 was<lb/> enacted. By the Rajasthan Tenancy (Amendment) Act,<lb/> for the first time, provisions in Chapter IIIB<lb/> prescribing a ceilings on holdings of agricultural<lb/> lands got introduced into the &apos;1955 Act&apos;, This<lb/> amending Act of 1960 received Presidential assent on<lb/> 12th March 1960. The Chapter IIIB was, by an<lb/> appropriate notification, brought into force with<lb/> effect from 15th December, 1963. The notifieddate,<lb/> under the &apos;1955 Act&apos; as stated earlier, was 1.4.1966.<lb/> 10.<lb/> Section (6A) of the &apos;1955 Act&apos; defined &apos;Ceilingarea&apos;:<lb/> &quot;Ceiling area&quot; in relation to land held<lb/> anywhere throughout the State by a person in any<lb/> capacity whatsoever shall mean the maximum area of<lb/> land that may be fixed as ceiling area under Section C<lb/> in relation to such person:<lb/> 11.<lb/> Section B in Chapter IIIB provided:<lb/> 30B.

			<p>Section 30C providing for the extent of ceiling area<lb/> said:<lb/></p>

			<p>30C. Extent of ceiling areaThe ceiling area for<lb/> a family consisting of five or less than five members<lb/> shall be thirty standard acres of land :<lb/></p>

			<p>Provided that, where the members of a family<lb/> exceed five, the ceiling area in relation thereto shall<lb/> be increased for each additional member by five<lb/> standard acres, so however that it does not exceed<lb/> sixty standard acres of land.<lb/></p>

			<p>ExplanationA &apos;standard acre&apos; shall mean the<lb/> area of land which, with reference to its productive<lb/> capacity, situation, soil classification and other<lb/> prescribed particulars is found in the prescribed<lb/> manner to be likely to yield ten maunds of wheat<lb/> yearly ; and in case of land not capable of producing<lb/> wheat, the other likely produce thereof shall, for the<lb/> purpose of calculating a standard acre, be determined<lb/> according to the prescribed scale so as to be<lb/> equivalent in terms of money value to ten maunds of<lb/> wheat:<lb/></p>

			<p>Provided that, in determining a ceiling area in<lb/> terms of standard acres the money value of the<lb/> produce of wellirrigated (chahi) land shall be taken<lb/> is being equivalent to the money value of the produce<lb/> of an equal area of unirrigated (barani) land.<lb/></p>

The Rajasthan Tenancy (Fixation of<lb/> Ceiling of Land) Government <ref type="biblio">Rules, 1963</ref>, which<lb/> came into force on and with effect from 15.12.1963.<lb/> Rule 9 required that in order to enable the Sub<lb/> Divisional Officer to determine the ceiling area<lb/> applicable to every person under Section C of the Act<lb/> and to enforce the provision of Sections E, every land<lb/> holder and tenant in possession of lands, in excess of<lb/> the ceiling area applicable to him, shall file a<lb/> declaration within six months from the notifieddate.<lb/> The law fixed 30 standard acres as the ceiling area.<lb/> Thereafter, successive amendments were made to<lb/> Chapter IIIB of the &apos;1955 Act&apos; which, while<lb/> maintaining the ceiling at 30 standard acres,<lb/> however, recognised certain transfers effected after<lb/> 1958, which were not originally so recognised in<lb/> fixing the ceiling. Again (by an amendment) of the<lb/> year 1970, Section was deleted. The 1955 Act itself<lb/> came to be included in the IX Schedule to the<lb/> Constitution by a Parliamentary law. The challenge to<lb/> said inclusion was repelled by this Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>On</p>

			<figure type="table">1.1.1973, the Governor of the State of Rajasthan<lb/> promulgated The Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on<lb/> Agricultural Holdings Ordinance, 1973 under Article<lb/> 213 of the Constitution of India. The Ordinance<lb/> repealed the corresponding provisions relating to<lb/> ceiling on agricultural holdings contained in Section<lb/> and Chapter IIIB of the &apos;1955 Act&apos; except to the<lb/> extent indicated in the Second Proviso to Section and<lb/> Section of the said Ordinance. The Ordinance brought<lb/> in to existence a new concept of and standards for<lb/> the&quot; ceilingarea&quot;. Certain transfers made by the land<lb/> holders even during the operation of the old law were<lb/> recognised as valid transfers for purposes of<lb/> computation of ceiling area under the new<lb/> dispensation brought about by the Ordinance. This<lb/> Ordinance was replaced by the 1973 Act which was<lb/> made operative retrospectively from 1.1.1973 being<lb/> the date of promulgation of the Ordinance. Section of<lb/> the &apos;1973 Act&apos; repealed as did the predecessor<lb/> Ordinance, both the old law in Chapter IIIB of the<lb/> &apos;1955 Act&apos; and the earlier Ordinance for which it<lb/> substituted.<lb/> 13.<lb/> Section Section 4(1), Second Proviso and Section of<lb/> the 1973 Act require particular notice.<lb/> 14.<lb/> Section 3 provides :<lb/> &quot;3. Act to override other laws, contracts, etc.<lb/> The provisions of this Act shall have effect<lb/> notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in<lb/> any other law for the time being in force, on any<lb/> custom, usage or contract or decree or order of a<lb/> court or other authority.<lb/> 15.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The Second Proviso to the Explanation appended to<lb/> Section 4(1) of the Act says:<lb/> Provided further that if the ceiling area<lb/> applicable to any person or family in accordance with<lb/> this section exceeds the ceiling area applicable to such<lb/> person or family according to the provisions of law<lb/> repealed by Section in that case the ceiling area<lb/> applicable to such person or family will be the same<lb/> as was under the provisions of the said repealed law.<lb/> 16.<lb/></p>

			<p>Section 40 provides ;<lb/> 40. Repeal and savings(1) Except as provided<lb/> in second proviso to Subsection (1) of Section and in<lb/> Subsection (<ref type="formula">2</ref>) of Section of this Act, the provisions<lb/> of Clause (6A) of Section and Chapter IIIB of the<lb/> Rajasthan Tenancy <ref type="biblio">Act, 1955 (Rajasthan Act 3 of<lb/> 1955)</ref> are hereby repealed except in the Rajasthan<lb/> Canal Project area wherein such provisions shall<lb/> stand repealed on the date on which this Act comes<lb/> into force in that area.<lb/></p>

			<p>(2) The Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on<lb/> Agricultural Holdings <ref type="biblio">Ordinance, 1973 Rajasthan<lb/> (OrdinanceI of 1973)</ref> is hereby repealed.<lb/></p>

			<p>(3) Notwithstanding the repeal of the said<lb/> Ordinance under Subsection (2), anything done or<lb/> any action taken or any rules made under the said<lb/> Ordinance shall be deemed to have been done taken<lb/> or made under this Act and section of the Rajasthan<lb/> General Clauses <ref type="biblio">Act, 1955 (Rajasthan Act 8 of 1955)<lb/></ref> shall apply to such repeal and reenactment.<lb/> 17.<lb/></p>

			<p>Section contains a statutory declaration that the &apos;Act&apos;<lb/> is for giving effect to the directive principles of State<lb/> policy towards securing the principles specified in<lb/> Article 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution of India.<lb/> 18.<lb/></p>

			<p>Appellants&apos; learned Counsel contend that when there<lb/> is a repeal of a statute followed by a reenactment of<lb/> a new law on the same subject with or without<lb/> modifications Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is<lb/> not attracted and the question as to the extent to<lb/> which the repealed law is saved would be dependent<lb/> upon the express provisions of the later statute or<lb/> what must be held to be its necessary and compelling<lb/> implications. It was urged that where the repeal is<lb/> accompanied by a afresh Legislation on the same<lb/> subject, the new law alone will determine if, and how<lb/> far the old law is saved and that in the absence of an<lb/> express appeal to Section 6 of the Genera Clauses Act<lb/> or of express provisions similar effect in the new law<lb/> itself, the provisions of the old law must be held to<lb/> have been effaced except whatever had been done, or<lb/> having effect as if done. This argument has the<lb/> familiar ring of what Sulaiman, CJ. had said on the<lb/> matter in B.Bansgopal v. Emperor. But, it must now<lb/> be taken to be settled that the mere absence of an<lb/> express reference to Section 6 of the General Clauses<lb/> Act is not conclusive, unless such omission to invoke<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is attended with<lb/> the circumstance that the provisions of the newlaw<lb/> evince and make manifest an intention contrary to<lb/> what would, otherwise, follow by the operation of<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, the incidents<lb/> and consequences of Section 6 would follow.<lb/> 19.<lb/></p>

			<p>Appellants&apos; learned Counsel submitted that the<lb/> legislation in question pertaining, as it did, to the<lb/> topic of agrarian reform was attendant with the<lb/> difficulties naturally besetting a task so inextricably<lb/> intermixed with complex and diverse and, indeed,<lb/> often conflicting socioeconomic interests had to go<lb/> through stages of empirical evolution and that having<lb/> regard to the widediversity of policyoptions manifest<lb/> between the earlier and the later legislations, the<lb/> conclusion becomes inescapable that the later<lb/> legislation, made manifest an intention inconsistent<lb/> with and contrary to the continuance of the rights<lb/> and obligations under the repealed law. It was agreed<lb/> that with the experience gained in the<lb/> implementation of the policy of agrarian reforms<lb/> embodied in the repealed law, the new policy<lb/> considerations -reflected in the new and basically<lb/> different thinking on some of the vital components of<lb/> the newpolicy -were evolved and incorporated in the<lb/> new law, so much so that the repealed and repealing<lb/> laws represented two entirely different systems and<lb/> approaches to the policy of agrarian reforms and the<lb/> two systems, with their marked differences on<lb/> basically and essential criteria underlying their<lb/> policies, could not coexist. it was urged that the<lb/> statement of objects and reasons appended to the<lb/> 1973 Bill recognised that the legislative policy and<lb/> technique underlying the old law were ineffective in<lb/> removing the great disparity that persisted in the<lb/> holdings of agricultural lands or in diluting the<lb/> concentration of agricultural wealth in the hands of a<lb/> few and recognised the necessity &quot;to reduce such<lb/> disparity and to refix the ceiling area on the<lb/> agricultural holdings so that agricultural land may be<lb/> available for distribution to land less persons&quot;.</p>

			<figure>It was<lb/> pointed out that material criteria relevant to the<lb/> effectuation of the newpolicy made manifest an<lb/> intention contrary to the survival of the policy under<lb/> the old law. The wide changes in the policy of the<lb/> later law which reflected a new and basically different<lb/> approach to the matter, included [i] a fundamental<lb/> rethinking on the concept of the &quot;ceilingarea&quot; by<lb/> reducing the 30 standard acres prescribed in the old<lb/> law to 18 standard acres; [ii] the redefinition of the<lb/> very concept of &apos;family&apos; and &apos;separate unit&apos;; [iii] the<lb/> point of time with reference to which the composition<lb/> and strength of the family would require to be<lb/> ascertained; [vi] a rethinking, and a fresh policy as<lb/> to the recognition of transfers made by landholders<lb/> including even those transfers made during the period<lb/> of operation of the old law; [v] the point of time of<lb/> the vesting of the surplus land in Government; [vi]<lb/> the redefining of the principles and priorities guiding<lb/> the distribution of the surplus land to landless<lb/> persons; and [vii] the amount to be paid to the land<lb/> holders for the excess land vesting in the State under<lb/> the new law.<lb/> 20.<lb/></figure>

			<p>It was submitted that the two laws -the old and the<lb/> new -envisaged two totally different sets of values<lb/> and policies and were so disparate in their context<lb/> and effect as to yield the inevitable inference that the<lb/> policy and the scheme of the later law, by reason<lb/> alone of the peculiarities and distinction of its<lb/> prescriptions, should be held to manifest an intention<lb/> contrary to the saving of the old law even respecting<lb/> pending cases. The ceiling laws, it was submitted,<lb/> envisage and provide an integrated and inter<lb/> connected set of provisions and the marked<lb/> distinctions in the vital provisions in the two sets of<lb/> laws rendered the continued applicability of the old<lb/> law to any case, not already finally concluded<lb/> thereunder, as impermissible in law as unreasonable<lb/> in its consequences if permitted. It was urged that<lb/> Section of the 1973 Act was a clinching indicator in<lb/> this behalf when it provided that the provisions of the<lb/> later law &quot;shall have effect notwithstanding anything<lb/> inconsistent contained in any other law for the time<lb/> being in force, or any custom, usage, or contract or<lb/> decree or order of a Court or other authority&quot;<lb/> (underlining supplied) and that the old Act, even if it<lb/> was, otherwise, held to be in force in relation to<lb/> pending cases, was clearly overborne by Section of<lb/> the new law.<lb/> 21.<lb/></p>

			<p>When there is a repeal of a statute accompanied by<lb/> reenactment of a law on the same subject, the<lb/> provisions of the new enactment would have to be<lb/> looked into not for the purpose of ascertaining<lb/> whether the consequences envisaged by Section 6 of<lb/> the General Clauses Act ensued or not -Section 6<lb/> would indeed be attracted unless the new legislation<lb/> manifests a contrary intention but only for the<lb/> purpose of determining whether the provisions in the<lb/> new statute indicate a different intention. Referring to<lb/> the way in which such incompatibility with the<lb/> preservation of old rights and liabilities is to be<lb/> ascertained this Court in State of Punjab v. Mohar<lb/> Singh said:<lb/> ...Such incompatibility would have to be<lb/> ascertained from a consideration of all the relevant<lb/> provisions of the new Law and the mere absence of a<lb/> saving clause is by itself not material. The provisions<lb/> of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act will apply to a<lb/> case of repeal even if there is simultaneous enactment<lb/> unless a contrary intention can be gathered from the<lb/> new enactment. Of course, the consequences laid<lb/> down in Section 6 of the Act will apply only when a<lb/> statute or regulation having the force of a statute is<lb/> actually repealed.<lb/></p>

			<head>22.<lb/></head>

			<p>Addressing itself to the question whether, having<lb/> regard to the particular provisions of the 1973 Act,<lb/> the inference that the new law manifests such<lb/> contrary intention could justifiably be drawn, the<lb/> High Court observed:<lb/></p>

			<p>We have, therefore, to examine whether the<lb/> new law expressly or otherwise manifests an intention<lb/> to wipe out or sweep away those rights and liabilities<lb/> which had accrued and incurred under the old Law...<lb/></p>

			<p>Having carefully gone through all the<lb/> authorities cited by the parties as referred to above,<lb/> we are of opinion that the new Act of 1973 does not<lb/> have the sweeping effect of destroying all the rights<lb/> accrued and liabilities incurred under the old law...<lb/></p>

			<head>23.<lb/> One of the indicia that the old law was not effaced is<lb/> in Section [2] of the new Act. It provides that if the<lb/> State Government was satisfied that the &apos;ceilingarea&apos;<lb/> in relation to a person as fixed under the oldlaw had<lb/> been determined in contravention of that law, a<lb/> decided case could be reopened and inquired into it<lb/> and the &apos;ceilingarea&apos; and the &apos;surplus area&apos;<lb/> determined afresh in accordance with the provisions<lb/> of the old law. Another indicium is in Section [1]<lb/> read with the Second proviso to Section [1] of &apos;1973<lb/></head>

			<p>Act&apos; which provides that if the ceiling area applicable<lb/> to a person or a family in accordance with the said<lb/> Section [1] exceeds the &apos;ceilingarea&apos; applicable to<lb/> such person or family, under the old law, then, the<lb/> &apos;ceilingarea&apos; applicable to such person or family<lb/> would be the same as was provided under the<lb/> provisions of the old law.<lb/> 24.<lb/></p>

			<p>The High Court relied upon and drew sustenance for<lb/> its conclusion from, what it called, the internal<lb/> evidence in the Act which, according to the High<lb/> Court, indicated that pendingcases were governed<lb/> only by the old law.</p>

			<figure type="table">The High Court referred to<lb/> Section [2] inserted by Act No. 8 of 1976 and what,<lb/> according to it, necessarily flowed from it in support<lb/> of its conclusion, Section [2] inserted by Act NO. 8 of<lb/> 1976 runs thus:<lb/> 15(2) Without prejudice to any other remedy<lb/> that may be available to it under the Rajasthan<lb/> Tenancy <ref type="biblio">Act, 1955 (Rajasthan Act 3 of 1955)</ref>, if the<lb/> State Government, after calling for the record or<lb/> otherwise, is satisfied that any final order passed in<lb/> any matter arising under the provisions repealed by<lb/> Section is in contravention of such repealed provisions<lb/> and that such order is prejudicial to the State<lb/> Government or that on account of the discovery of<lb/> new and important matter or evidence which has<lb/> since come to its notice, such order is required to be<lb/> reopened, it may, at any time within five years of the<lb/> commencement of this Act, direct any officer<lb/> subordinate to it to reopen such decided matter and<lb/> to decide it afresh in accordance with such repealed<lb/> provisions.<lb/></p>

			<head>25.<lb/> The High Court referring to the opening words of the<lb/> above provision observed:<lb/></head>

			<p>The opening words of the section &quot;without<lb/> prejudice to any other remedy that may be available<lb/> to it under the Rajasthan Tenancy <ref type="biblio">Act, 1955 (Act No.<lb/> 3 of 1955)</ref>&quot;, clearly show that the pending cases have<lb/> to be governed by the old law. If transactions past and<lb/> closed have to be reopened and decided afresh under<lb/> the provisions of the repealed law, and the ceiling<lb/> area under Chapter III of the Rajasthan Tenancy <ref type="biblio">Act,<lb/> 1955, has</ref></p>

 to be fixed under its repealed provisions,<lb/> then it must follow as a necessary corollary, that the<lb/> pending cases must be decided under the old law.<lb/> 26.<lb/> Sri Lodha, learned Counsel for the State of Rajasthan<lb/> submitted that the &apos;ceilingarea&apos; had to be fixed with<lb/> reference to the notified date i.e. 1,4.1966 by the<lb/> statutory standards prescribed under the Chapter III<lb/> B of the &apos;1955 Act&apos;. The two legislations are<lb/> complementary to each other and constitute two tier<lb/> provisions. So far as the cases that attracted and fell<lb/> within Chapter IIIB of 1955 Act, as on 1.4.1966,<lb/> would continue to be governed by that law as the<lb/> rights and obligations created by the said Chapter III<lb/> B amounted to create rights and incur liabilities. Sri<lb/> Lodha submitted that the view taken by the High<lb/> Court was unexceptionable.<lb/> 27.<lb/> On a careful consideration of the matter, we are<lb/> inclined to agree with the view taken by the High<lb/> Court on the point. The reliance placed by appellants&apos;<lb/> learned Counsel on the provisions of Section of 1973<lb/> Act as detracting from the tenability of the conclusion<lb/> reached by the High Court on the point is, in our<lb/> opinion, somewhat tenuous. The contention of the<lb/> learned<lb/> Counsel<lb/> is<lb/> that<lb/> the<lb/> expression<lb/> &quot;notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in<lb/> any other law for the time being in force&quot; in Section<lb/> of the 1973 Act would exclude the operation of<lb/> Chapter IIIB of the &apos;1955 Act&apos; which, according to the<lb/> contention, even if kept alive would yet be a &apos;law for<lb/> the time being in force&apos; and, therefore, be excluded by<lb/> virtue of Section This contention has been negatived<lb/> by the High Court ...and in our opinion rightly ..by<lb/> placing reliance on the pronouncements of this Court<lb/> in Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh and Anr. v. The State of<lb/> Vindhya Pradesh and Chief Inspector of Mines v. K.C.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Thapar. The High Court held that the expression &quot;law<lb/> for the time being in force&quot; does not take within its<lb/> sweep a law &apos;deemed to be in force&apos; and that,<lb/> accordingly, the opening words of Section relied ,<lb/> upon by the Appellants&apos; learned Counsel will not have<lb/> an overriding effect so as to exclude the old law.<lb/></p>

			<head>28.<lb/></head>

			<p>A saving provision in a repealing statute is not<lb/> exhaustive of the rights and obligations so saved or<lb/> the rights that survive the repeal. It is observed by<lb/> this Court in I.T. Commissioner v. Shah Sadiq &amp; Sons<lb/> : (SCC p. 524, para 15)<lb/> ...In other words whatever rights are expressly<lb/> saved by the &apos;savings&apos; provision stand saved. But, that<lb/> does not mean that rights which are not saved by the<lb/> &apos;savings&apos; provision are extinguished or stand ipso facto<lb/> terminated by the mere fact that a new statute<lb/> repealing the old statute is enacted. Rights which<lb/> have accrued are saved unless they are taken away<lb/> expressly. This is the principle behind Section 6[c],<lb/> General Clauses Act, 1897...<lb/> We agree with the High Court that the scheme of the<lb/> 1973 Act does not manifest an intention contrary to,<lb/> and inconsistent with, the saving of the repealed<lb/> provisions of Section [6A] and Chapter IIIB of &apos;1955<lb/> Act&apos; so far as pending cases are concerned and that<lb/> the rights accrued and liabilities incurred under the<lb/> old law are not effaced. Appellant&apos;s contention <ref type="biblio">[a]</ref> is,<lb/> in our opinion, insubstantial.<lb/></p>

			<head>Re : Contention (b):<lb/> 29.<lb/></head>

			<p>This takes us to the next question whether in the<lb/> present cases even if the provisions of Section of the<lb/> Rajasthan General Clauses Act, 1955. are attracted,<lb/> the present cases did not involve any rights &quot;accrued&quot;<lb/> or obligations &quot;incurred&quot; so as to attract the old law<lb/> to them to support initiation or continuation of the<lb/> proceedings against the landholders after the repeal.<lb/> It was contended that even if the provisions of the old<lb/> Act were held to have been saved it could not be said<lb/> that there was any right accrued in favour of the<lb/> State or any liability incurred by the land holders in<lb/> the matter of determination of the &apos;ceilingarea&apos; so as<lb/> to attract to their cases the provisions of the old law.<lb/></p>

			<p>The point emphasised by the learned Counsel is that<lb/> the excessland would vest in the State only after the<lb/> completion of the proceedings and upon the land<lb/> holder signifying his choice as to the identify of the<lb/> land to be surrendered. Clauses <ref type="biblio">[c]</ref> and <ref type="biblio">[e]</ref> of Section<lb/> of the Rajasthan General Clauses Act, 1955, provide,<lb/> respectively, that the repeal of an enactment shall not,<lb/> unless a different intention appears, &quot;affect any right<lb/> privilege, obligation, or liability, acquired, accrued, or<lb/> incurred under any enactment so repealed&quot; or &quot;affect<lb/> any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in<lb/> respect of any such right, privilege, obligation,<lb/> liability, fine, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as<lb/> aforesaid&quot;.<lb/> 30.<lb/></p>

			<p>For purposes of these clauses the &quot;right&quot; must be<lb/> &quot;accrued&quot; and not merely an inchoate one.</p>

			<figure type="table">The<lb/> distinction between what is and what is not a right<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:39 :::<lb/> *120*<lb/> preserved by Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, it is<lb/> said, is often one of great fineness. What is unaffected<lb/> by the repeal is a right &apos;acquired&apos; or &apos;accrued&apos; under<lb/> the repealed statute and not &quot;a mere hope or<lb/> expectation&quot; of acquiring a right or liberty to apply<lb/> for a right.<lb/> 31.<lb/> In Lalji Raja v. Firm Hansraj Nathuram this Court<lb/> dealing with the distinction between the &quot;abstract<lb/> rights&quot; and &quot;specificrights&quot; for the purpose of the<lb/> operation of Section 6 of General Clauses Act said:<lb/> (SCC p. 728, para 16)<lb/> That a provision to preserve the right accrued<lb/> under a repealed Act &apos;was not intended to preserve the<lb/> abstract rights conferred by the repealed Act...It only<lb/> applies to specific rights given to an individual upon<lb/> happening of one or the other of the events specified<lb/> in statute&apos; -<lb/>See Lord Atkin&apos;s observations in<lb/> Hamilton Gell v. White. The mere right, existed at the<lb/> date of repealing statute, to take advantage of<lb/> provisions of the statute repealed is not a &apos;right<lb/> accrued&apos; within the meaning of the usual saving<lb/> clausesee Abbot v. Minister for Lands and G. Ogden<lb/> Industries pty. Ltd. v. Lucas.<lb/> 32.<lb/> ….....<lb/> 33.<lb/> …....<lb/> 34.<lb/> The rights and obligations under this provision had<lb/> had to be determined with reference to the notified<lb/> date i.e. 1.4.1966. Referring to analogous provision<lb/> of the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands [Ceiling on<lb/> Holdings] Act, 1961, this Court in Raghunath v.<lb/> Maharashtra observed: (SCC p. 397, para 17)<lb/></figure>

			<p>The scheme of the Act seems to be to determine<lb/> the ceiling area of each person [including a family]<lb/> with reference to the appointed day. The policy of the<lb/> Act appears to be that on and after the appointed day<lb/> no person in the State should be permitted to hold<lb/> any land in excess of the ceiling area as determined<lb/> under the Act and that ceiling area would be that<lb/> which is determined as on the appointed day.<lb/></p>

			<head>35.<lb/></head>

			<p>Again in Bhikoba Shankar Dhumal v. Mohan Lal<lb/> Punchand Thathed, it was observed: (SCC p.687,<lb/> para 13)<lb/></p>

			<head>A close reading of the aforesaid provisions of<lb/> the Act shows that the determination of the extent of<lb/> surplus land of a holder has to be made as on the<lb/> appointed day. If any person has at any time after the<lb/> fourth day of August, 1959, but before the appointed<lb/> day held any land [including any exempted land] in<lb/> excess of the ceiling area, such person should file a<lb/> return within the prescribed period from the<lb/> appointed day furnishing to each of the Collectors<lb/> within whose jurisdiction any land in his holding is<lb/> situated, in the form prescribed containing the<lb/> particulars of all land held by him. If any person<lb/> acquires, holds or comes into possession of any land<lb/> including any exempted land in excess of the ceiling<lb/> area on or after the appointed day, such person has to<lb/> furnish a return as stated above within the prescribed<lb/> period from the date of taking possession of any land<lb/> in excess of the ceiling area.<lb/> 36.<lb/></head>

			<p>A contention similar to the one urged for the<lb/> appellants here that the title respecting the surplus<lb/> land would vest in the Government upon such land<lb/> being taken possession of by Government after the<lb/> declaration regarding the surplus was noticed in that<lb/> case. But, it was held that the liability to surrender<lb/> the surplus land would date back to the appointed<lb/> day. This Court said: (SCC p.688, para 13)<lb/> Any other construction would make the Act<lb/> unworkable and the determination of the extent of<lb/> surplus land of a holder ambulatory and indefinite.<lb/></p>

			<head>This was again reiterated in State of Maharashtra v.<lb/> Annapurnabai. This Court said: (SCC p.275, para 4)<lb/> Section 21 of the Act no doubt states that the<lb/> title of the holder of the surplus land would become<lb/> vested in the State Government only on such land<lb/> being taken possession of after a declaration<lb/> regarding the surplus land is published in Official<lb/></head>

			<p>Gazette. But the liability to surrender the surplus<lb/> land relates back to the appointed day in case of those<lb/> who held land in excess of the ceiling on the<lb/> appointed day. Therefore, even if the holder dies<lb/> before declaration of any part of his land as surplus<lb/> land, the surplus land is liable to be determined with<lb/> reference to his holding on the appointed day...<lb/> 37.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is, therefore, seen that the right of the State to take<lb/> over excess land vested in it as on the appointed day<lb/> and only the quantification remained to be worked<lb/> out. As observed by Lord Morris, in Director of Public<lb/> Works v. Ho Po Sang : (ALL ER p.731)<lb/> It may be, therefore, that under some repealed<lb/> enactment, a right has been given, but that, in respect<lb/> of it, some investigation or legal proceeding is<lb/> necessary. The right is then unaffected and preserved,<lb/> It will be preserved even if a process of quantification<lb/> is necessary. But there is a manifest distinction<lb/> between an investigation in respect of a right and an<lb/> investigation which is to a decide whether some right<lb/> should be or should not be given. On repeal the<lb/> former is preserved by the Interpretation Act. The<lb/> latter is not.<lb/> 38.<lb/></p>

			<p>The above passage was referred to with approval in<lb/> M.S. Shivananda v. K.S.R.T.C..<lb/> 39.<lb/></p>

			<p>We agree with the High Court that the right of the<lb/> State to the excess land was not merely an inchoate<lb/> right under the Act, but a right &quot;accrued&quot; within the<lb/> meaning of Section [c] of the Rajasthan General<lb/> Clauses Act, 1955, and the liability of the landowner<lb/> to surrender the excess land as on 1.4.1966 was a<lb/> liability &quot;incurred&quot; also within the meaning of the<lb/> said provision.</p>

			<figure type="table">There is no substance in contention<lb/> [b] either.&quot;<lb/> 77<lb/> Mr.Naphade would urge that this judgment is distinguishable<lb/> because it pertains to a ceiling on agricultural lands. Secondly, the<lb/> judgment deals with a case where earlier law was repealed, but reenacted<lb/> in a different form. Yet the Legislature retained the earlier law, namely,<lb/> the Act of 1955. The factual matrix was, therefore, different. This<lb/> judgment would have no application to the point before us.<lb/> We are unable to agree with Mr.Naphade and for more than<lb/> one reason. The judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court and laying<lb/> down such principles cannot be brushed aside on a spacious plea that the<lb/> statute which was subject matter of the judgment was repealed, but<lb/> reenacted later. This is a judgment on Section 6 of the Rajasthan General<lb/> Clauses Act, 1955 and which is identical to Section 6 of the General<lb/> Clauses Act, 1897. Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 reads as<lb/> under:<lb/> &quot;6.<lb/> Effect of repeal: -Where this Act, or any [Central Act]<lb/> or Regulation made after the commencement of this<lb/> Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter<lb/> to be made, then, unless a different intention appears,<lb/> the repeal shall not -<lb/>(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the<lb/> time at which the repeal takes effect; or<lb/> (b) affect the previous operation of any enactment<lb/> so repealed or anything duly done or suffered<lb/> thereunder; or<lb/> (c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability<lb/> acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment so<lb/> repealed; or<lb/> (d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment<lb/> incurred in respect of any offence committed against<lb/> any enactment so repealed; or<lb/> (e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or<lb/> remedy in respect of any such right, privilege,<lb/> obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment<lb/> as aforesaid;<lb/></figure>

			<p>and any such investigation, legal proceeding or<lb/> remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and<lb/> any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be<lb/> imposed as if the repealing Act or Regulation had not<lb/> been passed.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>Section 6 of the General Clauses Act would show that the Honourable<lb/> Supreme Court emphasized that a saving provision in the repealing<lb/> statute is not exhaustive of the rights and obligations so saved or the<lb/> rights that survive the repeal. The line of inquiry as has been repeatedly<lb/> pointed out by the Honourable Supreme Court would be not whether the<lb/> new Act expressly keeps alive the old rights and liabilities, but whether it<lb/> manifests an intention to destroy them. Unless such an intention is<lb/> manifested by the new Act, the rights and liabilities under the repealed<lb/> Act will continue to exist by force of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is the repealing Act and not the Act repealed which is to manifest the<lb/> contrary intention so as to exclude the operation of Section 6 of the<lb/> General Clauses Act. The silence of the repealing Act is consistent and not<lb/> inconsistent with Section 6 applying. That is how we are of the opinion<lb/> that if this line of inquiry is carried forward it would show that the Repeal<lb/> Act did not manifest an intention contrary to Section 6 of the General<lb/></p>

			<p>Clauses Act. The nature of right that is claimed or in other words the<lb/> privilege being not absolute that all the more we are unable to accept<lb/> Mr.Naphade&apos;s arguments. The Honourable Supreme Court holds that the<lb/> scheme of the Act seems to be to determine the ceiling area of each<lb/> person with reference to the appointed day. Hence, the rights and<lb/> obligations under the provision had to be determined with reference to<lb/> the notified date. If that is so and in this case if the lands are in excess of<lb/> ceiling limit and some of them may have vested in the State already, then,<lb/> the exemption claimed from applicability of ChapterIII would not mean<lb/> that the character of the lands is in any way altered or their status is<lb/> changed. The date with reference to which the lands have become excess,<lb/> thus cannot be ignored while determining the nature of the rights and<lb/> privilege. All the more if such privilege or right is conditional as noted<lb/> above. In these circumstances we see no reason to deviate from the<lb/> principles in the case of Bansidhar (supra).<lb/></p>

			<figure>80<lb/> We are of the clear opinion that clauses (b) and (c) of Section<lb/> 6 of the General Clauses Act are thus, clearly attracted. Therefore, the<lb/> repeal will not affect the previous operation of the Principal Act or<lb/> anything duly done or suffered thereunder.<lb/> 81<lb/> In that regard, assistance can be taken of the judgment of the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court in the case of M/s Universal Imports Agency<lb/> v/s Chief Controller of Imports and Exports reported in AIR 1961 SC 41.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In paragraphs 16 to 18 of this decision this is what is held:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;16.<lb/> What were the &quot;things done&quot; by the petitioners under<lb/> the Pondicherry law ? The petitioners in the course of<lb/> their import trade, having obtained authorization for<lb/> the foreign exchange through their bankers, entered<lb/> into firm contracts with foreign dealers on C.I.F.<lb/> terms. In some cases irrevocable Letters of Credit were<lb/> opened and in others bank drafts were sent towards<lb/> the contracts. Under the terms of the contracts the<lb/> sellers had to ship the goods from various foreign<lb/> ports and the buyers were to have physical delivery of<lb/> the goods after they had crossed the customs barrier<lb/> in India. Pursuant to the terms of the contracts, the<lb/> sellers placed the goods on board the various ships,<lb/> some before and others after the merger, and the<lb/> goods arrived at Pondicherry port after its merger<lb/> with India. The prices for the goods were paid in full<lb/> to the foreign sellers and the goods were taken<lb/> delivery of by the buyers after examining them on<lb/> arrival. Before the merger if the Customs Authorities<lb/> had imposed any restrictions not authorized by law,<lb/> the affected parties could have enforced the free entry<lb/> of the goods in a court of law. On the said facts a<lb/> short question arises whether paragraph 6 of the<lb/> Order protects the petitioners. While learned counsel<lb/> for the petitioners contends that &quot;things done&quot; take in<lb/> not only things done but also their legal consequences,<lb/> learned counsel for the State contends that, as the<lb/> goods were not brought into India before the merger,<lb/> it was not a thing done before the merger and,<lb/> therefore, would be governed by the enactments<lb/> specified in the Schedule. It is not necessary to<lb/> consider in this case whether the concept of import<lb/> not only takes in the factual bringing of goods into<lb/> India, but also the entire process of import<lb/> commencing from the date of the application for<lb/> permission to import and ending with the crossing of<lb/> the customs barrier in India. The word &quot;things done&quot;<lb/> in paragraph 6 must be reasonably interpreted and, if<lb/> so interpreted, they can mean no only things done but<lb/> also the legal consequences flowing there from. If the<lb/> interpretation suggested by the learned counsel for the<lb/> respondents be accepted, the saving clause would<lb/> become unnecessary. If what it saves is only the<lb/> executed contracts, i.e., the contracts whereunder the<lb/> goods have been imported and received by the buyer<lb/> before the merger, no further protection is necessary<lb/> as ordinarily no question of enforcement of the<lb/> contracts under the preexisting law would arise. The<lb/> phraseology used is not an innovation but is copied<lb/> from other statutory clauses. Section 6 of the General<lb/> Clauses Act (X of 1897) says that unless a different<lb/> intention appears, the repeal of an Act shall not affect<lb/> anything duly done or suffered there under So too, the<lb/> Public Health Act of 1875 <ref type="biblio">(38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 55</ref>) which<lb/> repealed the Public Health Act of 1848 contained a<lb/> proviso to s. to the effect that the repeal &quot;shall not<lb/> affect anything duly done or suffered under the<lb/> enactment hereby repealed&quot;. This proviso came under<lb/> judicial scrutiny in The Queen v. Justices of the West<lb/> Riding of Yorkshire There notice was given by a local<lb/> board of health of intention to make a rate under the<lb/> Public Health Act, 1848, and amending Acts. Before<lb/> the notice had expired these Acts were repealed by the<lb/> Public Health Act, 1875, which contained a saving of<lb/> &quot;anything duly done&quot; under the repealed enactments<lb/> and gave power to make a similar rate upon giving a<lb/> similar notice. The board, in ignorance of the repeal,<lb/> made a rate purporting to be made under the<lb/> repealed Acts. It was contended that as the rate was<lb/> made after the repealing Act, the notice given under<lb/> the repealed Act was not valid. The learned Judges<lb/> held that as the notice was given before the Act, the<lb/> making of the rate was also saved by the words<lb/> &quot;anything duly done&quot; under the repealed enactments.<lb/> This case illustrates the point that it is not necessary<lb/> that an impugned thing in itself should have been<lb/> done before the Act was repealed, but it would be<lb/> enough if it was integrally connected with and was a<lb/> legal consequence of a thing done before the said<lb/> repeal. Under similar circumstances Lindley, L.J., in<lb/> Heston and Isleworth Urban district Council v. Grout<lb/> confirmed the validity of the rate made pursuant to a<lb/> notice issued prior to the repeal. Adverting to the<lb/> saving clause, the learned Judge tersely states the<lb/> principle thus at p. 313 : &quot;That to my mind preserves<lb/> that notice and the effect of it&quot;. On that principle the<lb/> Court of Appeal held that the rate which was the<lb/> effect of the notice was good.<lb/> 17.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is suggested that the phraseology of the saving<lb/> clause of the English Statutes and of the General<lb/> Clauses Act of 1897 are of wider import than that of<lb/> paragraph 6 of the Order and, therefore, the English<lb/> decisions are not of any assistance in considering the<lb/> scope of the saving clause of the Order. It is further<lb/> stated that the English decisions apply only to a<lb/> saving clause of an Act which repeals another but<lb/> preserves the right created by the latter. We do not see<lb/> any reason why the same construction cannot be<lb/> placed upon the wording of paragraph 6 of the Order<lb/> which is practically similar in terms as those found in<lb/> the relevant saving clause of the English Statute and<lb/> that of the General Clauses Act.<lb/> 18.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nor can we find any justification for the second<lb/> criticism. In the instant case the legal position is<lb/> exactly the same. By reason of the IndoFrench<lb/> Agreement the Government of India made the Order<lb/> under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act applying the Indian<lb/> laws to Pondicherry. The effect of that Order was that<lb/> the French laws were repealed by the application of<lb/> the Indian laws in the same field occupied by the<lb/> French laws subject to a saving clause. The position is<lb/> analogous to that of a statute repealing another with<lb/> a saving clause. If the English decisions apply to the<lb/> latter situation, we do not see how they do not apply<lb/> to the former. In both the cases the preexisting law<lb/> continues to govern the things done before a<lb/> particular date. We, therefore, hold that the words<lb/> &quot;things done&quot; in paragraph 6 of the Order are<lb/> comprehensive enough to take in a transaction<lb/> effected before the merger, though some of its legal<lb/> effects and consequences projected into the post<lb/> merger period.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Further in the case of Amadalavasa Cooperative Agricultural<lb/> and Industrial Society Limited v/s Union of India reported in AIR 1976 SC<lb/> 958 in the context of compulsory insurance scheme and whether that<lb/> survives with all attendant conditions upon repeal of the Principal Act,<lb/> namely, the Emergency Risks (Factories) Insurance Act, 1962 the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court held as under:<lb/></figure>

			<p>&quot;18.<lb/> The appellants challenged the finding of the High<lb/> Court that the liability to pay the evaded premia<lb/> arose during the currency of the Acts and contended<lb/> that the liability itself was dependent on the<lb/> ascertainment by the authorised officer of the<lb/> insurable value of the factory or goods in accordance<lb/> with the Third Schedule and that until the extent of<lb/> the liability was so ascertained, there could be no<lb/> liability and so, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act,<lb/> was not attracted. In other words, the contention was<lb/> that until the liability of the insured was determined<lb/> by the authorized officer by ascertaining the correct<lb/> insurable value in accordance with the provisions of<lb/> the Third Schedule, no liability to pay the evaded<lb/> premia arose and therefore, no liability was incurred<lb/> before the expiry of the Acts which could be enforced<lb/> under the provisions of Section 6 of the General<lb/></p>

			<figure>*129*<lb/> FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw<lb/></figure>

			<p>Clauses Act after their expiry.<lb/> 19.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is clear from the provisions of the Acts that the duty<lb/> to take out insurance policy for the full insurable<lb/> value of the factory or goods was mandatory and that<lb/> the failure to do so was an offence. Be sides, in the<lb/> case of failure to insure for the full insurable value,<lb/> provisions were made for recovery of the relative<lb/> premia. To effectuate this purpose, the procedure for<lb/> determination of the insurable value of the factory or<lb/> goods and of the premia evaded was also provided.<lb/> 20.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is no compulsion in a voluntary insurance that<lb/> the cover should be made for the entire insurable<lb/> value of the property. The premium collected in a<lb/> voluntary insurance is related to the quantum of the<lb/> risk undertaken in the light of the insurable value<lb/> suggested by the insured. Generally, in a voluntary<lb/> insurance the premium is paid in consideration of the<lb/> cover provided. In other words, premium is paid in<lb/> order to enable the insurer to indemnify the insured<lb/> against loss or damage on account of the risk<lb/> specified. The scheme of insurance envisaged by the<lb/> Acts was different. There was no element of consensus<lb/> on the fundamental terms of insurance in the scheme.<lb/> The liability to take insurance policy for the full<lb/> insurable value of the factory or goods was<lb/> compulsory. The terms and conditions of the policy to<lb/> be taken were governed solely by the provisions of the<lb/> Acts and the Schemes. It is a mistake to assume that<lb/> the rights and liabilities of the parties in this<lb/> statutory scheme were similar, to those of a voluntary<lb/> contract of insurance, If the liability to take the<lb/> insurance policy for the full insurable value was<lb/> absolute, and if the terms and conditions of insurance<lb/> were settled by the terms of the statutes and the<lb/> Schemes read with the Schedules, there is no merit in<lb/> the contention of counsel for the appellants that the<lb/> obligation of the President as insurer was same as<lb/> that of an insurer in a contract of voluntary<lb/> insurance. The liability to pay premia in case of<lb/> undervaluation was not dependent upon the<lb/> subsequent determination of the full insurable value<lb/> of the factory or goods insured. If the factory or goods<lb/> was undervalued, when the insurance policy was<lb/> taken, the liability to pay premia on the basis of the<lb/> full insurable value arose at the time when the policy<lb/> was taken. That liability was not dependent upon the<lb/> ascertainment of the full insurable value by the<lb/> authorised officer in accordance with the Third<lb/> Schedule.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>83<lb/></head>

			<p>Once the repeal of the Principal Act has been understood not<lb/> to affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability accrued or incurred<lb/> under the Repealed Act, then, we do not find that the Repeal Act in this<lb/> case has manifested an intention contrary to applicability of Section 6 of<lb/> the General Clauses Act.<lb/></p>

			<head>84<lb/></head>

			<p>When the word and expression used is &quot;obligation or liability<lb/> incurred under any Repealed Act&quot;, then, the term &quot;liability&quot; is understood<lb/> to be of large and comprehensive significance and when construed in its<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">usual and ordinary sense in which it is commonly employed it expresses<lb/> the state of being under obligation in law or in justice [see AIR 1959<lb/> Punjab 328 (First National Bank Limited v/s Seth Sant Lal)].<lb/> 85<lb/> A Full Bench of Delhi High Court in the case of Mohd. Yaqub<lb/> v/s Union of India reported in AIR 1971 Delhi 45 followed the above<lb/> Punjab High Court&apos;s view and held that the liability is the state of being<lb/> bound or obliged in law or justice. In Black&apos;s Law Dictionary the word<lb/> &quot;liability&quot; is defined to mean &quot;the state of being bound or obliged in law<lb/> or justice to do, pay or make good something; legal responsibility&quot;. It is,<lb/> therefore, a word of widest import meaning an obligation or duty to do<lb/> something or to refrain from doing something. [see paras 13 to 16 of AIR<lb/> 1971 Delhi 45].<lb/> We cannot, therefore, be unmindful of the fact that the words<lb/> &quot;liability incurred&quot; have been construed as very general and<lb/> comprehensive and ordinarily taking both civil and criminal liability. [See<lb/> Kapur Chand Pokhraj v/s State of Bombay AIR 1958 SC 993].<lb/> 87<lb/> Such being the position in law we cannot accept<lb/> Mr.Naphade&apos;s contentions that the judgment of the Honourable Supreme<lb/> Court in the case of Bansidhar (supra) would not apply.<lb/> 88<lb/> We are further not in agreement with Mr.Naphade that<lb/> Bansidhar&apos;s case (supra) was confined to agricultural ceiling law and<lb/> reenactment thereof. Even with regard to the Principal Act before us it has<lb/> been held by our Court in Sadashiv Durgaji Ambhore v/s State of<lb/> Maharashtra reported in 1992 Mh.L.J. 1300 as under:<lb/> &quot;8.<lb/> Coming to the scheme of the U.L.C. Act it is crystal<lb/> clear that no person can retain vacant land in urban<lb/> area more than the prescribed ceiling limit. The excess<lb/> or better still the surplus land has to vest in the State.<lb/> There can thus be no question of escaping the<lb/> prohibition imposed by the statute, the validity of<lb/> which is already tested before. Therefore, once the<lb/> surplus land is determined by the Competent<lb/> Authority the original owner has no right over such<lb/> land and in due course those lands must vest in the<lb/> State.<lb/> 9.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Looking to the aforestated objectives as well as the<lb/> scheme of the U.L.C. Act, the lands which are found to<lb/> be in excess of the prescribed limit can never revert<lb/> back to the owner under any of the circumstances. It<lb/> must end with the vesting of such surplus lands with<lb/> the State Government. Otherwise the very object and<lb/> purpose for which the Act has been enacted would<lb/> frustrate and the holder of excess land would<lb/> contravene the provisions of Section 3 exposing him<lb/> to prosecution for offence under Section 38 of the Act.<lb/> 10.<lb/></p>

			<p>One more aspect that falls for consideration is the use<lb/> of the word &quot;may&quot; in Subsection (3) of Section 10 of<lb/> the U.L.C. Act. The said section reads as under:<lb/> &quot;10(3) At any time after the publication of the<lb/> notification under Subsection (1) the competent<lb/> authority may, by notification published in the<lb/> Official Gazette of the State concerned declare that<lb/> the excess: and referred to in the notification<lb/> published under Subsection (1) shall, with effect<lb/> from such date as may be specified in the declaration,<lb/> be deemed to have been acquired by the State<lb/> Government and upon the publication of such<lb/> declaration, such land shall be deemed to have vested<lb/> absolutely in the State Government free from all<lb/> encumbrances with effect from the date so specified.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>The use of word &quot;may&quot; after the words &quot;the competent<lb/> authority&quot; and before the words &quot;by notification<lb/> published in Official Gazette …......&quot; will have to be<lb/> construed as &quot;shall&quot; if the object and purpose of the<lb/> U.L.C. Act as discussed above have to be achieved. The<lb/> word &quot;may&quot; though primarily permissive is in certain<lb/> circumstances to be treated as mandatory and those<lb/> circumstances are available looking to the scheme of<lb/> the Act.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>89<lb/></head>

			<p>Therefore, the land which is vacant and in excess of ceiling<lb/></p>

			<figure>limit on the date of commencement of the Act is subject to ChapterIII of<lb/> the Principal Act and its application thereto is undisputed. If such<lb/> undisputed absolute application is the position emerging from the statute<lb/> and because of an exceptional circumstance the applicability is held in<lb/> abeyance, then, it is not open to those persons holding such lands to<lb/> contend that the Principal Act has been repealed, therefore, it&apos;s<lb/> applicability to the lands in question will not survive the repeal. If as<lb/> contended by the learned Advocate General the exemption keeps in<lb/> abeyance the applicability of ChapterIII till such exemption order is in<lb/> force and does not rule out the applicability of the Principal Act, then, we<lb/> cannot accept the arguments of the learned Senior Counsel for the<lb/> Petitioners to the contrary. Realizing this position, Mr.Naphade and other<lb/> Senior Counsel toned down their submissions to some extent. They urged<lb/> that Section 10 of the Principal Act is the heart of the Principal Act and<lb/> once the consequences of subsection (3) of Section 10 of the Principal<lb/> Act cannot be visited on the Petitioners after repeal of the Principal Act,<lb/> then, a contrary intention is manifested. If we hold that such contrary<lb/> intention is not manifested and Section 6 of the General Clauses Act<lb/> applies to the repeal in question, then, that would result in inconsistency<lb/> and absurdity. This argument is premised on the fact that subsection (2)<lb/> of Section 20 of the Principal Act is not saved and that is not specifically<lb/> referred in clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act and<lb/> hence, the above result will follow.<lb/> 90<lb/> For the reasons that we have set out hereinabove it will not<lb/> be possible to accept any of these contentions. Firstly, as understood in<lb/> the case of clause (a) of Section 20(1) of the Principal Act the exemption<lb/> is granted qua the excess vacant land and bearing in mind the factors and<lb/> circumstances indicated therein. Secondly, it is an exemption granted in<lb/> public interest and to subserve it. Thirdly, even if the exemption is<lb/> granted under clause (b) of Section 20(1) that is to relieve the undue<lb/> hardship. Under both clauses the exemption order could be conditional. If<lb/> the validity of the exemption order together with the conditions is saved<lb/> and equally any action taken thereunder, then, it will not be proper to<lb/> hold that the exemption order and conditions therein cannot be enforced<lb/> by recourse to the Principal Act. That is because if the exemption is a right<lb/> as is claimed, then, it is conditional. It is a right accrued, but the<lb/> conditions subject to which that right accrues cannot be ignored. Those<lb/> conditions are linked to the right and privilege acquired or accrued. If<lb/> that condition is in the nature of obligation or liability attached to the<lb/> privilege or right, then, a different intention not being spelled out that is<lb/> saved despite the repeal. The reasons, therefore, indicated above would<lb/> take care of these submissions of the learned Senior Counsel appearing<lb/> for the Petitioners and are enough to reject them.<lb/> 91<lb/> If an intention was to the contrary as urged by the learned<lb/> Senior Counsel for the Petitioners, then, there was no need for the<lb/> Parliament to have save the validity of any exemption order under sub<lb/> section (1) of Section 20 of the Principal Act or any action taken<lb/> thereunder and declare the same to be not affected by repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary.<lb/></figure>

			<p>There may have been cases before repeal of the Principal Act in which<lb/> there was challenge to the exemption orders or to the conditions<lb/> thereunder. Some of these challenges may have succeeded. The validity of<lb/> the exemption order may have been put in issue and even such<lb/> pronouncements of the court may affect the order granting exemption or<lb/> any action taken thereunder. Now, because of Section 3(1)(b) of the<lb/> Repeal Act, it is apparent that the order or condition or action is not<lb/> invalid. It is declared to be valid by the Repeal Act and, therefore, the<lb/> repeal of the Principal Act was not to affect the validity of such an order.<lb/></p>

			<p>In other words during subsistence of the Principal Act and when it was in<lb/> force the exemption order or condition thereunder or any action taken<lb/> thereunder may have been declared invalid by a court of law. Now,<lb/> notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary the validity of<lb/> exemption order is saved. That is saved expressly so as to not take away<lb/> its legal effects. The intent is not to affect adversely the legal<lb/> consequences flowing from such valid order. Hence, far from manifesting<lb/> or demonstrating a contrary intention, Section 3 of the Repeal Act is<lb/> consistent and in consonance with the applicability of Section 6 of the<lb/> General Clauses Act. In these circumstances we are of the view that the<lb/> principle laid down in the afore noted cases including Bansidhar (supra)<lb/> would squarely apply.<lb/></p>

			<p>92<lb/> That leaves us with only one argument of Mr.Sridharan and<lb/> he submits that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act will not apply<lb/> because the Repeal Act has to be adopted in terms of subsection (<ref type="formula">3</ref></p>

) of<lb/> Section 1 of the Repeal Act by the States other than the States of Haryana<lb/> and Punjab. He relied upon Article 252 of the Constitution of India and<lb/> particularly clause (2) thereof.<lb/> 93<lb/> We are unable to accept his contentions and for obvious<lb/> reasons. Article 252 of the Constitution of India confers power in the<lb/> Parliament to legislate for two or more States by consent and adoption of<lb/> such legislation by any other State. Clause (2) thereof states that any Act<lb/> passed by the Parliament may be amended or repealed by an Act of<lb/> Parliament passed or adopted in like manner, namely, as set out in clause<lb/> (1) of Article 252 of the Constitution of India by any State to which it<lb/> applies, but the State Legislature of that State cannot amend or repeal<lb/> any Act of the Parliament on its own. That it has to adopt it by resolution<lb/> passed in that behalf is clear by clause (1) of Article 252. However, we do<lb/> not find anything in the language of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act<lb/> which would enable us to hold that the same does not apply in the<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 :::<lb/> *136*<lb/> situation with which we are concerned. It will have to be clarified that the<lb/> Principal Act in the case is the Central Act. It has been made after<lb/> commencement of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Equally, the Repeal Act<lb/> is an Act of Parliament made after the General Clauses Act. Just as the<lb/> Principal Act had the section of applicability and applied at once to some<lb/></figure>

			<p>States, but had to be adopted by other States and a resolution had to be<lb/> passed in that behalf, similarly, the Repeal Act also contains identical<lb/> provisions. Merely because the Repeal Act has to be adopted and comes<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">into force in the State which it adopts upon passing of the resolution by<lb/> the House of that State will not mean that Section 6 of the General<lb/> Clauses Act does not apply. The applicability of Section 6 of the General<lb/> Clauses Act has to be seen qua the Repeal Act. Mr.Sridharan does not<lb/> dispute that it applies to the Repeal Act. His argument is that because of<lb/> adoption of the Repeal Act by resolution of the House of the State of<lb/> Maharashtra, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act will not apply. The<lb/> resolution merely adopts the Repeal Act made by the Parliament in the<lb/> State. If Section 6 of the General Clauses Act applies to the Repeal Act<lb/> and that is how its applicability is being tested, then, the argument of<lb/> Mr.Sridharan need not detain us.<lb/> 94<lb/> Reliance that Mr.Sridharan placed upon the judgment in the<lb/> case of Kolhapur Canesugar Works Limited v/s Union of India reported in<lb/> (2000) 2 SCC 536 is entirely misplaced. There, the Honourable Supreme<lb/> Court was concerned with a situation as to whether Section 6 of the<lb/> General Clauses Act, which is applicable to repeal of enactments by a<lb/> Central Act or Regulation, would apply in the case of either omission or<lb/> rule. The Constitution Bench held that this Section 6 cannot apply in case<lb/> of omission of a rule and the term regulation in Section 6 of the General<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 :::<lb/></figure>

			<p>Clauses Act has specific legal connotation. That has been defined legally<lb/> and in that regard the definitions of the terms &quot;enactment&quot;, &quot;regulation&quot;<lb/> and &quot;Central Act&quot; have been noted in paragraphs 18 and 19. These<lb/> definitions are to be found in the General Clauses Act itself. Since a mere<lb/> rule would not be covered by the term &quot;regulation&quot; as defined that the<lb/> Constitution Bench held that going by Section 3(51) of the General<lb/> Clauses Act Section 6 has no applicability in the case of omission of a rule.<lb/></p>

			<p>We do not see how this judgment can have any applicability in our case.<lb/></p>

			<p>Rather the observations in paragraph 32 of this judgment clarify the<lb/> position that so long as a &quot;Rule&quot; takes its colour from the definition of the<lb/> terms in the General Clauses Act the repeal of the same cannot be<lb/> construed in the light of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act.<lb/></p>

			<figure>95<lb/> In that regard, reliance placed by the learned Advocate<lb/> General on the judgment of the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh<lb/> High Court reported in AIR 1979 Madhya Pradesh 108 (Rajendra Kumar<lb/> v/s State of Madhya Pradesh) is appropriate. In paragraph 7 of this<lb/> decision the Division Bench clarified the legal position that when the<lb/> Parliament passes an Act with the consent of States the Act so passed<lb/> cannot be classified as a State Act. Further, the Division Bench clarified<lb/> the legal position in the context of Article 252 of the Constitution of India<lb/> as well. (See paras 4 and 8). Mr.Sridharan&apos;s arguments overlook the fact<lb/> that the Repeal Act has merely been adopted by the State of Maharashtra<lb/> by passing a resolution by the Legislature of that State and therefore, it is<lb/> not the resolution of the State Assembly with regard to which we are<lb/> looking at the applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act.<lb/> Mr.Sridharan, therefore, rightly canvassed alternate arguments and which<lb/> are more or less on the same lines as that of Mr.Naphade and other Senior<lb/> Counsel. Additionally, Mr.Sridharan submitted that Section 3 of the<lb/> Repeal Act and particularly clause (b) of subsection (1) thereof is a<lb/> special saving and saves only that which is specifically mentioned. There<lb/> is no room for any implication or reading into it something which is not<lb/> specifically mentioned therein. It is his argument that it is not a validating<lb/> statute or clause. It saves a subordinate legislation according to him.<lb/> 96<lb/> None of these arguments are sound in law. We are concerned<lb/> with Section 3 of the Repeal Act which is titled &quot;saving&quot;, but subsection<lb/> (1) thereof states that the repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect and<lb/> what it is not affected thereby is set out in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of sub<lb/> section (1) of Section 3. By clause (a) the repeal will not affect the vesting<lb/> of any vacant land under Section 10(3), possession of which has been<lb/> taken over by the State Government. If the intention was to obliterate and<lb/> wipe out everything, then, there was no need to insert clause (a) as well.<lb/> Clause (a) has been inserted so as to save the vesting of the land under<lb/> Section 10(3) and which is in possession of the State Government. The<lb/> Legislature was aware that in the light of the repeal of the Principal Act it<lb/> would be necessary to save the vesting inasmuch as subsection (3) of<lb/> Section 10 of the Principal Act itself speaks of vesting of the excess vacant<lb/> land in the State absolutely free from all encumbrances upon its deemed<lb/> acquisition. That deemed acquisition results after a declaration is<lb/> published in the official Gazette in terms of Section 10(3). The Parliament<lb/> stepped into to save only such vesting which has resulted in the land<lb/> being taken over by the State Government and not otherwise. By a mere<lb/> declaration in terms of Section 10(3) the vesting which otherwise takes<lb/> place would not be saved if in pursuance thereof the land is not taken<lb/> over by the State. Therefore, it is incorrect to urge that Section 3 of the<lb/> Repeal Act saves a subordinate legislation. Clause (a) of subsection (1) of<lb/> Section 3 of the Repeal Act is a substantive provision and the repeal<lb/> clearly affects the vesting of land of which possession has not been taken<lb/> because by subsection (2) of Section 3 such land can be restored. Hence,<lb/> a situation where there is a declaration issued and contained in the<lb/> notification contemplated by Section 10(3) of the Principal Act, but the<lb/> State failed to act in pursuance thereof and has not exercised it&apos;s power<lb/> under subsections (5) and (6) of Section 10 of the Principal Act, is dealt<lb/> with by Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. By clause (b) a substantive<lb/> provision has been made and to deal with a different situation, namely,<lb/> the excess vacant land and which may or may not be covered by<lb/> declaration under Section 10(3), but which is exempted in exercise of the<lb/> statutory power conferred vide Section 20(1) of the Principal Act. It is the<lb/> exercise of that power to exempt and all consequences which follow a<lb/> valid exemption order that are saved by clause (b). This is as set out<lb/> above not only saving the validity of order granting exemption, but any<lb/> action taken thereunder and notwithstanding anything in any judgment<lb/> of any court to the contrary. One more aspect or matter is dealt with by<lb/> clause (c) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act inasmuch as if<lb/> for granting exemption under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act there is a<lb/> condition to make payment to the State Government and if the payment<lb/> is made in compliance thereof, then, that payment made to the State<lb/> Government is also saved. Therefore, on reading Sections 3 and 4 of the<lb/> Repeal Act it is not possible to accept the arguments of Mr.Sridharan that<lb/> only a subordinate legislation is saved either by Repeal Act or Section 3.<lb/> Had it not been so Mr.Sridharan would not have further alternatively<lb/> argued and adopted the contentions of Mr.Naphade and others that the<lb/> power to withdraw the exemption or initiate an action under Section<lb/> 20(2) of the Principal Act is not saved or does not survive the repeal.<lb/> 97<lb/> We have already dealt with that argument and rejected it for<lb/> the reasons set out above. A faint attempt was made by Mr.Sridharan to<lb/> show that clause (b) has been inserted in subsection (1) of Section 3 of<lb/> the Repeal Act to protect the rights of innocent third parties or action<lb/> under the exemption orders which may affect them. It is not a substantive<lb/> provision and by no stretch of imagination revives the Principal Act is his<lb/> argument. We fail to see as to how in the absence of clause (b) a power of<lb/> exemption once exercised and when the Principal Act was in force, but<lb/> that order or any action taken thereunder being declared invalid that<lb/> could have survived the repeal even with the aid of Section 6 of the<lb/> General Clauses Act, 1897. In other words, it could have been argued that<lb/> not only there should be a power of exemption exercised, but the order in<lb/> that behalf or any action taken thereunder should have been valid, lawful<lb/> and subsisting on the date of the Repeal Act or at least when it came into<lb/> force. It could have been then said that only in such a situation that the<lb/> order would survive the repeal even without insertion of clause (b) in<lb/> subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act with the aid of Section 6 of<lb/> the General Clauses Act. To get over this situation and position a<lb/> substantive provision has been made in the Repeal Act which says that the<lb/> repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the validity of any order<lb/> granting exemption under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act or any action<lb/> taken thereunder notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the<lb/> contrary. This is a substantive provision and read together with other<lb/> clauses of subsections (1) and (2) of Section 3 and Section 4 of the<lb/> Repeal Act, so also, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and<lb/> harmoniously does not revive the Principal Act as is urged, but saves the<lb/> exemption order in exercise of the powers conferred by the Principal Act<lb/> or any action taken thereunder by declaring it to be valid notwithstanding<lb/> any judgment of any court to the contrary. That would be the correct<lb/> reading of the provisions or else Mr.Sridharan would not have still further<lb/> argued that clause (c) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act<lb/> does not save the liability incurred under the exemption order, but only<lb/> saves the payment made to the State Government. This further alternate<lb/> argument itself would show that Mr.Sridharan is not on a strong and<lb/> sound legal footing in urging that Section 3 of the Repeal Act is not a<lb/> substantive provision. That it is titled as &quot;savings&quot;, but contains the<lb/> substantive provisions which do not show any contrary intention to<lb/> applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is what is held by us<lb/> hereinabove. A correct and proper reading of clause (c) of Section 3(1) of<lb/> the Repeal Act would be that the Legislature had in mind a conditional<lb/> exemption order. One of the conditions could have been of making<lb/> payment to the State Government for granting exemption under Section<lb/> 20(1) of the Principal Act. If the power to exempt does not survive the<lb/> repeal, but the intent was to save the power to exempt already exercised<lb/> conditionally or otherwise that the Legislature stepped in to save even<lb/> payment made to the State Government for grant of such exemption. That<lb/> is because a beneficiary of the exercise of power of exemption should not,<lb/> post repeal of the Principal Act, urge that the State has no right to retain<lb/> the amount paid by him, but must refund it. That he has already made<lb/> payment and the power to exempt having been exercised when the<lb/> Principal Act was in force that it is clarified that the payment made to the<lb/> Government as a condition for granting exemption would survive the<lb/> Repeal. That is to take care of the plea that such payment will no longer<lb/> be valid as the exemption comes to an end post repeal. Therefore, in<lb/> order to declare that the power of exemption once exercised would<lb/> survive the repeal and equally the condition of payment thereunder that<lb/> clauses (b) and (c) have been inserted.<lb/> 98<lb/> We find that Mr.Sridharan is not right in placing reliance on<lb/> the judgments of the Honourable Supreme Court firstly in the case of Shri<lb/> Prithvi Cotton Mills Limited v/s Broach Borough Municipality reported in<lb/> 2000 (123) ELT page 3 (SC). There, the Honourable Supreme Court was<lb/> considering a case of the rate on the lands and buildings imposed under<lb/> the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act, 1925. Certain Assessees challenged<lb/> the imposition of these rates and filed the Writ Petitions to question it and<lb/> get the assessment cancelled. During the pendency of the Writ Petitions<lb/> the Legislature of Gujarat passed the Gujarat Imposition of Taxes by<lb/> Municipalities (Validation) Act, 1963. The Writ Petitions were, therefore,<lb/> amended and the Validation Act was questioned. The Honourable<lb/> Supreme Court, therefore, was considering the validity and legality of<lb/></figure>

			<figure type="table">Section 3 of this Validation Act. It is in that context that the observations<lb/> regarding a Validating Statute have been made. We do not see as to how<lb/> this judgment can have any application in the light of our conclusions<lb/> recorded hereinabove. This judgment is, therefore, clearly distinguishable.<lb/> 99<lb/> Equally, misplaced is the reliance on the judgment of the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v/s West Coast<lb/> Paper Mills Limited reported in 2004 (164) ELT 375 (SC). There, the<lb/> question was as to whether the appeal can be considered as continuation<lb/> of the suit. We do not find how this judgment can assist Mr.Sridharan in<lb/> his arguments on the Reference before us.<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 :::<lb/> *143*<lb/> FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw<lb/> 100<lb/> Once we have held that neither the power to exempt can be<lb/> said to be legislative nor can it be held that the Repeal Act saves the<lb/> subordinate legislation, then, no assistance can be derived from the<lb/> judgment in the case of Air India V/s Union of India reported in (1995) 4<lb/> SCC 734. Rather some of the observations therein and particularly<lb/> reference to Bennion on Statutory Interpretation in paragraph 7 of this<lb/> judgment would assist us and reinforce our above conclusions.<lb/> 101<lb/> We are not in agreement with Mr.Naphade that the power to<lb/> exempt conferred by Section 20 of the Principal Act is legislative in<lb/> nature. We are of the clear opinion that this power is QuasiJudicial in<lb/> nature. The nature of this power is to exempt the excess vacant lands. In<lb/> other words, they are vacant lands in excess of ceiling limit. They are<lb/> exempted from the provisions or applicability of ChapterIII on the<lb/> satisfaction reached and which is to be found in clause (a) and clause (b)<lb/> of subsection (1) of this provision. In a decision reported in AIR 1982<lb/> Madhya Pradesh 33 (Nandakishore v/s State of M.P.), the Division Bench<lb/> of Madhya Pradesh High Court held as under:<lb/> &quot;5.<lb/> …..... Clause (a) of Subsection (1) of Section 20 of<lb/> the Act empowers the State Government to exempt<lb/> any vacant land in public interest; whereas Clause (b)<lb/> thereof empowers the State Government to grant<lb/> exemption to any person who holds vacant land in<lb/> excess of the ceiling limit, where such exemption is<lb/> considered necessary to avoid undue hardship to such<lb/> person. The second schedule to the Act inter alia<lb/> prescribes Rs.10/ as courtfees stamp to be paid on<lb/> an application for exemption of vacant land under<lb/> Section 20 of the Act. The power to exempt so<lb/> conferred on the State Government carries with it an<lb/> obligation to exercise that power on a case being<lb/> made out for the purpose. Of course, the power to<lb/> exempt is exercisable by the State Government on its<lb/> own motion, but the same can be exercised otherwise<lb/> also. This is what flows from the use of the expression<lb/> &quot;either on its own motion or otherwise&quot; used in<lb/> Clauses</figure>

			<figure>(a) and (b) of Section 20(1) of the Act. The<lb/> words &quot;or otherwise&quot; cannot be construed ejusdem<lb/> generis and are indicative of the fact that the power is<lb/> exercisable on being invoked in any other manner. The<lb/> natural corollary of this position of law is that the<lb/> petitioners have right to submit a petition invoking<lb/> the exercise of the power of exemption so conferred on<lb/> the State Government. This Legislative intendment is<lb/> also clear from the provision of courtfee on an<lb/> application for exemption of vacant land under<lb/> Section 20 of the Act made in Schedule as stated<lb/> above. The power to exempt by its very nature in cases<lb/> to which Clause (a) of Section 20(<ref type="formula">1</ref>) of the Act is<lb/> applicable, appears to be exercisable in public interest;<lb/> whereas so far as Clause (b) of Section 20(1) of the<lb/> Act is concerned, the power is exercisable for the<lb/> benefit of the holders so that undue hardship on<lb/> account of operation of the Act may be avoided. In<lb/> present case the petitioners appear to invoke the<lb/> power vested in the State Government under Section<lb/> 20(1)(b) of the Act. Now, in order that the power to<lb/> exempt may be exercised under the aforesaid Clause<lb/> (b), it is necessary that the State Government should<lb/> be satisfied that the application of the provisions of<lb/> the Chapter III (in which Section 20 is placed) would<lb/> cause undue hardship to the person who holds the<lb/> vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit. On a case of<lb/> undue hardship being made out, the State<lb/> Government may by order exempt subject to such<lb/> conditions, if any, as may be specified in the order,<lb/> such vacant land from the provisions of the said<lb/> Chapter. Thus in essence the provision is for the<lb/> benefit of the holder and its object appears to be to<lb/> grant exemption so as to avert causing of undue<lb/> hardship to him by operation of the law. If the State<lb/> Government feels satisfied that a case has been made<lb/> out for grant of exemption claimed, then an order of<lb/> exemption may be passed even without hearing the<lb/> claimant. An order in favour of a party can be passed<lb/> behind his back even. But the question is whether an<lb/> order affecting the interests of the claimant adversely<lb/> can be passed without hearing him. Having regard to<lb/> the object which the provisions placed in Section<lb/> 20(1)(b) of the Act have to achieve and also having<lb/> regard to the serious consequences which will ensue in<lb/> case the claim for exemption is rejected without<lb/> hearing the claimant, it has to be held that the<lb/> claimant has to be heard before refusal of his claim<lb/> for exemption, so that he may show that there will be<lb/> undue hardship to him in case exemption is not<lb/> granted. Section 20(1)(b) of the Act does not negate<lb/> natural justice and in absence of express exclusion of<lb/> the rule of audi alteram partem, it is fair, indeed<lb/> fundamental, that the person claiming exemption<lb/> should not be prejudiced by action without<lb/> opportunity to show the contrary.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.<lb/></head>

			<p>The power of exemption has the effect of restoring the<lb/> applicability of the general law by taking away the<lb/> exemption to it created by the special law,<lb/> Accordingly, the power to claim exemption is a<lb/> valuable right. Where under the provisions of an Act<lb/> an authority is empowered to grant exemption and a<lb/> person has a right to claim it on fulfilment of<lb/> statutory conditions, the authority is bound to hear<lb/> him and pass a speaking order giving reasons in<lb/> support of its finding that he is not entitled to the<lb/> exemption.<lb/></p>

			<head>7.<lb/> Faced with this situation Shri Kulshreshtra contended<lb/> that the satisfaction postulated by the aforesaid<lb/> provision is subjective satisfaction merely and that in<lb/> absence of a corresponding provision in Clause (b) of<lb/> Section 20(1) for giving an opportunity of hearing, as<lb/> placed in Subsection</head>

			<p>(2) of Section 20 of the Act,<lb/> hearing of the petitioners prior to passing of the<lb/> impugned order was not necessary.<lb/></p>

			<head>8.<lb/> Satisfaction of the State Government contemplated by<lb/> cl. (b) of Section 20</head>

			<p>(1) of the Act has to be with<lb/> regard to the nature of hardship, which would be<lb/> caused to the claimant. Accordingly, the satisfaction<lb/> envisaged has to be objective in its character and<lb/> cannot be subjective satisfaction merely, the<lb/> touchstone for testing the validity or otherwise of the<lb/> satisfaction having been provided by the law. The<lb/> function of the State Government accordingly is of a<lb/> quasijudicial character.<lb/></p>

			<head>9.<lb/></head>

			<p>It is true that unlike Subsection (<ref type="formula">2</ref>) of Section 20 in<lb/> Clause (b) there is no specific provision for giving a<lb/> reasonable opportunity to the person concerned, but<lb/> from the language employed therein and in view of<lb/> the object which the provision has to achieve it has to<lb/> be regarded that acting upon the principle of natural<lb/> justice regarding hearing of the claimant is necessary<lb/> while deciding his claim for exemption thereunder. A<lb/> bare perusal of the impugned order will show that it<lb/> has been passed in accordance with the order passed<lb/> by the State Government in the department of Land<lb/> Records and Settlement on 2311980 rejecting the<lb/> application of the petitioners for grant of exemption.<lb/> It is not shown that the petitioners were either heard<lb/> by the State Government prior to passing of the order<lb/> conveyed vide Annexure R/5, to the Deputy<lb/> Commissioner of Land Records and Settlement, who<lb/> passed the order contained in Annexure P/2, in<lb/> pursuance thereof .<lb/></p>

			<p>10.<lb/> …...<lb/></p>

			<head>11.<lb/> Another contention put forth by Shri Kulshrestra was<lb/> that in view of the proviso to Clause (b), recording of<lb/> reasons is necessary only in case of grant of<lb/> exemption. This contention does not merit acceptance.<lb/></head>

			<p>The expression &quot;no order under this clause&quot; is wide<lb/> enough to cover the order of grant as well as refusal.<lb/></p>

			<p>Even otherwise, if in case of granting exemption<lb/> reasons are required to be stated it beats ones<lb/> imagination how in cases of rejection a claim for<lb/> exemption recording of reasons can be regarded to be<lb/> unnecessary.<lb/></p>

			<p>12.<lb/> Lastly, it was contended by Shri Kulshrestra that the<lb/> use of the word &quot;may&quot; in Clause (b) of Section 20(1)<lb/> of the Act does show that the power is discretionary<lb/> and if in its discretion the State Government have<lb/> rejected the application no challenge can be<lb/> entertained against the order of rejection. The<lb/> contention advanced by Shri Kulshrestra on the point<lb/> overlook the principle of law that when power is given<lb/> to a public authority, there may be circumstances<lb/> which couple with the power a duty to exercise it.<lb/></p>

			<p>Where a power is deposited with a public officer for<lb/> this purpose of being used for the benefit of persons<lb/> specifically pointed out with regard to whom a<lb/> definition is supplied by the legislature of the<lb/> conditions upon which they are entitled to call for its<lb/> exercise, that power ought to be exercised.</p>

			<figure type="table">See<lb/> Jullius v. Lord Bishon of Oxford, ((187480) ALL ER<lb/> Rep. 43 (HL) at p.47. Viewed from this angle, it<lb/> appears that the provisions placed in Section 20(1)(b)<lb/> of the Act are for the benefit of holders and the power<lb/> conferred thereby is exercisable for their benefit for<lb/> averting undue hardship that would be caused to<lb/> them if the land in respect of which exemption is<lb/> claimed is not exempted from the operation of the Act.<lb/> Accordingly, on case being made out, exemption has<lb/> to be granted and the State Government cannot<lb/> withhold the exemption claimed. As such, the word<lb/> &quot;may&apos;&apos; cannot be construed in a manner to clothe the<lb/> State Government with arbitrary power to reject an<lb/> application for exemption, even if the conditions for<lb/> grant thereof stand made out.&quot;<lb/> 102<lb/> This judgment has been followed by another Division Bench<lb/> of Gujarat High Court in AIR 1985 Gujarat 47 (Manilal Hiralal Doshi v/s<lb/> State of Gujarat). We are not concerned with other findings and<lb/> conclusions of the Division Bench of Gujarat High Court, but in paragraph<lb/> 4 of this judgment the observations of the Madhya Pradesh High Court<lb/> are referred and followed and in paragraphs 3 and 5 this is what is held:<lb/> &quot;3.<lb/> …....... The Government&apos;s satisfaction about granting<lb/> or not granting the exemption under that provision<lb/> obviously rests on objective facts. The factors which<lb/> are required to be taken into account by the<lb/> Government are (<ref type="formula">1</ref>) the location of the land, (<ref type="formula">2</ref>) the<lb/> purpose for which such land was used at the time the<lb/> application comes to be made or (3) the purpose for<lb/> which such land is proposed to be used in future and<lb/> (<ref type="formula">4</ref>) such other relevant factors as make the<lb/> Government decide that it is necessary or expedient<lb/> and that too in the public interest to grant the<lb/> exemption. What is public interest is a matter difficult<lb/> to be defined, but not difficult to be understood by<lb/> description. A good deal of factors would be required<lb/> to be examined by the Government under this head it<lb/> is well said that in a complex spectrum of facts like<lb/> the one required to be examined by the Government<lb/> for the purpose of exercising its powers under S.<lb/> 20(1)(a) which powers are not absolute powers but<lb/> are powers coupled with a duty. The Government<lb/> must have proper presentation of materials before it<lb/> More often than not if such a complex issue is taken<lb/> on hand by the Government ex parte, incorrect or<lb/> improper decision is likely to arise. It is, therefore, in<lb/> the fitness of the things that the Government should<lb/> ordinarily hear the applicant if the Government is<lb/> prima facie and ex parte inclined to take a view that<lb/> the exemption was not to be granted. If an applicant<lb/> has specifically sought for an opportunity to present<lb/> the case personally or through an agent in a situation<lb/> like the one arising under S. 20(<ref type="formula">1</ref></p>

)(a) of the Act it is<lb/> all the more necessary for the State Government to<lb/> hear the applicant. …........ When a citizen applies for<lb/> exemption say for example, for establishing any<lb/> industry and such proposed future user of the land is<lb/> one of the relevant factors to be counted while dealing<lb/> with an application under S. 20(1)(a) of the Act, the<lb/> citizen in such a situation would be able to explain his<lb/> difficulties more effectively if personal hearing is<lb/> granted. It is because of this far reaching effect of the<lb/> Governments decision on his prospects that we say<lb/> that the hearing is required to be read as the implicit<lb/> requirement of the provisions of the S. 20(1)(a)(b) of<lb/> the Act.<lb/> 5.<lb/> It is no doubt true that the judgment of the Madhya<lb/> Pradesh High Court was one relating to an<lb/> application for exemption under sub cl (b) of sub s.<lb/> (2) of S. 20 of the Act but the underlying principles<lb/> remain the same. As a matter of fact some petitions in<lb/> this group are the petitions for exemption under S.<lb/> 20(1)(b) itself. To our mind the underlying principles<lb/> remain the same when the Government has to<lb/> consider an application for exemption either under Cl<lb/> (a) or Cl (b) of sub s. (<ref type="formula">1</ref>) of S. 20 of the Act. In this<lb/> view of the matter these nine petitions beginning with<lb/> the Special Civil Application No.2181/83 are required<lb/> to be allowedby setting aside the orders of refusal to<lb/> grant exemption. The outcome will he that the<lb/> Government will afford a reasonable opportunity of<lb/> audience to all these petitioners and then decide their<lb/> applications afresh in accordance with the provisions<lb/> of the Act. The extension of opportunity of audience<lb/> can be best proved to have been given by the necessary<lb/> corollary of giving reasons if the vigorous submission&apos;s<lb/> of the applicants are dealt with by a reasonably<lb/> reasoned order, It is in the interest of the Government<lb/> also to give a reasoned order in order to escape the<lb/> charge of non application of mind. We accordingly<lb/> direct to give personal hearing to these petitioners and<lb/> decide the matters by a reasonably reasoned order.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">103<lb/> The above quoted observations of the Division Bench of the<lb/> Gujarat High Court and prior thereto of the Madhya Pradesh High Court<lb/> have our respectful concurrence.<lb/> 104<lb/> Similar view has been taken by the learned Single Judge of<lb/> Karnataka High Court in the judgment reported in AIR 1987 Karnataka 5<lb/> (D.Ananthakrishna Bhat v/s Special Deputy Commissioner and Competent<lb/> *150*<lb/> FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw<lb/> Authority, Mangalore). In paragraph 16 this is what is held:<lb/> &quot;16.<lb/> It is true that unlike subsection (2) of Section 20, in<lb/> clauses (a) and (b), there is no specific provision for<lb/> giving a reasonable opportunity to the person<lb/> concerned. But it seems to me from the language<lb/> employed therein and also in view of the object sought<lb/> to be achieved, it is to be regarded that acting upon<lb/> the principles of natural justice regarding hearing of<lb/> the claimant is necessary while deciding his claim for<lb/> exemption thereunder. Satisfaction of the State<lb/> Government contemplated under clauses (a) and (b)<lb/> of subsection (1) of Section 20 of the Act has to, be<lb/> with regard to the question of public interest or the<lb/> nature of hard ship, which would be caused to the<lb/> claimant. Having regard to these objects to be<lb/> achieved, it must be reasonable to hold that the<lb/> satisfaction envisaged has to be objective in its<lb/> character and cannot be merely subjective satisfaction<lb/> the touchstone for testing the validity or otherwise of<lb/> the satisfaction having been provided by the law. In<lb/> this view, the function of the State Government,<lb/> appears to me, is of a quasijudicial character. The<lb/> view I take gains support from a decision of the<lb/> Madhya Pradesh High Court in Nandakishore v.<lb/> State, AIR 1982 Madh. Pra. 33.&quot;<lb/> 105<lb/> The above observations have been followed in a Division<lb/> Bench judgment of this Court reported in 1988 Mh.L.J. 773 (Janardhan<lb/> Gadekar v/s Assistant Collector and Competent Authority). (see para 13).<lb/></figure>

			<p>106<lb/></p>

			<p>The above conclusions are enough to show that the power to<lb/> exempt cannot be said to be legislative, but is held to be quasijudicial in<lb/> nature. It is, therefore, clear that the said power can be invoked by the<lb/> applicant/ individual also. Secondly, it requires an order to be passed in<lb/> either event and which should be communicated to the party/ person.<lb/></p>

			<p>This would outline the nature of the power and which surely cannot be<lb/> said to be legislative in character. We need not, therefore, refer to any<lb/> further decisions and which would set out the difference between the<lb/> powers, namely, legislative and quasijudicial.<lb/></p>

			<figure>107<lb/> The judgments that have been cited by Mr.Naphade must<lb/> now be noted. He strenuously urged that he is supported in his argument<lb/> by the judgment of the learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh High<lb/> Court in Writ Petition No.26474 of 2009 (Surendra Raj Jaiswal v/s<lb/> Government of Andhra Pradesh) decided on 24.08.2011. There, the Writ<lb/> Petition was filed challenging the rejection by the Government of the<lb/> claim of the Petitioners and permission sought by them to construct a<lb/> multiplex theatrecumshopping complex in the place of existing cinema<lb/> theatre. It was their case that they had filed declaration declaring various<lb/> extents of land held by them along with their father on the<lb/> commencement of the Principal Act. They also filed an application before<lb/> the Government seeking exemption from ChapterIII of the Principal Act<lb/> so as to run an existing cinema theatre on their property called Deepak<lb/> Mahal Cinema situate at Narayanguda in Hyderabad Urban<lb/> Agglomeration. The order of exemption was passed and with a condition<lb/> that the said land should be utilized only for running a cinema theatre<lb/> and subject to further conditions which are incorporated in the order of<lb/> exemption. It was by virtue of exemption order that cinema theatre was<lb/> being run. Thereafter, the Principal Act was repealed in the State of<lb/> Andhra Pradesh after adoption of the Repeal Act with effect from<lb/> 27.03.2008. It is in these circumstances that the Petitioners argued that<lb/> they are entitled to use the property for construction of Multiplex Theatre<lb/> cum shopping complex. We find that from paragraphs 2 to 6 the facts<lb/> are noted. Thereafter, in paragraph 8 reference is made to the Principal<lb/> Act and the power to exempt. Then in paragraph 9 reference is made to<lb/> the Repeal Act. In paragraphs 10 and 11 the learned Single Judge held as<lb/> under:<lb/> &quot;10.<lb/> From a perusal of the aforesaid provisions under<lb/> Sections 3 and 4 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and<lb/> Regulation) Repeal Act of 1999, it is clear that the<lb/> orders granting exemption under subsection (1) of<lb/> Section 20 of the principal Act are saved. It is also<lb/> clear from a perusal of the provision under Section<lb/> 3(1)(c) of the Repealing Act that repeal of the<lb/> principal Act shall not affect any payments made to<lb/> the State Government as a condition for granting<lb/> exemption under subsection (1) of Section 20 of the<lb/> principal Act. But, at the same time, the provision<lb/> under subsection (2) of Section 20 is not saved.<lb/> Section 20(1) of the principal Act empowers the<lb/> Government to exempt any land subject to certain<lb/> conditions, but under subsection (2) of Section 20 of<lb/> the principal Act, the Government was empowered to<lb/> withdraw such exemption in cases where conditions<lb/> are violated. A harmonious reading of the provisions<lb/> under Sections 20(1) and 20</figure>

			<p>(2) of the principal Act,<lb/> coupled with Section 3 of the Repealing Act, makes it<lb/> clear that the order granting exemption is saved only<lb/> with a view to avoid repayment of any amounts<lb/> collected by the State Government, while granting<lb/> exemptions. When the principal Act itself is repealed<lb/> on the ground that it has failed to achieve the<lb/> objective expected of it, it is not open for the 1 st<lb/> respondentGovernment to refuse permission in the<lb/> instant case, only on the ground that the conditions<lb/> imposed in the order granting exemption shall<lb/> continue to operate. In the absence of any saving<lb/> clause, saving subsection (2) of Section 20 of the<lb/> principal Act, even in cases where conditions are<lb/> violated, Government is not empowered to withdraw<lb/> the exemptions granted under Section 20(1) of the<lb/> principal Act, after coming into force of the Urban<lb/> Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999. In<lb/> the absence of such power, and further, in view of the<lb/> Repealing Act itself, the conditions imposed in the<lb/> order granting exemption, have become un<lb/> enforceable and are nonest. In the absence of<lb/> initiation of proceedings or withdrawal of exemption<lb/> granted under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act<lb/> before the enforcement of the Urban Land (Ceiling<lb/> and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999, the land, which is<lb/> exempted, will become a freehold land, and hence, the<lb/> stand of the respondents that even after coming into<lb/> force of the Repealing Act, 1999, the conditions<lb/> imposed in the order granting exemption under<lb/> Section 20(1) of the principal Act shall continue to<lb/> operate, cannot be accepted. The said interpretation<lb/> will run contra to the very objective of the Urban<lb/> Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999. Said<lb/> view also gains support from the other provisions of<lb/> the Repealing Act, particularly Section 4, which states<lb/> that all proceedings relating to any order made or<lb/> purported to be made under the principal Act,<lb/> pending immediately before the commencement of the<lb/> Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act of<lb/> 1999, shall stand abate, except in cases where<lb/> possession is taken by the State Government or any<lb/> person duly authorized by the State Government on<lb/> behalf of the competent authority.<lb/></p>

			<head>11.<lb/></head>

			<p>Having regard to the provisions under Section 20(<ref type="formula">1</ref>)<lb/> and (<ref type="formula">2</ref>) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation)<lb/> Act, 1976 and the provisions under Sections 3 and 4<lb/> of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal<lb/> Act, 1999, it is to be held that in cases where the<lb/> vacant land is exempted under Section 20 of the<lb/> principal Act and where such exemption is not<lb/> withdrawn before the enforcement of the Repealing<lb/> Act, 1999, such land will become the freehold land<lb/> irrespective of any conditions with regard to usage of<lb/> the exempted land. As held above, as the land in<lb/> question has become the freehold land in view of the<lb/> Repealing Act, 1999, there appears no reason or<lb/> justification for not granting permission to use the<lb/> land covered by exemption proceedings, for the<lb/> purpose of multiplex theatrecum shopping complex.<lb/> In a strict sense, no such permission is necessary, but,<lb/> when the competent authority under the Greater<lb/> Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act has not<lb/> received the application, petitioner had to approach<lb/> the Government, and as permission is denied by<lb/> misconstruing the various provisions of the Repealing<lb/> Act, 1999, the impugned order is liable to be set<lb/> aside.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<figure>108<lb/> We do not see how firstly in the teeth of the factual position<lb/> where apart from the controversy with regard to survival of the order of<lb/> exemption and conditions thereunder post repeal, could the permission to<lb/> construct a multiplex theatrecumshopping complex in place of the<lb/> existing cinema theatre have been refused by the State Government. The<lb/> user was more or less similar with the original one. Apart therefrom the<lb/> learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh has not referred to any of the<lb/> judgments of the Honourable Supreme Court on the point and<lb/> particularly the decision in the case of Bansidhar (supra). The learned<lb/> Single Judge&apos;s attention was not invited to several aspects of the<lb/> controversy and which we have extensively noted above. The learned<lb/> Single Judge, therefore, with greatest respect, was not right in holding<lb/> that in the absence of any reference to subsection (2) of Section 20 of the<lb/> Principal Act in clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal<lb/> Act the conditions imposed in the order granting exemption do not<lb/> continue to operate. We do not find any reference made to Section 6 of<lb/> the General Clauses Act either. With greatest respect, we are unable to<lb/> agree with the view taken by the learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh<lb/> High Court in the decision referred above.<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 :::<lb/> *155*<lb/> FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw<lb/> 109<lb/> While on this point we also do not agree with Mr.Gangal<lb/> when he relies on the view taken by another Single Judge of Madras High<lb/> Court in Writ Petition No.46091 of 2002 and W.P.M.P. No.30655 of<lb/> 2004 decided on 29.01.2007 (L.Kannappan and L. Thirunavukarasu v/s<lb/> The Government of Tamil Nadu). There, the arguments were with regard<lb/> to acquisition of agricultural lands. Therein the Petitioners represented by<lb/> their father purchased the agricultural lands. After the property was<lb/> purchased the same was cultivated. The land was always agricultural<lb/> land. In relation to such an agricultural land the proceedings under the<lb/> Tamil Nadu Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1978 were initiated<lb/> and were sought to be continued. The Petitioners sought to make<lb/> payment for obtaining extract from the records of right at which point of<lb/> time it was informed that the lands have been acquired in the name of<lb/> Dr.N.Sivasamy. In these circumstances and by holding that the acquisition<lb/> under the said Ceiling Act when it was in force itself was invalid that the<lb/> Writ Petition was allowed. Apart therefrom it was urged that since the<lb/> Petitioners are in possession and enjoyment of the lands as reflected in<lb/> the revenue records and possession was not taken from them the<lb/> proceedings in that regard abate by virtue of the Repeal Act. This decision<lb/> more or less is on applicability of Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act and<lb/> not an authority on the point in the present case. It is, therefore, clearly<lb/> distinguishable.<lb/> 110<lb/> Mr.Naphade&apos;s reliance upon a judgment of the Delhi High<lb/> Court in the case of Tej Pratap Singh v/s Union of India in Writ Petition<lb/> (Civil) No.2455/1992 decided on 16.07.2009 must now be noted.<lb/> There, a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court had before it a situation<lb/> where the exemption was granted in terms of Section 20(1)(a) and<lb/> Section 22 of the Principal Act on 02.07.1992 subject to the condition<lb/> that the Petitioners before the Delhi High Court would make payment of<lb/> Rs.18,37,74,528/ to the Land &amp; Building Department, Delhi<lb/> Administration within 45 days. Aggrieved and dissatisfied with this<lb/> condition the Writ Petition was filed in the Delhi High Court in 1992 itself<lb/> which was styled as Writ Petition (Civil) No.2455/1992. During the<lb/> pendency thereof the Repeal Act came into force. The facts have been<lb/> noted and particularly that the Petitioner was pursuing his claim for<lb/> exemption for the purpose of redevelopment of the property. He rather<lb/> invited a decision from the Authorities on his application. That was<lb/> because his building plans were not sanctioned. A Division Bench of Delhi<lb/> High Court passed the interim order in another Civil Writ Petition which<lb/> is referred to in paragraph 4 of the judgment. That interim order was<lb/> challenged before the Honourable Supreme Court and the Honourable<lb/> Supreme Court passed an order directing the competent authority under<lb/> the Principal Act to decide the Petitioner&apos;s application. That is how the<lb/> order impugned in the subject Writ Petition was passed. The earlier Writ<lb/> Petition was disposed of as infructuous in the light of the Repeal Act being<lb/> brought into force.<lb/></figure>

			<p>111<lb/></p>

			<p>The argument was that the conditional exemption granted<lb/> would not survive the repeal of the Principal Act. At best and at the<lb/> highest if a condition of payment is not satisfied, then, the State<lb/> Government could have withdrawn the exemption order when the<lb/> Principal Act was in force. But, now same having been repealed that is no<lb/> longer possible. We find that this was an alternate argument, but the<lb/> main argument was that because the Principal Act is repealed there is no<lb/> question of any exemption sought being granted or the question of grant<lb/> of any exemption does not arise. Therefore, understood in the above<lb/> perspective the controversy was whether the claim for exemption made<lb/> by the Petitioner and the conditional order of exemption would survive<lb/> post repeal. The Petitioner had challenged the condition imposed in the<lb/> order of exemption and he had not abided by the condition admittedly.<lb/></p>

			<p>There was thus no exemption order in force. Yet in such a matter a<lb/> Division Bench of Delhi High Court made the following observations:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;11. The learned counsel for the respondent nos. 2 to 4<lb/> submitted that Section 3(1)(b) of the Repealing Act<lb/> would apply in this case whereby the exemption order<lb/> has been specifically saved. Therefore, according to the<lb/> learned counsel, the repeal of the ULCR Act would not<lb/> affect the conditional exemption granted by virtue of the<lb/> order dated 02.07.1992. The learned counsel for the<lb/> respondent nos. 2 to 4 also submitted that the repeal is<lb/> prospective and not retrospective. He also referred to<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which deals<lb/> with the effect of repeal. The said Section stipulates that<lb/> repeal of an enactment by a Repealing Act, unless a<lb/> different intention appears, shall not, inter alia, affect<lb/> any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired,<lb/> accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed.<lb/> Consequently, it was submitted that the right of the<lb/> petitioner to get an exemption under Section 20 (1) (a)<lb/> was subject to the liability of making the said payment<lb/> and other conditions which were imposed by the<lb/> exemption order. According to him, by virtue of Section<lb/> 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, the said liability,<lb/> which had been incurred by the petitioner to make the<lb/> said payment and to comply with the other conditions<lb/> for the grant of exemption, was specifically saved by the<lb/> Repealing Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>12.<lb/></p>

			<p>We have considered the arguments advanced by the<lb/> counsel for the parties. One thing is clear that the ULCR<lb/> Act has been repealed by the said Repealing Act. We have<lb/> already quoted Sections 3 and 4 of the Repealing Act.<lb/> Section 4 deals with abatement of legal proceedings and<lb/> stipulates that all proceedings leading to any order made<lb/> or purported to be made under the principal Act pending<lb/> immediately before the commencement of the Repealing<lb/> Act before any court, tribunal or other authority shall<lb/> abate. In other words, all such proceedings shall abate<lb/> on and from the coming into force of the Repealing Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a proviso to this Section which stipulates that it<lb/> would not apply to proceedings relating to Sections 11,<lb/> 12, 13 and 14 of the ULCR Act insofar as such<lb/> proceedings are relatable to the land, possession of<lb/> which has been taken over by the State Government or<lb/> any person duly authorized by the State Government in<lb/> this behalf or by the competent authority. From a<lb/> reading of the entire Section 4 of the Repealing Act, it is<lb/> clear that all proceedings for declaring excess vacant<lb/> land and acquisition of the said excess vacant land come<lb/> to a halt except the proceedings pertaining to Sections<lb/> 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the ULCR Act provided possession<lb/> of the land in question has not been taken over by the<lb/> State Government. In other words, those lands which<lb/> had not been taken into possession by the State<lb/> Government are excluded even in respect of the<lb/> proceedings relating to Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14. It is<lb/> clear that the intent of the Legislature was not to<lb/> implement the provisions of the ULCR Act any further if<lb/> they had not already resulted in the taking over of<lb/> possession of the lands in question. This is the general<lb/> intent which is discernable from a plain reading of<lb/> Section 4 of the Repealing Act. In the present case, it is<lb/> an admitted position that the land in question, which is<lb/> situated at 23, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi, has not<lb/> been taken into possession by the State Government. In<lb/> fact, the stage of the present case is that an order under<lb/> Section 8(4) of the ULCR Act has been passed and a<lb/> final statement has also been prepared under Section 9<lb/> of the same Act. The matter has not proceeded to the<lb/> stage of Section 10 which relates to acquisition of excess<lb/> land and vesting of the said excess land in the State<lb/> Government. There is, therefore, no question of the case<lb/> having proceeded to any stage beyond Section 9 of the<lb/> ULCR Act.<lb/></p>

			<figure>13.<lb/> This takes us to the consideration of the Savings Clause<lb/> provided in Section 3 of the Repealing Act. Section 3 (1)<lb/> (a) clearly stipulates that the repeal of the ULCR Act<lb/> shall not affect the vesting of any vacant land under sub<lb/> section (3) of Section 10, possession of which has been<lb/> taken over by the State Government or any person duly<lb/> authorized by the State Government in this behalf or by<lb/> the competent authority. We have noted above that the<lb/> possession of the property in question is still with the<lb/> petitioners and, therefore, this Clause is clearly<lb/> inapplicable. Section 3 (1) (b) stipulates that the repeal<lb/> shall not affect the validity of any order granting<lb/> exemption under subsection (1) of Section 20 or any<lb/> action taken thereunder, notwithstanding any judgment<lb/> of any court to the contrary. Section 3 (1) (c) provides<lb/> that the repeal shall not affect any payment made to the<lb/> State Government as a condition for granting exemption<lb/> under sub section (1) of Section 20. Reading sub<lb/> sections 3 (1) (a), (b) and (<ref type="formula">c</ref>) together, it appears to us<lb/> that the intention of the Legislature is that where an<lb/> exemption has been granted in favour of a land holder,<lb/> that is not to be disturbed notwithstanding any<lb/> judgment of any court to the contrary. The further<lb/> intention that can be discerned from the said provisions<lb/> is that the payment made to the State Government as a<lb/> part of a condition for granting exemption under Section<lb/> 20 (<ref type="formula">1</ref>) is also saved. From this, it can be understood<lb/> that had it not been specifically provided that the<lb/> payment made to the State Government as a condition<lb/> for grant of exemption will not be affected by the repeal,<lb/> the same would have been affected by the repeal.</p>

			<head>In<lb/> other words, what this provision intends to save is the<lb/> actual payment, if any, made to the State Government<lb/> as a condition for granting exemption under Section 20<lb/></head>

			<p>(1) of ULCR Act and not the condition itself. In the<lb/> context of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897,<lb/> the petitioner s right to exemption under section 20(1)<lb/> &quot;<lb/> of the ULCR Act is specifically saved, but, not the<lb/> &quot;liability to make the payment, unless the payment had<lb/> &quot;<lb/> already been made prior to the repeal. The General<lb/> Clauses Act, 1897 would, therefore, apply subject to this<lb/> intention. And, the intention of Parliament appears to<lb/> be that: (1) if any payments are made to the State<lb/> Government, that is not to be disturbed and (2) if any<lb/> exemption has been granted, that is also not to be<lb/> disturbed. It does appear to us that after the repeal, the<lb/> conditions of exemption which remain unimplemented<lb/> cannot now be implemented because they are not<lb/> specifically saved. The reason behind this being that<lb/> ceiling in respect of urban lands by itself has been<lb/> repealed altogether.&quot;<lb/></p>

				<formula>112<lb/></formula>

			<p>For the reasons that we have recorded hereinabove, with<lb/> greatest respect, we are unable to agree with the Division Bench of Delhi<lb/> High Court. What has been held is that Section 3(1)(c) of the Repeal Act<lb/> saves is the payment made to the State Government as a condition for<lb/> granting exemption and not the condition itself. These observations are<lb/> contrary to the further observations that by virtue of Section 6 of the<lb/> General Clauses Act the Petitioner&apos;s right to exemption under Section<lb/> 20(1) of the Principal Act is specifically saved, but not the liability to<lb/> make the payment unless payment had already been made prior to the<lb/> repeal. We do not see how such conclusion can be reached by the Division<lb/> Bench after holding that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897<lb/> applies to the repeal. To the extent that we have held to the contrary, with<lb/> greatest respect, we are unable to agree with the Delhi High Court&apos;s<lb/> judgment.<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">113<lb/> Equally, Mr.Naphade&apos;s reliance upon the judgments of the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. v/s Hari Ram<lb/> reported in (2013) 4 SCC 280, M/s Tata Coffee Limited v/s Government of<lb/> Andhra Pradesh in Writ Petition No.11929 of 2013 decided on<lb/> 22.07.2013 (Andhra Pradesh High Court) and Gajanan Kamlya Patil v/s<lb/> Additional Collector &amp; Competent Authority in Civil Appeal<lb/> No.2069/2014 decided on 14.02.2014 by the Honourable Supreme<lb/></figure>

			<p>Court, is misplaced. Hari Ram&apos;s case (supra) was directly concerned when<lb/> the State fails to take possession of the excess vacant land pursuant to the<lb/> notification under Section 10(3) of the Principal Act. This is a decision on<lb/> applicability of Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. True it is that the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court held that the word &quot;vesting&quot; or &quot;vested&quot; may<lb/> or may not include transfer of possession, but all such observations must<lb/> be seen in the context of the controversy, namely, the land being not taken<lb/> over physically. At the same time, the Honourable Supreme Court has<lb/> clarified in paragraph 41 of this judgment that the question whether a<lb/> right has been acquired or liability incurred under a statute before it is<lb/> repealed will in each case depend on the construction of the statute and<lb/> the facts of a particular case.<lb/></p>

			<p>114<lb/> Similar is the situation with the judgment in the case of<lb/> Gajanan Kamlya Patil (supra). There, the question was whether this Court<lb/> was justified in relegating the parties to file a civil suit to recover the<lb/> lands so as to get benefit of the Repeal Act. On facts it was found that the<lb/> Government failed to take actual possession of the surplus land before<lb/> <ref type="biblio">29.11.2007</ref>. In this backdrop and following the judgment in Hari Ram<lb/> (supra) that the order passed by the High Court was set aside and the<lb/> Appeals were allowed.<lb/></p>

			<head>115<lb/></head>

			<p>M/s Tata Coffee Limited judgment (supra) is once again by<lb/> the learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court and there, the<lb/> controversy was more or less identical inasmuch as the application for<lb/> exemption was filed. The exemption was granted and the land was to be<lb/> put to a user as specified in the order. That was done by the predecessor<lb/></p>

			<figure>intitle of M/s Tata Coffee. Thereafter, the successor M/s Tata Coffee<lb/> sought permission/ no objection certificate from the Joint Collector,<lb/> Ranga Reddy district for utilization of the subject land for the purpose of<lb/> development of housing scheme including providing of shelter to the<lb/> weaker sections of the society. The Collector informed that the NOC<lb/> cannot be granted unless the State Government accorded permission.<lb/> That is how the representation was made to the State Government and<lb/> which was rejected. For the reasons that we have recorded above, with<lb/> greatest respect, we are unable to agree with the view taken by the<lb/> learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court.<lb/> 116<lb/> Mr.Naphade then placed reliance on the judgment of the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court in Synco Industries Limited v/s Assessing<lb/> Officer, Income Tax, Mumbai reported in (2008) 4 SCC 22 wherein in the<lb/> context of interpretation placed on the Income Tax Act and some of it&apos;s<lb/> provisions, the Honourable Supreme Court held that where the<lb/> predominant majority of High Courts have taken a particular view of the<lb/> legal provision and interpreted it, the Supreme Court would lean in<lb/> favour of this predominant view, but exceptions to this principle are also<lb/> set out. Once we have set out the reasons for disagreeing with the views<lb/> taken by other High Courts, we do not see how this principle can be of<lb/> any assistance.<lb/> 117<lb/> For the reasons that we have recorded above we do not find<lb/> that the judgments relied upon by Mr.Naphade carry his submissions any<lb/> further.<lb/> 118<lb/> Now we are left with reliance placed by Mr.Naphade,<lb/> Mr.Sathe and Mr.Devitre on the judgments of this Court.<lb/> 119<lb/> Before that we would refer to some of the judgments which<lb/> have been relied upon by the learned Advocate General. Apart from<lb/> Bansidhar (supra) and the State of Punjab v/s Mohar Singh Pratap Singh<lb/> reported in AIR 1955 SC 84, the learned Advocate General relied upon<lb/> the judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Her<lb/> Highness Maharani Shantidevi P. Gaikwad vs. Savjibhai Haribhai Patel and<lb/> Others reported in (2001) 5 SCC 101. We at once clarify that for our<lb/> purposes we are not required to decide as to whether the judgment of the<lb/> Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Atia Mohammadi Begum<lb/> v/s State of U.P. (supra) stands overruled and to what extent. What we<lb/></figure>

			<p>find is that irrespective of whether Atia Begum (supra) is partially<lb/> overruled or not, the fact remains that compliance with the provisions of<lb/> the Principal Act is with reference to the date of it&apos;s commencement. The<lb/> land will have to be determined with reference to this date and that is<lb/> how it is treated and dealt with in the further provisions of the Principal<lb/> Act. The extent of the excess vacant land may be a matter for<lb/> determination and computation, but the time and period, so also, the date<lb/> on which it is so reckoned is not in any way affected. Hence, reliance on<lb/> the judgment in the case of Atia Begum (supra) and other judgments by<lb/></p>

			<p>Mr.Naphade and equally by the learned Advocate General need not detain<lb/> us.<lb/></p>

			<head>120<lb/></head>

			<p>The learned Advocate General relied upon the judgment in<lb/> Shantidevi Gaikwad (supra) to show that Bansidhar (supra) is followed<lb/> and applied. That we find to be accurate on perusal of paragraphs 43 to<lb/> 45 of this judgment. Mr.Naphade also relied upon these paragraphs to<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 :::<lb/></figure>

			<p>urge that a different intention appears in the Repeal Act involved in the<lb/> present case. However, we find that the Honourable Supreme Court has<lb/> reiterated the principle that a repealing statute is not exhaustive and does<lb/> not automatically extinguish the accrued rights unless taken away<lb/> expressly.<lb/></p>

			<p>121<lb/> There is substance in the arguments of the learned Advocate<lb/> General that if the Petitioners are claiming that the exemption confers in<lb/> them a right or privilege, then, they cannot turn around and say that if it<lb/> is conditional then the rights or privilege survive the repeal, but the<lb/> conditions do not. If their arguments are accepted, then, even the right or<lb/> privilege claimed would not survive. That would lead to absurd<lb/> consequences. If relying upon the exemption order the excess vacant land<lb/> is retained and put to use in accordance with the terms and conditions of<lb/> the exemption order, then, the repeal of the Principal Act would mean the<lb/> exemption order even if treated as valid would not survive. However, the<lb/> exemption order is expressly saved and therefore, arriving at a conclusion<lb/> that the exemption order is treated valid for all purposes, namely, the<lb/> right that it creates and the obligation that it imposes on parties. It is only<lb/> such an interpretation which would subserve the object of the Repeal Act<lb/> and read as a whole.<lb/></p>

			<p>122<lb/></p>

			<p>For the reasons that we have recorded above and since this is<lb/> the principle which can be culled out from the decisions relied upon by<lb/> the learned Advocate General that reference to any further judgments on<lb/> the same point is unnecessary. Suffice it to reiterate that reliance placed<lb/> by the learned Advocate General on these judgments is well placed.<lb/></p>

			<head>123<lb/></head>

			<p>We are also in agreement with the learned Advocate General<lb/> when he relies on the judgments of the Honourable Supreme Court which<lb/> have been referred to and followed the view taken in Bansidhar&apos;s case<lb/> (supra). We have already reproduced the paragraphs of those judgments<lb/> and as extracted in Bansidhar (supra). We agree with the emphasis by<lb/> Mr.Khambata on the principle that the liability to handover the excess<lb/> vacant land relates back to the appointed day or the date of<lb/> commencement of the Principal Act in any event. Therefore, it is clear<lb/> that these judgments and which are extensively referred in Bansidhar&apos;s<lb/> case (supra) cannot be brushed aside by us.<lb/></p>

			<figure>124<lb/> Reliance has been further placed on the judgment in the case<lb/> of Voltas Limited v/s Additional Collector &amp; Competent Authority reported<lb/> in 2008 (5) Bombay Cases Reporter 746. While it is true that the<lb/> judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court in Bansidhar&apos;s case (supra)<lb/> was cited before the Division Bench deciding Voltas, but we do not find<lb/> any reference being made to the same. First of all this judgment is not<lb/> interpreting Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act. It is a judgment and it<lb/> remains a judgment analyzing and interpreting Section 3(1)(a) of the<lb/> Repeal Act. Mr.Naphade heavily relies upon this judgment and to urge<lb/> that this judgment supports his submission that the only consequence<lb/> which would follow withdrawal of exemption order by exercising the<lb/> powers under Section 20(2) of the Principal Act is to apply ChapterIII of<lb/> the Principal Act and particularly the Section enabling vesting of the same<lb/> free from all encumbrances in the State of Maharashtra. His submission<lb/> presupposes that withdrawal is mandatory or that unless the exemption is<lb/> withdrawn the terms and conditions, if any, in the exemption order<lb/> cannot be enforced. We do not see how such absolute proposition<lb/> emerges from reading of the judgment in Voltas Limited (supra). If<lb/> paragraph 11 of this judgment is carefully perused the Division Bench<lb/> while analyzing Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act, so also, Section 3(2)<lb/> thereof holds that the land owner will get back title of the land only on<lb/> payment of the amount that he has received under the Principal Act from<lb/> the Government. It is in these circumstances that we are of the opinion<lb/> that this judgment must be seen as confined to this part of the Repeal Act<lb/> and cannot, therefore, be said to be construing other provisions of the<lb/> Repeal Act. The observations in paragraph 12 of this judgment in the<lb/> context of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act must be also seen as being<lb/> made so as to reinforce the conclusion with regard to applicability of<lb/> Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act.<lb/> 125<lb/> Then, there is reliance placed on the judgment in the case of<lb/> Vithabai Bama Bhandari v/s State of Maharashtra reported in 2009 (3)<lb/></figure>

			<p>BCR 663. There, the facts are to be found from paragraphs 2 to 12. They<lb/> would reveal that the essential relief was that the notice issued under<lb/> Sections 9 and 10 of the Principal Act be declared as abated. The petition<lb/> was by the holder of the land and more particularly described in the<lb/> judgment. The Petitioner was declared as holding surplus land. She<lb/> sought an exemption and the power under Section 20 was exercised with<lb/> a condition that 31 tenements of 40 sq.mtrs. each i.e. 1180.04 sq.mtrs. to<lb/> be sold to the Government nominees at fixed rate. The Petitioner,<lb/> therefore, made an application proposing to develop the land so as to<lb/> implement the scheme, but that proposal for development was rejected.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Appeals were filed under the Principal Act, namely, under Section 33<lb/> and a fresh inquiry under Section 8(4) of the Principal Act was directed.<lb/></p>

			<p>In pursuance thereof the holding of the Petitioner was determined afresh.<lb/></p>

			<p>An application was made for implementation of the scheme under Section<lb/></p>

			<figure>20 and in accordance with which the construction permission was<lb/> granted, construction was commenced and was completed within the<lb/> time frame prescribed for the same. It appears that the Petitioner<lb/> requested the Government/ competent authority to take possession of the<lb/> flats meant for the Government nominees, but before any further steps<lb/> could be taken, the Petitioner was informed that the exemption granted<lb/> under Section 20 itself was withdrawn. The Petitioner was served with a<lb/> notice under Section 10(5) calling upon her to handover possession of<lb/> surplus land due to non compliance of the conditions of exemption under<lb/> Section 20 of the Principal Act. That notice was challenged in the petition.<lb/> That is how the Petitioner relied upon the Repeal Act and in order to<lb/> avoid the consequences which would flow from cancellation or<lb/> withdrawal of the exemption order. The discussion in paragraphs 42, 43,<lb/> 44, 45 and 46 of the judgment would reveal that the Division Bench was<lb/> only concerned with Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. Nothing else from<lb/> the Repeal Act has been noticed far from any larger controversy. In such<lb/> circumstances we do not think that this judgment is on the point and<lb/> particularly which has been referred to us. Apart therefrom what we find<lb/> is that the Division Bench did not allow the State to rely upon Section<lb/> 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act because the exemption order had already been<lb/> withdrawn. The question of saving such an order and when the State<lb/> desired to take possession of the land despite repeal of the Principal Act<lb/> and in the teeth of Section 3(1)(a) thereof, therefore, rightly did not<lb/> arise. However, we find that the observations made by the Division Bench<lb/> in paragraphs 38 to 51 to the extent of applicability of Section 6 of the<lb/> General Clauses Act insofar as contrary to what we have held above, do<lb/> not lay down the correct law.<lb/> In the case of Mohan Gopalrao Mate v/s Principal Secretary<lb/> reported in 2009 (1) Bom.C.R. 275, once again it must be noted that the<lb/> Petitioner therein is an exMLA. He had challenged certain Government<lb/> Resolutions which impact large number of housing schemes and affect<lb/> large number of individual flat owners. That was in relation to handing<lb/> over and sale to the Government nominees at the prescribed or<lb/> predetermined rates for the Government quota flats. It was general<lb/> grievance and projected in public interest which was dealt with by the<lb/> Division Bench. Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of this judgment read as under:<lb/> &quot;3.<lb/> Counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that<lb/> the petitioner has filed the present petition in the<lb/> interest of Public as the Government Resolutions<lb/> <ref type="biblio">dated 8.11.2007 and 12.4.2007</ref></p>

 are against the<lb/> Public Policy and would affect the citizens who are the<lb/> original owners of the lands and were legally granted<lb/> exemption to hold vacant lands in excess of the ceiling<lb/> limit U/s. 20 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and<lb/> Regulation) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the<lb/> ULC Act&quot;, which has been repealed w.e.f. 29.11.2007<lb/> by the Government by adopting the Urban Land<lb/> (Ceiling And Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999<lb/> (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Repeal Act&quot;). Though<lb/> the ULC Act has been repealed intentionally and<lb/> malafidely, Government has issued the aforesaid<lb/> resolutions which are impugned in this petition. As a<lb/> result, the Government, instead of ruling out<lb/> manipulation, is giving opportunity to the respondent<lb/> Nos. 2 and 3 to take arbitrary and malafide decision<lb/> so as to harass the original land owners/scheme<lb/> holders as well as a common man who has purchased<lb/> the flats in the said Scheme. It is submitted that, after<lb/> granting exemption to hold vacant land in excess of<lb/> the ceiling limit under section 20 of the ULC Act, the<lb/> land owners have to surrender certain portion of the<lb/> vacant land to the Government free of cost. The<lb/> Government, prior to adoption of Repeal Act, allowed<lb/> to utilize such lands by the original land owners<lb/> under the provisions of section 23 of the said Act, if it<lb/> was not possible to use such a land for any public<lb/> purpose and was likely to be encroached. It is further<lb/> submitted that considering inability of Government to<lb/> protect the possession of said land, it was permissible<lb/> to the land owners to buyback such lands vide<lb/> Government Resolution No.ULC 10 (2004)/C<lb/> No.93/ULCA2 dated 14.07.2004. However, for no<lb/> cogent reason, Government has issued the impugned<lb/> Resolution dated 8.11.2007 which is primafacie<lb/> arbitrary, unjust and not in the public interest and<lb/> therefore, the same is liable to be quashed and set<lb/> aside. This decision of the Government is arbitrary<lb/> and that would give rise to the respondent Nos. 2 and<lb/> 3 to allot such lands (surrendered lands) to the men<lb/> of their choice. This has happened on a large scale, as<lb/> has been specifically observed and pointed out by the<lb/> &quot;JUSTICE BATTA COMMISSION&quot; and therefore,<lb/> revoking the earlier decision i.e. buyback of<lb/> surrendered land, again there would be accumulation<lb/> of huge lands with the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 and<lb/> there would be repetition of the malafide acts by the<lb/> respondent Nos. 2 and 3. As a result of which, the<lb/> main aim and object of the Special Act would be<lb/> defeated.<lb/> 4.<lb/> It is submitted by the learned counsel for the<lb/> petitioner that Government has issued a G.R. dated<lb/> 31.07.2006, however, the effect and operation of said<lb/> Government Resolution has been stayed by this Court<lb/> in Writ Petition No.4966 of 2006 by passing the<lb/> following orders:<lb/> Order dt.4.10.2006 :<lb/> &quot;Heard Mr. C.V.Kale, Adv. for the petitioner.<lb/> Notice returnable in three weeks.<lb/> Mr.Agrawal, AGP waives notice on behalf of<lb/> respondent nos. 1 to 3.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the meanwhile, the parties to maintain<lb/> statusquo&quot;.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Order dt. 7.11.2006 :<lb/></ref> &quot;We grant adinterim relief in terms of prayer<lb/> clause (ii) of the petition during the pendency of the<lb/> petition. With this observation, the application is<lb/> disposed of.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Order dt. 8.12.2006</ref> :<lb/> &quot;In the meantime, the authorities need not pass<lb/> orders on the applications made under the scheme<lb/> until further orders.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/></head>

			<p>However, the Government has issued a fresh G.R. dt.<lb/></p>

			<figure>12.4.2007 flouting the aforesaid orders passed by<lb/> this Court in Writ Petition No.4966 of 2006 and<lb/> therefore, the Govt Resolution dt. 12.4.2007 is liable<lb/> to be quashed and set aside.&quot;<lb/> 127<lb/> Thereafter, the arguments of the Petitioner have been noted<lb/> and which we find from paragraphs 8 to 21. From paragraph 22 onwards<lb/> the Additional Government Pleader&apos;s arguments have been noted and<lb/> from paragraph 37 onwards the rival contentions are analyzed. In<lb/> paragraphs 40 to 42 the necessity to enact the Principal Act and its<lb/> objectives have been discussed. Thereafter, reference is made to Sections<lb/> 20 and 21 of the Principal Act in paragraphs 43 to 46. In paragraph 47<lb/> the Division Bench held that if there was breach of or violation of the<lb/> terms and conditions of the Development Permission or Commencement<lb/> Certificate issued under the Planning Law, then, the Government cannot<lb/> cancel these permission/ sanction/ building permit in the garb of<lb/> exercising the powers to withdraw the exemption. That is how paragraphs<lb/> 47 and 48 would read. We do not find anything in paragraph 48 which<lb/> would enable us to hold that the Division Bench has decided any<lb/> controversy and which is subject matter of the present reference. The<lb/> whole issue was whether for breach of the terms and conditions on which<lb/> the order of exemption has been passed and one of which related to the<lb/> permission to construct or develop the land, can the State while<lb/> withdrawing the exemption under Section 20(1) also set aside or<lb/> interfere with the permission under the Maharashtra Regional Town<lb/> Planning Act, 1966 or related laws. Far from anything which would touch<lb/> the issues involved in the present Reference we do not think that this<lb/> judgment lays down or holds that the validity of the order of exemption<lb/> under Section 20 or any action taken thereunder would not survive with<lb/> all consequences despite the repeal.<lb/> 128<lb/> The only reference then made to the Repeal Act is to be<lb/> found in paragraphs 63 and 64. Paragraph 64 of the judgment reads as<lb/> under:<lb/></figure>

			<p>&quot;64.<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">In the case in hand, we are concerned with Subclause<lb/> (b) of Section (3) of Repeal Act which contemplates that<lb/> repeal of the principal Act shall not affect validity of any<lb/> order granting exemption under subsection (1) of<lb/> Section 20 or any action taken thereunder, not<lb/> withstanding any judgment of any Court to the counter.<lb/> It is, therefore, evident that validity of order granting<lb/> exemption under subsection (1) of Section 20 of the ULC<lb/> Act though passed prior to Repeal Act came into force,<lb/> would continue in view of the said saving clause.<lb/> Similarly, any action taken by the State Government<lb/> under subsection (2) of Section 20 prior to the Repeal<lb/> Act came into force is also continued to be valid even<lb/> after the Repeal Act came into force. Perusal of<lb/> provisions of Section 3 (1)(b) makes it evident that<lb/> repeal of Principal Act shall not affect validity of any<lb/> order granting exemption under subsection (1) of<lb/> Section 20 or any action taken thereunder. Hence, to<lb/> grant exemption in respect of land which was in excess<lb/> of the ceiling limit as well as action, if any taken by the<lb/> State Government thereunder in view of Section 20 (1)<lb/> is saved. Similarly, any action taken by the State<lb/> Government against the scheme holder under subclause<lb/></figure>

			<figure>(2) of Section 20 prior to coming into force of the<lb/> Repeal Act, is also saved. However, the power of the<lb/> State Government to alter, change or modify the terms<lb/> and conditions of any of the Schemes formulated prior<lb/> to coming into force of the Repeal Act and on the basis<lb/> thereof, sanction was granted by the Planning Authority<lb/> is not saved by the saving clause.&quot;<lb/> 129<lb/> We do not think that in the light of these conclusions on<lb/> Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act, any assistance could be derived from<lb/> this judgment and to answer the issues and questions posed before us.<lb/> Rather, the same support our conclusion.<lb/> 130<lb/> Then, we are left with the judgment on which reliance is<lb/> placed by the Petitioners, namely, Sundersons and others v/s State of<lb/> Maharashtra and others reported in 2008 (5) Bombay Cases Reporter<lb/> 85 : 2008(6) Mh.L.J. 332. We do not find that the said judgment dealt<lb/> with the controversy which has been raised before us. Apart therefrom we<lb/> find that not only in the said judgment, but in the further judgment of this<lb/> Court in the case of Damodar Laxman Navare v/s State of Maharashtra in<lb/> Writ Petition No.6300/2009 decided on 08.07.2010 the same Division<lb/> Bench clarified in paragraph 10 that it is not inclined to look into the<lb/> question and aspect of applicability of Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act.<lb/> 131<lb/> Reference is then made to the judgment to which one of us is<lb/> a party (S.C.Dharmadhikari, J.), reported in 2013(2) Mh.L.J. 224 (Manik<lb/> M. Ragit v/s State of Maharashtra). There, the Division Bench was<lb/> concerned with the issue post repeal of the Principal Act and particularly<lb/> about changes in the revenue record. The prayer was to restore the name<lb/> of the Petitioner in the revenue record pertaining to the land. Paragraph 2<lb/> of this judgment would show that the vacant land in excess of ceiling<lb/> limit was identified. The Petitioner before this Court sought an order of<lb/> exemption under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act. He presented the<lb/> scheme in relation to half portion of the excess vacant land that scheme<lb/> was sanctioned by the competent authority. However, the scheme was not<lb/> implemented at all. Later on an attempt was made to proceed against this<lb/> excess vacant land, physical possession of which was always with the<lb/> Petitioner. He, therefore, argued that Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act<lb/> would not come into play and the fact situation is fully covered by Section<lb/> 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. If the Respondent/ State cannot take physical<lb/> possession of the excess vacant land because the scheme has failed in<lb/> view of this express provision in the Repeal Act, then, the Petitioner&apos;s<lb/> name deserves to be restored to the revenue record was the essential<lb/> prayer. That has been granted and because there was no opposition from<lb/> the State. It is in this context that the Division Bench in paragraph 7<lb/> relied upon the Repeal Act and essentially Section 3(1)(a) of the same.<lb/></figure>

			<figure type="table">Paragraph 7 of the judgment reads as under:<lb/> &quot;7.<lb/> With the assistance of the learned counsel appearing<lb/> for parties we have perused the Writ Petition and also<lb/> the Division Bench judgment. Facts in our case are not<lb/> disputed. There has been no step or action taken in<lb/> pursuance of the order of exemption passed in favour<lb/> of the petitioner. Thus, the scheme was not<lb/> implemented. If it was not implemented, then, the<lb/> Division Bench judgment in Vithabai&apos;s case takes the<lb/> view that the consequence of passing an order under<lb/> Section 20(1) results in exemption of surplus vacant<lb/> land from the provisions of the Act. However, on<lb/> withdrawal of the exemption under Section 20(2) of<lb/> the Urban Land Ceiling Act, that does not provide that<lb/> possession of surplus land would automatically or is<lb/> deemed to have been taken by the Competent<lb/> Authority. If the State of Maharashtra is required to<lb/> resort to provisions of Chapter III of Urban Land<lb/></figure>

			<p>Ceiling Act for taking possession and issue notice<lb/> under Section 10 of the Act, then, they cannot urge<lb/> that possession was not taken prior to the Repealing<lb/> Act coming into force. In other words, if possession is<lb/> not taken prior to Repeal Act coming into force, then,<lb/> it will be restored to owner. The view taken is that<lb/> Section 10, does not provide for different procedure to<lb/> be adopted subsequent to the passing of an order<lb/> under Section 20(2) of the Urban land Ceiling Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>Therefore, looking at the matter this way, even if the<lb/> scheme has not been implemented or the exemption<lb/> has been withdrawn, this judgment holds that the<lb/> respondent could resort to Section 10 of the Un<lb/> repealed Act. That having not been done in the case<lb/> before us we are of the view that, the controversy is<lb/> covered by the judgment of this Court in the judgment<lb/> of Vithabai&apos;s case.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>132<lb/></head>

			<p>We are of the opinion that this judgment cannot be a<lb/> precedent for answering the questions posed before us. We have already<lb/> held that the observations in Vithabai&apos;s case (supra) to the extent they are<lb/> contrary to what we have held hereinabove do not lay down the correct<lb/> law. Therefore, firstly these observations must be seen as restricted to the<lb/> facts of that case and to which only Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act<lb/> applies. Secondly, this Court was not called upon to decide the ambit and<lb/> scope of Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act in that judgment as the scheme<lb/> never took off and was not acted upon. Once the exemption order was<lb/> not acted upon by the Petitioner, but the State attempted to take<lb/> possession of the surplus vacant land and after repeal that relief as prayed<lb/> by the Petitioner was granted. This judgment, therefore, cannot be seen as<lb/></p>

			<figure>answering the controversy.<lb/> 133<lb/> Finally, in Mira Bhayander Developers and Welfare<lb/> Association (supra) the controversy was with regard to the letter dated<lb/> 23.06.2008 addressed by the State Government to the SubRegistrar of<lb/> Assurances, Thane City. That letter directed the said Authority to ascertain<lb/> at the time when the scheme holder presents a document for registration<lb/> as to whether he has sought extension for implementation of the scheme<lb/> meant for economically weaker sections of the society under Section 20 of<lb/> the Principal Act and not to register the document otherwise. That was<lb/> the letter impugned in the Writ Petition and the Division Bench in a short<lb/> judgment held as under:<lb/> &quot;1.<lb/></figure>

			<figure type="table">The above Petition is filed on behalf of the members of<lb/> the Petitioner Association. The members of the Petitioner<lb/> Association who are the builders and developers have<lb/> taken benefit of the schemes meant for the Economically<lb/> Weaker Section of the society under Section 20 of the<lb/> Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976<lb/> [hereinafter referred to as &quot;the said Act&quot; for short]. The<lb/> said Act was repealed by the Urban Land (Ceiling and<lb/> Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 which came into force in<lb/> the State of Maharashtra on 29.11.2007. Since a large<lb/> number of schemes were sanctioned under Section 20 of<lb/> the said Act, the State Government, with a view to see<lb/> that the schemes are fully implemented, if partly<lb/> implemented, after the repeal of the said Act, issued a<lb/> letter dated 23.06.2008 to the SubRegistrar of<lb/> Assurances, Thane City directing him to ascertain at the<lb/> time when the scheme holder presents a document for<lb/> registration, whether the scheme holder has sought for<lb/> extension for implementation of the scheme or not; as<lb/> otherwise not to register the documents in question.<lb/> 2.<lb/> It is the said letter dated 23.06.2008, which is impugned<lb/> in the present Petition. The principal ground on which<lb/> the said letter is assailed is that such a condition cannot<lb/> be imposed by the Registering Authority and that the<lb/> registration cannot be refused on the said ground.<lb/> 3.<lb/></figure>

			<p>On the other hand it is contended on behalf of the State<lb/> by the learned AGP that on the repeal of the said Act,<lb/> the scheme holders who may be builders/developers are<lb/> trying to wriggle out of their obligations under the said<lb/> sanctioned schemes, and therefore the impugned letter<lb/> came to be issued which has been issued to protect the<lb/> schemes meant for the Economically Weaker Section,<lb/> and also the Government revenue.<lb/> 4.<lb/></p>

			<p>We</p>

			<figure>have considered the rival contentions. In our view, if<lb/> the members of the Petitioners Association have taken<lb/> benefit of the schemes under Section 20 of the said Act<lb/> by constructing buildings, they now cannot wriggle out<lb/> of their obligations to surrender flats to the Government<lb/> which the Government could sell at a fixed rate. The<lb/> entire tenor of the above Petition appears to be that the<lb/> Petitioners do not want to fulfil their obligations under<lb/> the said schemes viz surrendering the flats to the State<lb/> Government and taking advantage of the repeal of the<lb/> said Act want to contend that their obligations under the<lb/> said schemes do not survive. In our view the impugned<lb/> letter, as rightly contended by the learned AGP, has been<lb/> issued to protect the public interest and Government<lb/> revenue. It does not befit the Petitioners who have taken<lb/> advantage of the said schemes now to contend that their<lb/> obligations do not survive, and therefore there is no need<lb/> for them to surrender the flats to the Government. We,<lb/> therefore, do not find any merit in the challenge raised<lb/> in the above Petition which is accordingly dismissed.&quot;<lb/> 134<lb/> Though this judgment is based on the broad principles of<lb/> equity and that no one can take advantage of his own wrong, yet we are<lb/> of the opinion that the conclusion therein for the reasons recorded above<lb/> is correct. The same is in consonance with the conclusions reached by us<lb/> hereinabove.<lb/> 135<lb/> As a result of the above discussion the questions referred to<lb/> us are answered as under:<lb/> (a)<lb/> That the repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the<lb/> validity of the order of exemption under Section 20(1) of the<lb/> Principal Act and all consequences following the same<lb/> including keeping intact the power to withdraw the said<lb/> exemption by recourse to Section 20(2) of the Principal Act.<lb/> Further, merely because Section 20(2) is not specifically<lb/> mentioned in the saving clause enacted by Section 3(1)(b) of<lb/> the Repeal Act that does not mean that the power is not<lb/> saved. The said power is also saved by virtue of applicability<lb/> of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. That Section of<lb/> the General Clauses Act, 1897 applies to Section 3(1)(b) of<lb/> the Repeal Act.<lb/> (b)<lb/> Once having held that the power to withdraw the exemption<lb/> also survives the repeal of the Principal Act, then, all<lb/> consequences must follow and the said power can be<lb/> exercised by the State Government in accordance with law.<lb/> That power and equally all ancillary and incidental powers to<lb/> the main power to impose conditions are also saved and<lb/> survive the repeal. Meaning thereby the terms and conditions<lb/> of the order of exemption can be enforced in accordance with<lb/> law.<lb/> (c)<lb/> Question Nos.1 and 2 in the AFFIRMATIVE, by holding that<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 applies to the<lb/> savings of the exemption order including all terms and<lb/> conditions thereof, validity of which or any action taken<lb/> thereunder has been saved by Section 3(1)(b)<lb/> notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary.<lb/> (d)<lb/> Question Nos.3 and 4 will have to be answered as above, but<lb/> by clarifying that though it would be open for the State to<lb/> enforce the exemption order and terms and conditions<lb/> thereof, validity of which is saved by the Repeal Act, but<lb/> having regard to the language of Section 20(2) of the<lb/> Principal Act it cannot be held that same can be enforced<lb/> only by withdrawal of the order of exemption in terms of sub<lb/> section (2) of Section 20, which power also survives the<lb/> repeal of the Principal Act. In other words, though Section<lb/> 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act read with Section 6 of the General<lb/> Clauses Act, 1897 states that repeal of the Principal Act shall<lb/> not affect the validity of the exemption order passed under<lb/> Section 20(1) of the Principal Act or any action taken<lb/> thereunder notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the<lb/> contrary, still the obligations and liabilities incurred<lb/> voluntarily under the exemption order by the person holding<lb/> the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit need not be enforced<lb/> only by exercise of powers under subsection (2) of Section<lb/> 20 of the Principal Act, but by all other legally permissible<lb/> means.<lb/> (e)<lb/> We also clarify that though our answers to Questions 3 and 4<lb/> would be as aforesaid, still whether any of these powers<lb/> could be exercised and to what extent are all matters which<lb/> must be decided in the facts and circumstances of each case.<lb/> In the event the State desires to take any action in terms of<lb/> Section 20(2) of the Principal Act it would be open for the<lb/> aggrieved parties to urge that such an action is not<lb/> permissible in the given facts and circumstances particularly<lb/> because of enormous and unexplained delay, the parties<lb/> having altered their position to their detriment, the<lb/> proceedings as also the orders in that behalf are grossly<lb/> unfair, unjust, arbitrary, high handed, malafide and violative<lb/> of the principles of natural justice and of the Constitutional<lb/> mandate enshrined in Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21 and 300A of<lb/> the Constitution of India. These and other contentions can<lb/> always be raised and irrespective of our conclusions,<lb/> individual orders can always be challenged and action<lb/> thereunder impugned in appropriate legal proceedings<lb/> including under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.<lb/> (f)<lb/> The aggrieved parties can also urge that while seeking to<lb/> enforce the terms and conditions of the exemption order or<lb/> recalling or withdrawing the exemption itself the competent<lb/> authorities/ State has not adhered to the provisions of law<lb/> applicable for such exercise. Meaning thereby there has to be<lb/> a specific order in that behalf and mere issuance of<lb/> administrative instructions or circulars will not suffice. All<lb/> such objections can as well be raised and in individual cases.<lb/> (g)<lb/> By our answers to Questions 1 to 4 above, we should not be<lb/> taken to have held that there is a mandate under the Repeal<lb/> Act to withdraw the order of exemption passed under Section<lb/> 20(1) of the Principal Act and the Government is obliged to<lb/> withdraw it in the event the said order or any terms or<lb/> conditions thereof have not been satisfied rather violated or<lb/> breached. In the light of the wording of Section 20(2) of the<lb/> Principal Act the State is competent to withdraw, but only<lb/> after giving a reasonable opportunity to the persons<lb/> concerned for making representation against the proposed<lb/> withdrawal. The Government is obliged to pass an order<lb/> withdrawing any exemption and needless to clarify that in<lb/> the event such an order is passed it can be impugned and<lb/> challenged by the aggrieved parties in appropriate<lb/> proceedings on the grounds that it is unreasoned and/or in<lb/> the given facts and circumstances such an order could not<lb/> have been passed or need not be passed and the Government<lb/> could have granted time to comply with the terms and<lb/> conditions or that the terms and conditions relying on which<lb/> and for breach of which the exemption order is withdrawn<lb/> are not violated or breached, they were not mandatory and<lb/> have been substantially complied with or were incapable of<lb/> being complied with because of several factors, obstacles and<lb/> hurdles each of which cannot be enumerated or termed as<lb/> exhaustive in any manner. Therefore, if the Government is<lb/> not mandated to withdraw the exemption order, but can<lb/> ensure compliance of the terms and conditions without<lb/> withdrawal of the exemption order or without recourse to<lb/> Section 20(2) of the Principal Act, then, needless to clarify<lb/> that all liabilities, obligations and equally the remedies<lb/> available to the parties are unaffected by repeal and can be<lb/> resorted to in the afore stated events.<lb/> (h)<lb/> In the light of our conclusions as enumerated in paragraph<lb/> No.125 above we hold that the view taken by the Division<lb/> Bench in Vithabai Bama Bhandari v/s State of Maharashtra<lb/> and another reported in 2009(3) Bombay Cases Reporter<lb/> 663 (Writ Petition No.4241/2008 decided on 31 st March/ 16 th<lb/> April, 2009) does not lay down the correct law and to the<lb/> extent indicated hereinabove.<lb/> (i)<lb/> The Reference is answered accordingly. Each of these Writ<lb/> Petitions shall now be placed before appropriate Division<lb/> Benches for disposal in the light of the above principles and<lb/> on merits, so also, in accordance with law.

Gupte, J.) :<lb/> 1<lb/> I have gone through the judgement prepared by my brother<lb/> Dharmadhikari J. With greatest respect, I am afraid I am unable to agree<lb/> with some of the key conclusions and reasons discussed in it. I have in<lb/> the following judgment dealt with the conclusions in respect of which I<lb/> differ from the views expressed by brother Dharmadhikari J.<lb/> 2<lb/> The questions referred to the Full Bench and the submissions<lb/> made by learned Counsel appearing on either sides have been elaborately<lb/> set out by my brother Dharmadhikari J and need not be repeated here. I<lb/> shall, wherever necessary, refer to these submissions in the context of my<lb/> conclusions and reasons for the same.<lb/> 3<lb/> Let me briefly dwell at the outset with the conflict in the<lb/> decisions of Division Benches of our court, which led to the present Full<lb/> Bench reference, so as to put the whole controversy in a proper<lb/> perspective and make its context clear. What led to the conflict of the<lb/> Division Bench decisions of this court were the circulars issued by various<lb/> Competent Authorities under the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation)<lb/> Act, 1976 (&quot;the Principal Act&quot;) after repeal by the Urban Land (Ceiling<lb/> and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 (&quot;the Repeal Act&quot;) to SubRegistrars of<lb/> Assurances and planning authorities not to register documents presented<lb/> by landholders for registration or sanction plans filed for development of<lb/> lands unless no objection certificates were issued by these Competent<lb/> Authorities. These directives were purportedly issued with a view to<lb/> implement schemes sanctioned by Competent Authorities whilst granting<lb/> exemptions to the concerned lands under Section 20 of the Principal Act.<lb/> In some cases, the landholders would have breached the provisions of<lb/> these schemes, for example, by not completing the schemes within the<lb/> stipulated periods, in which cases the concerned Competent Authorities<lb/> would not issue no objection certificates, thereby ensuring compliance on<lb/> the part of the landholders with the sanctioned schemes. These circulars<lb/> were challenged before this Court in a number of petitions.<lb/> 4<lb/> In Sundersons &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors. 1 , the<lb/> Collector had issued instructions to Subregistrars of Assurances to insist<lb/> upon an NOC from the competent authority, namely, the Collector before<lb/> registering any document.<lb/> A Division Bench of this Court held that<lb/> persual of the circular did not disclose the source of the power under<lb/> which it had been issued and that it was not open to the Collector to issue<lb/> such instructions.<lb/> 5<lb/> In Damodar Laxman Navare Vs. State of Maharashtra 2 , the<lb/> Court was concerned with two letters -one by which authorities such as<lb/> the Municipal Corporation and SubRegistrar were directed not to<lb/> sanction plans or register documents presented by landholders and the<lb/> other directing the petitioner landholder in that case to pay penalty for<lb/> extension of time for completion of a scheme sanctioned under Section 20<lb/> of the Principal Act. Both these letters were issued after the repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act. The Division Bench hearing the petitioners&apos; challenge to the<lb/> two letters struck down these directions, holding them to be illegal and<lb/> ultra vires the powers of the authorities under the Principal Act. The<lb/> challenge to these circulars on the grounds of repeal of the Principal Act<lb/> and the effect of the saving clause on the exemption orders passed under<lb/> Section 20 or actions taken thereunder, was, however, not considered by<lb/> the Division Bench in Damodar Laxman Navare (supra).<lb/> 6<lb/> Then came the decision of another Division Bench of our<lb/> Court in Mira Bhayandar Builders and Developers Welfare Association<lb/> Vs. Deputy Collector and Competent Authority. 1 In that case, members<lb/> of the Petitioner Association, who were builders and developers, had<lb/> taken benefit of the schemes meant for economically weaker sections of<lb/> the society sanctioned under Section 20 of the Principal Act. The schemes<lb/> were partly implemented on the date of the repeal of the Principal Act.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The State Government issued a circular after the repeal, with a view to<lb/> see that the schemes were fully implemented, to the SubRegistrar of<lb/> Assurances. The circular directed the SubRegistrar to ascertain whether<lb/> the scheme holder had sought extension of time for implementation of the<lb/> scheme when the scheme holder presented a document for registration<lb/> and not to register the document in question if such extension was not<lb/> sought. The scheme holders challenged the circular inter alia on the<lb/> ground that the obligations under the scheme did not survive the repeal.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Division Bench accepted the contention of the learned AGP that the<lb/></p>

			<figure>impugned circular had been issued to protect the public interest by<lb/> ensuring implementation of schemes meant for economically weaker<lb/> sections. The Division Bench held that if the members of the Petitioner<lb/> Association had taken benefit of the schemes under Section 20 by<lb/> constructing buildings, they could not now wriggle out of their obligations<lb/> to surrender flats to the Government which the Government could sell at<lb/> fixed rates. The Division Bench accordingly rejected the Petitioners&apos;<lb/> challenge to the circular.<lb/> 7<lb/> These were then the rulings on the subject, when another<lb/> 1 Writ Petition No.5745/2009 dated 27 th August, 2009<lb/> Division Bench of our Court -in Jayesh Tokarshi Shah Vs. Deputy<lb/> Collector and Competent Authority 1 considered similar circulars issued<lb/> by the Competent Authority after the repeal of the Principal Act,<lb/> prohibiting registration of conveyances in respect of flats constructed<lb/> under schemes sanctioned under Section 20 and sold without obtaining<lb/> extension of periods of completion of the schemes or obtaining no<lb/> objection certificates from the Competent Authority under the Principal<lb/> Act. According to the Petitioners in that case, the circulars issued after the<lb/> repeal of the Principal Act were without authority of law and also that the<lb/> conditions of the exemption orders under Section 20 did not survive the<lb/> repeal. On the other hand, the State contended that the circulars were<lb/> issued for meaningful implementation of sanctions granted under Section<lb/> 20, as validity of such sanction orders remained saved from the rigours of<lb/> the Repeal Act. According to the State, the Petitioners had yet to discharge<lb/> their obligations under the schemes by handing over specified number of<lb/> tenements to the Government and paying penalty for extension of time to<lb/> complete the schemes. Based on the decision of our Court in Mira<lb/> Bhayandar Builders&apos; case (supra) it was contended by the State that it<lb/> was not open to a party, who had taken advantage of a scheme sanctioned<lb/> under Section 20 of the Principal Act, to contend that the obligations of<lb/> the scheme did not survive the repeal of the Principal Act. The Division<lb/> Bench in Jayesh Tokarshi Shah (supra) felt that the view expressed by<lb/> our Court in Sundersons &amp; Ors (supra) and Damodar Laxman Navare<lb/> (supra) led to the premise that the Competent Authority under the<lb/> Principal Act was not competent to issue such circulars, but that there was<lb/> a conflict with such premise in the view expressed by our Court in Mira<lb/> Bhayandar Builders&apos; case (supra) where challenge to a similar circular<lb/> was dispelled on the ground that the circular was issued to protect public<lb/> 1 Writ Petition No.3815/2010 decided on 26.10.2010<lb/> interest and having taken advantage of a scheme under Section 20 of the<lb/> Principal Act, the Petitioners could not wriggle out of their obligations.<lb/> The Court in Jayesh Tokarshi Shah (supra) referred to another decision<lb/> of our Court in Mohal Gopal Mate Vs. Principal Secretary 1 , which held<lb/> that the powers of the State under Section 20 in case of breach of a<lb/> condition of an exemption order were limited to withdrawal of the<lb/> exemption order only, whereupon provisions of Chapter III would apply to<lb/> such land. The Court in Jayesh Tokarshi Shah (supra) also felt that going<lb/> by strict interpretation of Sections 20 and 21 of the Principal Act, the<lb/> power of the State in case of contravention of any of the conditions of the<lb/> schemes sanctioned under these Sections by the scheme holders was<lb/> limited to withdrawal of exemption, declaring such land to be excess<lb/> vacant land and applying the provisions of Chapter III of the Principal Act<lb/> for acquisition of the same. The Court, however, felt that such view would<lb/> be in conflict with the view expressed by the Court in Mira Bhayander<lb/> Builders&apos; case (supra) and that therefore the controversy deserved to be<lb/> resolved by a Full Bench of this Court.<lb/> 8<lb/> That is how this reference has come before us. The principal<lb/> controversy before us concerns the effect of the Repeal Act on the<lb/> schemes sanctioned whilst granting exemptions under Section 20 of the<lb/> Principal Act to excess vacant lands. Do the conditions of exemption<lb/> orders survive the repeal and if so, can these conditions be enforced by<lb/> the State after the date of the repeal, if necessary by withdrawing the<lb/> exemption and applying the provisions of Chapter III to the lands which<lb/> were the subject matter of such exemption orders and schemes.<lb/> 9<lb/> At the outset, a brief overview of the Principal Act and the<lb/> 1 2009 1) BCR 275<lb/> Repeal Act may be necessary to understand the impact and reach of the<lb/> Repeal Act and whatever is left untouched by it from the provisions of the<lb/> Principal Act or actions taken thereunder.<lb/> 10<lb/> The Principal Act was enacted for (i) imposition of a ceiling<lb/> on vacant land in urban agglomerations, (ii) acquisition of land in excess<lb/> of the ceiling limit, and (iii) regulation of construction of buildings on<lb/> such land and for matters connected therewith. The declared objective of<lb/> these provisions in the Principal Act was to (i) prevent concentration of<lb/> urban land in the hands of a few persons and speculation and<lb/> profiteering therein and (ii) bring about an equitable distribution of land<lb/> in urban agglomerations to subserve the common good.<lb/> 11<lb/> Chapter III of the Principal Act contains the key provisions<lb/> for accomplishment of the aforesaid objectives. The Chapter consists of<lb/> three sets of provisions, namely, (1) Sections 3 to 18 which provide for<lb/> the ceiling limit, and ascertainment and acquisition of vacant land in<lb/> excess of such ceiling limit, (2) Sections 19 to 22 dealing with non<lb/> application or exemption from application of Chapter III to certain lands<lb/> and (3) Sections 23 and 24 which deal with disposal of vacant land<lb/> acquired under Chapter III.<lb/> 12<lb/> Section 3, which is the pivotal section in the Chapter,<lb/> proscribes any person from holding vacant land in excess of the ceiling<lb/> limit in the territories covered by the Principal Act. The ceiling limits for<lb/> various classes of agglomerations and the manner of calculating them for<lb/> various classes of persons are provided in Section 4. Section 5 provides<lb/> for a subsidiary rule for calculating the extent of vacant land in cases of<lb/> certain transfers (i.e. transfers between the appointed day and the date of<lb/> commencement of the Principal Act) and also prohibits transfers after the<lb/> date of commencement without furnishing a statement under Section 6<lb/> and publication of a notification of excess land under Section 10(1). The<lb/> machinery provisions for arriving at the extent of excess vacant land are<lb/> contained in Sections 6 to 9. The entire determination process starts with<lb/> a statement to be compulsorily filed by every person holding vacant land<lb/> in excess of ceiling limit as on the date of commencement of the Principal<lb/> Act, specifying the requisite particulars of such land. Section 7 contains<lb/> subsidiary provisions concerning filing of such statement in case such land<lb/> is situated within the jurisdiction of two or more competent authorities,<lb/> whether in the same state or in two or more states to which the Principal<lb/> Act applies. Section 8 provides for preparation of a draft statement by<lb/> the competent authority. It also requires service of such draft statement<lb/> on, and consideration of objections, if any, by, the concerned landholder.<lb/> Section 9 provides for determination of excess vacant<lb/> land and<lb/> preparation and service of a final statement concerning such excess<lb/> vacant land. Section 10 contains provisions concerning acquisition of<lb/> such excess vacant land by the State Government. Under the scheme of<lb/> Section 10, the competent authority has to first issue and publish a<lb/> notification giving particulars of excess vacant land, proposing its<lb/> acquisition and inviting claims of all persons interested in such land,<lb/> under Subsection (1) of Section 10. Subsection (2) requires the<lb/> competent authority to determine the nature and extent of such claims.<lb/> Subsection (3) empowers the competent authority to declare by<lb/> notification the acquisition of such excess vacant land with effect from a<lb/> date specified in that behalf. Upon publication of such notification the<lb/> land is deemed to be vested absolutely in the State Government with<lb/> effect from the date so specified. Subsection (4) of Section 10 provides<lb/> for an embargo on transfer of land between the dates of the publication of<lb/> the respective notifications under Subsections (1) and (3). Subsections<lb/> (5) and (6) deal with taking over of possession of the land thus vesting in<lb/> the State Government.<lb/> Subsection (5) authorizes the competent<lb/> authority to require by notice surrender or delivery of such land to the<lb/> State Government. Subsection (6) empowers the competent authority to<lb/> take possession by use of force in case of failure of the landholder to so<lb/> surrender or deliver possession. Sections 11 to 14 contain provisions<lb/> regarding payment of compensation by the State Government to the<lb/> landholder whose land is so acquired by the State Government. Section<lb/> 11 contains provisions for determination of such compensation, Section<lb/> 12 provides for appeals to a tribunal from any determination under<lb/> Section 11 and Section 13 provides for an appeal to the High Court from<lb/> the decision of the tribunal. Section 14 provides for the mode of payment<lb/> of such compensation. Sections 15 to 18 provide for subsidiary matters<lb/> such as ceiling limit on future acquisition by inheritance, etc., filing of<lb/> statement when the Principal Act is subsequently adopted by any State,<lb/> the competent authority&apos;s power to enter upon any vacant land for<lb/> carrying out the purposes of the Principal Act and penalty for<lb/> concealment of particulars of vacant land, etc.<lb/> 13<lb/> Section 19 provides cases in which the provisions of Chapter<lb/> III do not apply to certain vacant lands, e.g. lands held by the Central or<lb/> State Governments, banks, etc. Section 20 provides for the power of the<lb/> State Government to exempt any vacant land on conditions and to<lb/> withdraw such exemption on noncompliance of the conditions. (This<lb/> Section will be dealt with in detail in the following order.) Section 21<lb/> provides for circumstances in which excess vacant land may not be<lb/> treated as excess in certain cases. Section 22 provides for cases where a<lb/> landholder under certain conditions may be permitted to retain excess<lb/> vacant land.<lb/> 14<lb/> Sections 23 and 24, as noted above, provide for disposal of<lb/> vacant lands acquired by the State Government under the Principal Act.<lb/> These Sections inter alia serve the objective of equitable distribution of<lb/> land in public interest.<lb/> 15<lb/> Chapter IV enacts provisions concerning regulations of<lb/> transfers of land and use of urban property. Section 25 defines &quot;plinth<lb/> area&quot;. Section 26 provides for a notice to be given of any intended<lb/> transfer of vacant land to the competent authority, which has the first<lb/> option to purchase such land on behalf of the State Government. The<lb/> section also contains machinery provisions for completing such sale in<lb/> case the option is exercised by the competent authority. Section 27 enacts<lb/> a prohibition on transfer of urban property. Section 28 makes subsidiary<lb/> provisions for regulating registration of documents so as to effectively<lb/> implement the provisions of Sections 26 and 27. Section 29 contains<lb/> regulatory provisions for construction of buildings with dwelling units.<lb/> Demolition and stoppage of buildings constructed / being constructed in<lb/> contravention of the provisions of Section 29 is provided under Section<lb/> 30.<lb/> 16<lb/> Chapter V contains miscellaneous provisions providing for<lb/> powers of the competent authority (Section 31), jurisdiction of authorities<lb/> and tribunals (Section 32), appeal (Section 33), Revision (Section 34),<lb/> power of the State Government to issue directions (Section 35), power of<lb/> the Central Government to give directions (Section 36), returns and<lb/> reports, offences and penalties, etc. Section 42 in this chapter provides for<lb/> the overriding effect of the provisions of the Principal Act.<lb/> After the Principal Act came into force in the State of<lb/> Maharashtra, statements under Section 6 thereof were filed by<lb/> landholders. In some cases the land acquisition was completed and excess<lb/> vacant lands were taken possession of after following the procedure laid<lb/> down in Sections 8 to 10; whilst in other cases proceedings were pending<lb/> at various stages provided under Sections 8 to 10 or the appellate and<lb/> revisional stages under Sections 33 and 34 of the Principal Act. In respect<lb/> of some lands orders were passed under Sections 20 and 21 sanctioning<lb/> schemes presented by landholders and accordingly exemptions were<lb/> granted on conditions or excess vacant land was directed not to be treated<lb/> as excess, respectively, under Sections 20 and 21; and these schemes were<lb/> either completed or were at different stages of completion. In some cases,<lb/> where the conditions of exemption orders were breached, the exemptions<lb/> were withdrawn and the procedure under Sections 8 to 10 of the Principal<lb/> Act for acquisition of land thus rendered excess vacant land was being<lb/> applied to such lands and was at varying stages of completion. This was<lb/> the position in 1999, when the Parliament passed the Repeal Act.<lb/> 18<lb/> On 11 January 1999, an ordinance to repeal the Principal Act<lb/> was promulgated by the President. This was followed by a bill to repeal<lb/> the Principal Act tabled in the Parliament, being Bill No.17/1999. The bill<lb/> proposed repeal of the Principal Act in the same terms as the ordinance.<lb/></figure>

			<figure type="table">The statement of objects and reasons contained in the bill is in the<lb/> following terms :<lb/> &quot;<lb/> The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976<lb/> was passed with a laudable social objective. The main<lb/> purpose was to prevent concentration of urban land<lb/> in a few hands and to provide affordable housing to<lb/> the Economically Weaker Sections. It has on the<lb/> contrary pushed up land prices, practically brought<lb/> the housing industry to a stop and provided<lb/> opportunities for corruption. There is a widespread<lb/> demand for removing this irritant to land assembly<lb/> and construction activity. During the implementation<lb/> of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act,<lb/> 1976, there have been a spate of litigations giving rise<lb/> to serious hurdles in taking over possession of land,<lb/> by the State Governments. Public opinion is nearly<lb/> unanimous that the Act has failed to achieve its<lb/> objectives as expected.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Parliament has no power to repeal or amend the Act<lb/> unless resolutions are passed by two or more State<lb/> Legislatures as required under clause (2) of Article<lb/> 252. The Legislatures of Haryana and Punjab have<lb/> passed resolutions empowering Parliament to repeal<lb/> the Act in those States. The Act stands repealed in<lb/> those States and in the Union territories immediately<lb/> after promulgation of the repeal Ordinance and<lb/> subsequently if State Legislatures adopt this Repeal<lb/> Act by resolution, then the Urban Land (Ceiling and<lb/> Regulation) Act, 1976 will stand repealed in those<lb/> States, from the date of its adoption.<lb/> 3.<lb/> The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Bill,<lb/> 1998 was examined by the Standing Committee on<lb/> Urban and Rural Development. The Committee felt<lb/> that the land which is yet to be put to use for the<lb/> original purposes stated in the Act, under possession<lb/> of the Government should not be restored to previous<lb/> owners as such restoration may lead to avoidable<lb/> discrimination. The Committee also suggested that the<lb/> repeal Bill should contain a provision for abatement<lb/> of proceedings in the different courts. Keeping in view<lb/> the recommendations of the Committee, this Bill is<lb/> being introduced to replace the Urban Land (Ceiling<lb/> and Regulation) Repeal Ordinance, 1999 (Ord.5 of<lb/> 1999) notified on 11.01.1999 so that the State<lb/> Governments would be free to have their own<lb/> legislation commensurate with their needs and<lb/> experiences. Till this Act is repealed, States have no<lb/> power to legislate on this subject.<lb/> 4.<lb/> The proposed repeal, along with some other incentives<lb/> and simplification of administrative procedures, is<lb/> expected to revive the stagnant housing industry. The<lb/> repeal will facilitate construction of dwelling units<lb/> both in the public and private sector and help<lb/> achievement of targets contemplated under National<lb/> Agenda for Governance. The repeal will not, however,<lb/> affect vesting of any vacant land under subsection<lb/> (3) of Section 10 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and<lb/> Regulation) Act, 1976 the possession of which has<lb/> been taken over by the State Governments. It will not<lb/> affect payments made to the State Governments for<lb/> exemptions. The exemptions granted under Section 20<lb/> of the Act will continue to be operative. The amounts<lb/> paid out by the State Governments will become<lb/> refundable before restoration of the land to the<lb/> former owners.<lb/> 5.<lb/> The Bill also seeks to facilitate land assembly and a<lb/> flexible regime for administering urban land to suit<lb/> the varying local conditions based on State level<lb/> legislations or requirements.&quot;<lb/> The bill was passed by the Parliament and the Repeal Act was enacted.<lb/> The Repeal Act contains the following provisions :<lb/> &quot;1.<lb/> Short title and application commencement: -<lb/>(1) This Act may be called the Urban Land (Ceiling<lb/> and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999.<lb/> (2)<lb/> It applies in the first instance to the whole of the<lb/> States of Haryana and Punjab and to all the Union<lb/> territories; and it shall apply to such other State<lb/> which adopts this Act by resolution passed in that<lb/> behalf under clause (2) of article 252 of the<lb/> Constitution.<lb/> (3) It shall be deemed to have come into force in<lb/> the States of Haryana and Punjab and in all the<lb/> Union territories on the 11th day of January, 1999<lb/> and in any other State which adopts this Act under<lb/> clause (2) of article 252 of the Constitution on the<lb/> date of such adoption; and the reference to repeal of<lb/> the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976<lb/> shall, in relation to any State or Union territory,<lb/> mean the date on which this Act comes into force in<lb/> such State or Union territory.<lb/> 2.<lb/> Repeal of Act 33 of 1976: -The Urban Land (Ceiling<lb/> and Regulation) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as<lb/> the principal Act) is hereby repealed.<lb/> 3.<lb/> Savings: -<lb/>(1) The repeal of the principal Act shall not affect<lb/> (a) the vesting of any vacant land under<lb/> subsection (3) of section 10, possession of which has<lb/> been taken over by the State Government or any<lb/> person duly authorised by the State Government in<lb/> this behalf or by the competent authority;<lb/> (b) the validity of any order granting<lb/> exemption under subsection (1) of section 20 or any<lb/> action taken thereunder, notwithstanding any<lb/> judgment of any court to the contrary;<lb/> (c) any payment made to the State<lb/> Government as a condition for granting exemption<lb/> under subsection (1) of section 20.<lb/></figure>

			<figure>(2) Where-<lb/>(a) any land is deemed to have vested in the<lb/> State Government under subsection (3) of section 10<lb/> of the principal Act but possession of which has not<lb/> been taken over by the State Government or any<lb/> person duly authorised by the State Government in<lb/> this behalf or by the competent authority; and<lb/> (b) any amount has been paid by the State<lb/> Government with respect to such land,<lb/> then, such land shall not be restored unless the<lb/> amount paid, if any, has been refunded to the State<lb/> Government.<lb/></figure>

			<head>4.<lb/></head>

			<p>Abatement of legal proceedings : -<lb/>All proceedings relating to any order made or<lb/> purported to be made under the principal Act pending<lb/> immediately before the commencement of this Act,<lb/> before any court, tribunal or other authority shall<lb/> abate:<lb/></p>

			<p>Provided that this section shall not apply to the<lb/> proceedings relating to sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 of<lb/> the principal Act in so far as such proceedings are<lb/> relatable to the land, possession of which has been<lb/> taken over by the State Government or any person<lb/> duly authorised by the State Government in this<lb/> behalf or by the competent authority.<lb/></p>

			<p>Repeal and saving : -<lb/></p>

			<p>(1) The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation)<lb/> Repeal <ref type="biblio">Ordinance, 1999 (Ord. 5 of 1999)</ref> is hereby<lb/> repealed.<lb/></p>

			<p>(2) Notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or<lb/> any action taken under the said Ordinance shall be<lb/> deemed to have been done or taken under the<lb/> corresponding provisions of this Act.&quot;<lb/> The State of Maharashtra adopted the Repeal Act by a<lb/></p>

			<figure>resolution passed and adopted by both houses of State Legislature under<lb/> Article 252(2) of the Constitution of India on 29 November 2007. The<lb/> resolution adopted by the State of Maharashtra is in the following terms :<lb/> &quot;MAHARASTHRA<lb/> LEGISLATIVE<lb/> ASSEMBLY<lb/> RESOLUTION<lb/> Whereas, the Maharashtra Legislative<lb/> Assembly on 5 th October 1971 and the Maharashtra<lb/> Legislative Council on the 7 th October 1971 had, in<lb/> pursuance of clause (1) of article 252 of the<lb/> Constitution of India, resolved that the imposition of<lb/> ceiling on urban immovable property and acquisition<lb/> of such property in excess of the ceiling and all<lb/> matters connected therewith or ancillary and<lb/> incidental thereto should be regulated in the State of<lb/> Maharashtra by Parliament by law :<lb/></figure>

			<p>And Whereas, the Parliament had<lb/> thereafter enacted the Urban Land (Ceiling and<lb/> Regulation) <ref type="biblio">Act, 1976 (Central Act No. 33</ref></p>

 of 1976);<lb/> And Whereas, consequent upon the<lb/> resolutions passed by the Houses of the Legislatures of<lb/> the States of Haryana and Punjab, under article<lb/> 252(2) of the Constitution, that the Urban Land<lb/> (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, in its application<lb/> to those States, be repealed by Parliament by law, the<lb/> Parliament has enacted the Urban Land (Ceiling and<lb/> Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 (Act No. 15 of 1999);<lb/> And Whereas, subsection (2) of section<lb/> 1 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal<lb/> Act, 1999, provides that the said Act shall apply to<lb/> such other State which adopts the said Act by<lb/> resolution passed in that behalf under clause (2) of<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 :::<lb/> *197*<lb/> article 252 of the Constitution;<lb/> And Whereas, the Government of<lb/> Maharashtra is of the opinion that the Urban Land<lb/> (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 should be<lb/> repealed, in its application to the State of<lb/> Maharashtra, so that land in urban area may be<lb/> available for housing;<lb/> Now, therefore, in pursuance of clause<lb/> (2) of article 252 of the Constitution of India, the<lb/> Maharashtra Legislative Assembly hereby resolves<lb/> that the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal<lb/> Act, 1999, passed by the Parliament be adopted for<lb/> this State.&quot;<lb/> Accordingly, the Repeal Act was brought into force in the<lb/> State of Maharashtra on 29 November 2007.<lb/></figure>

			<head>20<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the common law rule, the consequence of repeal of a<lb/> statute is that the statute is as completely obliterated as if it had never<lb/> been enacted except of course as to transactions past and closed. The<lb/> clearest statement of this law is contained in the judgment of Tindal J. in<lb/> the case of Kay vs. Goodwin 1 to the following effect :<lb/></p>

			<p>&apos;The effect of repealing a statute is to obliterate it as<lb/> completely from the records of the parliament as if it had<lb/> never been passed; and, it must be considered as a law that<lb/> never existed, except for the purpose of those actions which<lb/> were commenced, prosecuted, and concluded whilst it was an<lb/> existing law.&apos;<lb/></p>

			<p>The march of law since those days is noted by the Supreme<lb/> Court in one of its oldest judgments on the point, in the case of State of<lb/> 1 1830 English Reports (Volume 130) at page 1403, Chief Justice Tindal<lb/> Punjab vs. Mohar Singh 1 , in the following words :<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot; (6)<lb/> Under the law of England, as it stood prior to the<lb/> Interpretation Act of 1889, the effect of repealing a statute<lb/> was said to be to obliterate it as completely from the<lb/> records of Parliament as if it had never been passed, except<lb/> for the purpose of those actions, which were commenced,<lb/> prosecuted and concluded while it was an existing law :Vide<lb/> Craies on Statute Law, 5th edn. page 323. A repeal<lb/> therefore without any saving clause would destroy any<lb/> proceeding whether not yet begun or whether pending at<lb/> the time of the enactment of the Repealing Act and not<lb/> already prosecuted to a final judgment so as to create a<lb/> vested right: Vide Crawford on Statutory Constitution, pp.<lb/> 599600. To obviate such results a practice came into<lb/> existence in England to insert a saving clause in the<lb/> repealing statute with a view to preserve rights and<lb/> liabilities already accrued or incurred under the repealed<lb/> enactment.<lb/></p>

			<p>Later on, to dispense with the necessity of having to<lb/> insert a saving clause on each occasion, section 38(2) was<lb/> inserted in the Interpretation Act of 1889 which provides<lb/> that a repeal, unless the contrary intention appears, does<lb/> not affect the previous operation of the repealed enactment<lb/> or anything duly done or suffered under it and any<lb/> investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted,<lb/> continued or enforced in respect of any right, liability and<lb/> penalty under the repealed Act as if the Repealing Act had<lb/> not been passed. Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, as is<lb/> well known, is on the same lines as section 38(2) of the<lb/> Interpretation Act of England. &quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>The net result then would be that though the repealed statute<lb/> is obliterated from the statute book, to see what is saved despite the<lb/> repeal, one has to go by the saving clause, if any, of the repealing statute<lb/> and the provisions of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act insofar as they<lb/> apply.<lb/></p>

			<figure>1 AIR 1955 S.C. 84 (Vol. 42 C.N. 20)<lb/> The savings clause of the Repeal Act, in our case, saves firstly<lb/> the vesting of any vacant land under subsection (3) of Section 10 of the<lb/> Principal Act, but with a caveat. Such vesting is saved only if possession of<lb/> such vacant land has already been taken over by the State Government or<lb/> any person duly authorized by the State Government in this behalf or by<lb/> the competent authority (Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act). Secondly, it<lb/> saves the validity of any order granting exemption under subsection (1)<lb/> of Section 20 or any action taken thereunder, and it saves such validity<lb/> notwithstanding a judgment of any court to the contrary (Section 3(1)(b)<lb/> of the Repeal Act). Thirdly, the savings clause saves any payment made to<lb/> the State Government as a condition for granting exemption under Sub<lb/> Section (1) of Section 20 (Section 3(1)(c) of the Repeal Act). A further<lb/> saving provision is contained in subsection (2) of Section 3, which does<lb/> not require restoration of any land which is deemed to have vested in the<lb/> State Government under subsection (3) of Section 10 of the Principal<lb/> Act, but possession of which has not been taken over, subject to two<lb/> conditions -one, any amount has been paid by the State government with<lb/> respect to such land and two, such amount has not been refunded to the<lb/> State Government. In other words, if these two conditions are fulfilled,<lb/> the vesting of such land continues and is saved from the effects of the<lb/> repeal. Lastly, the savings clause saves proceedings relating to Sections 11,<lb/> 12, 13 and 14 of the Principal Act in so far as such proceedings are<lb/> relatable to the land, possession of which has been taken over by the State<lb/> Government or any person authorized by the State Government or any<lb/> person authorized by the State Government or by the competent<lb/> authority. This is a necessary corollary of saving the vesting of such land.<lb/> If the land is vested and the vesting saved by the Repeal Act, the<lb/> proceedings relating to such land for (I) determination of compensation<lb/> (Section 11), appeals to a tribunal from such determinations (Section 12),<lb/> appeals to the High Court from the appellate orders of tribunals (Section<lb/> 13) and (ii) determination of mode of payment of compensation (Section<lb/> 14), are also saved.<lb/> 22<lb/> The scheme of the Repeal Act is thus absolutely clear and<lb/> there are unambiguous indications in this scheme that the Repeal Act was<lb/> meant to completely do away with the Principal Act except in cases of<lb/> actions taken under the Principal Act which had achieved a finality. In the<lb/> first place, we may note the principal Section in the Repeal Act, i.e.<lb/> Section 2, which repeals the Principal Act as a whole without any<lb/> reservation. Secondly, the saving clause in Section 3(2) read with Section<lb/> 3(1) shows that any land which is deemed to be vested in the State<lb/> Government under Section 10(3) of the Principal Act will stand restored<lb/> to the owner of such land except in two cases. One, where the vesting is<lb/> accompanied by taking over of possession of the land (i.e. where<lb/> possession is surrendered to the State Government by the owner in<lb/> pursuance of a notice under Section 10(5) or where possession is taken by<lb/> the competent authority under Section 10(6) of the Principal Act). And<lb/> the other, where possession is not taken but any amount has been paid by<lb/> the State Government with respect to such land. In the latter case, such<lb/> land shall not be restored unless the amount paid by the State<lb/> Government is refunded to it. No vesting order except in the two<lb/> contingencies noted above is saved by the Repeal Act. Thirdly, it may be<lb/> noted that Section 3(1)(b) saves the validity of an order granting<lb/> exemption under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act or any action taken<lb/> thereunder. It does not in terms save any action to be taken thereunder,<lb/> but saves validity of any action already taken thereunder. Fourthly,<lb/> exemption order under Section 20(1) of the<lb/> Principal Act.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In case (i), the Repeal Act has no effect whatsoever. It is to be<lb/> treated as a transaction past and closed. It is fully saved despite the<lb/> repeal. In case of (ii), the Repeal Act shall have an effect subject to refund<lb/> being made to the State Government of the amount paid by it. If such<lb/> refund is made, the Repeal Act will have its full effect and the vesting will<lb/> not be saved at all. In case of (iii), the payment made or action taken, as<lb/> the case may be, will be saved.<lb/></p>

			<figure>24<lb/> These provisions are clear and loud. They imply a complete<lb/> repeal or obliteration of the law except in cases particularly provided for.<lb/> But if and to the extent there is any ambiguity (thereby permitting<lb/> external aids for interpretation of the repealing statute), we may have<lb/> reference to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the repealing<lb/> statute. The Statement of Objects, as noted above, shows that whereas the<lb/> main purpose of the Principal Act was to prevent concentration of urban<lb/> land in a few hands and provide affordable housing to economically<lb/> weaker sections, the Act actually resulted in pushing up land prices,<lb/> practically brought the housing industry to a stop and provided<lb/> opportunities for corruption. The Objects and Reasons acknowledge a<lb/> near unanimous public opinion that the Act has failed to achieve its<lb/> objectives as expected. In these premises, the Repeal Act proposes a<lb/> complete repeal without any reservation, saving only the consequences<lb/> specially provided for.<lb/> 25<lb/> In the backdrop of what is stated above, we may now discuss<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 :::<lb/> *203*<lb/></figure>

			<p>the effect of the saving clause insofar as it saves the validity of an<lb/> exemption order. At the outset, we may note that the very idea of saving<lb/> from the effect of a repeal is to save something that is accrued or<lb/> incurred under the repealed statute. It is the right or liability which is<lb/> crystallized before the repeal. The effect of saving of an exemption order<lb/> must be considered in that light. At the same time, it may be noted that it<lb/> is the exemption order as a whole which is saved. The exemption order, as<lb/> rightly noted by brother Dharmadhikari J, grants a privilege, but such<lb/> privilege is granted on certain conditions. The entire exemption order<lb/> would be valid, that is to say, both the privilege and the conditions would<lb/> be valid. In the absence of any valid reasons, it cannot possibly be<lb/> suggested that only the privilege is valid and not the conditions on which<lb/> it is granted.<lb/></p>

			<figure>26<lb/> Now the question is, what are the consequences of such<lb/> validity. The obvious consequences, which are provided in the Repeal Act<lb/> itself, are (a) all actions taken under the exemption order are valid and<lb/> (b) payment made thereunder to the State Government is valid. But what<lb/> are the other consequences. Could it be that the breach of the conditions<lb/> of a valid exemption order would attract the provisions of Section 20(2)<lb/> and all provisions of Chapter III including those relating to vesting of the<lb/> land would thereupon apply to such land (i.e. land becoming excess<lb/> vacant land as a result of withdrawal of exemption under Section 20(2)).<lb/> 27<lb/> There are clear indications in the Repeal Act that these<lb/> consequences are not contemplated. In the first place, withdrawal of an<lb/> exemption order renders the land &apos;excess vacant land&apos; just as any other<lb/> vacant land which is in excess of the ceiling limit and which is not subject<lb/> to an exemption order under Section 20(1). If such other vacant land<lb/> could not continue to be vested in the State Government even after the<lb/> provisions of Section 10(3) applied to it, if possession of the land was not<lb/> already taken by the Government on the date of the repeal, there is no<lb/> reason why the provisions of Section 20(2) and consequences of<lb/> withdrawal of exemption thereunder should apply to a land which is<lb/> exempted under Section 20(1), but conditions of such exemption are<lb/> breached as on, or after, the date of the repeal.<lb/> 28<lb/> If Chapter III were to apply to such land, which has become<lb/> excess vacant land by reason of withdrawal of the exemption order in<lb/> connection therewith, but not to other excess vacant lands, anomalous<lb/></figure>

			<p>and incongruent consequences would follow. Take for example, the case<lb/> of two pieces of land one where the exemption order has already been<lb/> withdrawn before the repeal and a statement under Section 6 is filed in<lb/> connection with such land, but no further steps have been taken and the<lb/> other land, which had no exemption order at any time and therefore, was<lb/> excess vacant land ever since the appointed day. In the case of this latter<lb/> land, not only is a statement under Section 6 filed, but further<lb/> proceedings have culminated into a declaration under Section 10(3) and<lb/> this has resulted in deemed vesting of the land in the State Government.<lb/></p>

			<p>Yet the latter land stands restored to the land owner upon repeal , but the<lb/> proceedings under Sections 8, 9 and 10 would have to continue in respect<lb/> of the former land despite the repeal and that land at the conclusion of<lb/> these proceedings could vest in, and would have to be surrendered to,<lb/> and if not surrendered, forcibly taken possession of by, the State<lb/> Government. It is difficult to see the rationale behind such anomalous and<lb/> incongruent treatment to the two lands in our example.<lb/></p>

			<p>Section 10; that it was an admitted position that though a declaration was<lb/> made under Section 10(3) followed by a notice under Section 10(<ref type="formula">5</ref></p>

),<lb/> actual physical possession was not taken over by the State Government or<lb/> the Competent Authority under the Principal Act by the time the Repeal<lb/> Act was brought in force; and that accordingly, the vesting of the land in<lb/> the Government was not saved. The Division Bench relied upon a<lb/> judgment of another Division Bench of our Court in Voltas Ltd. Vs.<lb/> Additional Collector and Competent Authority 1 in this behalf.<lb/> 30<lb/> The law stated in Vithabai Bama Bhandari (supra) in this<lb/> behalf has not been contested by the State. The learned Advocate<lb/> General, in his submissions, accepts that any land, earlier exempted under<lb/> Section 20(1), but exemption of which was already withdrawn under<lb/> Section 20(2) before the repeal of the Principal Act, cannot vest in the<lb/> State Government after the repeal if possession of such land was not<lb/> taken over by the State before the date of repeal. That indeed would be<lb/> the effect of Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal Act. Once this position is<lb/> accepted, there is possibly no logic or justification for not applying this<lb/> law to the land exempted under Section 20(1) but exemption of which is<lb/> withdrawn after the date of repeal. If the power of the Government to<lb/> acquire the land in the event of withdrawal of exemption before the<lb/> repeal is not saved by the Repeal Act except in a case where the exercise<lb/> of such power is completed by not just deemed vesting under Section<lb/> 10(3) but by taking over of physical possession under Section 10(5) or<lb/> 10(6), there is no reason why such power is saved for a land, the<lb/> exemption of which is withdrawn after the repeal.<lb/> 31<lb/> Even Section 4 of the Repeal Act is a pointer to show that<lb/> 1 2008(5) Bom.C.R. 746<lb/> applicability of SubSection(2) of Section 20 of the Principal Act as also<lb/> applicability of the provisions of Chapter III to lands earlier subject to<lb/> exemptions under SubSection(1) of Section 20, but which exemptions<lb/> were withdrawn either before or after the repeal, is not saved. Section 4<lb/> makes it clear that all proceedings relating to any order made or<lb/> purported to be made under the Principal Act shall lapse save and except<lb/> proceedings under Section 11 to 14 in relation to land, possession of<lb/> which has been taken over by the State Government under the Act.<lb/> Section 4 does not make any distinction in respect of proceedings in<lb/> relation to (i) land which has become excess vacant land by reason of<lb/> withdrawal of exemption order Section 20(2) and (ii) all other excess<lb/> vacant lands. Just as in the case of all other lands, where possession is not<lb/> taken over, even in the case of lands, to which Chapter III is being applied<lb/> by reason of withdrawal of the exemption order, the proceedings would<lb/> clearly abate. Any other interpretation would be clearly contrary to the<lb/> plain reading of Section 4.<lb/> 32<lb/> The Repeal Act, thus, does not save any order passed or to be<lb/> passed under Section 20(2) withdrawing exemption under Section 20(1)<lb/> of the Principal Act and thereby applying Chapter III to the land in<lb/> question. If anything, the repealing statute would have expressly provided<lb/> so. It does not provide for saving of either Section 20(2) or any order<lb/> passed under Section 20(2). When the applicability of the whole of<lb/> Chapter III is done away with in relation to all excess vacant land other<lb/> than land of which possession is taken by the State under that chapter,<lb/> there is no discernible reason why that Chapter should apply to land<lb/> exemption of which has been withdrawn under Section 20(2) of the<lb/> Principal Act. Upon withdrawal of exemption, such land is like any other<lb/> excess vacant land and the provisions of the Principal Act including<lb/> Chapter III will cease to apply to it unless the vesting of such land in the<lb/> State Government is followed by taking over of possession. Thus, it is<lb/> clear that the saving clause of the Repeal Act does not save the land once<lb/> exempted under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act from the application of<lb/> the repeal.<lb/> 33<lb/> Let us now consider if it is saved by the provisions of Section<lb/> 6 of the General Clauses Act. Learned Advocate General relied upon the<lb/> judgment of the Supreme Court in Bansidhar Vs. State of Rajasthan 1<lb/> and submitted that a saving provision in a repealing statute is not<lb/> exhaustive of the rights and liabilities which are saved or which survive<lb/> the repeal, and Section 6 of the General Clauses Act can still be invoked<lb/> so as to save other rights, privileges, obligations and liabilities which have<lb/> been acquired or accrued or incurred under the repealed statute before<lb/> the date of the repeal. The Court in that case reiterated the law laid<lb/> down in I.T. Commissioner Vs. Shah Sadiq &amp; Sons 2 , to the following<lb/> effect: (SCC P. 524, para 15)<lb/> &quot;<lb/> .</figure>

			<p>..In other words whatever rights are expressly<lb/> saved by the &apos;savings&apos; provision stand saved. But that does not<lb/> mean that rights which are not saved by the &apos;savings&apos; provision<lb/> are extinguished or stand ipso facto terminated by the mere<lb/> fact that a new statute repealing the old statute is enacted.<lb/> Rights which have accrued are saved unless they are taken<lb/> away expressly. This is the principle behind Section 6(c),<lb/> General Clauses Act, 1897.... &quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>But then as the Supreme Court has held in Bansidhar&apos;s case<lb/> itself, as also in a numerous other cases, what we have to also see is,<lb/></p>

			<figure>whether the repealing statute exhibits a contrary intention. Section 6 of<lb/> the General Clauses Act provides the various contingencies which a repeal<lb/> does not affect, but prefaces that by providing: &quot;unless a different<lb/> intention appears&quot;. In Kalawati Devi Harlake Vs. The Commissioner of<lb/> Income Tax, West Bengal 1 , the Supreme Court was concerned with the<lb/> Income Tax Act, 1922, which was repealed by the Income Tax Act, 1961.<lb/> The Commissioner of Income Tax in that case had issued a notice<lb/> regarding incometax assessments of the assessee for the years 195253 to<lb/> 196061, which, according to the Commissioner, were erroneous and<lb/> prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, and for which the Commissioner<lb/> proposed to issue proceedings under Section 33 B of the Income Tax Act,<lb/> 1922. The assessee claimed that the Income Tax Act, 1922 was repealed<lb/> by the Income Tax Act, 1961 which came into force on April 1, 1962, and<lb/> that powers under the repealed Act under Section 33 B could not any<lb/> longer be exercised. Section 297 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provided for<lb/> the repeal of the 1922 Act and also provided savings therefrom. Section<lb/> 297 did not cover saving of the proceedings under Section 33B of the<lb/> repealed Act after the repeal. The Department, however, relied upon<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. The Supreme Court noted that<lb/> Section 297 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provided for various<lb/> &apos;proceedings&apos; which may be initiated and prosecuted or continued in<lb/> respect of any past matter or assessment. The Court observed that Section<lb/> 297 was meant to provide as far as possible for all contingencies which<lb/> may arise out of the repeal of the 1922 Act and that Section 297 did not<lb/> provide for saving of provisions regarding appeals, revisions etc. in<lb/> respect of assessment orders already made or which were authorized to<lb/> be made under that Section. The Income Tax department, however,<lb/> argued that the Parliament had Section 6 of the General Clauses Act in<lb/> 1 AIR 1968 SC 162<lb/> view and therefore no express provision was made dealing with appeals<lb/> and revisions, etc. This contention was rejected the Supreme Court in the<lb/> following words: (Pg 168 of AIR 1968 SC 162)<lb/> &quot; (15)<lb/></figure>

			<p>The learned counsel for the appellant submits<lb/> that Parliament had S. 6 of the General Clauses Act in<lb/> view, and therefore no express provision was made<lb/> dealing with appeals and revisions, etc.<lb/></p>

			<p>In our view<lb/> Section 6 of the General Clauses Act would not apply<lb/> because Section 297(2) evidences an intention to the<lb/> contrary.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Union of India v. Madan Gopal Kabra,<lb/> (1954) 24 ITR 58 = (AIR 1954 SC 158) while interpreting<lb/> Section 13 of the Finance Act, 1950, already extracted<lb/> above, this Court observed at p. 68 (of ITR) = (at p. 162 of<lb/> AIR) :<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot;Nor can section 6 of the General Clauses Act<lb/> 1897, serve to keep alive the liability to pay tax on the<lb/> income of the year 194950 assuming it to have accrued<lb/> under the repealed State law, for a &quot;different intention&quot;<lb/> clearly appears in sections 2 and 13 of the Finance Act<lb/> read together as indicated above.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>It is true that whether a different intention appears or not<lb/> must depend on the language and content of Section<lb/> 297(2). It seems to us, however, that by providing for so<lb/> many matters mentioned above some in accord with what<lb/> would have been the result under Section 6 of the General<lb/> Clauses Act and some contrary to what have been the result<lb/> under Section 6, Parliament has clearly evidenced an<lb/> intention to the contrary. &quot;<lb/></p>

			<head>34<lb/></head>

			<p>The repealing statute in our case, as noted above, exhibits a<lb/> contrary intention to not to save anything which is not expressly saved by<lb/> the saving clauses contained in Sections 3 and 4 thereof.<lb/></p>

			<head>35<lb/></head>

			<p>Even otherwise, assuming that Clauses (a) to (e) of Section 6<lb/> of the General Clauses Act were to apply to acts, or rights and liabilities,<lb/> or proceedings under the Principal Act after the repeal, it is difficult to see<lb/> how the exemption order can be withdrawn or provisions of Chapter III<lb/> can be applied to such land upon withdrawal of exemption. The argument<lb/> of the State is that by virtue of Clause (c) of Section 6, rights, privileges,<lb/> obligations or liabilities under the repealed Principal Act, are saved.<lb/></p>

			<p>Clause (c) talks about any right, privilege, obligation or liability &quot;acquired,<lb/> accrued or incurred&quot; under the repealed enactment. Mere existence of a<lb/> right, which has not been &quot;acquired&quot; or &quot;accrued&quot; on the date of the<lb/> repeal, would not get protection under Clause (c) of Section 6. So also a<lb/> liability cannot be enforced under the provisions of the repealed statute<lb/> unless the same is &quot;incurred&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<head>36<lb/></head>

			<p>In the case of Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Ltd. Vs. Amrit<lb/></p>

			<p>Lal &amp; Co. 1 , the Supreme Court explained the provision thus:<lb/></p>

			<p>&quot; 25. The opening words of Section 6 specify the field over<lb/> which it is operative. It is operative over all the enactments<lb/> under the General Clauses Act, Central Act or regulations<lb/> made after the commencement of General Clauses Act. It<lb/> also clarifies in case of repeal of any provision under the<lb/> aforesaid Act or regulation, unless a different intention<lb/> appears from such repeal, it would have no effect over the<lb/> matters covered in its clauses viz. (a) to (e). It clearly<lb/> specifies that the repeal shall not revive anything not in<lb/> force or in existence or affect the previous operation of any<lb/> enactment so repealed or anything duly done or suffered or<lb/> affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired,<lb/> accrued or incurred under the repealed statute, affect any<lb/> penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any<lb/> offence committed under the repealed statute and also does<lb/> not affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in<lb/> respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability,<lb/> penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid.<lb/></p>

			<p>Thus the<lb/> central theme which spells out is that any investigation or<lb/> legal proceeding pending may be continued and enforced as<lb/> if the repealing Act or regulation had not come into force.<lb/></p>

			<head>26.<lb/></head>

			<p>As a general rule, in view of Section 6, the repeal of a<lb/> statute, which is not retrospective in operation, does not<lb/> prima facie affect the pending proceedings which may be<lb/> continued as if the repealed enactment were still in force. In<lb/> other words, such repeal does not effect the pending cases<lb/> which would continue to be concluded as if the enactment<lb/> has not been repealed. In fact when a lis commences, all<lb/> rights and obligations of the parties gets crystalised on that<lb/> date. The mandate of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is<lb/> simply to leave the pending proceedings unaffected which<lb/> commenced under the unrepealed provisions unless<lb/> contrary intention is expressed. We find clause (c) of<lb/> Section 6, refers the words &quot;any right, privilege, obligation...<lb/> acquired or accrued&quot; under the repealed statute would not<lb/> be affected by the repealing statute. We may hasten to<lb/> clarify here, mere existence of a right not being &quot;acquired&quot;<lb/> or &quot;accrued&quot;, on the date of the repeal, would not get<lb/> protection of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. &quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>In Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises (supra), the Supreme<lb/> Court quoted its decision in M. S. Shivananda Vs. Karnataka SRTC 1 in<lb/> this connection, which in turn quoted the eloquent observations of the<lb/> Privy Council in the case of Director of Public Works Vs. Ho Po Sang 2 in<lb/> this behalf, as follows:<lb/> &apos;It may be, therefore, that under some repealed<lb/> enactment, a right has been given but that, in respect of it,<lb/> some investigation or legal proceeding is necessary. The<lb/> right is then unaffected and preserved. It will be preserved<lb/> even if a process of quantification is necessary. But there<lb/> is a manifest distinction between an investigation in respect<lb/> of a right and an investigation which is to decide whether<lb/></p>

			<figure>1(1980) 1 SCC 149<lb/> 2[1961] A.C. 901 (P.C.)<lb/> some right should be or should not be given. On a repeal,<lb/> the former is preserved by the Interpretation Act. The latter<lb/> is not.&apos;<lb/> (emphasis supplied)<lb/> Even in Bansidhar&apos;s case the Supreme Court, whilst<lb/> construing Clauses (c) and (e) of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act,<lb/> had said this:<lb/> &quot; 30. For purposes of these clauses the &apos;right&apos;<lb/> must be &apos;accrued&apos; and not merely an inchoate<lb/> one. The distinction between what is and what<lb/> is not a right preserved by Section 6 of the<lb/> General Clauses Act, it is said, if often one of<lb/> great fineness. What is unaffected by the repeal<lb/> is a right &apos;acquired&apos; or &apos;accrued&apos; under the<lb/> repealed statute and not &apos;a mere hope or<lb/> expectation&apos; of acquiring a right or liberty to<lb/> apply for a right.&apos; &quot;<lb/> 37<lb/> Now let us see, how the provisions of the Principal Act with<lb/> which we are concerned in the present case, namely, Section 20(2) and<lb/> generally the provisions of Chapter III, fare in the context of an order<lb/> under Section 20(2), in this behalf. What is argued is that the landholder<lb/> holding an exemption under Section 20(1) attracts the liability to have<lb/> the exemption withdrawn and Chapter III of the Principal Act applied to<lb/> the land. This may certainly be called an existing liability and the<lb/> Government can be said to have a corresponding right to withdraw the<lb/> exemption and apply Chapter III to the land in question. But the question<lb/> is, is it an &quot;incurred&quot; or &quot;accrued&quot; right, as understood by law in the<lb/> context of application of Section 6. The consequence of a purported non<lb/> compliance with any of the conditions of an exemption order under<lb/></figure>

			<p>Section 20(1) of the Principal Act is that &quot;it shall be competent for the<lb/> State Government to withdraw, by order, such exemption.&quot; Such order can<lb/> be passed if &quot;the State Government is satisfied&quot; that any condition is not<lb/> complied with, and such satisfaction can be reached only &quot;after giving a<lb/> reasonable opportunity to such person for making a representation<lb/> against the proposed withdrawal&quot;. And only after all this is done and an<lb/> order of withdrawal of exemption is passed that &quot;the provisions of this<lb/> Chapter shall apply&quot;. Even application of Chapter III itself does not ispso<lb/> facto imply vesting of the land in the State Government. It only means<lb/> that the elaborate machinery of Section 6, 8, 9 and 10, including the<lb/> hearings at each of these stages, will have to be gone through before the<lb/> vesting can take place. It is not as if the exemption stands ispso facto<lb/> withdrawn and the land is deemed to be vested in the State Government<lb/> upon breach of a condition of exemption.<lb/></p>

			<head>38<lb/></head>

			<p>In the first place, whether there is a breach and therefore, a<lb/> corresponding right to the State to acquire excess vacant land, will itself<lb/> have to be ascertained. An investigation and a proceeding involving an<lb/> opportunity to show cause to the defaulting landholder are required to<lb/> enable the Government to pass an order withdrawing the exemption.<lb/></p>

			<p>Thereafter, further investigation and proceedings will have to be<lb/> undertaken to ascertain if the land is excess vacant land and whether the<lb/> land is to be acquired. During these proceedings, the landowner may even<lb/> apply that the excess vacant land may not be treated as excess under the<lb/> provisions of Section 21 or even present another Scheme under Section<lb/> 20 for exemption. In other words, before an &quot;accrued&quot; or &quot;acquired&quot;<lb/> vesting right can be claimed by the State, a whole of gamut of<lb/> investigation and proceedings will have to be gone through. Thus, neither<lb/> is any divesting of the land to the State &quot;incurred&quot; by the landholder nor<lb/> is the vesting &quot;accrued&quot; to, or &quot;acquired&quot; by, the State.<lb/> Thus, in the first place, there is no &quot;withdrawal of exemption&quot;<lb/> under Section 20(2) &quot;incurred&quot; nor any right to withdraw exemption and<lb/> apply Chapter III is &quot;accrued&quot; or &quot;acquired&quot; by the State. And as for<lb/> &apos;vesting&apos; of the land in the State, there is not even a statable case that the<lb/> &apos;vesting&apos; is in any way &quot;acquired&quot; or &quot;accrued&quot; in favour of the State at the<lb/> stage of breach of a condition or even at the stage of withdrawal of the<lb/> exemption. There is, in that case, no question of application of Section<lb/></p>

			<figure>6(c) of the General Clauses Act to the breach of a condition of an<lb/> exemption order and saving of the Government&apos;s power to withdraw the<lb/> exemption or apply Chapter III or acquire the land thereunder.<lb/> 40<lb/> Thus, neither the savings clause of the Repeal Act nor Section<lb/> 6 of the General Clauses Act saves the provisions of Section 20(2) or the<lb/> applicability of Chapter III of the Principal Act in relation to an exemption<lb/> order passed under Section 20(1). If the conditions of exemption granted<lb/> under Section 20(1) are breached, neither can the exemption be<lb/> withdrawn after the repeal nor could Chapter III be applied to the land<lb/> upon withdrawal of such exemption after the repeal. There is no question<lb/> of the State Government seeking to acquire such land any time after the<lb/> repeal.<lb/> 41<lb/> That still leaves the question: Are there any consequences<lb/> (apart from the ones discussed above) of the validity of the exemption<lb/> order saved under Section 3(1) (b) of the Repeal Act. We have noted that<lb/> the validity of an exemption order covers both the privilege, namely, the<lb/> exemption, and the conditions attached to that privilege. But we have also<lb/> noted that breach of these conditions cannot be visited with the<lb/> consequence of either withdrawal of exemption under Section 20(2) or<lb/> application of the other provisions of Chapter III after such withdrawal. If,<lb/> however, the exemption order together with its conditions could be<lb/> implemented or enforced by the State or any beneficiary of a scheme<lb/> sanctioned under Section 20(1), otherwise than by recourse to Section<lb/> 20(2) or other provisions of Chapter III of the Principal Act, when the<lb/> Principal Act was in force, there is no reason why such implementation or<lb/> enforcement is not possible after the repeal. Take the case of an<lb/> exemption order under Section 20(1) for a housing scheme with an<lb/> express condition of handing over a specified number of tenements to the<lb/> State Government. If the scheme is not implemented at all, the State has<lb/> no means of implementing the condition except by recourse to Section<lb/> 20(2) by withdrawing the exemption and applying the provisions of<lb/> Chapter III to the land. The Principal Act not being in force, this course is<lb/> not available to the State after the repeal. But if the scheme is<lb/> implemented, and a housing project is actually brought up on the land,<lb/> but the tenements have not been handed over to the State Government,<lb/> can the State Government not require the land owner to hand over the<lb/> tenements to the State Government, without withdrawing the exemption<lb/> under Section 20(2). The answer is yes. The State may go to a court of<lb/> law or devise any other means, legislative or executive, acceptable to law<lb/> to recover the possession of the tenements due to it. If the State could do<lb/> it when the principal statute was in force, there is no reason why it cannot<lb/> do so after the repeal, especially if the repealing statute expressly saves<lb/> the validity of both the exemption and the conditions on which it is based.<lb/> Take another case. An exemption order is issued under Section 20(1) in<lb/> respect of a land on a condition that such land shall be used only for<lb/> industrial purpose. This condition could have been implemented by the<lb/> State otherwise than by recourse to Section 20(2) of the Principal Act, say<lb/> by not sanctioning any plans for a non -industrial user. If the State could<lb/> do it before the repeal, it can do so even after the repeal. After all the<lb/> exemption order and its conditions are valid even after the repeal.<lb/> 42<lb/> In a sense, these are actions taken under the Principal Act<lb/> which have achieved a finality. In the case of the housing scheme referred<lb/> to in the example above, the housing scheme is completed. (It may even<lb/> be substantially completed.) The liability to hand over the tenements to<lb/> the Government has crystalized and has been incurred. The Government<lb/> in turn has acquired an enforceable right to get the tenements. In the<lb/> second case, namely, exemption on the condition of industrial user, the<lb/> exemption is a completed act. The land has been exempted under the<lb/> provisions of Section 20(1) on the condition that the only permissible user<lb/> would be the industrial user. No further act is required either on the part<lb/> of the landholder or the Government to make the condition enforceable.<lb/> The liability to not to use the land for a nonindustrial user is incurred by<lb/> the landholder and can be enforced by the Government in any manner<lb/> known to law.<lb/> 43<lb/> This, then, is the answer to the main question posed to the<lb/> Full Bench. What is saved by the saving clause of the repealing statute is<lb/> the validity of an exemption order, and it means the validity of both the<lb/> exemption and the conditions on which it is granted. But that does not<lb/> mean that the breach of any condition of the exemption order can be<lb/> visited with the consequence of either withdrawal of exemption under<lb/> Section 20(2) or application of Chapter III of the Principal Act to the land.<lb/> At the same time, if it were permissible to implement or enforce the<lb/> exemption order in any manner acceptable to law otherwise than by<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:40 :::<lb/> *218*<lb/> recourse to Section 20(2) or Chapter III of the Principal Act, such<lb/> implementation or enforcement is permissible even after the repeal.<lb/> 44<lb/> To this extent, I am not in agreement with the view expressed<lb/> by the Andhra Pradesh and Delhi High Courts, respectively, in Surendra<lb/> Raj Jaiswal vs. Government of Andhra Pradesh 1 and Tej Pratap Singh<lb/> vs. Union of India 2 . I am in respectful agreement with the view of the<lb/> learned Single Judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of<lb/> Surendra Raj Jaiswal (supra) that on noncompliance of conditions of an<lb/> exemption order, the State Government after the repeal of the Principal<lb/> Act was not empowered to withdraw the exemption granted under<lb/> Section 20(1). With respect, however, I do not agree with his view that in<lb/> the absence of the power to withdraw the exemption, the conditions have<lb/> become unenforceable and are nonest or that such land has become<lb/> freehold land irrespective of any conditions with regard to the usage of<lb/> the exempted land. So also, for the reasons discussed above, I am in<lb/> respectful disagreement with the statement of law by the Delhi High<lb/> Court in the case of Tej Pratap Singh (supra) that after the repeal, the<lb/> conditions of exemption, which remain unimplemented, cannot be<lb/> implemented because they are not specifically saved. The conditions are<lb/> saved because the exemption order as a whole is saved. They can even be<lb/> enforced, if the liability created thereby has been incurred, as discussed<lb/> above. One of the reasons cited by the Delhi High Court whilst arriving at<lb/> this conclusion was the provision of Section 3(1) (c) of the Repeal Act. In<lb/> Tej Pratap Singh&apos;s case (supra) the exemption under Section 20(1) was<lb/> granted on a condition requiring certain payment to be made to the State<lb/> Government. The Delhi High Court held that under Section 3(1) (c) the<lb/> actual payment was saved, but not the condition of payment. The Court<lb/> felt that had it not been specifically provided that the payment made to<lb/> the State Government was saved despite the repeal, the same would have<lb/> been affected by the repeal. From this, the Court deduced that in the<lb/> context of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, the landholder&apos;s right to<lb/> exemption under Section 20(1) is specifically saved, but not the &apos;liability&apos;<lb/></figure>

			<p>to make the payment, unless the payment had already been made prior to<lb/> the repeal. I am afraid that would not be a correct way of dealing with the<lb/> question of validity of a condition or any liability created thereunder. As<lb/> discussed by me above, and explained in the judgment of my brother<lb/> Dharmadhikari J, the exemption order and its conditions are both valid.<lb/></p>

			<p>That is the consequence of Section 3(1) (b) itself. One need not have<lb/> recourse to Section 3(1) (c) for that validity. Just as any other condition is<lb/> valid, so is the condition requiring payment is valid. The question only is<lb/> whether, and to what extent, this valid condition can be enforced. As<lb/> explained by me above, if the scheme under which exemption was<lb/> granted was not implemented or acted upon at all (or<lb/> even<lb/> substantially), the only consequence of noncompliance of such condition<lb/> (say, of payment) would be to withdraw the exemption and apply Chapter<lb/> III to the land. That is, as explained above, not permissible. But if it is<lb/> implemented or substantially acted upon, then surely in a given case the<lb/> condition can be enforced without withdrawal of exemption in a manner<lb/> known to law, i.e. by any acceptable judicial, legislative or executive<lb/> device.<lb/></p>

			<head>45.<lb/></head>

			<p>The only question is, why is then the provision of Section<lb/> 3(1) (c) at all necessary, for a completed payment, it may be argued, may<lb/> be saved on the above logic under Section 3(1) (b) itself. The answer, to<lb/></p>

			<figure>Maharashtra and others deals with the question as to whether it was<lb/> open to the Collector and Competent Authority in that case to issue<lb/> instructions to the SubRegistrar of Assurances to not to register any<lb/> document. The view taken in that case that it was not open to the<lb/> Collector to issue such instructions as he had no Appellate, Supervisory<lb/> or Revisional powers over the Registering Officer, is correct and in<lb/> consonance with the law laid down by our Court in the case of<lb/> Sundersons &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors. The judgment in<lb/> Damodar Laxman Navare and others Vs. State of Maharashtra and<lb/> others does not deal with the question as to whether any order passed<lb/> before the repeal of the Principal Act under Section 10(1) or (3) in<lb/> respect of a land, after its exemption under Section 20(1) was withdrawn<lb/> under Section 20(2), is saved after the repeal. As held by me above, such<lb/> order does not survive the repeal of the Principal Act. In so far as the<lb/> judgment of our Court in Mira Bhayandar Builders and Developers<lb/> Welfare Association vs. The Deputy Collector and Competent<lb/> Authority is concerned, the view expressed therein that the landholders,<lb/> who have taken the benefit of the schemes under Section 20 of the<lb/> Principal Act by constructing buildings, cannot after the repeal of the<lb/> Principal Act wriggle out of their obligations to surrender flats to the<lb/> Government, is correct, but for the reasons discussed above. The legality<lb/> of the means adopted by the State Government or any other person for<lb/> holding the landholders to their respective obligations under such<lb/> schemes will, however, have to be decided in each case having regard to<lb/> the facts and circumstances of the individual case.<lb/> (S.C.

			<p>To appreciate the meaning which needs to be attributed to Section<lb/></p>

			<figure>3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act, an exemption order issued under Section 20(1) is<lb/> required to be kept in mind. A sample copy of the exemption order has been<lb/> tendered to the Court on behalf of the petitioners. A perusal of this exemption<lb/> exemption shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and vacant land and such<lb/> land with structures and the land appurtenant shall be acquired as per Chapter III<lb/> of ULC Act,1976.<lb/> (g)<lb/> that the exempted land with or without building shall not be transferred<lb/> except for the purpose of mortgage (in favour of financial institutions) failing<lb/> which the exemption granted shall stand withdrawn. Necessary returns are<lb/> required to be filed to the State Government in a prescribed form to show the<lb/> progress of the work done by the beneficiary. In case of breach of the order, it<lb/> shall be competent for the State Government to withdraw by an order exemption<lb/> from the date specified in the order.<lb/></figure>

			<p>(h)<lb/> The beneficiary will advertise the entire scheme within six months from<lb/> the date of sanction order of the State Government.<lb/></p>

			<p>An exemption order issued under Section 20(1) of the Principal<lb/> Act stipulates these different conditions, and it is on these conditions the vacant<lb/> land would cease to be out of the purview of Chapter III of the Principal Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>These conditions include the condition on the part of the beneficiary to subject<lb/> himself<lb/> to the provision of Chapter III in case there is breach of any conditions of the<lb/> exemption order on his part.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is significant that the power to exempt as provided under section 20 of<lb/> the principal Act begins with a non-obstante clause and reads thus:<lb/></p>

			<figure>&quot; 20. Power to exempt: (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any of<lb/> the foregoing provisions of this Chapter,................&quot;.(Emphasis<lb/> supplied)<lb/> It is therefore clear that power under section 20 is an independent power<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:41 :::<lb/> *230*<lb/> notwithstanding the other provisions as contained in Chapter III namely section<lb/> 3 to section 19 and Section 21 to section 24.<lb/> If the Government exercises<lb/> powers under section 20 sub-section (1) such an exercise would be an<lb/> independent exercise, irrespective of the applicability of other provisions of the<lb/> provisions of chapter III. It certainly cannot be construed that once an<lb/> exemption order under section 20 sub-section (1) was issued, the land which is<lb/> otherwise subject to the provision of section 3 to section 19 of the Principal Act,<lb/> for the exemption becomes immune from the applicability of the said provisions,<lb/> the consequences of which are deemed to have taken place the moment of the<lb/> Act became applicable to such vacant land. Further once an exemption is granted<lb/> under section 20 (1) it is an admitted position that the land is a vacant land and<lb/> the beneficiary by his volition subjects himself to the terms and conditions of the<lb/> exemption order. Once this position is established a beneficiary of section 20 (1)<lb/> order cannot contend that everything under the exemption order has become<lb/> redundant due to the repeal of the Act. Such contention in my opinion is wholly<lb/> against the express provisions of section 3 (1) (b) of the Repeal Act which saves<lb/> the validity of an exemption order. It is therefore seen that Section 20 is in the<lb/> nature of an exception to the general rules as contained in Chapter III of the<lb/> principal Act which deal with the ceiling on vacant land and the manner in which<lb/> such lands would be dealt under the provisions of chapter III of the Act.<lb/> The intention of the Legislature which is apparent from the<lb/> wordings of Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act is to save in totality the validity of<lb/> an order granting exemption under sub-section (1) of Section 20 of the Act or<lb/> any action taken thereunder. When the legislature saves the validity of a Section<lb/> 20(1) order which includes all the conditions including the condition that in case<lb/> of breach of any of the conditions provisions of Chapter III would become<lb/> applicable, then it will not be possible to read into the provisions of Section 3(1)<lb/> (b) of the Repeal Act that the legislature intended otherwise. In other words, the<lb/> validity of an exemption order as saved by Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act<lb/> cannot be read de hors its conditions inasmuch as the said provision mandates<lb/> that an order granting exemption under Sub-section (1) of Section 20 is valid<lb/> wholesomely. It would be an absurdity to say that such an exemption order<lb/> would remain valid de hors the conditions on which it is issued. The word<lb/> &quot;validity&quot; as used in Section 3(1)(b) is of considerable significance. Black Law<lb/> Dictionary (8th Edition) would refer the word &quot;valid&quot; to mean as under:-<lb/>&quot;legally sufficient, binding, a valid contract&quot;<lb/> If this is what the Legislature intended then necessarily the validity<lb/> of an exemption order under Section 20(1) would include all attributes necessary<lb/> to keep an exemption order valid and therefore would also include the<lb/> applicability of Chapter III of the Principal Act. De hors the applicability of<lb/> Chapter III which is one of the prime conditions of a Section 20(1) exemption<lb/> order, the validity of such exemption order as saved by the provisions of Section<lb/> 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act would be rendered meaningless. In any event the<lb/> beneficiary of an exemption order can be the last person to quarrel about this<lb/> proposition as he has accepted the exemption order in totality which includes<lb/> acceptance to the applicability of Chapter III of the Principal Act.<lb/> It is well settled that if the words used by the legislature in framing the<lb/> legislation have a necessary meaning, it is the duty of the Court to construe the<lb/> clause accordingly irrespective of the inconvenience that may be caused<lb/> (Argumentum Ab Inconvenienti Plurimum Valet In Lege). In the context of a<lb/> Section 20 exemption order and considering the plain reading of section 3 (1) (b)<lb/> of the Repeal Act the interpretation as suggested by the petitioners would lead to<lb/> extravagant results, away from the object which the saving provision intends to<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:41 :::<lb/> achieve.<lb/> It is settled that a saving provision in a repeal statute is not<lb/> exhaustive of the rights, obligations so saved or rights that survives the repeal as<lb/> is clear from the judgment of the Constitution Bench in the case of &quot;Bansidhar<lb/> &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; ors&quot; reported in (1998) 2 SCC 557 It is,<lb/> therefore, imperative that Section 6 of the General Clauses Act which provides<lb/> for the effect of a repeal, stands completely attracted. Section 6(c) of the<lb/> General Clauses Act provides that the repeal shall not affect any right, privilege,<lb/> obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment was<lb/> repealed unless a different intention appears.<lb/> A proper examination of the provisions of the Repeal Act and more<lb/> particularly the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 do not indicate that it would be<lb/> the intention of the Legislature to save the validity of a Section 20(1) Exemption<lb/> Order to exclude the enforcing power being applicability of Chapter III of the<lb/> Principal Act being one of the conditions under the exemption order. It cannot<lb/> be said that the rights accrued and the liabilities incurred under Section 20(1)<lb/> exemption order stands completely effaced when the validity of such an<lb/> exemption order has been saved by the provisions of Section 3(1)(b) of the<lb/> Repeal Act. As no such contrary intention can be gathered from the provisions<lb/> of the Repeal Act, the petitioner&apos;s contentions that the validity of the exemption<lb/> order as saved by Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act is valid de hors the<lb/> conditions of the exemption order cannot be accepted on the basis of the plain<lb/> wordings of Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act. In the decision of the Supreme<lb/> Court in the case of &quot;Shantibai Gaikwad Vs. Shivajibhai Haribhai&quot; reported in<lb/> &quot;2005(5) SCC 101&quot;, the Supreme Court has once again recognized the principle<lb/> ::: Uploaded on -11/09/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:51:41 :::<lb/> *233*<lb/> FULL.BENCH.JUDGMENT.sxw<lb/> that a repealing statute is not exhaustive and does not automatically extinguish<lb/> accrued rights unless they are taken away completely. The Repeal Act in no<lb/> manner expressly takes away the applicability of the conditions under Section<lb/> 20(1) exemption order. In fact the intention of the legislature is to wholesomely<lb/> save the validity of an exemption order which ipso facto include the teeth<lb/> namely to take action under Chapter III of the Principal Act in case of breach of<lb/> the condition under which an exemption has been granted for the beneficiary of<lb/> the Section 20(1) of the order.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The petitioners contention that for some reason the scheme under a<lb/> section 20 (1) order could not be completed and hence the exemption order<lb/> cannot be enforced due to the repeal of the Principal Act, cannot be accepted.<lb/></p>

			<p>Once the legislature holds an exemption order issued under section 20 (1) to be<lb/> valid, all incidental powers which are necessary to preserve its validity would be<lb/> available to the State. This would be firstly by virtue of the clear provisions of<lb/> section 3 (1) (b) of the Repeal Act and secondly by virtue of the provisions of<lb/> section 6 of the General Clauses Act. Any other interpretation would be nothing<lb/> short of doing a violence to the solemn intention of the legislature in saving the<lb/> validity of an exception order by in view of the express provisions of section 3<lb/></p>

			<p>(1) (b) of the Repeal Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>In view of the aforesaid discussion, the legal position as would<lb/> emerge can be summarized as under:-<lb/></p>

			<figure>(a)<lb/> Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act saves the validity of an order<lb/> granting exemption under sub-section (1) of Section 20 or any action taken<lb/> thereunder, notwithstanding any judgment of any Court to the contrary.</figure>
