            <table>Halsbury&apos;s Laws of England (vide<lb/> 4th<lb/> Edn., Vol.II, p.44, para 58), the English law as to<lb/> conspiracy has been stated thus:-<lb/>&quot;58. Conspiracy consists in the agreement of<lb/> two or more persons to do an unlawful act,<lb/> or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. It<lb/> is an indictable offence at common law, the<lb/> punishment for which is imprisonment or<lb/> fine or both in the discretion of the court.<lb/> The essence of the offence of conspiracy<lb/> is the fact of combination by agreement.<lb/> The agreement may be express or implied, or<lb/> in part express and in part implied. The<lb/> conspiracy<lb/> arises<lb/> and the<lb/> offence<lb/> is<lb/> committed as soon as the agreement<lb/> is<lb/> made; and the offence continues to be<lb/> committed so long as the combination<lb/> persists, that is until the conspiratorial<lb/> agreement is terminated by completion of its<lb/> performance<lb/> or<lb/> by<lb/> abandonment<lb/> or<lb/> frustration or however it may be. The actus<lb/> reus in a conspiracy is the agreement to<lb/> execute the illegal conduct, J?,Ot the<lb/> execution of it. It is not enough that two or<lb/> more persons pursued the same unlawful<lb/> object at the same time or in the same place;<lb/> it is necessary to show a meeting of minds, a<lb/> consensus to effect an unlawful purpose. It<lb/> is not, however, necessary that each<lb/> conspirator<lb/> should<lb/> have<lb/> been<lb/> in<lb/> communication with every other.&quot;<lb/> 345. There is no difference between the mode<lb/> of proof of the offence of conspiracy and that of<lb/> any other offence. It can be established by direct<lb/> or circumstantial evidence. [See: Bhagwan<lb/> Swarup Lal Bishan Lal v. State of Maharashtra<lb/> [AIR 1965 SC 682] (AIR at p.686) .]</table>

            <table>view.<lb/> Direct<lb/> evidence in proof of<lb/> a<lb/> conspiracy is seldom available; offence of<lb/> conspiracy can be proved by either direct or<lb/> circumstantial evidence.<lb/> It is not always<lb/> possible to give affirmative evidence about the<lb/> date of the formation of the criminal<lb/> conspiracy, about the persons who took part<lb/> in the formation of the conspiracy, about the<lb/> object<lb/> which<lb/> the<lb/> objectors<lb/> set before<lb/> themselves as the object of conspiracy, and<lb/> about the manner in which the object of<lb/> conspiracy is to be carried out, all this is<lb/> necessarily a matter of inference.<lb/> 348. The provision of Sections 120-A and<lb/> 120-B IPC have brought the law of conspiracy<lb/> in Jndia in line with the English law by<lb/> making the overt act unessential when the<lb/> conspiracy is to commit any punishable<lb/> offence. The English law on this matter is<lb/> well settled.<lb/> Russell on Crime (12t h Edn.<lb/> Vol.1.,p.202) may be usefully noted:<lb/> &quot;The gist of the offence of conspiracy then<lb/> lies, not in doing the act, or effecting the<lb/> purpose for which the conspiracy is formed,<lb/> nor in attempting to do them, nor in inciting<lb/> others to do them, but in the forming of the<lb/> </table>

He has stated that, initially,<lb/> the case was investigated by Mr. Pradeep Kumar, Inspector of Police<lb/> and that the said Pradeep Kumar was repatriated to his Parent Branch<lb/> in Kerala on 13/04/1996 and, thereafter, the case was transferred to<lb/> him.<lb/> <note>P.W. 16 -Pradip Kumar was the Investigating Officer who<lb/> carried out the investigation after the complaint was lodged on<lb/> 02/06/1993 till 1996 when he handed over the investigation to P.W<lb/> brought on record number of documents.

In a nutshell, the evidence which is brought on record is to the<lb/> effect that OIDB had surplus funds at its disposal. Inquiries were made<lb/> by OIDB with the Nationalized Bank, informing them about its<lb/> intention of investing these surplus funds. Counter offers were made<lb/> by the Nationalized Banks to OJDB. Syndicate Bank had made an offer<lb/> to OIDB, asking them to invest their surplus funds in PMS services for a<lb/> period of one year and had assured the OIDB of expected return of<lb/> 18.25Â°/o interest per annum. The offer document sent to OIDB clearly<lb/> disclosed that the moneys parked with the Syndicate Bank under PMS<lb/> activities would be invested in the capital market instruments and<lb/> <note>::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014<lb/> ::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 :::<lb/> would be at the risk of constituents and that the expected returns<lb/> would be about 18.25Â°/o per annum.<lb/> Though these letters were<lb/> received by OIDB, an initial amount of Rs 20 crores (approx.) was sent<lb/> by OIDB to the Syndicate Bank Delhi Branch as first remittance on<lb/> 03/04/1992 and at that time there was no contract or agreement<lb/> between the OIDB and Syndicate bank.
