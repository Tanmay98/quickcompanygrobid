2. 
In the present case, the complaint dated 02/06/1993 was filed 

by Shri V. Sethumadhavan, Chief Vigilance Officer of the Syndicate 

Bank. Initially, the complaint was filed for the offence punishable 

under section 120-B read with section 420 of the Indian Penal code 

and section 13(1) (d) read with section 13(2) of the Prevention of 

Corruption Act against one R Sundaresan, the then Divisional 

Manager, Syndicate Bank, FIM Division, Bombay and Directors and 

Office bearers of M/s Fair Growth Investments Ltd. (FGIL) and M/s 

Fair Growth Financial Services Ltd. (FGFSL). In the said complaint, it 

was alleged that Shri R. Sundaresan was in-charge of FIM Division of 

the Syndicate Bank at Bombay and Portfolio Management Services 

transactions were conducted at his instance without specific 

authorization from the Head Office and that these transactions were 

entered into pursuant to the criminal conspiracy which was entered 

into with an object of cheating the Syndicate Bank and that the said R. 

Sundaresan and others abused their position to cause wrongful gain to 

other accused and corresponding wrongful loss to the Syndicate Bank. 

After the offence was registered, CBI made an investigation and 

charge-sheet came to be filed against R.S. Pai, the Executive Director of 

Syndicate Bank, accused No.1 herein and K.R.N. Shenoy, Managing 

Director of Mis Fair Growth Investments Ltd., accused No.2 herein. R.

Sundaresan who was initially named as an accused in the complaint 

was dropped from the array of accused and in the charge-sheet it was 

alleged that Shri R.S. Pai, Executive Director of the Syndicate Bank and 

Shri K.R.N. Shenoy had entered into a conspiracy with an object of 

committing criminal breach of trust of the funds placed with the 

Portfolio Management Scheme of the Syndicate Bank by Oil Industries 

Development Board (hereinafter referred to as "OIDB"). Four charges 

were framed against both the accused. In the first charge, it was 

alleged that during the period from October 1991 to May 1992, 

accused Nos. 1 and 2 had entered into criminal conspiracy for 

siphoning off funds and providing and investing these funds in the 

Portfolio Management Scheme of the Syndicate Bank and, therefore, 

they had committed an offence punishable under section 120-B read 

with section 409 of the lndian Penal Code. The second charge which 

was levelled against accused N o.1 was that he misused his official 

position as an Executive Director of a Nationalized Bank i.e the 

Syndicate Bank to place with the 
Ponfolio Management Scheme 

(hereinafter referred to as "PMS") of the Syndicate Bank an amount of 

Rs 132.33 crores. He was also charged that seven remittances of 

various amounts during the period from 02/04/1992 and 30/05/1992 

which were remitted by OIDB were invested in PMS activity of the

Syndicate Bank in violation of directions/guidelines contained in the 

letters sent by the Syndicate Bank and also in violation of RBI's 

Circular dated 18/01/1991. The accused No.l was further charged for 

illegally investing the said amount in the Company of accused No.2 in 

order to enable him and his Company to make a wrongful gain and, 

therefore, it was alleged that accused No.1 committed an offence 

punishable under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code. 

3. 
The third charge which was framed against the accused No.l 

was that as a motive and/or reward for causing aforesaid wrongful 

gain to accused No.2, he got transferred 62000 shares from the 

promoters' quota of M/s Fair Growth Investment Ltd (FGIL) and its 

sister concern the Fair Growth Financial Services Ltd., in his name and 

he thereby committed an offence punishable under section 13(1)(d) 

. 

read with section 13(2) and section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption 

Act. The fourth charge which was framed against accused N o.2 was 

that he had instigated and abetted accused No.1 by transferring the 

said 62,000 shares in favour of accused No.I in order to enable FGIL to 

make wrongful gain of Rs 93,17,77,925/-. 

4. 
Both the accused pleaded not guilty to the said charge.

FACTS, FINDINGS & CONCLUSION: 

7. 

Before taking into consideration the rival submissions, it would 

be relevant to briefly take into consideration the chronology of events 

and facts and circumstances of this case. 

8. 

Accused No.1 -R. S. Pai was the Executive Director of Syndicate 

Bank and was stationed at Manipal, Kamataka and was posted at Head 

Office of Syndicate Bank. OIDB is a Government Organization having 

its Head Office at Delhi. OIDB had number of surplus funds at its 

disposal which were lying idle and they wanted to invest the said 

amount for a period of one year in order to ensure that it would earn 

higher profit on the said funds. Syndicate Bank had taken a policy 

decision of promoting its PMS and had given offer to all the 

Companies, Government Corporations, individuals, to invest their 

money in PMS. Accordingly, offer letters were issued by Syndicate 

Bank to various Companies. One such offer letter was also sent to 

OIDB. The Reserve Bank of India also had revised its guidelines in 

respect of investments which were to be received by the Nationalized 

Banks in their PMS. Copies of these letters were also sent to OIDB. 

Syndicate Bank had informed the OIDB that it would get a tentative

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


9 

return of 18.25o/o on its investments. 
OIDB, through vanous 

remittances, sent an amount of rs 132.22 crores to the Syndicate Bank, 

Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch, New Delhi. This amount, in tum, was 

sent to the FIM Department of the Syndicate Bank at Bombay, who, in 

tum, invested these amounts in shares of Private Companies. The 

remittances were sent by OIDB between the period from 02/04/1992 

to 30/05/1992. 

9. 

It is the case of the prosecution that OIDB had specifically 

instructed the Syndicate Bank to invest the amount remitted by it in 

Government Securities, Government Bonds only and not in shares of 

Private Companies. It is the case of the prosecution that the Officials 

of OIDB were kept in dark and these funds which were remitted for the 

purpose of being invested in Government Securities were, in fact, 

diverted in favour of accused No.2 -K. R. N. Shenoy in order to enable 

him to invest the said amount in his own Company. On the other 

hand, it is the case of the Syndicate Bank in its letters and 

correspondence between the parties that OIDB was aware that the 

amount which was remitted in PMS was always at the risk of the 

investors and that these remittances were invested in shares of blue 

-chip private •companies. 
Prosecution case, therefore, is that the

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


--.. . -----------

10 

accused No. l, who was the Executive Director of Syndicate Bank was, 

therefore, directly responsible for the investments which were made by 

FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay 
in Private 

Companies, contrary to the specific instructions which were given by 

OIDB and contrary to the guidelines which were given by RBI. 

Prosecution case further is that, as a return for the favo ur given by 

accused No.1 to accused No.2, 62000 shares were transferred in the 

name of accused No.1 from the promoters' quota of Mis Fair Growth 

Investments Ltd. (FGIL) and its sister concern M/s Fairgrowth 

Financial Services Ltd. and, accordingly, a complaint was lodged on 

02/06/ 1993 by Shri V. Sethumadhavan, Chief Vigilance Officer, 

Syndicate Bank, Head Office, Manipal with the Central Bureau of 

Investigation, Mumabi under section 120B read •with section 420 of 

the Indian Penal Code and under section 13(2) read with section 

13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption •Act, 1988 against Shri R. 

Sundaresan, the then Divisional Manager, Syndicate Bank, FIM 

Division, Bombay and Directors and Office bearers of M/s Fair Growth 

Investments Ltd. (FGIL) and its sister concern M/s. Fair Growth 

Financial Services Ltd. (FGFSL) 

10. On 24/07 /1997, a charge-sheet was filed by the Central Bureau 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


11 

of Investigation, Bank Securities & Fraud Cell, Bombay in the Special 

Court constituted under the Special Courts (Trial of Offences Relating 

to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992 at Bombay against Shri R.S. 

Pai, the then Executive Director, Syndicate Bank, the accused No.1 and 

Shri 
K. R. N. Shenoy, Managing Director of M/s Fair Growth 

Investments Ltd., the accused No.2 
and the charge-sheet was 

registered as Special Case No.3 of 1997 in the Special Court at 

Bombay. 

11. Both the accused filed discharge applications and during the 

course of hearing of these discharge applications, the Counsel for the 

prosecution thought it necessary to file additional documents and 

additional statements in addition to the charge-sheet which was 

already filed. Accordingly CBI filed Misc. Application No.338 of 2000 

under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 26/07 /2000, 

seeking permission of the Court to place on record (i) list of 15 

additional witnesses and their respective statements recorded under 

section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, (ii) list of all the 67 

persons whose statements were recorded under section 161 of the 

Code of Criminal Procedure, (iii) list of all search/seizure receipt 

memos under which all documents have been seized by CBI and (iv)

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


12 

additional list of documents with the CBI on which reliance was placed 

by CBI. 
This application was rejected by the Special Court on 

26/07 /2000. 

12. CBI preferred an appeal in the Apex Court against the said order 

and the appeal was allowed by the Apex Court on 03/04/2002 and the 

order passed by the Special Court was set aside and the permission was 

granted to CBI for production of additional documents. Thereafter, 

again, discharge applications filed by the accused were heard and 

were dismissed. Charge was framed against the accused, after they 

pleaded not guilty to the offence with which they were charged. 

Prosecution, in support of its case, examined 16 witnesses and brought 

on record number of documents. 

13. After having gone through the oral and documentary evidence 

which is brought on record, in my view, the prosecution has not 

established that accused No.1 committed an offence punishable under 

section 120B read with section 409 of the Indian Pen a l Code or has 

committed an offence punishable under section 13(1)(d) read with 

section 13(2) read with section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 

1988. Prosecution also has not established that the accused No.2 has 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


13 

aided or abetted accused No. l for commission of the offence 

punishable under section 409 of the Indian Penal code or for the 

offence punishable under section 13(1)(d) read with section 13(2) 

read with section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. 

Prosecution has not established that accused Nos. 1 and 2 had entered 

into criminal conspiracy of diverting funds remitted by OIDB to the 

Private Company of accused No.2 in oder to cause wrongful gain to 

accused No.2 and wrongful loss to OIDB. 

14. I have come to the above conclusion for the following reasons. 

15. The first point which falls for consideration is : whether the 

prosecution has established that accused No.1 and accused No.2 had 

entered into conspiracy to misappropriate the funds which were sent 

by OIDB? 

16. In the present case, admitted position is that the funds which . 

were remitted by OIDB were sent directly to Syndicate Bank, Delhi 

Branch and, thereafter, Delhi Branch of Syndicate Bank had sent these 

• amounts to FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank at Bombay and, 

thereafter, Syndicate Bank, Bombay Branch, had remitted these

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


14 

amounts to accused No.2 for the purpose of investing it in the 

Companies. Prosecution has not been in a position to establish any 

direct link with accused No. l who was the Executive Director of 

Syndicate Bank and was stationed at Manipal, Kamataka State where 

the Syndicate Bank has its Head Office. Neither the witnesses who 

were examined from OIDB nor the witnesses who have been examined 

from the Syndicate Bank have stated that. these funds were given to 

accused No.2 on the instructions of accused No. l. On the contrary, 

there is a documentary evidence on record to indicate that OIDB 

Officers had, in tum, stated in their letter that they had no concern 

with the PIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank at Bombay and that they 

were concerned directly with the Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank 

since the remittances were made through the Delhi Branch of the 

Syndicate Bank. 

17. 

In order to establish the offence of conspiracy, prosecution has to 

bring on record either direct or indirect evidence for the purpose of 

establishing that there was meeting of minds on the part of the accused 

to commit an illegal act by illegal means. It is normally not possible to 

get direct evidence to establish the offence of criminal conspiracy and, 

in large number of cases, prosecution has established criminal

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


15 

conspiracy on the basis of circumstantial evidence. Law in respect of 

criminal conspiracy has been laid down in several judgments of the 

Apex Court and this Court. In the recent judgment in the case of Ram 

Narayan Popli Vs. CBI reported in (2003) 3 SCC 641, arising out of 

Special Courts (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) 

Act, 1992 the Apex Court has made the following observations. 

"342. It would be appropriate to deal with the 
question of conspiracy. Section 120-B IPC is the 
provision which provides for punishment for 
criminal conspiracy. 
Definition of "criminal. 
conspiracy" given in Section 120-A reads as 
follows: 

"120-A. When two or more persons agree to 
do, or cause to be done,-
(l)an illegal act, or 
(2)an act which is not illegal by illegal means, 
such an agreement is designated a criminal 
conspiracy: 
Provided that no agreement except an 
agreement to commit an offence shall 
amount to a criminal conspiracy unless 
some act besides the agreement is done by 
one or more parties to such agreement in 
pursuance thereof." 
The elements of a criminal conspiracy have 

been stated to be : (a) an object to be 

accomplished, (b)a plan or scheme embodying 
means to accomplish that object, (c)an 
agreement or understanding between two or 
more of the accused persons whereby, they 
become definitely committed to cooperate for 
the accomplishment of the object by the means

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


16 

embodied in the agreement, or by any effectual 
means, and ( d)in the jurisdiction where the 
statute required to overt act. The essence of a 
criminal 
conspiracy 
is 
the 
unlawful 
combination and ordinarily the offence is 
complete when the combination is framed. 
From this, it necessarily follows that unless the 
statute so requires, no overt act need be done 
in furtherance of the conspiracy, and that the 
object of the combination need not be 
accomplished, in order to constitute an 
indictable offence. Law making conspiracy a 
crime is designed to curb immoderate power to 
do mischief which is gained by a combination 
of the means. The encouragement and support 
which co-conspirators give to one another 
rendering enterprises possible which, if left to 
individual effort, would have been impossible, 
furnish the ground for visiting conspirators and 
abettors with condign punishment. 
The 
Conspiracy is held to be continued and 
renewed as to all its members wherever and 
whenever any member of the conspiracy acts in 
furtherance of the common design (See: 

American Jurisprudence, Vol. II, Sec. 23, p.559) 

For an offence punishable under section 120-B, 
the prosecution need not necessarily prove that 
the perpetrators expressly agree to do or cause 
to be done illegal act; the agreement may be 
proved by necessary implication. Offence of 
criminal conspiracy has its foundation in an 
agreement to commit an offence. A conspiracy 
consists not merely in the intention of two mor 
more, but in the agreement of two or more to 
do an unlawful act by unlawful means. So long 
as such a design rests in intention only, it is not 
indictable. When two agree to carry it into 
effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and an 
act of •each of the parties, promise against 
promise actus contra actum, capable of being 
enforced, if lawful, punishable if for a criminal

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


17 

object or for use of criminal menas. 

343. No doubt, in the case of conspiracy there 

cannot be any direct evidence. The ingredients of 

offence are that there should be an agreement 

between persons who are alleged to conspire and 

the said agreement should be for doing an illegal 

act or for doing by illegal means an act which 

itself may not be illegal. Therefore, the essence of 

criminal conspiracy is an agreement to do an 

illegal act and such an agreement can be proved 

either by direct evidence or by circumstantial 

evidence or by both, and it is a matter of common 

experience that 
direct evidence to prove 

conspiracy is rarely available. 
Therefore, the 

circumstances proved before, during and after the 

occurrence have to be considered to decide about 

the complicity of the accused. 

344. 
In Halsbury's Laws of England (vide 
4th 

Edn., Vol.II, p.44, para 58), the English law as to 

conspiracy has been stated thus:-

"58. Conspiracy consists in the agreement of 

two or more persons to do an unlawful act, 

or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. It 

is an indictable offence at common law, the 

punishment for which is imprisonment or 

fine or both in the discretion of the court. 

The essence of the offence of conspiracy 

is the fact of combination by agreement. 

The agreement may be express or implied, or 

in part express and in part implied. The 

conspiracy 
arises 
and the 
offence 
is 

committed as soon as the agreement 
is 

made; and the offence continues to be 

committed so long as the combination 

persists, that is until the conspiratorial 

agreement is terminated by completion of its 

performance 
or 
by 
abandonment 
or 

frustration or however it may be. The actus 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


18 

reus in a conspiracy is the agreement to 
execute the illegal conduct, J?,Ot the 
execution of it. It is not enough that two or 
more persons pursued the same unlawful 
object at the same time or in the same place; 
it is necessary to show a meeting of minds, a 
consensus to effect an unlawful purpose. It 
is not, however, necessary that each 
conspirator 
should 
have 
been 
in 
communication with every other." 

345. There is no difference between the mode 
of proof of the offence of conspiracy and that of 
any other offence. It can be established by direct 

or circumstantial evidence. [See: Bhagwan 
Swarup Lal Bishan Lal v. State of Maharashtra 

[AIR 1965 SC 682] (AIR at p.686) .] 

346. 
It was held that the expression "in 
reference to their common intention" in Section 
10 is very comprehensive and it appears to have 
been designedly used to give it a wider scope 
than the words "in furtherance of, in the English 
law; with the result, anything said, done or 
written by a co-conspirator, after the conspiracy 
was formed, will be evidence against the other 
before he entered the field of conspiracy or after 
he left it. Anything said, done or written is a 
relevant fact only. 

" 
as against each of the persons 
believed to be so conspiring as well for the 
purpose of showing that any such person 
was a party to it'. . .. In short, the section 

can be analysed as follows: (1) There shall 

be a prima facie evidence eff ording a 
reasonable ground for a court to believe 
that two or more persons are members of 
a conspiracy; (2) if the said condition is 
fulfilled, anything said, done or written by 
any one of them in reference to their 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


19 

common intention will be evidence against 
the other, (3) anything said, done or 
written by him should have been said, 
done or written by him after the intention 
was formed by any one of them; (4) it 
would also be relevant for the said 
purpose against another who entered the 
conspiracy whether it was said, done or 
written before he entered the conspiracy 
or after he left it; and (5) it can only be 
used against a co-conspirator and not in 
his favour." (AIR p.687, para 8) 
We are aware of the fact that direct 
independent evidence of criminal conspiracy 
is generally not available and its existence is a 
matter of inference. 
The inferences are 
normally deduced from acts of parties in 
pursuance of a purpose in common between 
the conspirators. This Court in V.C. Shukla v. 
State (Delhi Admn.) [(1980) 2 SCC 665] held 
that to prove criminal conspiracy, there must 
be a meeting of minds resulting in ultimate 
decision taken by the conspirators regarding 
the commission of an offence and where the 
factum of conspiracy is sought to be inferred 
from circumstances, the prosecution has to 
show that the circumstances give rise to a 
conclusive or irresistable inference of an 
agreement between two or more persons to 
commit an offence. As in all other criminal 
offences, the prosecution has to discharge its 
onus of proving the case against the accused 
beyond reasonable doubt. The circumstances 
in a case, when taken together on their face 
value1 should indicate the meeting of minds 
between the conspirators for the intended 
object of committing an illegal act or an act 
which is not illegal1 by illegal means. A Jew 
bits here here and a few bits there on which 
the prosecution relies cannot be held to be 
adequate for connecting the accused with the

adopted and illegal acts done were in 

furtherance of the object of conspiracy 

hatched. 
The circumstances relied for the 

purposes of drawing an inference should be 

prior in time than the actual commission of 

the offence in furtherance of the alleged 

conspiracy. 

34 7. 
Privacy and secrecy are more 

characteristics of a conspiracy, than of a loud 

discussion in an elevated place open to public 

view. 
Direct 
evidence in proof of 
a 

conspiracy is seldom available; offence of 

conspiracy can be proved by either direct or 

circumstantial evidence. 
It is not always 

possible to give affirmative evidence about the 

date of the formation of the criminal 

conspiracy, about the persons who took part 

in the formation of the conspiracy, about the 

object 
which 
the 
objectors 
set before 

themselves as the object of conspiracy, and 

about the manner in which the object of 

conspiracy is to be carried out, all this is 

necessarily a matter of inference. 

348. The provision of Sections 120-A and 

120-B IPC have brought the law of conspiracy 

in Jndia in line with the English law by 

making the overt act unessential when the 

conspiracy is to commit any punishable 

offence. The English law on this matter is 

well settled. 

Russell on Crime (12t h Edn. 

Vol.1.,p.202) may be usefully noted: 

"The gist of the offence of conspiracy then 

lies, not in doing the act, or effecting the 

purpose for which the conspiracy is formed, 

nor in attempting to do them, nor in inciting 

others to do them, but in the forming of the

21 

scheme or agreement between the parties, 

agreement is essential. Mere knowledge, or 

even discussion, of the plan is not per se, 

enough." 

349. 

Glanville Williams in Criminal Law (2"d 

Edn., p. 382) states: 

"The question arose in Iowa case, but it 

was discussed in terms of conspiracy 

rather than of accessoryship. D , who had a 

grievance against P, told E that if he would 

whip P someone would pay his fine. E 

replied that he did not want anyone to pay 

his fine, that he had a grievance of his own 

against P and that he would whip him at 

the first opportunity. E whipped P. D was 

acquitted of conspiracy because there was 

no agreement for 'concert of action', no 

agreement to 'cooperate'." 

350. Coleridge, J. while summing up the 

case to the jury in R. v. Murphy [(1837) 

173 ER 502] (ER ar p.508) states: 

".... I am bound to tell you, that 

although the common design is the root 

of the charge, it is not necessary to 

prove that these two parties came 

together and actually agreed in terms to 

have this common design, and to pursue 

it by common means, and so to carry it 

into execution. This is not necessary, 

because in many cases of the most 

clearly established conspiracies there are 

no means of proving any such thing, and 

neither law nor common sense requires 

that it should be proved . Jf you find that 

these two persons pursued by their acts 

the same object, often by the same 

means, one performing one part of an

22 

act, and the other another part of the 

same act, so as to complete it, with a 

view to the attainment of the object 

which they were pursuing , you will be 

at liberty to draw the conclusion that 

they have been engaged in a conspiracy 

to effect that object. The question you 

have to ask yourselves is, ' had they this 

common design, and did they pursue it 

by these common means -the design 

being unlawful?" 

351. 
As noted above, the essential 

ingredient of the offence of criminal 

conspiracy is the agreement to commit 

an offence. 
In a case where the 

agreement is for accomplishment of an 

act which they itself constitutes an 

offence, then in that event no overt act 

is necessazy to be proved by the 

prosecution because in such a situation, 

criminal conspiracy is established by 

proving such an agreement. Where the 

conspiracy alleged is with regard to 

commission of a serious crime of the 

nature as contemplated in Section 120-B 
read with the proviso to sub-section (2) 
of section 120-A, then in that event 

mere proof of an agreement between 

the accused for commission of such a 

crime alone is enough to bring about a 

conviction under Section 120-B and the 

proof of any overt act by the accused or 

by any one of them would not be 

necessary. 
The provisions, in such a 

situation, do not require that each and 

every person who is a party to the 

conspiracy must do some overt act 

towards the fulfilment of the object of 

conspiracy, the essential ingredient 

being 
an 
agreement between 
the

23 

conspirators to commit the crime and if 

these requirements and ingredients are 

established, the act would fall within the 

trappings of the provisions contained in 

Section 120-B (See: Suresh Chandra 
Bahri v. State of Bihar [1995 Supp (1) 
sec soJ 

352. The conspiracies are not hatched 

in the open, by their nature, they are 
secretly planned, they can be proved 

even by circumstantial evidence, the 

lack of direct evidence relating to 

conspiracy has no consequence. (See : 

E.K. Chandrasenan v. State of Kerala 
[(1995) 2 sec 99]) 

353. In Kehar Singh v. State (Delhi 

Admn.) [(1988) 3 sec 609] (AIR at p. 

1954), this Court observed: (SCC pp. 

732-33, para 275). 

"275. 
Generally, a conspiracy is 

hatched in secrecy and it may be 

difficult to adduce direct evidence of 

the same. The prosecution will often 

rely on evidence of acts of various 
parties to inf er that they were done in 

reference to their common intention. 

The prosecution will also more often 
rely upon circumstantial evidence. 

The conspiracy can be undoubtedly 

proved by such evidence direct or 

circumstantial. 
But he court must 

enquire whether the two persons are 
independently pursing the same end 

or they have come together to the 

pursuit of unlawful object. 
The 

former 
does 
not 
render 
them 

conspirators, but the latter does. It is, 

however, essential that the offence of

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


24 

conspiracy requires some 
kind of 
physical fanifestation of agreement. 
The express agreement, however, 
need not be proved. 
Nor actual 
meeting of two persons is necessary. 
Nor it is necessary to prove the actual 
words of communication. 
The 
evidence as to tansm1ss1on of 
thoughts sharing the unlawful design 
may be sufficient." 
"Conspiracy can be proved by 
circumstances and other materials." 

(See: State of Bihar v. Paramhans 
Yadav [1986 Pat LJR 688 (HC) ) 

: [T]o establish a charge of 
conspiracy 

knowledge 

about 
indulgence in either an illegal act or a 
legal act by illegal 
means is 

necessary. In some cases, intent of 

unlawful use being made of the goods 
or services in question 
may be 
inferred from the knowledge itself. 
This apart, the prosecution has not 

establish that a particular unlawful 

use was intended, so long as the 
goods or service in question could not 
be put to any lawful use. Finally, 
when the ultimate offence consists of 
a chain of actions, it would not be 
necessary for the prosecution to 
establish, to bring home the charge of 
conspiracy 
that 
each 
of 
the 
conspirators had the knowledge of 
what the collaborator would do, so 
long as it is known that the 
collaborator would put the goods or 
service to an unlawful use." (See: 

State of Maharashtra v. Som Nath 
Thapa [(1996) 4 sec 659]), sec p.

354. 
It 
was noticed that Section 

120-A and 120-B IPC have brought 

the law of conspiracy in India in line 

with the English law by making an 

overt 
act 
inessential 
when 
the 

conspiracy 
is 
to 
commit 
any 

punishable 
offence. 
The 
most 

important ingredient of the offence 

being the agreement between two or 

more persons to do an illegal act. In 

a case where criminal conspiracy is 

alleged, the court must inquire 

whether 
the 
two 
persons 
are 

independently pursuing the same end 

or they have come together to pursue 

the unlawful object. The former does 

not render them conspirators but the 

latter does. 
For the offence of 

conspiracy, some kind of physical 

manifestation 
of 
agreement 
1s 

required to be established. 
The 

express agreement need not be 

proved. 
The 
evidence 
as 
to 

transmission of thoughts sharing the 

unlawful act is not sufficient. 

A 

conspiracy is a continuing offence 

which continues to subsist till it is 

executed or rescinded or frustrated by ' 

choice of necessity. 
During its 

subsistence, whenever any one of the 

conspirators does an act or series of 

acts, he would be held guilty under 

Section 120-B of the Indian Penal 

Code. 

355. 

I may usefully refer to Ajay 
Aggarwal v. Union of India, [(1993) 3 

SCC 609]. It was held : (SCC p.617, 
para 8-9) 

• 

"8. . .... It is not necessary that each

26 

conspirator must lmow all the details 

of the scheme nor be a participant at 

every stage. It is necessary that they 

should agree for design or object of 

the 
conspiracy. 
Conspiracy 
is 

conceived as having three elements: 

(1) agreement; (2) between two or 

more 
persons 
by 
whom 
the 

agreement is effected; and (3) a 

criminal object, which may be either 

the ultimate aim of the agreement, or 

may constitute means, or one of the 

means by which that aim is to be 

accomplished. 
It is immaterial 

whether this is found in the ultimate 

objects. The common law definition 

of ' criminal conspiracy' was stated 

first by Lord Denman in Jones case 
[ R. v. Jones, 1832 B & Ad 345] that 

an indictment for conspiracy must 

' charge a conspiracy to do an 

unlawful act by unlawful means' and 

was elaborated by Willies, J. on 

behalf of the Judges while referring 

the question to the House of Lords in 

Mulcahy v. R [(1868) 3 HL 306] and 

the House of Lords in unanimous 

decision reiterated in 

Quinn v. 
Leathern (1901 AC 495]: 

'A conspiracy consists not merely 

in the intention of two or more, but 

in the agreement of two or more, to 

do an unlawful act, or to do a lawful 

act by unlawful means. So long as 

such a design rests in intention only, 

it is not indictable. When two agree 

to carry it into effect, the very plot is 

an act in itself, and the act of each of 

the parties, promise against promise, 

actus contra actum, capable of being

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


27 

enforced, if lawful: and punishable if 
for a criminal object, or for the use of 
criminal means.' 

9. This Court in E.G. Barsay v. State 
of Bombay [AIR 1961 SC 1762] held: 

'The gist of the offence is an 
agreement to break the law. The 
parties to such an agreement will be 
guilty of criminal conspiracy, though 
the illegal act agreed to be done has 
not been done. 
So too, it is an 
ingredient of the offence that all the 
parties should agree to do a single 
illegal act. • It may comprise the 
commission of a number of acts. 
Under Section 43 of the Indian Penal 
Code, an act would be illegal if it is 
an offence or if it is prohibited by 
law.' 

In Yash Pal Mittal v. State of Punjab 
[(1977) 4 sec 540] the rule was laid as 

follows : (SCC p. 543, para 9) 
' ... The very agreement, concert or 
league is the ingredient of the 
offence. It is not necessary that all the 
conspirators must know each and 
every detail of the conspiracy as long 
as they are co-participators in he 
main object of the conspiracy. There 
may be so many devices and 
techniques adopted to achieve the 
common goal of the conspiracy and 
there 
may 
be 
division 
of 
performances in the chain of actions 
with one object to achieve the real 
end of which every collaborator must 
be aware and in which each one of 
them must be interested. There must 
be unity of object or purpose but 
there may be plurality of means 
sometimes even unknown to one

28 

another, amongst the conspirators. 

In achieving the goal several offences 

may be committed by some of the 

conspirators even unknown to the 

others. The only relevant factor is 

that all means adopted and illegal 

acts done must be and purported to 

be in furtherance of the object of the 

conspiracy even though there may be 

sometimes misfire or overshooting 

by some of the conspirators.' 

10. In Mohd. Usman Mohd. Hussain 
Maiyar v. State of Maharashtra 
((1981) 2 sec 443] it was held that 
for an offence under Section 120-B 

IPC, 
the 
prosecution 
need 
not 

necessarily 
prove 
that 
the 

conspirators expressly agreed to do or 

cause to be done the illegal act, the 

agreement 
may 
be 
proved 
by 

necessary implication." 

356. 

After referring to some 

judgments of the United States 

Supreme Court and of this Court in 

Yash Pal Mittal v. State of Punjab 
[(1977) 4 sec 540] and Ajay 
Aggarwal v. Union of India [ [1993) 3 
SCC 609] the Court in State of 
Maharashtra v. Som Nath Thapa 
[(1996) 4 sec 659] summarized the 

position of law and the requirements 

to establish the charge of conspiracy, 

as under: (SCC p. 668, para 24) 

"24. The aforesaid decisions, 

weighty as they are, lead us to 

conclude that to establish a charge of 

conspiracy 

. knowledge 

about 

indulgence in either an illegal act or a 

legal 
act 
by 
illegal 
means

29 

necessary. In some cases, intent of 

unlawful use being made of the 
goods or services in question may be 
inferred from the knowledge itself. 
This apart, the prosecution has not to 

establish that a particular unlawful 

use was intended, so long as the 
goods or service in question could not 
be put to any lawful use. Finally, 
when the ultimate offence consists of 
a chain of actions, it would not be 
necessary for the prosecution to 
establish, to bring home the charge of 
conspiracy, 
that 
each 
of 
the 
conspirators had the knowledge of 
what the collaborator would do, so 
long as it is known that the 
collaborator would put the goods or 
service to an unlawful use." [See 

State of Kerala v. P. Sugathan [(2000) 

8 SCC 203] (SCC p. 212, para 14)]" 

18. Keeping in view the aforesaid principle laid down by the Apex 

Court, it has to be seen whether the prosecution has established the 

case of criminal conspiracy against accused Nos. 1 and 2. It has to be 

noted here that, initially, the complaint was lodged by 
Shri V. 

Sethumadhavan against Shri R. Sundaresan. In the said complaint, it 

is specifically alleged that Shri R. Sundaresan who was the then 

Divisional Manager of FIM Branch of Syndicate Bank at Bombay was 

responsible for misappropriation and for diverting the funds which 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


30 

were remitted from the Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank to FIM 

Branch of Syndicate Bank at Bombay. However, surprisingly, charges 

against the said Shri R. Sundaresan were dropped when the charge 

sheet was filed and this person who was named as accused was, later 

on, examined as a witness by the prosecution. 
No explanation has 

been given by the prosecution as to why and for what reason the 

Investigating Officer felt that it was not necessary to make the said R. 

Sundaresan as an accused and in his place accused No.1 -R.S. Pai who 

was stationed at Manipal, Kamataka State, was made an accused in 

this case. When a query was made by this Court whether there was 

any direct or indirect evidence against accused No.1 for the purpose of 

proving that accused Nos. 1 and 2 conspired together, Mr. V.G. 

Pradhan, the learned Special Public Prosecutor, very candidly stated 

that no such documentary or oral evidence is available which could 

establish that accused No.1 -R.S. Pai had entered into conspiracy with 

accused No.2 -K. R. N. Shenoy. Prosecution has examined in all 16 

witnesses. 

19. 
P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh, at the relevant time, was working as an 

accountant in OIDB. It is pertinent to note that questions were asked 

by Mr. Pradhan, the learned Special Public Prosecutor, to this witness 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


31 

without declaring the said witness as hostile. Thereafter, after the 

witness was cross-examined by the Counsel appearing for accused Nos. 

1 and 2, permission was sought by Mr. V.G. Pradhan, the learned 

Special Public Prosecutor appearing for CBI to re-examine this witness. 

Though the objection was raised by the Counsel appearing on behalf of 

the accused, this objection was overruled for the reasons stated in the 

order and Mr. Pradhan was permitted to re-examine this witness. 

Liberty, however, was given for the accused to cross-examine him since 

certain new documents were sought to be brought on record. This 

witness, however, did not make himself available for further cross 

examination and though several dates were taken by the prosecution 

to produce the said witness for further cross-examination, he did not 

remain present and, therefore, ultimately, order had to be passed by 

this Court after a lapse of almost 8 months to delete the re 

examination which was taken by Mr. V.G. Pradhan, Special Public 

Prosecutor for CBI. 

P.W. 2 -Arvind Kaushal was working as Financial Adviser and 

Chief Accounts Officer for a period from October, 1991 to May, 1992. 

P. W. 1 was also working in the same Department and he was 

subordinate to P. W. 2.

P.W 3 -R. Sundaresan was working as Divisional Manager of 

FIM Division Branch of Syndicate Bank at Bombay. A complaint was 

lodged against him by Shri V. Sethumadhavan of the Vigilance Branch 

of the Syndicate Bank. However, his name was dropped and in his 

place the name of R.S. Pai was included and R. Sundaresan was 

examined as the witness on behalf of the prosecution. 

P.W. 4 -E.R. Seshadri was working as Deputy General Manager 

of Syndicate Bank at Delhi Zonal Office. 

P. W 5 -R. Kalyanasundaram was working in the Syndicate Bank 

in its Funds and Investment Management Department (FIM) during 

the relevant period. 

P.W 6 -Shreyas Morakhia and P.W. 7 -Sharad Jamnadas Shah 

were carrying on business in the Stock Exchange at the relevant time. 

However, they did not support the prosecution case. 

P.W. 8 -Ameet Dalal was a stock broker at Bombay Stock 

Exchange at the relevant time. He has brought on record the contract

note signed by him at Exhibit-119. 

P.W. 9 -M. Damodaran was a Joint Secretary, Ministry of 

Finance at the relevant time and he had given sanction to prosecute 

accused No.I. 

P.W. 10 -K. P. Suresh Prabhu was posted at Syndicate Bank, 

PIM Branch, Fort, Bombay during the relevant period. 

P.W. 11 -Jayant Rege was holding the post of Assistant General 

Manager in the Syndicate Bank and he has brought on record 

Syndicate Bank Officer Employees' (Conduct) Regulations, 1976 and 

also companion regulation i.e. Syndicate Bank Officer Employees' 

(Discipline & Appeal) Regulations, 1976 at Exhibit 125 collectively. 

P.W. 12 -Prasanna Shenoy was, at the relevant time, posted as 

Assistant Vice President, Fairgrowth Investments Ltd at Bombay. 

P.W. 13 -Dattapal Neroy was working as a Manager of 

Syndicate Bank from 1972 to January 1992 and, thereafter, he was 

working in Fairgrowth Investments Pvt. Ltd.

34 

P.W. 14 -V. Sethumadhavan was working with Reserve Bank of 

India and he was sent on deputation to Syndicate Bank from 1991 to 

1994 as Chief Vigilance Officer. 

P.W. 15 -Sushil Prasad Singh was working as Inspector of Police 

in the CBI Bank Securities Cell, Bombay in June, 1992 and a written 

complaint was received by him from V. Sethumadhavan, Chief 

Vigilance Officer, Syndicate Bank in the last week of May, 1993 and it 

was registered by him on 02/06/1993. He has stated that, initially, 

the case was investigated by Mr. Pradeep Kumar, Inspector of Police 

and that the said Pradeep Kumar was repatriated to his Parent Branch 

in Kerala on 13/04/1996 and, thereafter, the case was transferred to 

him. 

P.W. 16 -Pradip Kumar was the Investigating Officer who 

carried out the investigation after the complaint was lodged on 

02/06/1993 till 1996 when he handed over the investigation to P.W 

15 -Sushil Prasad Singh. 

20. The accused have not examined any witness. Prosecution has

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


35 

brought on record number of documents. Since the charge levelled 

against accused Nos. 1 and 2 is of conspiracy to commit offence 

punishable under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code, substantive 

charge under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code is also framed 

against accused No. I and charge of abetment to commit offence under 

section 409 is leve lled against accused No.2. It would be appropriate if 

the entire evidence on record is examined to see whether the aforesaid 

charges have been proved against accused Nos. 1 and 2. In this 

context, it will be necessary first to see what is the evidence against 

accused No.1. 

21. In a nutshell, the evidence which is brought on record is to the 

effect that OIDB had surplus funds at its disposal. Inquiries were made 

by OIDB with the Nationalized Bank, informing them about its 

intention of investing these surplus funds. Counter offers were made 

by the Nationalized Banks to OJDB. Syndicate Bank had made an offer 

to OIDB, asking them to invest their surplus funds in PMS services for a 

period of one year and had assured the OIDB of expected return of 

18.25°/o interest per annum. The offer document sent to OIDB clearly 

disclosed that the moneys parked with the Syndicate Bank under PMS 

activities would be invested in the capital market instruments and 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


36 

would be at the risk of constituents and that the expected returns 

would be about 18.25°/o per annum. 
Though these letters were 

received by OIDB, an initial amount of Rs 20 crores (approx.) was sent 

by OIDB to the Syndicate Bank Delhi Branch as first remittance on 

03/04/1992 and at that time there was no contract or agreement 

between the OIDB and Syndicate bank. Subsequently, five more 

remittances of various amounts were sent during 02/04/1992 and 

30/05/ 1992 aggregating to Rs 132.22 crores. 
Though OIDB has 

asserted that it had informed the Syndicate Bank about the guidelines 

and directions for the investments of the said amounts in its six letters 

dated 
21/04/1992, 
29/04/1992, 
01/05/1992, 
04/05/1992, 

12/05/1992 and 14/05/1992, the admitted position is that when the 

first remittance was sent on 03/04/1992 for an amount of Rs 20 crores 

(approx.), no such directions were issued. After the scam broke out in 

April 1992, the OIDB appears to have written letters to Syndicate 

Bank, asking them to invest the amounts remitted by them only in 

Government Securities. However, when the Syndicate Bank informed 

the OIDB Officers that the expected returns of 18.25°/o interest per 

annum would be achieved only because of investments made in PMS 

which, in tum, meant that the amounts would be invested by 

purchasing shares in the capital market of Blue-chip 
Companies.

37 

Thereafter, OIDB issued a clarification to its earlier letters by adding 

the word "etc." to directions contained in six letters. Prosecution has 

proved remittances which have been made by OIDB between 

02/04/ 1992 and 30/05/ 1992 in favour of Syndicate Bank, Kasturba 

Gandhi Marg Branch, New Delhi. 
Prosecution has also proved 

remittances of. the amount from Syndicate Bank, Kasturba Gandhi 

Marg Branch, New Delhi to the FIM Branch of Syndicate Bank, Fort, 

Bombay through interbank advice notes. Prosecution also has proved 

that this amount was used for the purpose of purchasing shares in the 

open market and these shares were purchased in the name of OIDB. 

The brokers in the Stock Exchange who have been examined have 

identified the contract notes for the purchase of shares out of the said 

amount remitted to FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay. 

The evidence on record and particularly the evidence of P.W. 1 -V.P. 

Chugh and P.W 2 -Arvind Kaushal, on close scrutiny, clearly indicates 

that the officials of OIDB had tried to salvage the position of their 

investment in PMS activity by writing various letters to Delhi Branch of 

the Syndicate Bank, seeking their explanation about investments made 

by Syndicate Bank, after the amount was remitted by OIDB to 

Syndicate Bank, Delhi Branch. Though the prosecution has brought on 

record documents to prove the remittances from OIDB to the Delhi

Branch of the Syndicate Bank and from Delhi Branch of the Syndicate 

Bank to FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay, it has not 

been in a position to establish the manner in which the accused No. l 

who was the Executive Director of the Syndicate Bank and who was 

stationed at Manipal, Kamataka State is involved in the entire episode 

of investment of the funds sent by OIDB in various shares in the capital 

market. Though an an attempt has been made by the prosecution by 

examining P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan and other witnesses from the 

Syndicate Bank to suggest that it was under the oral instructions of 

R.S. Pai -accused No. l that the said investments were made in the 

capital market, there is no documentary evidence on record and except 

the bare words of P.W. 3, there is no vital evidence to indicate 

involvement of accused No.I in the entire episode. P.W 3 -R. 

Sundaresan has stated in his evi dence that he had met R. S. Pai in 

Hongkong and on the request made by him to R. S. Pai, he was 

brought to FIM Branch of Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay. Prosecution 

has further brought on record statements of witnesses working in the 

Syndicate Bank. In March, 1992 a meeting was conveyed by R.S. Pai -

accused No. l in which he has stated that the profitability of the Bank 

had to be increased and suggested that for that purpose PMS should be 

increased and efforts should be made for the purpose of mobilization

39 

of fu nds from various Companies so that these could be invested in 

PMS services and, as a result, higher margin of profit could be earned 

through PMS activities. P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan has stated that he had 

orally directed him to engage accused No.2 for the purpose of 

investment of moneys collected from his customers in the capital 

market instruments. Though P.W. 3 has tried to suggest that it was at 

the behest of accused No. l these investments were made, his testimony 

has not been supported by the other witnesses who were examined 

through the Syndicate Bank who have stated in their evidence that a 

Committee was formed and FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, 

Bombay would decide the amounts which would be invested in the 

capital market. The time and the scrips and other particulars would be 

decided by the said Committee. Admittedly, accused No.1 -R.S. Pai 

was not the member of this Committee. There is, therefore, a clear 

contradiction in the evidence of P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan and other 

witnesses from the Syndicate Bank. Though P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan 

has stated that they had acted as per the oral instructions of accused 

No.1 -R.S. Pai, the other witnesses have stated that decision to make 

investments was made by the Committee consisting of four members of 

which P.W. 3 was one of the members. Further, the evidence which is 

brought on record also clearly indicates that the funds of the OIDB 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


40 

were entrusted to the Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch of the Syndicate 

Bank at New Delhi, which, in tum, had entrusted these amounts to the 

FIM Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay. There is thus no 

evidence on record to show that the funds of OIDB were entrusted to 

R.S. Pai who was stationed at Manipal, Kamataka State or that the 

funds were routed through the Head Office to the Bombay Office. On 

the contrary, when the letter was written by FIM Branch of the 

Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay to OIDB, a reply was sent by the off icials 

of OIDB stating that they were not concerned with the FIM Division of 

the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay as they had dealt only with the 

Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch of the Syndicate Bank at New Delhi. 

This clearly indicates that there was no entrustment of funds to 

accused No.l and, therefore the principal ingredient for the offence 

punishable under section 409 is clearly absent as the entrustment of 

funds by the OIDB to accused No.1 has not been establish ed. Further, 

though accused No.2 has been charged for the offence of conspiracy of 

committing criminal breach of trust, the documentary evidence on 

record indicates that the amounts which were remitted by the Kasturba 

Gandhi Marg Branch of the Syndicate Bank at New Delhi to the FIM 

Division of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay were not invested in the 

Companies owned by accused No.2 and the amount of Rs 93 crores 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


41 

was invested in shares in the capital market which were purchased in 

the name of OIDB. This indicates that there was actual purchase of 

shares in favour of OIDB and the transaction in question was not an 

ostensible purchase or sale transaction of shares. 

22. 
Now it will be appropriate to examine the evidence which is 

brought on record by the prosecution and to see whether the said 

evidence is sufficient for the purpose of establishing the case against 

accused Nos. 1 and 2. 

23. 

P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh has deposed that the Oil Industry 

Development Board was constituted under the Oil Industry 

Development Act, 1974. The Government levied cess under section 15 

of the said Act. P.W. 2 -Arvind Kaushal has stated that OIDB was 

constituted under the statute and, therefore, was an autonomous body 

and the Government levied cess on oil and the proceeds were credited 

to the consolidated funds of India and, therefore, from time to time, 

the amounts were transferred to its statutory organizations. The funds 

which were given to OIDB from the consolidated funds were spent on 

research and development and the funds were also given to various oil 

sector companies for the purpose of development. P.W. 1 has fu rther 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


42 

stated that over and above giving loans to the approved Companies, 

OIDB still had surplus funds at its disposal and these funds were 

deposited with the Nationalized Banks only and some amounts were 

invested in Saving Bank Accounts kept in Fixed Deposits and for a 

short time in Government Securities. He has stated that during the 

period from October, 1991 to May, 1992, OIDB had accounts with the 

Indian Overseas Bank, State Bank of India and number of other 

Nationalized Banks. P.W. 2 -Arvind Kaushal has further stated in his 

evidence that the guidelines were laid down regarding the manner in 

which these surplus funds were to be utilized or invested by the OIDB. 

He has further stated that the Syndicate Bank was one such Bank with 

whom the OIDB had transaction between the period from October, 

1991 to May, 1992. P.W. 1 has stated that investment decisions were 

taken by making endorsement on the file. He has stated that the offers 

which came from the Bank were in writing and the accountant was to 

ascertain the number of investments which were made at the time of 

maturity of the fixed deposits and other instruments and to find out 

about the over all situation in respect of such investments. P.W. 2 

fu rther has deposed that the proposal would be tabulated by the 

accountant and P.W. 1 would examine the offers which were received 

and make specific recommendations to the Financial Adviser. He has 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


43 

stated that the Chairman of the Board used to be the Minister in charge 

of Petroleum and Natural Gas who had directed that all the 

investments would require his approval. He has stated that, initially, 

Shri Malviya was the Minister of the Portfolio and, thereafter, he was 

replaced by Shri B. Shankaranand and that during this period the 

express approva l of the Hon'ble Minister was taken and, after the 

approval was obtained from the competent authority, the concerned 

Bank would be informed about the amount which was to be invested 

and the manner in which it was to be invested. He has specifically 

stated that the approval was obtained from the Minister to invest the 

surplus fund s in other securities since the higher ra te of interest was 

given if investment was made in Portfolio Management Servi ces and 

investment advisory services. P.W. 2 has stated that the Officers of the 

OIDB had informed the Secretary that there •was no possibility of 

getting a firm commi tment regard ing fixed returns in terms of interest. 

He has stated that, however, the Bank informed to the Secretary of the 

Board that they would ensu re that there would be fixed higher rate of 

interest. It is relevant to note the statements made by P.W. 1 in his 

deposition on page Nos.4 and 5 of the notes of evidence in respect of 

the funds entrusted with OIDB which read as und er:-

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


44 

"During the relevant period, the Syndicate 
Bank was entrusted with the funds of OIDB 
under the PMS. The Syndicate Bank also had 
given offer to us for investment in PMS. During 
the relevant period, we were dealing with 
offices of Syndicate Bank and letters were 
received from Bombay, Delhi, and DGM of 
their bank also had correspondence with us. 
Some letters were addressed to Chairman, 
OIDB while some letters were addressed to me . 
as DCFAO and some were addressed to the 
accountant. If the offer was accepted, these 
banks would be informed the period for which 
their offer 
was accepted and the amount 
which was to be invested and the rate of 
interest which was accepted by the OIDB and 
also the period for which the amount was 
invested. As soon as we accepted their offer, 
we would inform them that the amount had to 
be invested in securities, bonds, and units of 
UTI and also the lock in period and the rate of 
interest. These conditions were intimated to 
them in writing and also these conditions were 
personally discussed with the officer of bank 
that these amounts would be invested as stated 
hereinabove. It was also clarified to them that 
this amount would not be invested in Private 
Sector Bonds. 
These conditions were 
intimated to them in order to ensure that our 
fu nds are not lost since PMS depends on 
market fluctuations at the time of investment 
and at the time of disinvestment also. No 
person from the Syndicate Bank came to me 
for the purpose of discussing the matter of 
investment. The letters which were sent by 
these banks were kept in a file." 

At the same time P.W. 2 in his evidence has stated about the funds 

which were deployed in Syndicate Bank. 
He has stated in his 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


45 

deposition on pages Nos. 29 and 30 of the notes of ev idence as under:-

"During the rele vant pe riod, surplus funds 

were deployed in the Syndicate Bank. Dur ing 

this period, the investment were not made in 

one bul k amount but were made in different 

installments. Roughly, I could say that in four 

to five installment investment was made. It is 

possible that it could be more or less 

installments. The OIDB dealt with the ban ks 

only through their offices and branches in New 
Delhi. 
The mode of investment in these 

branches in New Delhi was that either the 

represe ntative of the bank would come to the 

board and collect the cheque or the officer of 

the board would come to the board and collect 

the cheque or the officer of the board would 

go to the bank and deliver the cheque and 

letter. 
The covering letter which was sent 

alongwith the cheque gave specific directions 
to the bank regarding amount to be invested, 

securities, the peri od of investment and lastly 

the manner of deployment of those funds." 

24. 
In this context, in entire evidence of P.W. 1 and P .W. 2, no 

reference at all has bee n made to accused No.1 -R.S. Pai. It has never 

been stated by both the witnesses that the funds were entrusted to R.S. 

Pai or that he had, on telephone or orally made any commit me nt for 

fixed return of the investments made by OIDB with the Syndicate 

Bank. On the contrary, the letter which is written by the Syndicate 

Bank clearl y indicates that they had offered tentative interest rates and

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 :::

46 

no firm commitment was made by them. The only evidence which is 

sought to be brought on record against accused No.I -R.S. Pai is the 

statement of P.W. 5 -R. Kalyanasundaram who has stated that R. S. 

Pai -accused No.l and K. R. N. Shenoy -accused No.2 were known to 

each othe r and both had worked together in Syndicate Bank and that 

K. R. N. Shenoy -accused No.2 has re signed as Assistant General 

Manager in Syndicate Bank and, thereafter, joine d the FGIL. The 

accused Nos. 1 and 2 have not disbursed the remittance s which were 

made by OIDB to the Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank or further 

remittances made by Delhi Branch of Syndicate Bank to the FIM 

Division of Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay. Only other evidence which 

is brought on record against accused No. I is through. the evidence of 

P.W. 4 -E.R. Seshadri, P.W. S -R. Kalyansundaram, P.W. 3 -R. 

Sundaresan, Divisional Manager of Sy ndicate Bank at Bombay. P.W. 3 

-R. Sundaresan has stated in his deposition on page 55 of the notes of 

evidence as under: -

"I say that the head office of the Syndicate 

Bank is at Manipal, Kamataka. I say that 
Shri R.S. Pai was operating from the he ad 

office at Mani pal. I say that Mr. Shenoy 

was working at Bombay."

47 

Similarly P.W. 4 -E.R. Sheshadri has stated in his deposition on page 

94 of the notes of evidence as under: -

"I say that I know Shri R.S. Pai. He was 

Executive Director in the Syndicate Bank 

and was posted at Mani pal., 
, 

And P.W. 5 -R. Kalyanasundaram has stated in his deposition on page 

No.109 of the notes of evidence as under:-

"I say that at that time Shri R.S. Pai was an 

Executive Director of the Syndicate Bank. I 

say that Shri R.S. Pai's office was situated 

at Manipal, South Kamataka." 

Further, P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan in his evidence has stated that he had 

met accused No.1 -R.S. Pai when he visited Hongkong and he had 

stated that R.S. Pai expressed his concern about the deteriorating 

condition of the Bank. P. W. 3 in his deposition on page Nos. 51 and 

52 of the notes of evidence has stated as under: -

"I say that I have met R.S. Pai in Hongkong 

when he had come there in a capacity as 

Chairman of the Board of Directors in the 

year 1991. In Syndicate Bank, he was a 

Executive Director. 
During this period 

when Mr. Pai visited Hongkong, we did

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


48 

discuss about the financial health of 
Syndicate Bank. 
At that time, he 
expressed 
his 
concern 
about 
the 
deteriorating condition of the bank and 
that something had to be done to improve 
the said condition. I say that at that time, I 
had discussed with him that I was due to 
return to India and he suggested that he 
would try to get the posting in Bombay in 
the Merchant Banking Division." 

The other evidence against accused No.I has come through P.W. 3 -R. 

Sundaresan. He has stated that a meeting was held in March, 1992 

and R.S. Pai had made an appeal to all the Executives to mobilize 

funds. P.W. 3 in his deposition on page Nos. 53 and 54 of the notes of 

evidence has stated as under:-

"In the first week of March 1992, the 
meeting was held at Zonal Off ice and in 
the said meeting, Mr. R.S. Pai discussed 
many issues and more particularly issues 
concerning the profitability in general and 
he also announced that FIM would soon 
start the Portfolio Management Services. 
He also informed us this was in addition to 
the Nariman Point Branch where this 
activity had already started. He made an 
appeal to all the executives who were 
present there to keep this in mind and 
accordingly, mobilise funds. I say that 
most of the senior executives and zonal 
heads from Delhi and other branches were 
present. I say that Mr. Sheshadri who was 
a DGM of Delhi zone was also present. He 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


49 

welcomed his idea and he assured us that 
with his contacts in Delhi, he would be in 
a position to mobilise funds for that 
purpose." 

P.W. 4 -E. R. Sheshadri has further stated in his deposition on page 

Nos. 95 and 96 of the notes of evidence as under:-

"Some time in March, 1992, the 
Zonal Office had convened meeting of all 
Zonal Managers in order to discuss 
strategies of the Bank for the next 
financial year. This meeting was held for 
the purpose of discussing strategies of 
growth development and management of 
the Bank and its various branches. I was 
present at the said meeting which was 
held at Pune. Shri R.S. Pai was presiding 
over the said meeting which was held at 
Pune. 
I remember that during this 
relevant period I had a colleague by name 
Shri Sundaresan Prabhu. He was, at the 
relevant time, Funds Investment Manager 
and was posted at Bombay. I say that 
another colleague namely Shri P.S. 
Prabhu was also posted at Bombay. I say 
that he was Assistant General Manager at 
that time. l do not remember whether 
Shri Sundaresan Prabhu and Shri P.S. 
Prabhu were present in the meeting which 
was held at Pune. 

I say that in this meeting Shri R.S. 
Pai informed us that the Bank was earning 
less profits and he, therefore, suggested 
various ways and methods for overcoming 
difficult situation which was faced by the 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


so 

Bank. He, therefore, suggested that the 

Bank had Investment Department which 

had ability to invest surplus funds of their 

bank. Similarly, Investment Department 

was also in a position to invest surplus 

funds of the Syndicate Bank. I say that 

expectation of Shri R.S. Pai as Head of the 

organization was that all the branches and 

Zonal Offices should generate good profits 

for the Bank. 

I say that about 20 

members were present at the said 

meeting." 

25. From the aforesaid evidence, apart from bare words of P.W. 3 -

R. Sundaresan that he was acting on the oral instructions of R.S. Pai, 

there is no other evidence on record to suggest that R.S. Pai -accused 

No. l was monitoring the entire transaction. The entire evidence of 

these witnesses, as stated hereinabove, does not even remotely connect 

the accused No.1 with the investments made by OIDB with the Delhi 

Branch of the Syndicate Bank nor with the investments made by FIM 

Branch of the Syndicate Bank, Fort, Bombay. On the other hand, the 

entire correspondence with the OIDB has been made either through 

the Delhi Branch of Syndicate Bank or by Shri R. Sundaresan as 

Divisional Manager of Syndicate Bank, FIM Branch, Fort, Bombay. It 

has to be noted here, as observed hereinabove, that P.W. 1 -V.P. 

Chugh was permitted to be re-examined and he was further cross-

examined by the Counsel for the accused. P.W. 1, however, thereafter, 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


51 

did not make himself available for further cross-examination after his 

re-examination was taken by Mr. V.G. Pradhan, the learned Special 

Public Prosecutor. As a result, an objection was taken by the learned 

Counsel appearing on behalf of the accused that the entire re 

examination of V.P. Ch ugh, therefore, be struck off from the record 

and, accordingly, I had passed an order, directing that the said entire 

re-examination be struck off from the record. The documents which 

were exhibited by P.W. 1 in the re-examination, therefore, also were 

not permitted to be read in evidence. No application was made by the 

prosecution for recalling the said order. Thereafter, at no time, P.W. 1 

-V.P. Chugh was made available for further cross-examination. Even 

otherwise, therefore, an adverse inference will have to be drawn 

against the prosecution for not making V.P. Chugh available for cross 

examination. An adverse inference will have to be drawn that V.P. 

Chugh was not permitted to be cross-examined because the 

prosecution was afraid that he may not support the prosecution case. 

In fact, on earlier occasion, Mr. V.G. Pradhan had sought leave of this 

Court to cross-examine V.P. Chugh without declaring him hostile. 

P.W. 1 fur ther has, in his evidence, stated that he was not aware of the 

guidelines laid by the Reserve Bank of India and/or SEBI. The entire 

evidence of P.W. 1, therefore, even otherwise, becomes completely 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


52 

unreliable and atleast his evidence 1s of no assistance to the 

prosecution for establishing the case against accused Nos. 1 and 2. 

Same is the case of evidence given by P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan. 

Initially, he was nruned as accused in a complaint which was filed by V. 

Sethumadhavan, Vigilance Officer of the Syndicate Bank. For a period 

of one month after the complaint was filed, P.W. 16 -Pradip Kumar 

who was the Investigating Officer did not even care to record the 

statement of P.W. 3. All the correspondence is made and directions 

have been given by P.W. 3 under his signature. There is absolutely no 

evidence to show that he was under direct control of ac• cused No.I -

R.S. Pai, except his bare word that he was acting under his 

instructions. His evidence has not been corroborated by any other 

witness or by any qocumentary evidence on record. Prosecution also 

• 

has not been in a position to give any plausible explanation as to why 

the prosecution chose to drop him as an accused and examined him as 

a witness on behalf of the prosecution. Evidence of P.W. 2 -Arvind 

Kaushal also indicates that all the correspondence was made by him 

after the scam was broke out and the letters written by him appear to 

be an afterthought to salvage the damage caused to OIDB. It has come 

on record that the first remittance which was made by OIDB was 

without entering into any formal document between the OlDB and the 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


53 

Syndicate Bank and it is only on the basis of offer letters which were 

sent by either party, OIDB is trying to make out a case that it had 

remitted the amount for investing it only in Government Securities, 

though the first remittance of Rs 20 crores (approx) was made even 

without giving any intimation to the Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch of 

the Syndicate Bank at New Delhi. To that extent, therefore, evidence 

of P.W. 2 -Arvind Kaushal also does not establish any nexus between 

the accused Nos. 1 and 2 and the remittances which were made by the 

Officials of the OIDB. 

26. For the aforesaid reasons, I am of the view that the prosecution 

has not established that there was a conspiracy between accused Nos. 

1 and 2 for utilizing the funds of OIDB or that the accused No. l had 

persuaded the Officials of the OIDB to park their fu nds with the 

Syndicate Bank with an assurance of fixed returns. Similarly, the 

entrustment of money by OIDB to R.S. Pai alsso has not been 

estabHshed. 

27. 

Having seen the oral evidence against accused Nos. 1 and 2, it 

will have to be examined whether from the documentary evidence 

which is brought on record, any case is made out against both the 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


54 

accused. For that purpose, it is necessary to see the chronology of 

events. I have already stated that from 02/04/1992 to 30/05/1992 

various remittances were made by the OIDB in the Kasturba Gandhi 

Marg Branch of the Syndicate Bank at New Delhi for an amount of 

Rs 93,17,77,925/-and this amount, in tum, was invested by accused 

No.I and the said amount was remitted to accused No.2 through five 

remittances of various amounts during the period 07 /05/1992 to 

29/06/1992. Now, it will have to be seen the manner in which the 

amounts were paid and the correspondence between the parties before 

and after the remittances were made in order to appreciate the rival 

contentions. 

28. According to the prosecution, a meeting was arranged by accused 

No.1 in March, 1992 wherein he has urged all his Executives to 

mobilize funds from individual clients, so that these funds could be 

invested in the PMS services. At this stage, it would be relevant to take 

into consideration the RBI guidelines which have been issued. The 

Reserve Bank of India issued guidelines which have been brought on 

record at Exhibit-14. The said circular was communicated to the 

Chairman/Chief Executive of all Scheduled, Commercial Banks. All 

this was in relation to Portfolio Management Scheme on behalf of 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


55 

clients. In para 2 of the said guidelines, it has been stated as under:-

"2. 

Our scrutiny of 'portfolio management 

services' provided •by some banks, however, 

has disclosed certain disquieting features as 

under : 

(i) Banks have been accepting short term 

funds, i.e. for a period less than one year, for 

portfolio management. 

(ii) 
Banks have been accepting funds for 

portfolio 
management 
and 
instead 
of 

managing such funds themselves, placed 

such 
funds 
with 
other 
banks 
for 

management. 

(iii) 
Banks have been deploying portfolio 

funds in call money market and bills market. 

(iv) 
Banks have not been maintaining 

client-wise records of funds accepted for 

portfolio management and investments made 

thereagainst. They have been using portfolio 

funds for their own purposes. They have also 

been mixing their own investments with 

those of their clients." 

It was under these circumstances, the Reserve Bank of India issued 

guidelines to Banks. Clause (iv) of para 3 of the said guidelines is as 

follows :-

"3. 
It has, therefore, been considered 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


56 

necessary to issue further guidelines to 
banks on this matter. Portfolio management 
services (PMS) may be provided by 
banks/their subsidiaries to their clients 
henceforth, subject strictly to the following 
revised guidelines : 

(i) .................................................... . 

(ii) •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 

("') 111 ................................................... . 

(iv) 
The funds accepted for portfolio 
management are essentially expected to be 
deployed in capital market instruments such 
as shares, debentures, bonds, securities etc. 
In any case, portfolio funds should not be 
deployed for lending in call money /bill 
market and lending to/placement with 
corporate bodies. 

( v) ................................................... . 

(vi) ............................ ......................... . 

( " ) 

)) 

Vll .................................................... . 

The Reserve Bank of India, therefore, had clearly indicated in its 

guidelines that funds which were placed with the Nationalized Bank 

under PMS are essentially expected to be invested in capital market 

instruments such as shares, debentures, bonds, securities etc. The 

restrictions, however, were placed in order to ensure that these 

investments are not made for short term below one year and the

57 

minimum period of investment should be one year. A restriction was 

also imposed by the RBI that this money should not be deployed for 

lending in call money/bills market and lending to/placement with 

corporate bodies. The RBI guidelines, therefore, dearly stipulated that 

when funds were deployed with the Nationalized Banks in the PMS, 

these funds were essentially to be used for the purpose of investment 

in capital market instruments. In this background, it has to be seen 

from the documentary evidence i.e the contents of correspondence as 

to what had transpired between the OIDB and the Syndicate Bank. 

The Accountant of OIDB Shri B.S. Sharma had issued a letter dated 

21/03/1992 to all the Banks, a list of which is attached to the said 

letter which is brought on record at Exhibit-13. 
It would be 

worthwhile to see the relevant contents of the said letter at Exhibit-13, 

which reads as under:-

Sir, 

"Sub: Investment of funds in Portfolio 

Management Scheme for a period 

of one year. 

We propose to invest a part of our surplus funds in 

the Portfolio Management Scheme for a period of one 

year. You are requested to make your best offer for the 

same positively by 23.3.1992. The offer may please be 

made after consulting higher management with a view

to giving best possible rate and avoiding any subsequent 
revision thereto." 

Copy of this letter was also addressed to the Syndicate Bank alongwirh 

all other Nationalized Banks which is evident from the list annexed to 

Exhibit-13. From the aforesaid letter, it is evident that the OIDB was 

very clear in its mind of investing its funds in the Portfolio 

Management Scheme (PMS). 

29. The Syndicate Bank also had .written a letter dated 21/03/1992 

to the OIDB. This letter is sent by the Assistant General Manager of 

the Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch of the Syndicate Bank, New Delhi. 

In this letter, it has been stated that Syndicate Bank had learnt that the 

surplus funds with the OIDB were to be invested and an offer was 

made by the Bank to invest these . funds in the PMS. It would be 

relevant, therefore, to see exactly what was the offer made by the 

Syndicate Bank. The relevant portion of the said letter at Exhibit-7, 

reads as under. 

"Dear Sir ' 

Re : Investment of your funds with us 
under Portfolio Management Scheme. 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014

We learn that you have surplus funds meant for investment. 

In this connection, we would like to offer our expertise 

services to you for management of your funds, that may be 

placed with our Bank, by you, under Portfolio Management 

Scheme, so as to enable you to get the maximum possible 

returns. 

In the past, we have been successful in getting a return of 

around 18°/o to our existing portfolio clients and we hope 

to achieve near about the same level of return to you also. 

However, the indicate yie ld for yo u would be about 

18.250/o p. a. [Emphasis supplied] 

Such funds placed with us by you will be managed by us as 

per the guidelines issued by R.Bl/SEBI in the matter." 

30. At this juncture, it would also be relevant to consider another 

guideline which was issued by the R.Bl in its guidelines at Exhibit-14 

ln clause (ii) of para 3 of Exhibit-14, it is stated as under:-

"3 (ii) 

'PMS' should be in the nature 
of investment 

consultancy /management, for a fee, entirely at the 

customer's risk, without guaranteeing, either directly or 

indirectly, a pre-determined return. 
The bank should 

charge a definite fee for the services rendered independent 

of the return to the client." 

From the letter which is referred to at Exhibit-7, it is clear that the 

Assistant Manager of the Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch of the 

Syndicate Bank, New Delhi had clearly stated that the yield was 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


60 

indicative only to the extent of 18.25°/o . This is relevant because in the 

subsequent correspondence between the OIDB Officials and the Bank, 

much emphasis has been laid by the prosecution on these letters to 

indicate that the Syndicate Bank had promised and assured OIDB that 

it would give them the assured returns. The above letter at Exhibit-7 

which is written prior in point of time to the first investment which is 

made, clearly states that the only indicative yield of the interest has 

been mentioned. Officials of the OIDB, therefore, were clearly aware 

that what was the promise given by the Syndicate Bank and i.e only 

the indicative yield of the investments which were made in the PMS. 

The subsequent correspondence between the Officials of the OIDB with 

the Syndicate Bank clearly is after the scam broke out and as I would 

presently point out, obviously, this was in order to save their own skin 

from the possible fa llout of the investments made at their behest with 

the Syndicate Bank. The documents which I am presently dealing with 

clearly suggest that the Officials of the OIDB were aware that the 

investments were being made in PMS and that the yield would only an 

indicative yield. 
However, the subsequent correspondence which 

strangely has begun after 21/4/1992 clearly suggests that the Officials 

of the OIDB have tried to put a wool over their eyes or atleast suggest 

that they were not aware that the investments were made in the PMS 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


61 

which clearly was meant for investments which were essentially to be 

made in the capital market instruments as indicated hereinabove in the 

RBI guidelines. Syndicate Bank also had in the letter written to the 

F.A & C.A.0. of OIDB, New Delhi i.e. P.W. 1 dated 16/04/ 1992 given 

details of PMS. This has become necessaiy to point out the details 

which have been given by the Deputy General Manager, New Delhi 

Branch of the Syndicate Bank. In this letter which is at Exhibit-15, 

categorically, the following information was given:-

" Dear Sir,

This letter has been received by OIDB and there is a stamp of

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 :::

63 

acknowledgment and the letter has been received on the same day and 

F .A & C.A.O. of OIDB has put his initials acknowledging receipt of this 

letter. This letter assumes importance for two reasons. Later on, the 

Officials of OIDB in their correspondence fe igned ignorance about the 

invesnnents which were made by the Syndicate Bank in the capital 

market instruments and have stated that specific directions were given 

by the OIDB to invest their funds only in Government Securities. It is 

imponant to note that when the first remittance was sent on 

03/04/1992, the said amount was remitted to the Delhi Branch of the 

Syndicate Bank even before the formal agreement was executed 

between the parties and after receipt of this letter at Exhibit-IS. 

Therefore, there is no manner of doubt that the Syndicate Bank clearly 

indicated that the funds which were invested in PMS were meant to be 

invested in capital market instruments and that the risk was entirely of 

the constituents and 1°/o "Back-end,, service charges would be paid to 

the Bank. The subsequent correspondence reveals that P.W. 2 has 

produced one of the letters wherein he has expressed his surprise as to 

how an amount of Rs 33 lacs (approximately) was charged as service 

fee by the Syndicate Bank. The subsequent correspondence, therefore, 

is clearly contrary to what the Syndicate Bank had clearly informed the 

F.A. & C.A.O. of OIDB, New Delhi. I shall refer to the said letter at 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


64 

later stage. The stand taken by the OIDB, therefore, is clearly contrary 

to the documents which are on record. In fact, the documents which 

have been brought on record clearly falsifies the case of the 

prosecution. It is surprising as to how the CBI did not make any 

investigation in respect of Officials of OIDB who were equally 

responsible for making these investments with the Syndicate Bank 

when they were fully aware about the nature of the inve stments and 

the indicative yield of the said investments as also the risk involved in 

making these investments under PMS. The correspondence clearly 

indicates that the Officers of OIDB had jumped the wagoner to make a 

quick money and put at risk the funds which were at its disposal and 

which were sent to OIDB from the consolidated funds of India. 

Though the matter was of such a serious nature, the evidence of P.W. 

15 and 16 who were Investigating Officers shows the manner in which 

the investigation had been earned out. It clearly reveals that an 

attempt has been made to protect the Officials of the OIDB and to let 

go the persons who were directly responsible for the entire episode. A 

complaint was filed by Shri V. Sethumadhavan who was the Chief 

Vigilance Officer against Shri R. Sundaresan. No explanation has been 

given as to why no case was filed against him and later on he was 

examined as prosecution witness.

31. In the backdrop of these documents, now it has to be seen as to 

how the Officials of OIDB have later on tried to give twist to the entire 

episode which was obviously meant for the purpose of saving their 

own skin. After this letter at Exhibit-15 was received by F.A. & C.A.0. 

of the OIDB, New Delhi and acknowledgment to that effect was given 

it is thereafter he addressed a letter • to the Chief Manager of the 

Syndicate Bank dated 21/4/1992 which is at Exhibit-5. P.W. 1 in this 

letter states as under:-

"We have parked funds to the extent of Rs 
20.09 crores with you as per acknowledgment 
received from your bank vide your letter 
No.216, DZO DGMS F-20,92 dated 18.4.92 for 
their proper management under 'Portfo lio 
Investment'. 
Your 
acknowledgment 
of 
deployment of our funds in Govt. Securities, 
Units of UTI and Public Sector Bonds, Safe 
Custody of securities giving return as contained 
in 
your 
letter 
No. 788/9005/92, 
dated 
25/26.3.1992 is awaited which may please be 
expedited." [Emphasis supplied] 

Since the reference is made to the letter dated 25/03/ 1992, it has to 

be seen what was mentioned in the said letter which is at Exhibit-6 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


66 

dated 25/03/1992. It is stated by the Divisional Manager of the New 

Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank that yield on the investment made 

by the OIDB would not be less that 18.250/o . P.W. 1, therefore, does 

not make any reference to the letter received by him dated 

16/04/1992 in which details of the PMS was given. He, however, 

makes a reference to letter dated 25/26.03.1992. P.W. 1, therefore 

fe igned ignorance about receipt of the letter dated 16/04/ 1992. This 

clearly indicates that though P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh was very well aware 

that the funds parked with the Syndicate Bank were to be deployed 

under PMS with all its attending risk involved, he . fe igned ignorance 

about this letter and makes a stray reference to the letter dated 

25/26.03.1992. It has to be noted that the letter dated 25/26.03.1992 

has been written with reference to the letter written by the Assistant 

General Manager of the Syndicate Bank to the OIDB dated 

21/03/1992. The said letter appears to be a confirmation of what is 

stated in letter dated 21/03/1992. In this context, therefore, it will be 

necessary to see the relevant contents of the said letter which is at 

Exhibit-6 dated 25/26.03.1992 which read as under:-

"Further to our letter of offer vide ref. 
No.PMS/269/5037 /HKS/92 dated 21.3. 1992, 
this is to confirm that the yield on your 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


67 

investment would be not less than 18.25°/o p.a. 
on the investment made by you with our Bank 
upto Rs 140 crores (Rupees One hundred forty 
crores) for one year." 

This letter, therefore, was in addition to what was mentioned in 

Exhibit-7. In the letter at Exhibit-7 dated 21/03/1992, it has been 

clearly mentioned that the indicative yield of 18.25% 1 per annum 

would be available on the funds placed with the Syndicate Bank. A 

reference also has been made to the guidelines issued by RBl/SEBI in 

the said letter. P.W. 1, instead of making reference to letter dated 

21/03/1992 at Exhibit-7 and further letter which was written dated 

16/04/1992 at Exhibit-15 giving complete details of PMS, chooses to 

make a reference only to letter dated 25/26.3.1992 at Exhibit-6. This 

clearly shows the dishonesty on the part of the prosecution witnesses 

and that a dishonest stand was taken by the Officials of OIDB even 

before the investments were made. This further indicates that they 

were very well aware that the said investments were made contrary to 

the regulations which were laid down by the Central Government and 

the guidelines and the resolutions passed by the OIDB in its internal 

meetings. However, in their correspondence, Officials of OIDB have 

fe igned ignorance about the information given by the Syndicate Bank 

to them. These documents, therefore, clearly falsify the stand taken by 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


68 

the OIDB's Officials. As I have already indicated that an adverse 

inference has to be drawn against the prosecution, particularly because 

of the conduct of P.W. 1 in not making himself available for further 

cross-examination. Prosecution though had an ample opportunity to 

get this witness, did not take any steps whatsoever for making him 

available for further cross-examination. 

32. 

The above discussion dearly reveals that the Investigating 

Agency acted in a totally sloppy manner though facts and the 

documents clearly speak for themselves. 
On the one hand, no 

explanation is given by the Investigating Officers P.W. 15 and 16 why 

no investigation was made at the OIDB end though they had an ample 

opportunity to do so. 
On the other • hand, though the entire 

documentary evidence dearly suggests that the correspondence was 

essentially between the OIDB's officials and the Officers of New Delhi 

Branch of the Syndicate Bank and the FIM Branch of the Syndicate 

Bank, Fon, Bombay, further investigation has not been made after 

these documents were made available • to the prosecution. 

33. The subsequent correspondence reveals that P.W. 1 in his 

subsequent correspondence has maintained his stand that the funds in

the PMS were to be invested in Government Securities. Letter dated 

29/04/1992 at Exhibit-8 is written by P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh to the Chief 

Manager, Syndicate Bank, Bhagwan Das Ro ad, New Delhi records that 

fo ur cheques, all dated 29/04/1992 drawn on State Bank of India, K.G. 

Marg, New Delhi were sent for deployment under Portfolio 

Management Scheme with effect from 29/04/1992 @ 19.51°/o . The 

amount of the said cheques was Rs 81,68,50,924.65. It is interesting 

to note that in para 3 of this letter he has stated as under:-

"3. The funds have been parked with you for 
their proper management as "Portfolio 
Investment" in Government Securities Units of 
UTI & Public Sector Bonds in accordance with 
RBI guidelines." 

In this connection, it will also be relevant to note the following 

correspondence between S.K. Pujari, the Accountant of OIDB and P.W. 

3 -R. Sundaresan, Divisional Manager of the Syndicate Bank. In the 

letter at Exhibit-19 dated 18/06/1993, S.K. Pujari has informed the 

Divisional Manager as under:-

"Sub: Investment of funds under P.M.S 
Ref : Your letter No.1212/FIM/PMS/93, dated 
June 7, 1993.

Sir, 

The Oil Industry Development Board has 

made no investment with your branch. Whatever 

investments the Board has made these have been 

made with the Bank's office/branch located at New 

Delhi. Therefore, no cognizance can be taken of 

your above mentioned communication. You are 

advised to take up the matter with the DGM, 

Syndicate Bank, New Delhi and your headquarters 

at Manipal." 

The second letter is dated 03/06/ 1992 written by P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh 

to the Assistant General Manager of the Syndicate Bank which is at 

Exhibit-24 in which he has stated that the Bombay Office in its letter 

dated12/05/1992 has sent an acknowledgment regarding receipt of 

funds amounting to Rs 61.43 crores from OIDB through your K.G. 

Branch Office for placement in Portfolio Management. He has stated 

that since the entire funds of Rs 198.38 crores have been given to Delhi 

Office only, there was no occasion for Bombay Office to write the said 

letter. 
Again, P.W. 1 wrote a letter which is at Exhibit-26 dated 

03/08/1992 in which he has made a reference to the letter dated July 

18, 1992 from the Bombay Office regarding confirmation of investment 

of funds. In para 2 of the said letter dated 3/8/ 1992 at Exhibit-26, he 

has mentioned as under:-

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


71 

"Your Bombay Office vide its letter dated 

July 1 8, 1992 has sent confirmation regarding 

investment of funds and holding securitie s. This 

is inexplicable since the funds have been placed 

with your bank on the basis of offe r rece ive d 

from your office." 

So, on the one hand, OIDB has later on taken a sta nd that it was not 

concerned with any othe r Office and that it had deploye d the funds 

on ly with the K.G. Marg Branch of the Syndicate Bank, New Delhi. No 

refe rence was made to any communication made by accused No.l -

R.S. Pai. This clearly establishes that the funds were entrusted by 

OIDB even according to P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 with the Delhi Branch of 

the Syndicate Bank and not eve n with the FIM Branch of the Syndicate 

Bank, Fort, Bombay, much less with R.S. Pai who was the Executive 

Director and who was stationed at Manipal, Karna taka. 
The 

correspondence also indicates that though Officials of OIDB were very 

well aware about the lette r dated 16/04/1992 at Exhibit-15 and the 

other letter dated 21/4/1992, they had fe igned ignorance about the 

same and in their letters have stated that the funds were deployed for 

the purpose of investment in Government Securities on ly and the 

Syndicate Bank Officers at Delhi Branch had assured them of fixed 

returns of ab ove 18°/o and, later on, in the subsequent correspondence, 

they have maintaine d that the fund were deployed for investment at

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


72 

19.SlO /o per annum. This is clearly contrary to the correspondence 

between the Assistant General Manager, Syndicate Bank and the OIDB. 

In the letter dated 27 /04/ 1992 at Exhibit-17, the Assistant General 

manager of the Syndicate Bank has again stated that the indicative 

yield on the investment under PMS was 19.51°/0 per annum. The said 

letter at Exhibit-17 reads as under:-

"Further to our earlier letter to you on the 

subject offering an in dicative yi eld of 18.50°/o 

for 
your 
investment 
under 
Portfolio 

Management Scheme with us we are now 

pleased to offer you an indicative yield of 

19.51 % (Nineteen point five one percent 

p.a.)" [Emphasis supplied] 

and yet P.W. 1 in his letter which is written two days after the letter at 

Exhibit-17, states that the investment of Rs 81,68,50,924.65 under 

PMS has been made with effect from 29/04/1992 @ 19.Slo/ o . All this 

correspondence clearly reveals that on the one hand officials of the 

OIDB were very well aware of the risk which was involved in investing 

their surplus funds in PMS and, on the other hand, for the purpose of 

creating record in its office, in the correspondence they have shown 

audacity of stating that the funds were to be given for deployment in 

Government Securities for a assured sum of interest, though in each

73 

letter sent by the Officers of the Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank, 

they were at pains to point out that the yield was only an indicative 

yield. Apart from this , it is evident that neither P.W. 1 -V.P. Chugh 

nor P.W. 2 -Arvind Kaushal have made any reference to either Mr. R.S. 

Pai -accused No. l or Mr. K. R. N. Shenoy -accused No.2. Therefore, 

entrustment of funds with accused No. I has not at all been established. 

A boogie has been raised by the Officials of the OIDB that they were 

not aware that their surplus funds were being invested in PMS under 

their own risk , though they were specifically informed by the Officers 

of the Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank and the CBI has turned a 

blind eye towards the OIDB Officials which is reflected from the 

evidence of P.W. 15 and 16 who were the Investigating Officers who 

have clearly stated in their cross-examination that though involvement 

of OIDB Officials also appears to be eminent from these documents, no 

investigation was made by the CBI on that front. The attempt made by 

the OIDB Officials to play hide-and-seek at the same time is reflected 

from the following letter which is at Exhibit-9 and this letter is written 

by Mr. S.K. Pujari. 
Mr. S.K. Puj ari writes a letter to the Chief 

Manager, Syndicate Bank in which he states as under:-

"Sir ' 

The following amendment may please be 

made under the investment No.4 of our letter 

dated 29.4.92. 

S.No.4 

Read 

S.No.4 

Portfolio Management Scheme for a 

period of one year. 

Portfolio Management Scheme for a 

period of one year. Investments in 

Units, Bonds of Public Sector Units, 

Certificates of Deposit, Commercial 

paper of Government, Companies, 

Govt. Securities, etc." 

This letter obviously has been written after it was pointed out by the 

Syndicate Bank Officials that the PMS pertains only to investments in 

capital market. The Officials of the OIDB, therefore, clearly made an 

attempt to hide this fact from the higher Offi cials of the OIDB and the 

Central Gove rnment. 
Unfortunately, though this is clearly evident 

from these documents, no steps have been taken by CBI to probe into 

this aspect at all, though the funds came from the consolidated fund of 

India and under section 15 of the Oil Industry Development Act, 1974 

the Government had levied cess and, thereafter had transferred these 

funds to OIDB for various purposes. 
In view of this documentary 

evidence, therefore, I am clearly of the view that, in any case, there is 

::: Uploaded on -13/11/2014 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


75 

no connection between the investment of funds by the OIDB either 

with accused No. l or accused No.2. Therefore, point Nos. 1 and 2 are 

answered in the negative. 

34. 
Prosecution has also proved the remittances of money from 

Delhi Branch of the Syndicate Bank to its Bombay Branch through 

inter-bank credit advise note since these documents are not disputed. 

Even if the said documents are accepted, as I have indicated earlier, 

nothing turns on the said documents of transf�r of money from the 

Syndicate Bank, New Delhi Branch to the FIM Branch of the Syndicate 

Bank at Fort, Bombay and the further amount which has been sent to 

FGIL. An attempt has been made by the prosecution to show that 

accused No.1 knew accused No.2 while he was working in the 

Syndicate Bank and further an attempt is made to show that P.W. 3 -R 

Sundaresan was brought from Hongkong to the FIM Branch of the 

Syndicate Bank at Fort, Bombay. 
It is also said by some of the 

witnesses that because Mr. Prabhu did not agree with Mr R.S. Pai -

accused No.l, he was suddenly transferred and in his place Mr. R. 

Sundaresan was posted as Divisional Manager. It is the further case of 

prosecution and it is so stated by P.W. 3 and P.W. 5 that on account of 

suggestion made by R.S. Pai -accused No.1 that accused No.2 was

appointed for the purpose of making investments in the capital market 

instruments. The second limb of the prosecution case therefore is that 

Mr. R.S. Pai had persuaded OIDB Officials to invest its money in 

Syndicate Bank and, on the other hand, the said money was siphoned 

off in favour of FGIL and it's sister concern the Fairgrowth Financial 

Services Ltd since the said company of which accused No.2 was a 

Managing Director was under liquidity crunch and, therefore, accused 

No.2 and his Company had wrongfully gained from the transfer of 

fu nds to it and wrongful loss was caused to OIDB. 

35. 
First of all , it is pertinent to note here th.at though original 

complaint which was filed by V. Sethumadhavan and an FIR was 

lodged which is at Exhibit-130, it was alleged that P.W. 3 -R. 

Sundaresan had cheated the Bank and there was wrongful loss caused 

to OIDB and wrongful gain to accused No.2. 
Later on, when the 

charge-sheet was filed, a charge of cheating was dropped. No charges 

were levelled against P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan who was named as an 

accused in the original complaint and the charge was levelled against 

accused No.1 -R.S. Pai for the substantive offence of criminal breach 

of trust under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code and conspiracy 

along with the offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Though, it has been charged that the entire amount was transferred in 

the name of Company of accused No.2, it is a matter of record that the 

actual shares to the tune of Rs 93 crores approximately were purchased 

in the name of OIDB. The decision to make investment was taken by 

the Committee of four persons in which accused No.1 was not a 

member and, on the other hand, P.W. 3 -R. Sundaresan was the 

member of the Committee alongwith three other persons. This falsifies 

the case of the prosecution that the investments were made in FGIL 

and its sister concern the Fairgrowth Financial Services Ltd of which 

the accused No.2 was the Managing Director at the instance of Mr. R.S. 

Pai -accused No.1. This decision was taken by the Committee of fo ur 

persons which decided the date and the manner which the investments 

were to be made. 
This clearly indicates that the transaction of 

investment in shares from the PMS of the client was not an ostensible 

share transaction but was an actual share transaction. It is interesting 

to note that the prosecution has not stated whether actual loss was 

caused to the OIDB as a result of investment made. No such complaint 

has been made either by V. Sethumadhavan who lodged a complaint or 

by Officials of OIDB that the said funds of Rs 132.22 crores which were 

deployed were lost or not repaid. Prosecution ought to have produced 

the said fact on record as• to what happened thereafter in order to 

_j

make the record straight. 
Obvious inference therefore has to be 

drawn. It is a matter of record that the entire amount was repaid to 

OIDB alongwith interest and, as such, no loss was caused to the OIDB. 

None of the witnesses who was examined from the Syndicate Bank 

stated that any loss was caused to the Syndicate Bank. Prosecution, 

therefore, has miserably failed in establishing the charge of criminal 

conspiracy to commit an offence of criminal breach of trust by accused 

No.l and accused No.2 or the substantive charge of criminal breach of 

trust against accused No.1 Accordingly, point Nos. 1 and 2 are 

answered in the negative. 

36. 

So far as 3rd and 4th charge is concerned, prosecution has not 

proved that 62000 shares from the promoters' quota of FGIL and its 

sister concern M/s Fair Growth Financial Services Ltd were transferred 

in the name of accused No.1 or in the name of his family members. 

The 3rd and 4th charge read as under:-

"THIRDLY, 
that in pursuance to the said 

conspiracy you Accused No.l, as a motive 

and/ or reward for causing the aforesaid 

wrongful gain to accused No.2 and/or his said 

company, dishonestly obtained in your name 

and in the name of your fa mily members of 

62,000 shares from promoters' quota of the

79 

FGIL and its sister concern the Fairgrowth 

Financial Services Ltd., and you have thereby 

committed offences punishable under sections 

13(1) (d) read with section 13(2) and section 7 

of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988." 

"FOURTHLY, that you Accused No.2 instigated 

and abetted accused No.1 in obtaining the said 

62000 shares by way of motive/reward for 

enabling you and/or your said company to 

make the aforesaid wrongful gain of Rs 

93,17,77,925/-
and 
you 
have 
thereby 

committed an offence punishable under section 

12, Prevention of Conuption Act, 1988." 

37. 
In order to establish that accused Nos. 1 and 2 had committed an 

offence as charged under 3 
rd 
and 
4rh 
charge, it was necessaiy to 

establish that the FGIL and its sister concern M/s. Fair Growth 

Financial Services Ltd had transferred the aforesaid 62000 shares from 

its promoters' quota in favour of accused No. I and his family members . 

Unfortunately, prosecution has miserably failed in establishing the said 

charge since it has not been proved that the said shares were, in fact, 

transferred in the name of accused No.1 or his family members. All 

those documents which were marked as X-1 to X-14 have not been 

proved and, therefore, these documents could not be exhibited. The 

relevant witness who could prove the contents of the said documents 

and who was the author of the said documents was not examined by

the prosecution. Prosecution witness viz Investigating Officer who had 

produced these documents in the search conducted as per search 

warrant dated 05/04/ 1994, did not identify the signatures and 

handwriting of the said persons who prepared the documents and, as a 

result, though the search warrant was brought on record alongwith 

these documents, the relevant documents were not proved and, 

therefore, are not the part of the record. Prosecution, therefore, is not 

in a position to establish that these shares which were seized pursuant 

to the search warrant which was issued were, in fact, transferred in the 

name of accused No. I or his family members. That being the position, 

the 3rd and 4 th charge has not been established by the prosecution and 

the accused Nos. 1 and 2, therefore, have to be acquitted of the said 

charge which is levelled against them. It has to be noted here that, 

though ample opportunity was given to the prosecution to examine the 

said witness, in spite of diligent efforts being made by the prosecution, 

they were unable to examine the said witness. Points Nos. 3 and 4 

are, therefore, answered in the negative. 

38. 
I have already indicated hereinabove that documents which 

are marked at X-1 to X-14 for identification, though it was a very 

important piece of evidence for the purpose of showing that certain

81 

favours were received by accused No.1 and to that extent to show his 

involvement in the said matter, have not been proved at all. As a 

result, documents at marked at X-1 to X-14 cannot be read in evidence. 

The search warrant dated 04/05/1994 has been proved and is at 

Exhibit-134 and 135. However, the documents which were seized and 

are at serial Nos. 1 to 18 in the report, however, could not be proved 

as P.W. 15 -Sushil Prasad Singh who has made the panchanama has 

stated that certain documents were seized by S.S. Nair, Deputy 

Superintendent of Police from the residence of accused No.1. He has 

stated that when these documents were seized, he was not connected 

with the investigation of the case. He has further stated that when 

these documents were seized during the course of investigation and D-

52 to D-57 were signed by the witnesses. He has stated that, however, 

he was not in a position to identify the signatures of these witnesses. 

He has also stated that he cannot identify the signature of Vineet 

Suchanti. The documents 0-52 to D-57 were seized during the search 

of residence of accused No.1 at Bangalore on 06/05/1994. 

Prosecution has neither examined the author of these documents 

which are marked as X-1 to X-14, nor have they examined any person 

who could identify the signature of the various signatories. As a result, 

all these documents not being proved, no inference can be drawn that

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:40:17 ::: 


82 

shares of FGIL were transferred in favour of accused No.1 and the 

members of his family as a motive or reward and, therefore, I have 

already held that point Nos. 3 and 4 have not been proved by the 

prosecution. 

3� . 

As a result of the above discussion, it is clear that no case has 

been made out against the present accused and the accused are liable 

to be acquitted. 

\.+o. At this stage, it would be appropriate to make a reference to the 

assistance which is given to this Court by the Special Public Prosecutors 

Mr. V.G. Pradhan and Mr. R.S. Mhamane who have taken great efforts 

to put up the case of the prosecution and without their assistance, it 

would not have been possible for this Court to decide this case. 

41. 
Accordingly, the fo llowing order is passed:-

ORDER 

In the result, both the accused are acquitted of the offences 

with which they were charged. Their bails bonds stand cancelled.
