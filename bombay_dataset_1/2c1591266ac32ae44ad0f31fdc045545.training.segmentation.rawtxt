Mumbai of Andhra Bank during the period from the year 1990 to 1992. Accused 

No.3 was the Shares and Stock Broker operating from Mumbai. An dhra Bank is a 

Nationalised Bank and the accused Nos. l <lnd 2, being employees of Andhra 

Blink, were public servant5. The Head Office of Anclhra Bank hcicl permitted the 

Manager -Funds at Mumbai to undertake the purchase and sale of securHies for 

i.rnd on beha lf of accused No.3 Hiten D;::bi on the comm . 
i ssion of .Rs.400/-µer 011e

worth about Rs.200 core cl1 ro ugh accuseci No.3 Hiten Dalal from Andlira Bunk, 

Canbank Mutual Fund and Standard Chartered Bank. The securities sold through 

Andhra Bank were in fact the securicies of accused No.3 Hiten Dalal and as per 

the permission granted by the Head Office, even though Hiten Dalal was shown 

broker, Andhra Bank had entered into transaction of sale of those securHies for 

and on behalf of Hiten Dalal. On 26.12.1991, accused No.3 Hiten Dalal was to 

repurchase certain securities worth Rs.1,29,02,29,400.69 from Grindlays Bank It 

was also necessary for Grindlays Bank to sell the securities and to raise money to 

ma in tain Cash Reserve RJtio (CRR) as per the directions of Reserve Bank of lnclia 

(RBI). However, on that d(ly, for want of sufficient funds, accused No.3 could not 

fulfill his commitment to repurchase lhe said seclirities from Grjndlays Bank and .. 

therefore, Grindlays Bank was in difficulty to maincain its CRR. As per the 

directions given by RBI,Nt:1tionalised �nd Scheduled Bnnks had to m.:iintain CRR 

by keeping certain percemage of their funds in deposit with RRI. If there •.vould 

be deficit in the said clcposH, the Bank couid borrow money at a short notice 

!mown as "Call TV1oney" and keep that amou nt in their account with Reserve 

Bank of lnd.ia and in case the amount of the Bank in deposit wi.th HBT would be in 

excess of the CRR Jimit, it could advance or lend the said excess mone y by 

issuing the cheques against Reserve Bank an<l thus earn profit. No Bank could 

borrow call money except for thC' purpose of maintaining CRR and in no case ic

could be for the purpose of any customer or broker nor any broker could be 

involved in cal.I money borrowing or lending transactions. As per the funds 

position of Andhra Bank, the head office of Andbra Bank at Hyderabad had 

instructed the f\1anager-Funds, Fort Branch at Mumbai to borrow amount of Rs.SO 

crore on 26.12.1991 to maintain che CRR and accordingly, the Mumbai Branch of 

Andhra Bank had borrowed amounl of Rs.40 crore from Bank of J ndia and Rs.10 

crore from Canbonl< Mutual Fund with interest at 8% per annum. The decisions 

for borrO\•v.ing or lending call money could be taken only by the Chairman and 

Managing Director of Andhra Bank and in his absence, by the next senior-mosL 

officer and only after communication of such decisio ns, the action could be taken 

by the Manager -Funds at Mumbai m borrow or ]end ca.11 money. Without such 

instructions from the head office, the officers at Mumbai could not borrow or lend 

<1ny call money. However, in this ccise, when on 26.12.1991, the accused No.3 

was unable lo arrange funds 10 pmchase securities from Grindlays Bank, to help 

him accused Nos. 1 and 2 borrowed amount of Rs.130 crore as call money from 

Canara Bank and immediately transferred the said funds to Grindlays Bank by 

issuing a pay order without any instructons or authorisatjon from the Head Office. 

For the whole day on 26.12.1991, the officers of the Grindlays Bank were trying 

lo materia!.ise the transaction of sale of securities, but it could not be. On 

27.12.1991, the amount of Rs.130 cron:' received from Andhra Bank on 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:44:31 ::: 


5 

Spl-C1se-1-l998.sxw 

26.12.1991 was treated as call money borrowing and on the same day, the said 

amount was repaid to Andhra Bank. In the d ocuments prepared by the accused 

Nos. 1 and 2, about call money len t to Grindlays Bank, the rate of 1nterest was 

shown to be 14%. However, Grindlays Bank had never agreed to pay interest at 

the rate of 14%. It issued the Call Money Bank Receipt on 27.12.1991 shmving 

the rate of .interest to be paid at 10% per annum. Grindlays Bank repaid the 

amount of Rs.130 crore to Andhra Bank on 27.12.1991 along with interest at 10% 

per annum. In vie\"' of this, the acc used persons made changes in their books 

about rate of interest from 14% to 10% and ba!Jnce amount of 4% was debited to 

the account of accused No.3. However, false debit note was prepared to indicc1te 

that the amount was received as commission on the transaction of sale of 

se curities for accused No.3. 

According to prosecution, the tr<1nsaction of 

borrowing of Rs.130 crore call money from Canara Bank by accused Nos. 1 and 2 

was wHhout any authority from the head office etnd as jt was not necessary for the 

purpose of maintenance of CRR of Andhra Bank, it was iliegal and irregula r. 

Similarly, 

advancing of that money immediately to Grindlays Bank w help 

accused No.3, a stock broker, in fulfillment of his commitment with Grindlays 

Bank, was also illegal and against the policy of borrowing or lending call money 

and again it was withouc any uuthoriry or permission or in�truction from the head 

office of .Anclhra Bank. A. s these: transcictions \-verc entered into by ilCcused 1'1os. 1

and 2 £0 help the Jccused No.3, und lo obrnin pecuniary advantage to him, it 

amounted to misuse of their office as public servants with the Nationalised Bank 

and, therefore, they committed these offences. 

3. 

During the year 1992, it lrnd < ome to rhe notice of the Government of 

India and Reserve Bank that sever a•I irregularitles and Hlegalities were committed 

in the Bzmks and the Financial Institutions. Therefore, Jankir:aman Com mittee 

was constituted. Jankiraman Committee looked into the transactions of dHferent 

Banks and \•vherever there were any suspicious transactions, investigation� were 

made . For chis purpose, 8Jnks Securities Cell was constituted in the CBI. Later 

on, its nomenclature vvas changed as Banks Securities anci Fraud Cei!. After the 

preliminury enquiry of the rransJct. ions perti:lining to the present case; S.P. Paladie:, 

the then Superintendent of Police 'vvhh Ban k scam nnd Fraucl Celi of CBI at 

Mumbai, registered FIR N. RC-4/BSC/1993/BOM. and rhe matcer WC1S handed 

over to che Inspector Satyapalsingh for further investigatjon. After transfer of 

Inspector Satyapa]singh, the investigation was entrusted co Inspector Sanjay 

K. Sareen . A final report for cl osure was prepa red by lnspector Satyopnlsingh ancl 

same report was signed by the Inspector Sareen and was submitted to the Special 

court However, that report was not accepted by the learned Special Judge Mr. 

Justice Variav': {as His Lordship t:1en was) and he directed further investigation.

Spl-Case-1-1998.sxw 

After funher invesligation, Inspector Sareen came to conclusjon that offences 

\Vere commiccecl by the accused persons. After obtaining necessary sanction for 

prosecution of accused Nos. 1 and 2, he filed charge-sheet. Initially, charge-sheet 

was filed against six persons. Accused Nos. 4, 5 an d 6 were the concerned 

officers and staff members of ANZ Grindlays Bank. However, later on, accused 

Nos. 4, 5 and 6 werr discharged as no materiu! was foun d against rhem. 

4. 
Against accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3, charges vide Exhibit 1 were framed 

CJS stated above. Each of them pleaded not guilty. The plea of the accused persons 

is that accused No.3 was to repurchase the securities from Grincllays Bank on 

26.12.1991. However, on thar day, sufficient funds were nol ava.ilabJe in his 

account and, therefore, the said transactions could not be materalised. 

As 

Grjndlays Bank was in need of the amount co mtlintilin its CRH, ir was badly in 

need of Rs.130 crore and, therefore, on the request of Grine.Bays Bilnk, Andhr<1 

Bank lent amount of Rs.130 crore as call money. For this purpose, accused Nos. L 

and 2 were orally instructed by the hcticl offlce nt Hy de rabad to borro'"' Rs.130 

crore as call money and to .lend rhe same to Grind lays Bank. Therefore, accused 

Nos. 1 and 2 borrowed Rs.130 crore c;:ill money from Canara Bank on in terest at 

the rate of 11 % per annu m and lent the Sllrnc to Gr ind lays Bcink at 14% per 

annum. However, as Grindlays Bank was not willing to pay 14% and paid only

Spl-C�se-1-1�98.Sx\v 

10% per ann um interest, balance amount of inreres r .'.lt the rate of 4% per annum 

was debHed to the account of accused No.3. In these transactions, Andhra Bank 

earned profit. Accused No.3 djd not earn anything. In fact, he had to pay 

difference of interest at 4% per annum because he had agreed to compensate 

Grindlays Bank as he could not fulfill the commitment of purchasing the 

securities on that day.

It is proved by the prosecution evidence and it is also an admitted 

face that Andhra Bank having lts head office at Hyderabad is a Nationalized Bank. 

It has branches at different places, including at Fort, Mumbai. Accused No.1 

R.Dhankumar was the Manager, Funds Department at the Fort Branch, Mumbai of 

Andhra Bank and accused No.2 S. P.Kamath was working as Deparcment Officer 

in the Funds Department at the Fort Branch. Accused No.3 -Hiten DaJaJ was the 

share 

and stock broker and he also used to enter into his own securities 

transactions. 

The evidence of PW-1 J. Sambasiva Sastry, who was working as 

Chief Officer, Central Accounts Department at the Head Off ice, Andhra Bank, 

shows that Rese1ve Bank of India had prescribed Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) for 

Scheduled Commercial Banks under Section 42 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 

1934 and Statutory Li quidi ty Ratio ( SLR) under Secti on 24 of the Banking

Spl-Casc-l-1998.sxw 

Regulation Act, 1949. CRR may be varying from 3% to 15%. CRR is a statutory 

deposit or reserve to be maintained with RBI at a certain percentage of the total 

demand and time liability of the Bank as on the lase Friday of 2nd preceding 

fortnight. SLR may vary from 25o/o to 40% as may be prescribed by RBI from 

time to time on net demand and time liabilj ty of the Bank as on last Fri day of the 

2ncJ preceding fortn ight. SLR is in addition to CRR and it m eans total securWes 

in the form of gol d, cash and unencumbered approved securities . 

The 

Deparunental Officer atta ched to the Funds and Investment Depart ment of Central 

accounts Department at Head Office of Andhra Bank collects the balances 

mainrained ar 
RBI b ra nches and prepares i.l daily sta{ement indicating 

consolidi.Hed position of funds mainwined at the RBI, the requirement of CRR to 

be maintained as per RBI guidelines and to nrrive at the position of deficit or 

surplus for the concerned fortnight. The data is collected from all the RBI 

branches all over India \"1here Andhra Bank is ma intaining the account with RBI. 

The Departmental Officer submits the stat ement so prepi1red to the Deputy Chief 

Officer of the Funds department and after scrutiny by the Depu ty Chief Officer, 

the state1nent 

is to be submitted to the Chief Officer, Central accounts and

During the relevant period, PW-1 Sambasiva Sastry was che only Chief Officer 

and PW-2 N. Ramesh v.'as the Deputy Chief Officer, Central Accounts department 

at Hyderabad. PW-1 Samasiva Sastry further explained that deficit in CRR 

means shortage in deposits with RBI than the prescribed limit of CR R and surplus 

means the reserves with RBJ exceed the prescribed CRR. If there is deficit, the 

head office \vould communicate the same to the Ma nager, Funds Bombay and 

direct him to borrO\ . v call money and then such borrowed caJl money is kept with 

RBT to maintain the prescribed CRR. Call money is borrowed only for overnighr 

and next day that amount has to be repaid from the funds generated by deposits or 

from receipts from the debtors of the Bank. Cail money may be borro\•ved frorn 

other Scheduled commercial Banks or rimmcial lnstitulions and not from privJte 

patties. When the reserves of the Bank with RBI exceed the CRR limit, the 

surplus or the excess money may be lent in the market to generate profits for the 

Bank. He also deposed that for the purpose of borro•...;ing or ]ending call money, 

instruction s were required to be t.:iken from rile Chairnrnn and Managing Di rector 

of the Bank and on ly if he would nor be civailable, instrucrions could be obtnined 

from the next higher authority then available. There was no de]egation of pm-•,1ers

complied and same was noted in the statem ent dated 27 .12.1991. The statement 

dated 27.12.1991 also shows that there was surplus of Rs.10 crore and the

of nine differem companies from Andhra Bank, Canbank Mutua] Fund and 

Standard Chartered bank through accused No.3 Hilen Dalal vide his contract note 

dated 20.11.1991. The value of these securities was about Rs.200 crore. Exhibits 

126 lO 153 are the documents pertaining to purchase of the securities by Grindlays 

Bank from Andhra Bank on 20.11.1991. These documents are proved by PW-8 

Ganesh Karnath and that part of evidence has gone unchallenged. Admittedly, the 

said securities were actually of uccused No.3 Hi ten 0Jlal and though as per the 

contract note and other documents, Andhra Bank was selhng the securit. ies and 

Hiten Dalal was the broker, in fact, Hiten Dalal himself was owner of those 

securities and Andhra Bank had entered into the said transactions for Hicen Dalal. 

It is an 1.1dmitted fact that Andhra Bank Head Office had issued instructions for 

operation of security transac(ions for constituents at Fort Branch Mumbai on 

5.12.1990. Exhibit 8 are the sLJid instruct ions As per clause 17 of the same, the 

rransactions in case of Hiten Dalal be GHTied out. However, in case other clien(s, 

the Bombay Branch had to obtain prior permission fron1 the Zonal manager, 

Bombay under intimation to Central Office. It clearly indicated that the Bombay 

Branch Office could enter into transactions of securities on behalf of .Hiten Daial

was maintaining his account No.4819 with the Fort Branch of Andhra Bank. In 

view of th is, chere is no dispute that the transactions could be entered into by the 

Fort Branch of Andhra Bank on behalf of accused No.3 Hiten Dalal and for such 

transactions the Bank could collect commission at the rate of Rs.400/-per one 

crore. 

11. 

Evidence on record reveals and it is admitted by accused No.3 that 

on 26.12. 1991, he was to repurchase certain securities from G ri ndlays Bank. The 

value of said securities was to be Rs.1.,29,02,29,400.69. The evidence shows 

that Grincl l ays Bank was in immediate need of chac amount too maincain its CRR 

on that day. Evidence of py,1_7 Akash Rukhaiyar, PW-8 Ganesh Kamath and 

PV/-11 Sri ker Rao Kha rnba dkone reveals that on 26.12.1991, G rindlays Bank was 

to enter imu transaction for saJe of Lhe securities to Andhra Bank through broker 

Hiten Dalal and for that purpose, Deal Slips were prep ared by the from office and 

were transmitted to the back offic e and on the basis of the instructions given 

from fronl office, the back office also prepared Deal Slips for th.is purpose:. 

However, the transactions for sale of those securiti es could not be materialised on 

that day. Exhibits 93 to 125, 160 to 180 Mid Exhibits 186 to 192 are the Dea.I

these Deal Slips were prepared/generated from 11.51 co 12.21 hrs. ExhibHs 93 

and 94 are about the same transaction. Exhibit 93 Dea] Slip was prepared by the 

front offke and Exhibit 94 Deal Slip was prepi:tred by back office. Exhibits 94, 97,

there is an endorsement " Please reverse as on 26/12" and on the remaining deal 

shps, there is endorsement "Please reverse". It indicates that aJI these Deal Slips 

from Exhibits 93 to 112 and 121 to 123 were required to be reversed. However, 

the words '"Please reverse as of 26112" i ndjcates that the order for reversal must 

not have been passed on 26.1 2. 1991 . , but on some l ater date. The evidence 

r�veais tha t such instructions must have been given on the next day i.e. 27.12.91.

cancelled and again prepared and as per the evidence, the transaction of sale of 

the said securities by Gr.indlays Bank could not be materialised and finally, the 

said transactions were called off, evidence of PW-4 Hemlata, PW-5 K.D.Prabhu 

and PW-6 Kuppuswamy Basker shows that amount of Rs.100 crore was advanced 

by Canara Bank co Andhra Bank at 1 p.m. and further amount of Rs.30 crore was 

advanced by Canara Bank to Andhra Bank at 2 p.m. on that day. That amount was

15. 
From the evidence of the officers from Grindlays Bank and che 

documents noted above, it is clear that initiaJly on 26.12.1991, from 11 a.m. itself 

a deal for sale of securities by Andhra Bank to Grindlays Bank was in the offing. 

Even though the securities were co be purchased by accused No.3 Hiten Dalal, on 

the deal slips prepared by Grindlays Bank, naturaJly, as per instructions and talk 

wich the officers of Andlua Bank, Andhra Bank was shown to be purchaser of 

those securities, while accused No.3 Hi ten Dalal was shown only as a broker. 

There would be no illegality in that transaction even though undertaken in the 

name of Andhra Bank because there were standing instructions from (he head 

office that the Fort Branch, Mumbai could undertake the securities transactions of 

accused No.3 Hilen Dalal, for which Andhra Bank was to charge commission. 

However, at the same time, it v,1as also known to the accused persons that on 

26.12.1991, sufficjenl funds were not available jn the account of accused No.3 

ma intained with Andina Bank and therefore he was nae i n a position to make 

payment and to purchase the securities. It appears that taking into consideration 

this position, accused Nos. 1 and 2 borrowed amount of Rs. 130 crore as ca. ll 

money from Canara Bank and the amount was also paid by them to Grind!Jys 

Bank by aboul 2 p. m. on tht1t day. From lhe ev.idence noted above, it is also 

estt.1blished thnt the pay order issued by the accused Nos. 1 and 2 on behalf of 

Andhra Bank and in favour of Grindlays Bank was also submitted for realisation

25 

Spl-Cise-J-1998.sxw 

at or before 2.15 p.m. as that was the time before wMch the cheques and pziy 

orders could be submitted for realisation. As per the evidence of PW-13 Rahu.I 

Ghate, the pay order from Andhra Bank was not accompanied or supported by any 

document and, therefore, it was not clear for what purpose zind on what account 

amount of Rs.130 crore was pad by Andhra Bank to Grindlays Bank. In the given 

circumstances, there remains no doubt that this amount of Rs.130 crore was paid 

by Andhra Bank co Grindlays Bank £0\1\iards the deal of purchase of securitjes on 

beh alf of accused No.3 Hiten Dc:lal from GrindJays Bank. 

However, it is 

mysterious and not clear \.. .,rhy the deal of these securities could not be finaIJy 

materialised on that clay inspire of t.he fact that amount of Rs. 130 crore was 

already paid by A.ndhra Bank to Gri ndlays Bank. 

16. 
As as per the funds position as proved by PW-1 Sambasiva Sastry 

<:fnd PW-2 N. Ramesh, with the help of documents Exhibits 27, 28 and 29, rhe 

heud office of Andhra Bank had directed the Funds Manager, Fort Brcinch 3t 

Mumbai ro borrO\•V amount of Rs.SO crore as call money to maintain CRR and 

these di rections were actua l ly nored in the statement of daily pos.ition of CRR E;.,: . 

27 and compliance thereof is a1so noted in the daily position of CRR as on 

26. 12. 1991 vide Exh.28. 
These statements of daily position of CRR were 

maintained in the Central Office of Andhra Bank. On 26.12.1991, after borrowi ng

Spl-Case-1-1998.sxw 

amount of Rs.10 crore from Canbank Mutual Fund and Rs.40 crore from Bank of 

India for maintenance of CRR, in view of certa in oth er deposits wHh and non 

payment by Andhra Bank, Andhra Bank was in excess of funds and, therefore, on 

27.12.1991, che Central Office of Andhra Bank advised the Bombay Office to lend 

amount of Rs.10 crore to the British Bank. This is also noted in ExhibH 28. On 

27. 12. 1991, amount of Rs.10 crore was lent lO the British Bank of Middle East 

and amount of Rs.20 crore was Jent to Hongkong Bank as per the funds position 

register for the period from 14.12. 1991 to 27.12. 1991 vide Exhibit 29. Exhibit 30 

is the statement of interest of call money paid. There are entrjes dated 26.12.1991 

to show thac amount of Rs.40 crore was borrowed from Bank of India anti Rs. 10 

crore was borrowed from Canbank Mutual Fund at the rate of 8% per mrnum 

interest and the interest credited to the accounts of those Banks are also mentioned 

in Exhibit 30. The evidence of PW-1 Sambasiva Sastry and PW-2 N. Ramesh 

clearly goes to prove that there were instruccions to the Fort Branch, Mumbai to 

borrow only C1mount of Rs.SO crore as call money on 26.12.1991 to maintain the 

CRR. According co them, there were no instructions to the Fort Branch, Mumbai 

to borrow Rs.130 crore as calJ money from Canara Bank or to lend or advance the 

same to Grindlays Bank. In the kuchha register Ex.58 maintained by P\Al-4 

1-lemlata Na.ir at Fort Office, tliere were two entries of call money borrowed frorn 

Canbank Mutual Fund and Bank of India and below that amount total was carried 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:44:31 :::

as Rs.SO crore. However, later on, the tocal "SO Cr" was struck off and then there 

was an addition of following words "Canara 11% 130 er" indkating that amount 

of Rs.130 crore was borrowed from Canara Bank as call money at 11 % per 

annum interest and below that entry total was again drawn as 180 Crore. In front 

of these entries, the interests were also calculated and shown 
on the said 

borrowings. Below these entries and at the bottom, there was endorsement "Call 

Money Lent Grindlays Bank @ 14% Rs.130 crs" showing that amount of Rs.130 

crore was lent to Grindlays Bank as call money and the interest rate was 14% per 

annum. These entries were taken in the kuchha register Article "B" (Exhibit 58). 

These entries were taken by PW-4 Hemlata Nair as per instructions given by 

accused No.2 S.P.Kamath as per her evidence. 

17. 

It has come in the evidence of PW-2 N. Ramesh that he also used to 

maintain a kuchha register on which whatever information was received on 

telephone used to be noted down by him so that he would not forget the 

information received on phone. On 27.12.1991, in the kuchha register Article "A" 

mainta.ined by him, there were notings indicating that amount of Rs.130 crore at 

11 % was repaid and same amount which was lent was recalled. This entry 

pe1tains to the transaction of amount borrowed from Canara bank at 11 % and lent 

to GrindJays Bank at 14%. This entry indicates that the amount lent to Grindlays

Bank was recalled and was repajd to Canarll Bank. This noting is marked Exhibit 

32. Il is material to note that this kuchha regi ster was not officjalJy maintajned by 

N. Ramesh as a record of any instructions. In face, according to him, he only used 

to note down the compliances and this indicated that on 27.12.1991, the 

transaction of repayment to Canara Bank and recall:ing the amount from 

G ri ndlays Bank \•vas completed and this was informed to him on telephone and 

therefore he had noted it. 
The learned CounseJ for the accused vehemently 

contended that this ent ry Exhibit 32 indicutes that the amount of Rs.130 crore \• v Js 

borrcvveci from Canara Bank and Jent to Grimilays Bank and then it \•Vas recaii r:cl 

from Grindla y s Bank and repaid to Canara Bank as per instructions given from the 

head office and, therefore, the accused persons had reported compJiance on 

27.12.1991. This is den ied by PW-2 N.Ramesh. According to him, there was 

inslruction only to borrow Rs.SO crore as call money to ma intain CRR and this .is 

dul y supported by several documents noted above. There is no document 

maintained at the head office of And hra Bank to show that any instructions 'vv ere 

given to the Fund Manager, Fort Branch to borrow Rs. 130 crore as call money 

from Canara Bank and to lend it to Grindlnys Bank. It has been proved by Pv\ 7-1

Spl-Case-1-1998.sxw 

call money could not be boITowed for any other purpose. Therefore, it must be 

held that Rs.130 crore could not be borrowed as call money because the purp ose 

of maintaining CRR was served by borrowing amount of Rs.SO crore as per 

instructions given by the head office. Admi ttedly, amount of Rs.130 crore was not 

required to maintain the CRR nor that amount was kept in Andhra Bank account 

maintained with RBI for such purpose. 

18. 
From the record, it is proved that Canara Bank lent Rs. 100 crore to 

Andhra Bank at 1 p.m. and further lent amount of Rs.30 crore to Andhra Bank by 

2 p.m. Thus, by 2 p.m., Andhra Bank had received amount of Rs.130 crore as call 

money and immediately that amount was paid to Grindlays Bank by pay order 

without any document to show for what purpose that amount was paid by Andlira 

Bank to Grindlays Bank. From this evidence, it is clearly established that amount 

of Rs. 130 crore was borrowed by accused Nos. 1 and 2 from Canara Bank as caJI 

money without any instructions from the head office and certainly not for the 

purpose of maintainjng the CRR and thus there was violation of the directions not 

only from Reserve Bank but a]so fr om the head office of Andhra Bank. The said 

amount of Rs.130 crore having been borrowed from Canara Bank as call money 

was advanced to Grindlays Bank clearly to meet the habil.ity of accused No.3 as 

he had a commitment with GrindJ ays Bank to purchase the securities on that day,

30 

Spl-Case-J -1998.sxw 

though the transaction was to be in the name of And hra Bank and he was to be 

shown only as a broker . The evidence on record clearly show that talks about the 

deal of th ese securities continued till lace in the evening of 26.12.1991 and, 

therefore, number of ti mes the deal slips were prepared and cancelled and last deal 

slips were prepared at 18.48 hrs. indicating that the transaction was to tak e effect. 

However, it was not finalised. PW-13 Ralrnl Ghate from Grindlays Bank deposed 

that till in the evening he had repeatedly asked PW-14 Pankaj Kazi as to , .. ,hac 

was to be done to the deal, but he was asked to wajt. He clearly deposed that on 

27. 12. 1991, he was instructed by PW-14 Pan kaj Kazi that the deal was called off 

and the amount of Rs.130 crore received from Andina Bank be tre<.1ted as call 

money borrO\•ved and that is how the first document generaced in the Gri nd lays 

Bank about the call money borrowi ng of Rs.130 crore was at 13.55 hrs. on 

27.12. 1991 vide Exh1bits 156 and 157. On these two deaJ slips of cal money 

borrowing, deal date is shown as 27. 12.1991, but the value date is 26.12.1991. 

P\ . V-13 Rahul Ghate explained that the value date indicates the d�;te of actual 

recejpt of money, while che deal elate shows the actual date of deal. Thus, as per 

Exhibits 156 and 157, the deal of call money borrowing had taken place on 

27.12.1991 at 13.55 hrs. but the value date was 26.12.1991 wh i ch shows that the 

amount of Rs.130 crore was received by Grindlays Bank from Andhra Bank on 

26.12.1991. lt means that on 26.12.1991 <1nd till at about 13.55 hrs. en

Spl-Case-J-1998.sxw 

27.12. 1991, Grindlays Bank was not awure that the amount was lent to it as a call 

money borrowing though the amount was received by it on 26.12.1991 itself. 

During that period, the amount was lying in a suspense account with Grindlays 

Bank and after caJl money deal was entered into, the amounc was treated as call 

money borrm•ving and within a sho11 time i.e. 16.28 hrs. this amount was repaid to 

Andhra Bank as per deal slips Exhibits 1 58 and 159. All these documents dearly 

go to shuw that on 26.12.1991, the accused Nos. 1 and 2 issued the pay order of 

Rs.130 crore in favour of Grindlays Bank not as call money lent but apparently 

towards the value of the securities transaction of accused No.3 Hiten Dalal. 

However, it is not clear why i nspite of having made payment to Grind)ays Bank, 

the security transactions were not finalised till late in the evening or till the nexr 

day morning itself and why the sa.id deal of securities transactions was caJled off. 

It is possible that the accused No.3, who was a big broker and whose transactions 

were ru nning into hundreds of crores every day, did not find it profitable to 

finalise the deal and the security transaction was, therefore, called off and thus the 

amount of Rs.130 crore pai d by Andhra Bank to Grindlays Bank was created as 

ca.ll money lent.

have been entrusted to them, the accused Nos. 1 and 2, as the officers of Andhra 

Bank, 
illegally and without any authority, devjated that amount towards the 

payment to Grindlays Bank on account of the deal of securities transactions of 

Hiten Dalal. This amounted to crindnal breach of trust. The said criminal breach 

of trust was temporary for one day because that amount was received back by 

Andhra Bank and also repaid by Andhra Bank to Canara Bank on the next day. 

This was done fra udulently and dishonestly for the advantage of the accused No.3 

because accused No.3, who was a big broker and also 
dealer in securities 

transactions running into hundreds of c:rores, had to maintain his own standing and 

credib1lity in the market and if the amount would not have been paid to Grindlay� 

Bank on that day inspite of the commitment by him, he would lose the credib.ility 

and standing in the market which could adversely affect his business in future 

and, therefore, even though no apparem finnncial gain or advantage was received 

by him out of Lhis trnnsaction, it would give him financial advantage in the long 

run in running the business. 

20. 
lt is clearly established that there \'\1ere no instructions from the head 

office of Andhra Bank to the Fort Branch to borrow Rs.130 crore as call money 

from the Canara Bank nor there was any authorHy to lend the said amount as call 

money to Grindlays Bank. Therefore� the riccused Nos. J and 2 had no authority

K.D.Prabhn and PW-6 Kuppuswamy Bas kar, it is proved tliat on 26.12.1991 Cit 

about 1 p.m. on request of Andhra Be:rnk, Cana ra Bank lent amount of Rs.100

A ndhra Bank. From the side of Andhru Bank, Fort Branch, 'iviumbai, a debit

Spl-Case-1-1998.sxw 

from Canara Bank. It was signed by accused No.2 S.P.Kamath. Exhibit 66 js a 

credit voucher in favour of Andhra Bank for the said amount. P. W.4 Hemlaca Nair 

deposed that because the signature on Exh.66 is below the stamp of Andhra Bank, 

she was unable to state whose signature it was. However, if the signature on Exh. 

66 is carefuJJy seen, it appears to be of accused No.2 S.P. Karnath which is similar 

to his signature on Exhibit 6 5 and several other signatures whkh are proved to be 

of accused No.2. Exhibit 68 is a caJI money receipr of Rs.130 crore which bears 

signatures of accused Nos. l and 2 both. It was issued to Canara Bank against the 

amount received. As the accused Nos. 1 and 2 had no authority to borrow the 

amount as call money, they also did not have authority from Andhra Bank or from 

superior officers at head office of Andhra Bank to prepare and execute any of 

these documents. By executing these documents, they represented to Canara Bank 

that they had an authority from Andhra Bank or the head office of Andhra Bank co 

borrow call money to the tune of Rs.130 crore and thus fraudulently they made 

Canara Bank officers to enter into the contract to lend Rs.130 crore as call money. 

This was the false representation and false documents were prepared by them 

with out any authority and, therefore, they committed forgery. Similarly, credit 

voucher Ex. 71 about the amount of Rs.130 crore as call money lent to Grindlays 

Bank, indjcating that the cheque was issued to Grindlays Bank as call money lent, 

was signed by accused Nos. 1 and 2 both. This document was also executed by

Spl-Case-1-1998.sxw 

accused Nos. 1 and 2 falsely and without any authority from Andhra Bank or the 

head office of Andhra Bank to lend amount of Rs.130 crore. It appears that 

though this credit vouch er bears the elate 26.12.1 991, this document must have 

been create d on 27.12. 1991 because till lc;te in the evening on 26.12.1991, the 

staff of Gr indlays Bank \•Vas not aware that the nmoum of Rs.130 crore received 

from Andhra Bank was towards call money lenr by An<lhra Bank and borrowed 

by Grindlays Bank. On 27.12.1991, at about 1.55 p.rn., PW-13 Rahul Ghate, for 

the first time, got instructions that the am ount received was to be treated as call 

money borrowed and accordingly, he generated the deal tickets. It means just 

shortly before that the credit voucher Exh. 71 must have been prepared jn Andhrn 

Bank. Though this document indicated that the document was executed by 

accused Nos. 1 and 2 on behalf of and under the authority of Canara Bank, they 

had no such authorily to lend the money. It is a lso material to note that the cheque 

of Rs. 130 crore was dellvered by AndhrJ Bank to Grind lays Bank on 26.12. 199 i. 

withom obraining any call m011ey receipt. On 27. 12.1991, at 13.58 hrs., Gr1ndl2ys

that amount was received on 26.12.91. Execution of these documents clearly 

show that the offence of forgery punishable under Sec. 465 of JPC was committed

though this credit voucher bears the date 26.12.1991, this document must have

21. 

lt is clear from the evidence, [hat on 26.12.1991, there was no deal 

with Grindlays Bank to lend the amount as call money. On 27.12.1991, documents 

about the same were prepared. Exhibit 71 is the credit voucher for the call money 

l ent to Grind) ays Bank. It shows that rate of interest was to be 14% per annum. 

However, it appea rs that Grindlays Bank did not agree with interest at 14% and 

issued the call mon<.:>y deposjc receipt Ex. 74A in v.rhkh the rate of interest was 

shown to be 10%. Jn the kuchha register Ex.58, PW-4 Hemlata Nair had notecl 

about i.HTIOLmt of Rs.130 crore Js call money lent to Grindlays Bank at 14% per 

annum in terest. Il was noted by her ot the bottom of the page for 26.12.1991. In 

the statement of Current Accounc showing the call money lent, there is one entry 

dated 26.12.1991 which shows that amount of Rs.1.30 crore t. "J as Jent to Grindlays 

Bank as cal l money and ra t e of .interest was jnitially 14%, but it appears ro have 

been changed tD 10%. Similarly, there is next entry on 27.12.91 whkh shmvs thi.lt 

call money lent to Grindlays Bank wa s received back. Here also i nitjally the 

interest rate was mentioned as 14%, but then it was changed to 10% and in the 

product col um n showing total amount of interest received, th ere appears some 

overwriting or correction. It appears that accused Nos. 1 and 2 had agreed to 

advance amount of Rs. 130 crore under the impressjon that Andhra Bank would be 

gerting interest at the rate of 14% per ;.innurr1 and accordingly the cred it voucher 

was issued, but Grindlays Bank refused to pay 14c Yo and therefo re these documents

were changed. Gri ncllays Bank paid interest at the rate of 10%. In view of this, 

there was a difference of 4% per annum. Towards the difference of the said 4% per 

annum, amount of Rs.1,42,466/-was debited to t'he account of accused No.3 Hiten 

Dalcll maintained with Andina Bank for which debit voucher Ex.9A was prepared 

by PW-4 Hemlala and signed by accused Nos. 1 C1nd 2. It is materia l to note that 

in the sa. i d debit voucher, it was shown to be amount of commis sion on sale and 

purchase of securi ties . There is also a debit entry in the Account No.4819 of 

accused No.3 Hiten DalaJ vide Exhibit 11. In that account also amount is debited 

as commission on sale. In fact, this could not have been a com m ission on sale. 

As stated earlier, as per standi ng instructions from the head office on securities 

transactions of Hiten Da lal and ocher brokers, commission of Rs.400/-per crore 

\11as to be charged. [n fact, in (he present cnse, the transuction of purchase cf 

securities of Rs.130 crores was not materialised. Had the said deal materialis2c1, 

And!ira Bank could have charged maximum nmounc of Rs.52,000/-towards 

commission from Hiten Dalal. The com mission cou1d not be Rs.1,42,466/-. 

PW-4 Hemlata Nair, after calculation, deposed on oath that this amount was 

equivalent to 4% per annum interest on the amount of Rs.130 crore. Finally, it is 

conceded bv the accused Nos. 1 and 2 that this amount was recovered as 

_, 

difference in the interest from tJccused No.3. 
Firstly, the above referred 

documents \. V ere falsified by makjng modificarfons and correcti ons in the

statement of account and documents. Secondly, the entry in the statement of 

account of the accused showing the amount of Rs.1,42,466/-as commission on 

sale and sim i]arl y tl1e debi t voucher Ex.9A to the same effect amounted to 

preparing false documents and it also amounts to forge ry. Thus, the offences 

punishable under Sections 465 and 477 A of IPC are also proved as against 

accused Nos. 1 and 2. 

22. 
I do not find any material to hold the accused persons guilty for the 

offence pun]shab]e under Sec. 411 of IPC nor rhe accused persons can be held 

guilty for the offence pu nishable under Section 202 of IPC. At the cime of 

argu ments, the Jearnecl Senior P.P. conceded that the accused were noc bouncl to 

give any information about the offence a llegedly committed by themselves as it 

would nmount to confession against themselves. Section 202 is applicable only 

when a person, who is lega l ly bound co give information, has got information of 

commission of certain offence ancl intentio!1aJly omits to give such information to 

the concerned authorities. Section 202 of IPC cannot be applicable ra the accust=:d 

persons who have committed the substantive offences. 

23. 
Taking the prosecution evi dence ht its tota Uty, it becomes clear that 

accused No.3 had a commitment with Grindlays Bank to purchase certain 

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 19:44:31 ::: 


39 

Spl-Case-1-1998.sxw 

securities for the amoum of Rs. 1,29,02,29,400.69 from Grindlays Bank. As 

Grindlays Bank was in need of che money to maincain the CRR, it was necessary 

for accused No.3 to fulfill that commitment to maintajn his standjng and 

credibility i n the market. However, he did not have money on that day. 

There fore, even though the Fort Branch of Andhra Bank had neither any 

instructions nor any authority from the head office to borrow amount of Rs.130 

crore as ca!J money, accused Nos. 1 and 2 borrow�d that amount as call money 

from Canara Bank on 26. 12.1991 and immediately made payment to Grjndlays 

Bank witho ut informing them for what purpose the amount was paid. Finally the 

deal about purchase of securities could not be materialised and it was called off, 

most probably on 27.12.1991 and on that day, the amount which \•Vas a lready paid 

by accused Nos. 1 and 2 on behalf of Andbrn Bank to Grindlays Bank was treated 

as call money lent lo Grincllays Bank and on that day, the officers of Grindlays 

Bank prepared documents to show that call money was borrowed from Andhra 

Bank. There is no material to show that there \•Vere any instructions from the head 

office to accused Nos. 1 and 2 to bonow the amount of Rs.130 crore as call money 

and then co lend the same to Grindlays Bank. They did it at their own level and in 

all probability, at the behest of accused no.3 Hicen Dalal. When Grindlays Bank 

refused co pay interest at 14% and pnid interest at the rate of 10%, Andhra Bank 

recovered the difference of 4% per annum interest from accused No.3 Hiten Dalal

by debiting the amount to his account. 

24. 
�.1r. Kale, l ea rn ed Counsel for accused No.3 contended that accused

14°/o interest on that money and thus earned a profit of 3% and thus Andhra Bank 

was al so benefited. Andhra Bank received 10% interest from Grindlays Bank and 

accused No.3 paid 4% per annum on the said amount to Andhra Bank and thus to 

the extent of 4% inlerest, which amounted to Rs. l,42,466/-, accused No.3 was pul 

to loss and therefore, it is contended that it cnnnot be said that any pecuniary 

advantage was caused to the accused No.3. Jt is true that no financial Joss was 

caused to Andhra Bank or to Grindlays Bank. In a way Andhra Bank earned profit 

at 3% per annum in this transaction. it is also true that accused N0.3 was required 

to pay amount of Rs. l,42,466/-to Andhra Bank in th is whole transe1ction even 

though the amount of loan \<\If.IS not actually enjoyed by him. However, the amounr 

of Rs.1 ,42,466/-\vas a smalJ amount for accused No.3, who had big deal$ and 

transactions running into hundreds of crores of rupees and, cherefore, it \Ni.IS 

necessary for him to fulfill his commitment co the Banks Jnd Financial 

Institutions. On that day, he was not in a position to fulfill the commitment cind 

had he failed to provide the money to Grjndlays Bank, his standh1g and credibility 

among the Banks and Financial Institutions would have been damaged and it 

would have adversely affected his business in the long nm. Payment of Rs. 

1,42,466/-was a smal l amount for him and even though it was a gain for Anclhra 

Bank, still the guin was at the cost of maintenance of high standJrds of the 

Banldi1g principles, rules, re g ulations and directives issued by Resen.'i.� Bank of

India under the R.B.1. Act. Therefore, I do nm find any force in the contention of 

the ]earned Cou nsel for the accused that no offence was committed. 

26. 
Ta king into consjderation an the materia.1 on record , I fi nd that

entered into conspiracy and as a result of that conspiracy, accused Nos. 1 and 2, in 

furtherance of their common committed the offences punishuble uncler 

Sections 409, 465 and 477 A of IPC. Both of them were \VOrking as employees of 

Andhra Bank and as such they were the public servants. By dishonestly and 

fraudulently misappropriating the amount even though temporarily, they 

committed the offence 
of criminal misconduct under Section 13(l)(c) of 

Prevention of Corruption Act and similarly while holding the said office as public 

servants, they obtained for accused No.3 a pecuniary advantage without any 

publ ic interc.:'st by violation the laws, rules, regulations and directive� 1.rn�� therefrm.:• 

they committed the offence of criminal misconduct under Section 13(l )(d) C!lso.

furtherance of the conspiracy with accused No.3, he is also liable to be convicted

Office as in-charge of Human Resources Development Department and he was 

competent to accord sanction for prosecution of Junior Management Scale J

Each of the accused claims that he had suffered a lot because of this 

case because none of them had gained any pecuniary advantage from this matter. 

According to the accused No. l, he was d.i smissed from service and he has no 

income. Accused No.2 claims that he was removed frorn service. According to 

accused No.3, even though the offences are said to have been committed for his 

pecuniary advantage, .money had never come to his hands and the money was 

always with one or the other Bank, each of whom got some benefits, but not the 

accused and, therefore, the accused persons claim l eniency.

1eniency is mjsplaced and the pun i sh ment should be proportionate to the offence 

committed by them. 

31. 

Even thou gh che offences under Sections 409, 465, 477 A IPC as well 

as the offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act have been comm1tted, fact 

remains that it was a temporary misappropr.iation of the money, unlawfully and 

wrongly borrowed as calJ money from Canara Bank and then paid to Grindlays 

Bank. The amount \.Vas received back from Grindlays Bank on the nexc day and 

also was pC1id back to Canara Bank with interest. In view of the facts noted above, 

none of the Banks actually suffered any financial loss in the matter. However, fact 

remains that the said transactions were carried out against the direccions given by 

Reserve Bank of Jnclia under the statu tory provisions of RBI Act as well as against 

the stand i ng instructions of the Head Office of Andhra Bank. There were 

illega lities and irregularities in operations in violation of the Banking rules, 

regula tions, directions and ethics, and thus the Banking system was subverted for 

the he nefit of a private share/scock broker or deal er i.e. accused No.3. In such 

circumstances, even though none of them had apparently received any financial 

ga)n nor any of the Bank had suffered any financial loss, stm, it wil1 be necessary 

to impose sentence of impr]sonment with fine against each of the accused.
