1. 
By this petition filed under section 34 of the Arbitration 

& Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short "the Act"), the petitioner 

challenges the Interim Award dated 25 th April, 2017, passed by the 

Arbitral Tribunal to the extent it awards and determines: 

(i) 
that the Concession Agreement dated 25 th August, 2006 

was validly terminated, both on account of Political 

Force Majeure Events and material default on the part of 

the Petitioner thereby holding / finding that the issue of 

liability against the Petitioner is finally determined; 

(ii) that the hearing stands bifurcated and all quantum 

related issues deferred to a second phase to decide the 

quantum of the Respondent's claims; 

(iii) the issues that would arise in the second stage of the 

arbitration as set out in paragraph 83 of the Impugned 

Award; 

(iv) that there was no conciliation under the Arbitration and 

Conciliation Act, 1996; 

(v) that the second phase may involve a brief set of 

pleadings whereby the Respondent may make fresh 

quantum claims, and the Petitioner may file its response

to the quantum, claims, and documents may be relied 

upon by parties; 

(vi) that the need for any oral or expert evidence would be 

determined by the Tribunal in the second phase; and 

(vii) that its decision on the Counter Claim is deferred. 

2. 
A further direction is sought to set aside the impugned 

Award insofar as it rejects the petitioner's case and contentions. 

3. 
The basic grounds of challenge to the impugned Interim 

Award are as under: 

I 
Reliance placed by the Arbitral Tribunal on 

evidence which was inadmissible in law; 

II 
Upholding the validity of the termination of 

the Concession Agreement dated 25 th 

August, 2006; 

III(A) 
The Award is contrary to the procedure 

agreed upon between the parties as 

provided by section 19(2) of the Act;

III(B) 
Legal misconduct on the part of the 

Tribunal; and 

III(C) 
Failure of the Tribunal to consider and 

decide the Counter Claim filed by the 

petitioner. 

4. 
Before I examine these grounds of challenge, it would be 

necessary to encapsulate the brief facts of the matter. The present 

dispute arises out of a Concession Agreement dated 25 th August, 

2006 (for short "the Concession Agreement") which was entered 

into between the petitioner and the respondent for the purpose of 

four-laning, improvement and maintenance of the Bhiwandi-Kalyan 

Shil-Phata Highway (for short "the Project Highway" and/or the 

"Project Road"). The Project Highway is a road in the Mumbai 

Metropolitan Region which provides an East-West Link and 

connects NH3 to NH4. This Project Highway bears a heavy load of 

commercial traffic as well as caters to passenger vehicles 

commuting between Kalyan-Bhiwandi and Dombivali. The road 

measures 21.6 kilometers in length of which four kilometers was a 

four lane Highway from before and the rest of the road was of poor 

quality and a two-lane undivided carriageway. Additionally, over

fifty percent of the road length had stretches with poor driving 

conditions and was in need of immediate attention for road 

strengthening etc. The Project comprised of strengthening the 

existing four lane dual carriageway and widening the existing two-

lane carriageway to a four lane dual carriageway. 

5. 
In order to carry out work on the Project Highway, the 

Government of Maharashtra, by its letter dated 31 st January, 2005, 

and Notification dated 24 th July, 2006, appointed the petitioner 

(MSRDC) as an entrepreneur to implement the said Project with a 

concession period of 15 years 8 months and 15 days in two phases 

on a build, operate and transfer (BOT) basis. Phase-I was for 

strengthening the existing two lane divided carriageway and 

widening the existing two-way carriageway to a four lane divided 

carriageway. Phase-I concession period was for 9 years, 10 months 

and 15 days. Phase-II was for constructing the Kalyan Bypass with 

a major bridge on Ulhas river and Railway Over Bridge ("ROB") on 

the Central Railway Line along with the approach roads. 

6. 
In order to carry out the aforesaid work, the petitioner 

invited bids on 19 th July, 2005. Pursuant thereto, a consortium of

"Plus Expressways Berhad" and "Concept Management and 

Consulting Private Limited" bid for the said Project and was found to 

be the successful bidder having offered the lowest concession period 

of 6 years, 8 months and 4 days. "Plus Expressway Berhad" is 

stated to be wholly owned by the investment arm of the Government 

of Malaysia. 

The consortium partner, "Concept Management 

Consulting Private Limited" is a company incorporated in India 

under the Companies Act, 1956. The bid of this consortium, namely 

the Plus -Concept Consortium was accepted by the MSRDC vide a 

letter dated 12 th May, 2006. Subsequently, as required under the 

agreement, the consortium promoted and constituted a special 

purpose vehicle called "Plus BKSP Toll Limited" and who was the 

Claimant in the arbitration proceedings (the respondent herein). 

Accordingly, the petitioner, the respondent and the consortium 

entered into a Concession Agreement dated 25 th August, 2006, and 

which is the Agreement out of which the present disputes arise. For 

the sake of convenience, the petitioner shall be referred to as 

"MSRDC" and the respondent shall be referred to as "PLUS". 

7. 
As per the Concession Agreement, M/s. S.N. Bhobe and 

Associates Private Limited was appointed as an Independent

Consultant (for short the "IC") for the Project. The IC was 

appointed by MSRDC under clause 20 of the Concession Agreement. 

Clause 20.1, inter alia, provided that MSRDC will monitor and 

supervise the Project. However, MSRDC could appoint a consulting 

firm for this purpose by following an appropriate selection process 

and the name of the finally selected IC was to be communicated to 

the Concessionaire (PLUS). 

8. 
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the 

Concession Agreement, the date of the commencement of 

construction was reckoned as 25 th August, 2006. The Commercial 

Operations Date ("COD") was to be 24 th February, 2008 and was the 

date on which MSRDC was to issue the completion certificate or 

provisional completion certificate. The concession period was to run 

until 28 th April, 2013, namely, the period from the date of signing of 

the Concession Agreement and ending on the termination date. 

9. 
According to MSRDC, it was agreed between the parties 

that PLUS would not be entitled to recover Toll until after receipt of 

the completion certificate or the provisional completion certificate

and after removing the defects, if any. The provisional completion 

certificate came to be issued to PLUS on 22 nd June, 2009, subject to 

certain terms and conditions. In the meantime, the Government of 

Maharashtra issued a Toll Notification on 13 th August, 2009, 

authorizing PLUS to collect and retain the Toll from 22 nd August, 

2009 till 28 th April, 2013. In a meeting held on 23 rd October, 2009 

between PLUS and MSRDC, it was decided that the date of the 

provisional completion certificate would be deemed to be 22 nd 

August, 2009. 

10. 
Thereafter, on 30 th October, 2009, MSRDC granted PLUS 

an extension of the construction period until 29 th December, 2009, 

which was an extension of 674 days from the original schedule 

Project completion date. As there was a delay in completion of the 

construction of the Project, PLUS addressed a letter to MSRDC and 

the IC, inter alia, requesting MSRDC to pay a sum of Rs.161.65 

crores (being the difference between the actual cost incurred by 

PLUS and the original Project cost) towards additional direct cost 

incurred due to the alleged material default of the Concession 

Agreement by MSRDC as well as a Force Majeure Event. Thereafter, 

on 16 th April, 2010, PLUS, while referring to its letter dated 24 th

February, 2010, inter alia, stated that it was seeking compensation 

for all additional direct costs suffered and incurred by it and called 

upon MSRDC to pay the purported dues for which it provided the 

certificate from the statutory auditors. According to MSRDC, since 

disputes arose between the parties, PLUS, by its letter dated 10 th 

May, 2010, called upon the IC to act in accordance with clause 

39.1(b) of the Concession Agreement and referred six claims to it 

for conciliation. I must note that this is seriously disputed by PLUS 

as, according to it, only one claim for 'additional direct cost' was 

referred to the IC under clause 39.1(b) and not all six claims. I will 

deal with this aspect later in my judgment. 

11. 
Be that as it may, the IC, by its letter dated 15 th May, 

2010, agreed to act as a Mediator in accordance with clause 39.1(b). 

Thereafter, several meetings were held and correspondence was 

exchanged between the parties for the purpose of and in pursuance 

of the request for conciliation/mediation. Finally, MSRDC and PLUS 

forwarded a joint proposal to the Government of Maharashtra for its 

consideration. During the pendency of the said proposal, PLUS, by 

its two letters dated 19 th March, 2013 terminated the Concession 

Agreement. However, PLUS did not stop collecting Toll from the

said date and vide its letters dated 8 th April, 2013 and 22 nd April, 

2013 requested for an amicable settlement. 
The Concession 

Agreement thereafter came to an end on 28 th April, 2013. PLUS, 

therefore, by its letter dated 25 th April, 2014, made a reference of all 

disputes and differences, including the Counter Claim between 

MSRDC and PLUS to the Vice Chairman and Managing Director of 

MSRDC. Thereafter, several discussions and meetings took place 

between the parties. As the disputes could not be resolved, PLUS, by 

its letter dated 31 st July, 2015, invoked arbitration and appointed 

the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Aftab Alam (Retired) as their nominee 

Arbitrator. On the other hand, MSRDC by its letter dated 27 th 

August, 2015, appointed Mr. R.M. Premkumar (Retired), an IAS 

Officer, as their Nominee Arbitrator and all disputes and differences 

were referred to arbitration. Thereafter, the Indian Council for 

Arbitrators, by their letter dated 15 th December, 2015, appointed 

the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shafee Syed Parkar (Retired) as the 

Presiding Arbitrator. Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal was duly 

constituted. 

12. 
In its first meeting held on 20 th February, 2016, the 

Arbitral Tribunal, in consultation with the parties and their

advocates, passed a detailed Procedural Order. 
By the said 

Procedural Order, the Arbitral Tribunal fixed a detailed procedure 

and passed directions for filing of the pleadings, documents, 

evidence etc, including the dates for cross-examination of witnesses 

by each party and also the dates for oral hearing. It was made clear 

that only in exceptional circumstances, extension of time would be 

granted, but under no circumstances, the scheduled dates of 

hearings fixed by the Arbitral Tribunal would be affected or altered. 

The relevant portion of this Procedural Order reads as under: 

"Practice Directions [under Section 19(3) of the Arbitration and 
Conciliation Act, 1996] 

After discussion, the Learned Counsel for the parties have agreed 
on this practice and procedure to be followed and in accordance 
therewith the following directions are issued by the Tribunal: 

1. 
Extension of time shall be granted by the Tribunal in its 
discretion: 

(a) 
in exceptional cases only; 

(b) 
provided that a request is submitted before the date 
scheduled; and 

(c) 
as soon as it appears that the deadline cannot be complied 
with. 

The Parties may also agree between themselves for short 
extensions of time, on the basis of mutual courtesy, as long as 
those extensions do not materially affect the time table (the dates 
scheduled for the sittings of the Tribunal must not be affected) and 
that the Tribunal is informed prior to the scheduled deadline."

13. 
Accordingly, as per the Procedural Order dated 20 th 

February, 2016, PLUS filed its Statement of Claim. MSRDC, by its 

advocate's letter dated 28 th April, 2016, sought four weeks' time to 

file the Statement of Defence and Counter Claim for the reasons 

more particularly stated in the said letter. PLUS objected to 

granting further time to MSRDC to file its Statement of Defence and 

Counter Claim on the ground that the schedule fixed by the Arbitral 

Tribunal on 20 th February, 2016, was prepared after discussing and 

obtaining the consent of the lawyers for both parties. The Arbitral 

Tribunal, by its order dated 4 th May, 2016, granted two weeks' time 

to MSRDC to file its Statement of Defence and Counter Claim. 

Thereafter, by its Procedural Order dated 12 th May, 2016, the 

Arbitral Tribunal rescheduled the dates only to the extent to which 

it concerned filing of the pleadings, documents and evidence. The 

dates fixed for cross-examination of witnesses as well as for oral 

hearings was kept unchanged. In other words, the time fixed for 

cross-examination of witnesses from 17 th January, 2017 to 21 st 

January, 2017, remained unchanged and similarly, the dates fixed

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 13 of 169 

for oral arguments from 31 st January, 2017 to 4 th February, 2017 

also remained unchanged. 

14. 
Thereafter, the respondent filed its Statement of Defence 

and Counter Claim before the Arbitral Tribunal, taking up various 

defences. The record reflects that thereafter PLUS filed an 

application for production of documents which was objected to by 

MSRDC on various grounds. One of the main grounds was that the 

documents sought to be produced were expressly barred under 

sections 75 and 81 of the Act and/or section 23 of the Evidence Act 

and/or that they were privileged and/or were confidential. The 

Arbitral Tribunal held a meeting on 17 th October, 2016, wherein it 

deferred all issues raised by the parties at the final hearing. By the 

said order dated 17 th October, 2016, the Tribunal once again 

confirmed the fact that the other directions given in the Procedural 

Order dated 20 th February, 2016, shall remain unchanged. 

15. 
Thereafter, as per the schedule fixed by the Arbitral 

Tribunal, from 17 th January, 2017 to 21 st January, 2017 cross-

examination of witnesses of both parties was done and the 

arguments were heard from 31 st January, 2017 to 4 th February,

2017. On 4 th February, 2017, the hearing concluded and the 

Arbitral Tribunal directed the parties to file their written 

submissions and the matter was reserved for passing an Award. It 

was made clear by the Arbitral Tribunal that there would be no more 

hearings unless the Arbitral Tribunal was of the opinion that after 

going through the written submissions some clarification was 

required. Thereafter, on 26 th April, 2017, MSRDC received from the 

Arbitral Tribunal, a photocopy of the Interim Award dated 25 th 

April, 2017, and which is impugned in the present petition. It is 

aggrieved by this Interim Award that MSRDC is challenging the 

same on the grounds mentioned by me earlier. 

16. 
As noted above, the Interim Award is challenged on five 

different grounds. I find that ground (i) the Award is contrary to 

the procedure agreed to between the parties [ground IIIA]; (ii) the 

failure of the Tribunal to consider / decide the Counter Claim 

[ground IIIC]; and (iii) legal misconduct on the part of the Tribunal 

[ground IIIB]; are all inter-twined together and, therefore, my 

findings on these three grounds will be decided together. The two 

other independent grounds I find are with reference to (i) the 

Tribunal placing reliance on inadmissible evidence which vitiates

the Award [ground I]; and (ii) upholding the validity of the 

termination of the Concession Agreement [ground II]. I shall deal 

with these two grounds first and separately before I decide the other 

three grounds of challenge. 

I. 
RELIANCE ON INADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE VITIATES 
THE AWARD: 

SUBMISSIONS OF MSRDC: 

17. 
Mr. Chagla, the learned senior counsel appearing on 

behalf of MSRDC, submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal has arrived 

at its findings by relying upon documents and purported admissions 

made in documents which in law were inadmissible and hence could 

not be relied upon or looked at by the Tribunal. This argument is 

premised on the basis that the documents relied upon by the 

Tribunal were documents that were exchanged between the parties 

during the course of mediation /conciliation /settlement proceedings 

before the IC as contemplated under clause 39.1(b) of the 

Concession Agreement. He submitted that the documents and/or 

admissions exchanged between the parties during the course of such 

mediation/conciliation proceedings could not be relied upon as it is

impermissible in law. To substantiate this argument, Mr. Chagla 

submitted that PLUS made six claims before the IC as a mediator 

under clause 39.1(b) of the Concession Agreement. He submitted 

that clause 31.2 of the Concession Agreement categorically 

stipulates that in the event of MSRDC being in material default and 

such default is cured before termination, MSRDC shall pay to the 

Concessionaire, as compensation, all additional direct cost suffered 

or incurred by the Concessionaire arising out of such material 

default by MSRDC in one lumpsum within thirty days of receiving 

the demand or, at MSRDC's option, in three equal annual 

instalments, with interest. Mr. Chagla submitted that the term 

'additional direct cost' under the Concession Agreement is, 

therefore, an omnibus term referring to all costs suffered or 

incurred by PLUS in any capacity as long as it arises out of a 

material default by MSRDC. He submitted that this is borne out by 

the correspondence on record before the termination of the 

Concession Agreement. He submitted that PLUS' letter dated 24 th 

February, 2010 to MSRDC categorically refers to 'additional direct 

cost' reimbursement due to material default by MSRDC of the 

Concession Agreement. By the said letter, PLUS sought Rs.161.65 

crores as 'additional direct cost' incurred due to material default of 

::: Uploaded on -19/04/2021 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 17 of 169 

MSRDC under clauses 4.1(b), 4.3, 10.1(i), 10.1(ii) and 10.1(iii). 

Therefore, by the said letter, PLUS sought all additional direct costs 

incurred by it on account of material defaults on the part of MSRDC. 

In other words, it was the submission of Mr. Chagla that all claims 

were referred to mediation/conciliation under clause 39.1(b) and 

not just one claim, namely claim No.5 for 'additional direct cost' as 

held by the Arbitral Tribunal. 

18. 
Mr. Chagla thereafter brought to my attention, another 

letter dated 16 th April, 2010, which again reiterates that PLUS had 

sought compensation from MSRDC for all additional direct costs 

suffered and incurred by them arising out of the purported material 

defaults by MSRDC. Mr. Chagla pointed out that a similar letter was 

again written by PLUS on 30 th April, 2010. Finally, on 10 th May, 

2010, PLUS invoked clause 39.1(b) of the Concession Agreement 

and called upon the IC to mediate and assist in resolving the 

reimbursement demands already raised in respect of compensation 

for all additional direct costs suffered due to material defaults of the 

Concession Agreement by MSRDC under clause 31.2 of the 

Concession Agreement. The subject of the letter is identical to the 

earlier letters and the letter itself refers to the letter of 30 th April,

2010, and to all preceding communication to MSRDC on the 

abovementioned subject. Therefore, Mr. Chagla submitted that by 

the said letter, various alleged material defaults on the part of 

MSRDC were referred to the IC, including the claims arising out of 

material defaults under clause 10.1(v) of the Concession 

Agreement. Mr. Chagla submitted that after a meeting on 5 th June, 

2010, scheduled by the IC, in pursuance of PLUS' invocation of 

conciliation, PLUS, inter alia, stated that it was continuing to suffer 

huge losses in revenue and that there was reduction in Toll income 

and that it was seeking compensation for all direct losses suffered by 

PLUS arising out of the erection of barrier by the Government 

Agency (The Commissioner of Police). PLUS also stated that it was 

willing to accept the extension of the concession period in lieu of 

cash payment in light of loss in Toll revenue which was stated as 

Rs.103.9 crores. Mr. Chagla thereafter also brought to my attention 

the letter written by the IC dated 14 th July, 2010 to MSRDC which 

categorically submitted the revised calculations in respect of the 

loss in total revenue due to delay in issue of Toll Notification, non-

payment of Toll by KDMT and NMMT buses and loss due to diversion 

of heavy vehicles. He thereafter brought to my attention the letter 

written by the IC to MSRDC dated 23 rd June, 2011, wherein one

Dhruv Consultant provided the expenditure figures and stated that 

the IC had revised the same to Rs.161.19 cores and incidentally 

Annexure B to the said letter explicitly calculates the loss due to 

diversion of heavy traffic. He also brought to my attention other 

letters written by the IC to MSRDC dated 9 th July, 2011 and 2 nd 

August, 2011. He also submitted that subsequent thereto, MSRDC, 

on 20 th October, 2011, made an offer to PLUS in respect of the 

request for conciliation under their letter dated 10 th May, 2010 by 

proposing an extension in the concession period until 10 th July, 

2024 in lieu of claim Nos.1, 4, 5 and 6 and rejecting the claim for 

compensation for loss of revenue on account of delay in issuing the 

Toll Notification and KDMT and NMMT buses refusing to pay Toll. 

This offer was accepted by PLUS by its letter dated 4 th November, 

2011. He submitted that pursuant thereto, PLUS drafted the terms 

of a Settlement Agreement and Recital D thereof is very relevant. 

Mr. Chagla was at pains to point out Recital D of the draft terms of 

Settlement Agreement clearly stipulates as under: 

"D. Further, in pursuance of Clause 39.1 ("Amicable Resolution") of 
the Concession Agreement, the Concessionaire, vide its letter no. 
BKSP/PD/CA/E/C/435-10-5-2010 dated May 10, 2010, and earlier

described under "Annexure A" hereto) with MSRDC ("Claim 
Letter").

19. 
Relying upon the aforesaid recital, Mr. Chagla submitted 

that even according to PLUS, all six claims were referred to 

conciliation under clause 39.1(b) and, therefore, it was wholly 

incorrect on the part of the Arbitral Tribunal to come to the 

conclusion that only one claim, namely, for 'additional direct cost' 

was referred to conciliation and not the other claims. He submitted 

that this was contrary to the entire record, including what was 

stated in the termination notice issued by PLUS dated 19 th March, 

2013.

20. 
Mr. Chagla then submitted that even in PLUS' own 

pleadings [in the Statement of Claim], under the heading "Facts 

about traffic diversion due to ban on entry of heavy vehicles on the 

BKSP Road", PLUS has clearly averred that it invoked clause 39.1 

for amicable dispute resolution and requested the IC to mediate and 

assist. All this material, therefore, clearly establishes that even on 

PLUS' own pleaded case, conciliation proceedings, while under the 

nomenclature of 'additional direct cost', actually encompassed all 

claims raised by PLUS. He submitted that, therefore, the findings of 

the Tribunal that the offer of conciliation was only in relation to the 

claim for 'additional direct cost' and that the conciliation 

proceedings were only invoked in relation thereto, is directly 

contrary to the documents on record and the express admissions 

made by PLUS and are, therefore, perverse and completely 

unsustainable. 

SUBMISSIONS OF PLUS: 

21. 
On the other hand, Mr. Khambatta, the learned senior 

counsel appearing on behalf of PLUS, submitted that the IC was 

appointed by MSRDC to monitor and supervise the Project on its 

behalf in terms of clause 20 of the Concession Agreement. The IC

was to act as an agent / representative of MSRDC for supervising the 

Project. All communications addressed by MSRDC or PLUS were 

sent to the IC or the IC was also marked on the said communication. 

Apart from this, the IC also wore another hat under the Concession 

Agreement which is as a Mediator in respect of such disputes which 

were specifically referred to him under clause 39.1(b). Under clause 

39.1(b) there were two modes of mediation. In case of a dispute 

between MSRDC and PLUS, either party could, with regard to that 

specific issue or dispute, call upon the IC to mediate that particular 

dispute. Failing mediation by the IC or without the intervention of 

the IC, either party could refer such dispute to the Vice Chairman 

and Managing Director of MSRDC and the Chairman of the Board of 

Directors of PLUS, for an amicable settlement. In the facts of the 

present case, MSRDC appointed M/s. S.N. Bhobe and Associates 

Private Limited as the IC for the current Project. 

22. 
Mr. Khambata submitted that the six claims submitted 

by PLUS to the IC can be divided into two types. Firstly, those 

claims that were lodged by PLUS with the IC on account of various 

reasons during the usual course of business. Secondly, those claims 

in respect of which there was a dispute and PLUS had invoked

clause 39.1(b) of the Concession Agreement for mediation by the IC. 

Mr. Khambatta submitted that in the facts of the present case, the 

six claims submitted to the IC were as under: 

Claim No.1 
Extension in Concession Period due to 
revision of COD to 29.12.2009. 

Claim No.2 
Loss in Toll revenue due to delay in Toll 
Notification. 

Claim No.3 
Loss in Toll revenue due to ban on heavy 
vehicles on the Project Highway. 

Claim No.4 
Loss in Toll revenue due to refusal to pay 
the Toll fee by KDMT/NMMT for their 
buses plying on the Project Highway. 

Claim No.5 
Additional direct cost reimbursement due 
to material default of the Concession 
Agreement by MSRDC. -Submitted for 
mediation of the IC under clause 
39.1(b). 

Claim No.6 
Variation in project cost due to changes in 
the Scope of Work. 

(emphasis supplied) 

23. 
Mr. Khambatta submitted that only claim No.5 and 

which was for 'additional direct cost', was referred to mediation of 

the IC under clause 39.1(b). He submitted that this was clear from 

the fact that PLUS by its letter dated 26 th February, 2010, addressed

to MSRDC, filed the claim for 'additional direct cost' reimbursement 

as a result of the material defaults of the Concession Agreement by 

MSRDC. This claim was for Rs.161.65 crores. PLUS wrote another 

letter on 16 th April, 2010, to MSRDC demanding reimbursement of 

the 'additional direct cost' due to material default of MSRDC. 

Thereafter, on 30 th April, 2010, PLUS addressed another letter to 

MSRDC stating the urgency of resolving the issue of 'additional 

direct cost' within the defined time lines. Since MSRDC did not 

make any payments, with reference to the 'additional direct cost', 

PLUS wrote a letter dated 10 th May, 2010 to the IC invoking the 

provisions of clause 39.1(b) for assistance and contractual 

mediation in resolving the issue of 'additional direct cost' 

reimbursement and no other claim. Further, on receipt of the 

aforesaid communication, the IC, vide its letter dated 15 th May, 

2010, informed MSRDC that PLUS had invoked clause 39.1(b) of the 

Concession Agreement in relation to the issue of 'additional direct 

cost'. MSRDC thereafter by its letter dated 29 th May, 2010, 

requested both PLUS and the IC to attend a meeting for resolution 

under clause 39.1(b) in relation to the issue of 'additional direct 

cost' reimbursement. Thereafter, the IC, in its communication dated 

11 th October, 2010, addressed to MSRDC discussed various claims

submitted by PLUS. However, what is important to note is that the 

IC categorically mentioned that clause 39.1(b) was invoked only 

with reference to 'additional direct cost'. The IC subsequently, on 

23 rd June, 2011, wrote to MSRDC in relation to the calculation for 

the 'additional direct cost' reimbursement whereby the revised 

amount was Rs.161.19 crores. Mr. Khambatta submitted that on 

looking at this letter it was abundantly clear that the claim was only 

for 'additional direct cost' in the sum of Rs.161.19 crores and not 

the other claims which were independent of the claim for 'additional 

direct cost'. He pointed out that thereafter, by a letter dated 3 rd 

February, 2011, MSRDC informed PLUS stating that they had 

referred all the claims of PLUS to a Committee of Directors 

consisting of the Vice Chairman and Managing Director of MSRDC. 

The Committee was to consider the claims and decide on their 

admissibility and thereafter quantify the same. The Committee was 

to also determine the conversion of the quantified claim to the 

concession period in terms of the Concession Agreement and the 

resultant increase in the concession period. He submitted that all 

claims were referred to the Committee of Directors for the purpose 

of compensating PLUS by extending the Toll period in lieu of cash. 

Mr. Khambatta submitted that this Committee of Directors was not

the joint mediation envisaged under clause 39.1(b) and which was 

to consist of (i) the Vice Chairman and Managing Director of MSRDC 

and (ii) the Chairman of PLUS. This Committee of Directors was an 

internal Committee of MSRDC. He thereafter brought to my 

attention, the report of the Committee of Directors of July, 2011. He 

submitted that the Committee of Directors considered all the claims 

and presented its report in respect thereof. In the said report it is 

mentioned that PLUS had lodged six claims with the IC. The report 

analysed 
each 
claim 
individually 
and 
gave 
separate 

recommendations for each claim. Out of the six claims, the 

Committee accepted claim Nos.1, 3, 4 and 6 to be admissible 

whereas claim No.2 was not accepted as a valid claim. With 

reference to claim No. 5, and which related to 'additional direct cost', 

the Committee of Directors stated as under: 

"The Concessionaire has already requested for resolution of this 
issue under the provisions of dispute resolution as per clause 
39.1(Annexure 13) of the Concession Agreement, for which 
MSRDC has appointed Mr. A.V. Deodhar, Superintending 
Engineer, MSRDC to represent itself in the dispute resolution 
proceedings. 

It is most suitable that this issue is resolved as per the provisions of 
the Concession Agreement for determination of the value of 
additional direct cost and grant of extension in concession period to 
the Commissionaire as compensation based on the computed 
value of additional cost which will also save MSRDC from 
substantial financial burden of paying cash compensation."

24. 
Mr. Khambatta submitted that the Committee 

summarized its findings, reiterating that claim Nos.1, 3, 4 and 6 

were accepted in terms of the recommendations of the IC and claim 

No.2 was rejected. However, regarding claim No.5, i.e. 'additional 

direct cost', the Committee recommended "Resolution of dispute as 

per the provisions of the Concession Agreement for settlement of 

issue". He submitted that from this report of the Committee of 

Directors, it is clear that the Committee either accepted or rejected 

the claims of PLUS, except the claim for 'additional direct cost' 

which was claim No.5. This claim was to be resolved by mediation of 

the IC as per clause 39.1(b) of the Concession Agreement. Mr. 

Khambatta submitted that keeping in line with this, the IC also, in 

its communication dated 2 nd August, 2011, addressed to MSRDC, 

listed out six claims, including the claim for 'additional direct cost'. 

The IC thereafter dealt with each individual claim separately. As far 

as claim No.5 is concerned, the IC recommended that PLUS has 

already requested for resolution of this claim under the provisions of 

dispute resolution as per clause 39.1 of the Concession Agreement 

for which MSRDC has appointed Mr. A.V. Deodhar, Superintending

Engineer, MSRDC to represent itself in the dispute resolution 

proceedings. The IC recommended that it is most suitable that this 

issue is resolved amicably as per the provisions of clause 39.1 of the 

Concession Agreement through negotiated settlement with PLUS for 

determining the value of 'additional direct cost' and grant of 

extension in the concession period as compensation based on the 

negotiated value of the additional cost and which also would save 

MSRDC from a substantial financial burden of paying cash 

compensation. Mr. Khambatta submitted that all this material 

clearly goes to show that only the claim for 'additional direct cost' in 

the sum of Rs.161.19 crores was referred for conciliation under 

clause 39.1(b) and not all the claims as sought to be contended on 

behalf of MSRDC. He submitted that, in fact, the claim of additional 

direct cost has been reduced by the IC from Rs.161.69 crores to 

Rs.40.04 crores and which was accepted by PLUS. This is another 

factor which clearly goes to show that 'additional direct cost' was a 

completely separate claim and only that claim was referred to 

mediation/conciliation under clause 39.1(b). 

25. 
This apart, Mr. Khambatta submitted that there is ample 

correspondence on record to show that MSRDC has engaged in

correspondence with several third parties in which they admitted 

their own defaults and which cannot be termed as correspondence 

entered into during conciliation proceedings. 
He, therefore, 

submitted that the contention of MSRDC that all claims were 

referred to mediation is wholly without substance and deserves to 

be rejected. Mr. Khambatta also submitted that when one reads the 

findings of the Arbitral Tribunal on this issue, it is quite clear that 

from the documents on record, it is certainly a plausible view and if 

that be the case, no interference is called for under section 34 of the 

Act. He, therefore, submitted that the aforesaid argument holds no 

merit and ought to be rejected. 

FINDINGS OF THE COURT: 

26. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length 

and have perused the papers and proceedings in the above petition. 

The point to be decided here is whether all six claims were 

submitted by PLUS to the IC under clause 39.1(b), as sought to be 

contended by Mr. Chagla, or whether only the claim for 'additional 

direct cost' was submitted under the said clause. To put it in a nut-

shell, according to Mr. Chagla, if all claims were submitted for 

conciliation under clause 39.1(b), then all correspondence

exchanged between the parties during the period of conciliation 

would be privileged and/or confidential and could not be relied upon 

for any purpose by the Tribunal. On the other hand, if only the claim 

for 'additional direct cost' was submitted for conciliation, the 

situation would be quite different. 

27. 
To understand this controversy, one must understand 

the role of the IC. The IC is defined in the definitions clause (clause 

1.1). It stipulates that the IC (Independent Consultant) shall have 

the meaning ascribed to it in clause 20.1. Correspondingly, clause 

20 of the Concession Agreement deals with the appointment of the 

IC and his duties and obligations. Clause 20 of the Concession 

Agreement reads thus: 

"20. 
INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT 

20.1 
MSRDC will monitor & supervise the Project. However 
MSRDC may appoint a consulting engineering firm for this purpose 
by following an appropriate selection process. The name of the 
finally selected such Independent Consultant will be communicated 
to the Commissionaire. 

20.2 
The appointment of the Independent Consultant 
pursuant to Clause 20.1 shall initially be for a period of one and half 
(1.5) years from the date of its appointment. MSRDC may in its 
discretion thereafter renew such appointment or appoint another 
person. 

20.3 
The Independent Consultant shall report to MSRDC 
about their work, services, and activities pursuant hereto through

regular periodic reports (at least once every month) as the situation 
may warrant. Such report of Independent Consultant shall include 
but not be limited to the matters and things set forth in said 
Schedule 'O'. 

20.4 
The cost of supervision and monitoring by MSRDC / 
Independent Consultant shall be borne by Concessionaire. An 
amount of Rs.15,00,000/-(Rupees Fifteen Lakhs) per month during 
Construction Period and an amount of Rs.5,00,000/-(Rupees Five 
Lakhs) per month after COD up to the end of Concession Period 
shall be paid by Concessionaire to MSRDC before 10 th of every 
month. 

20.5 
MSRDC may terminate the appointment of the 
Independent Consultant at any time subject to appointment of their 
replacement by another Independent Consultant in accordance with 
this Article XXII. 

20.6 
If the Concessionaire has reason to believe that the 
Independent Consultant is not discharging its duties in a fair, 
efficient and diligent manner, it may make a written representation 
to MSRDC, stating its reasons in detail, seeking termination of the 
appointment of the Independent Consultant. Upon receipt of such 
representation, MSRDC shall hold a tripartite meeting with the 
Concessionaire and Independent Consultant for amicable 
resolution of the dispute. If the dispute remains unresolved, it shall 
be resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure. 
In case the appointment of Independent Consultant is terminated 
under this Clause, it shall be replaced by another Independent 
Consultant in accordance with this Article XX. 

20.7 
If either party disputes any advice, instruction or 
award of the Independent Consultant, the dispute shall be resolved 
in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure." 

(emphasis supplied) 

28. 
As can be seen from the aforesaid clauses, it was the 

obligation of MSRDC to monitor and supervise the Project. However, 

MSRDC could appoint a Consulting Engineering Firm for this

purpose, namely, to monitor and supervise the Project. The 

Independent Consultant (IC) was to report to MSRDC about the 

working, services and activities through regular periodic reports. 

Such reports were to include but not limited to the matters and 

things set forth in Schedule-O. MSRDC also had the right to 

terminate the appointment of the IC at any time, subject to 

appointment of their replacement by another IC in accordance with 

Article XXII. From the aforesaid clauses, it is clear that the IC was a 

person appointed by MSRDC to monitor and supervise the Project 

and was to report to MSRDC regarding its progress by filing regular 

periodic reports. Apart from this role, the IC had another role to 

play. This was to act as a Mediator as contemplated under clause 

39.1(b) of the Concession Agreement. For the sake of convenience, 

Clause 39.1 is reproduced hereunder: 

"39. DISPUTE RESOLUTION 

39.1 Amicable Resolution 

(a) 
Save where expressly stated to the contrary in the 
Agreement, any dispute, difference or controversy of whatever 
nature howsoever arising under, out of or in relation to this 
Agreement including incompletion of the Project Highway 
between the Parties and so notified in writing by either Party to 
the other (the "Dispute") in the first instance shall be attempted 
to be resolved amicably in accordance with the conciliation 
procedure set forth in Sub-clause (b) below.

CARBP371.17.doc

Page 33 of 169 

(b) 
In the event of any Dispute between the Parties, either 
Party may call upon the Independent Consultant to mediate 
and assist the Parties in arriving at an amicable settlement 
thereof. Failing mediation by the Independent Consultant or 
without the intervention of the Independent Consultant, either 
Party may require such Dispute to be referred to the VC & MD 
of MSRDC and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the 
Concessionaire, for the time being for amicable settlement. 
Upon such reference, the said two Authorities shall meet not 
later than 7 (seven) days of the date of such request to 
discuss and attempt to amicably resolve the Dispute. If such 
meeting does not take place within the said period or the 
Dispute is not amicably settled within 15 (fifteen) days of such 
meeting between the said two Authorities, either Party may 
refer the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the 
provisions of Clause 39.2. 

(c) 
If the Dispute is not resolved as evidenced by the 
signing of the written terms of settlement within 30 (thirty) 
working days of the aforesaid notice in writing or such longer 
period as may be mutually agreed by the Parties then the 
provisions of Clause 39.2 shall apply." 

(emphasis supplied) 

29. 
As can be seen from clause 39.1, where there was any 

dispute, difference or controversy of whatever nature arising under, 

out of, or in relation to the Concession Agreement, the aggrieved 

party could, by writing, inform the other party about such dispute 

and the same was to be attempted to be resolved amicably in 

accordance with the conciliation procedure set forth in sub-clause 

(b) of clause 39.1. Sub-clause (b) stipulates that in the event of any 

dispute between the parties, either party may call upon the IC to

mediate and assist the parties in arriving at an amicable settlement 

thereof. Failing mediation by the IC, or without the intervention of 

the IC, either party may require such dispute to be referred to (i) the 

VC and MD of MSRDC and (ii) the Chairman of the Board of 

Directors of PLUS, for an amicable settlement. In other words, 

conciliation proceedings under clause 39.1(b) could be undertaken 

either by (i) the IC; or (ii) the VC and MD of MSRDC alongwith the 

Chairman of the Board of Directors of PLUS. Reading these clauses, 

I find considerable force in the argument of Mr. Khambatta that the 

IC, under the Concession Agreement, wore two different hats. 

Firstly, he was a person who was supposed to monitor and supervise 

the Project and report to MSRDC. The second was to act as a 

Mediator under clause 39.1(b), if the said clause was so invoked by 

either party. 

30. 
Having said this, I shall now examine whether the 

factual situation before me is one where mediation / conciliation was 

invoked with reference to all six claims submitted by PLUS to the IC 

or whether it was only the claim for 'additional direct cost' that was 

the subject matter of mediation/conciliation under clause 39.1(b). 

In this regard, I find considerable force in the arguments canvassed

by Mr. Khambatta. Clause 39.1(b) was invoked by PLUS vide its 

letter dated 10 th May, 2010. This letter was issued in relation to the 

claim for 'additional direct cost'. On receipt of the aforesaid 

communication, the IC, vide its letter dated 15 th May, 2010, 

informed MSRDC that PLUS had invoked clause 39.1(b) of the 

Concession Agreement in relation to the issue of 'additional direct 

cost'. MSRDC thereafter, by its letter dated 29 th May, 2010, 

requested both PLUS and the IC to attend a meeting for dispute 

resolution under clause 39.1(b) in relation to the issue of 'additional 

direct cost' reimbursement. Thereafter, the IC in its communication 

dated 11 th October, 2010, addressed to MSRDC discussed the six 

claims submitted by PLUS. However, what is important to note is 

that the IC categorically mentioned that clause 39.1(b) was invoked 

only with reference to the claim of 'additional direct cost' which 

arose due to the delay in the Commercial Operations Date (COD) and 

not for other claims. In fact, on the face of it, claim Nos.3 & 4, and 

which related to (i) loss in Toll revenue due to ban on heavy vehicles 

on the Project Highway and (ii) loss in Toll revenue due to refusal to 

pay the Toll fee by KDMT/NMMT for their buses plying on the 

Project Highway, are not, as they could not have been, claims made

due to the delay in the Commercial Operations Date (COD) at all. The 

relevant portion of the said letter reads thus: 

"â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ 
6) 
Additional Direct Cost due to material default of the 
concession agreement by MSRDC: This claim is due to the 
delay in COD of the project highway and additional direct costs 
suffered by the concessionaire as a result of this delay. The 
sequence of events and concessionaire's claim are as follows: 

a. 
As per the terms of the Concession Agreement, it was a 
condition precedent under clause 4.1(b) and an obligation of 
MSRDC under clause 10.1(i) to grant the concessionaire way 
leaves required in connection of the project highway and provide 
the right of way for the alignment of the project free from any 
encumbrances. 

b. 
The above matter resulted in delay in COD by 674 days. 

c. 
Subsequently, in order to ensure completion of the project 
highway construction despite the material default, with the 
cognizance of the causes of delay, the construction period and 
date and COD were extended by 674 days to 29.12.2009 by 
MSRDC vide its letter no.MSRDC/02/JMD(1)/BKS:1/File 
No.102/49999 dt. 30.10.2009. 
To provide this extension, 
MSRDC invoked Force Majeure clauses 29.4 and 29.6(b), latter 
being the only clause in the concession agreement which 
provides for extending the concession period. 

d. 
Concessionaire vide letter no.BKSP/PD/CA/E/C/366 dated 
February 24, 2010, and various subsequent letters on the subject 
matter, demanded that they should be compensated for 
additional direct costs suffered due the delay in COD for which it 
is contractually entitled under clause 31.2, that provides for 
compensation in the event of MSRDC being in material default of 
the concession agreement and also under 29.6(d) read with 
clause 29.7(c) that provide for reimbursement of cost actually 
incurred and certified by the statutory auditors of concessionaire 
in case of Political Force Majeure event. 

e. 
MSRDC vide its letter referred at sr. no. 9 above 
communicated to the concessionaire its denial on material default 
of the concession agreement.

f. 
Concessionaire vide its letter referred at sr. no. 10 
has provided its response, reiterating the basis for compensation, 
clarifying that the extension in construction period merely 
attempts to restore the original operations period which was 
drastically reduced due to delay in COD and does not 
compensation for the additional direct costs suffered due to the 
delay; further maintaining its stand that it was an event of 
material default of the concession agreement by MSRDC.

(emphasis supplied) 

31. 
Apart from this, I find that all the claims submitted by 

PLUS were referred by MSRDC to a Committee of Directors 

consisting of the Vice Chairman and Managing Director of MSRDC. 

This Committee of Directors thereafter prepared a report in July, 

2011 wherein it considered all the claims of PLUS and presented its 

report in respect thereof. The said report categorically mentions 

that PLUS had lodged six claims with the IC. The report analysed 

each claim individually and gave separate recommendations for 

each claim. Out of the six claims submitted by PLUS, the Committee 

accepted claim Nos.1, 3, 4 and 6 (set out earlier) to be admissible, 

whereas claim No.2 was not accepted as a valid claim. With

reference to claim No.5 and which related to 'additional direct cost', 

the Committee of Directors noted that PLUS had requested for 

resolution of this issue under the provisions of the Dispute 

Resolution as per clause 39.1 of the Concession Agreement and for 

which MSRDC had appointed Mr. A.V. Deodhar to represent itself in 

the dispute resolution proceedings. It was thereafter recommended 

that it would be more suitable that this issue is resolved as per the 

provisions of the Concession Agreement for determination of the 

value of 'additional direct cost' and to grant extension in the 

concession period which will also save MSRDC a substantial 

financial burden of paying cash compensation. 

32. 
From all this material, I find that Mr. Khambatta is 

correct in his submission that only the claim for 'additional direct 

cost' [namely, claim No. 5], was the claim that was referred to 

mediation / conciliation under clause 39.1(b) of the Concession 

Agreement. I am unable to agree with Mr. Chagla that the words 

'additional direct cost' should be read in an omnibus fashion which 

would include every single claim that was submitted by PLUS to the 

IC. This is not how the IC understood it and neither was it the 

understanding of MSRDC or the Committee of Directors of MSRDC.

33. 
This apart, I find the discussion on this aspect by the 

Arbitral Tribunal is at paragraphs 65, 75 and 76 respectively. The 

Tribunal has noted that the letter dated 10 th May, 2010, and the 

letters issued earlier to it do not actually refer to the six claims, but 

rather only to the claim of 'additional direct cost'. This claim was 

first put forward by a letter dated 24 th February, 2010 where PLUS 

claimed an amount of Rs.161 crores as the escalated project cost on 

account of material default of MSRDC. Subsequently, this claim was 

pursued by further letters dated 16 th April, 2010 and 30 th April, 

2010. Finally, by means of the letter dated 10 th May, 2010, PLUS 

proposed conciliation. It is in this light that the Arbitral Tribunal 

came to a finding that the offer of conciliation was in relation only to 

the claim for 'additional direct cost'. The Tribunal held that though 

it is true that other claims had also been raised by that time, these 

were by means of separate letters and were separately pursued. It 

is only much later, by a communication dated 2 nd August, 2011, that 

the Independent Consultant clubs the various claims under the six 

heads and makes its recommendations with relation to each claim. 

With reference to claim No.5 ('additional direct cost'), the IC once 

again notes that PLUS has already requested for resolution of this

issue under the provisions of the Dispute Resolution as per clause 

39.1 of the Concession Agreement and it is most suitable that this 

issue is resolved amicably as per the provisions of clause 39.1 

through negotiated settlement and granting extension in the 

concession period will save MSRDC a substantial financial burden of 

paying cash compensation. The Tribunal further notes the strong 

objection of MSRDC regarding the admissibility of not only the 

Director's report referred to above, but to a very large number of 

documents / correspondence exchanged between PLUS, the IC and 

MSRDC in regard to the claims raised. It notes that the objection to 

the admissibility of these documents is the most prominent and 

consistent theme of the case of MSRDC. The main objection is that 

the correspondence between the parties was made in the course of 

conciliation proceedings and, therefore, protected by confidentiality 

on account of sections 75 and 81 in Part III of the Arbitration & 

Conciliation Act, 1996 and/or section 23 of the Evidence Act. After 

considering the material and giving a careful consideration to the 

objection raised by MSRDC, the Tribunal finds no merit in this 

contention. The Tribunal holds that firstly the conciliation 

proceedings were only invoked in relation to the claim for 

'additional direct cost' whereas the figure of Rs.112 crores includes

loss on other grounds as well (loss of Toll revenue on account of 

traffic regulations and non-payment of Toll by Municipal buses). The 

Tribunal, therefore, holds that the alleged confidentiality attached to 

the conciliation proceedings can, at best, be attached to matters 

pertaining to the claim for 'additional direct cost', but not the other 

claims. The Tribunal also correctly holds that the Concession 

Agreement never envisaged or contemplated a conciliation as 

contemplated under Part III of the Act and neither any such 

procedure was followed. It also noted that the IC was a nominee of 

MSRDC performing MSRDC's obligations under the agreement 

which it could outsource to the IC. Part III of the Act, however, 

requires that there should be an independent and impartial third-

party Conciliator to mediate and assist in the resolution dispute. 

Given that the IC was a nominee of MSRDC, it could never, therefore, 

have performed the role of a Conciliator as understood and 

envisaged under Part III of the Act. It could, at best, have been a 

contractual conciliation procedure. The third point that the Tribunal 

holds on this issue is that clause 39.1(b) of the Agreement did not 

expressly contain any confidentiality restrictions with regard to the 

correspondence exchanged during the conciliation procedure and 

nor are any documents marked 'without prejudice'. It is in these

circumstances that the Tribunal rejected the contention of MSRDC 

that the documents exchanged between the parties was a part of 

conciliation and, therefore, inadmissible in the proceedings. The 

Tribunal thereafter, though holding that the documents were 

admissible, categorically recorded that it would still be required to 

be determined as to the weightage that could be attached to these 

documents as evidence of an admitted quantification of the loss 

suffered by PLUS. 

34. 
Having gone through the findings given by the Arbitral 

Tribunal in the relevant paragraphs mentioned above, it can hardly 

be stated that the view taken by the Tribunal suffers from any 

patent illegality or is perverse. The Tribunal has examined the 

record, heard the parties and thereafter come to its conclusion. The 

Arbitral Tribunal has categorically held that after looking at the 

correspondence on record, the conciliation proceedings were only 

invoked in relation to the claim for 'additional direct cost' and not 

with reference to any other claim. This finding can hardly be 

termed as perverse and is certainly a plausible view taken by the 

Tribunal to hold that the objection to the admissibility of the

documents on the ground that they are part of conciliation 

proceedings is without any merit. 

35. 
Before concluding on this issue, it would only be fair to 

deal with the reliance placed by Mr. Chagla on Recital 'D' of the draft 

settlement agreement (reproduced above). I find that the reliance 

placed by Mr. Chagla on Recital 'D' is wholly misplaced. Firstly, 

PLUS itself sought to rely upon this draft (to establish admission of 

liability) and which was negated by the Tribunal on the ground that 

the same was never signed by either of the parties and hence could 

not be relied upon. I then fail to see how MSRDC can rely upon it 

when it does not admit the same. Secondly, Recital 'D' talks about 

the six claims that were raised pursuant to a letter dated 10 th May, 

2010 and earlier letters on the subject. In fact, the letter dated 10 th 

May, 2010 (and the earlier letters) clearly shows that six claims 

were never raised and only the claim for 'additional direct cost' was 

raised under the said letters which culminated into conciliation 

proceedings under clause 39.1(b). 
The Tribunal too, after 

examining the correspondence on record, categorically records that 

the letter dated 10 th May, 2010 and the letters issued earlier to it, 

do not actually refer to the six claims, but rather only to the claim

Page 44 of 169 

for 'additional direct cost'. In fact, the Tribunal also records that 

though it is true that other claims had also been raised by that time, 

these were by means of separate letters and were separately 

pursued. This being the position, I find that the reliance placed by 

Mr. Chagla on Recital 'D' of the draft settlement agreement is wholly 

misplaced. Similar is the case in relation to the pleadings filed 

before the Arbitral Tribunal. The Tribunal has considered the 

pleadings and has thereafter come to the conclusion that it was only 

the claim for 'additional direct cost' that was referred to mediation / 

conciliation and not any other claim. In these circumstances, I do 

not find that the Tribunal was in any error in holding that it was 

only the claim for 'additional direct cost' that was referred to 

mediation / conciliation under clause 39.1(b) and not any other 

claim. I, therefore, do not find any reason to interfere with the 

Interim Award on this issue. 

II. UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF THE TERMINATION 
OF THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT: 

SUBMISSIONS OF MSRDC:

36. 
Mr. Chagla submitted that the findings of the Arbitral 

Tribunal upholding the termination of the Concession Agreement is 

contrary to the record and, therefore, wholly illegal and perverse. 

He submitted that the Concession Agreement could be terminated 

under two different clauses, namely, clause 32.4 and clause 29.8 of 

the Concession Agreement. Clause 32.4 gave a right to PLUS to 

terminate the Concession Agreement in the event of any default 

committed by MSRDC. On the other hand, clause 29.8 gave a right 

to either party to terminate the agreement if a Force Majeure event 

subsisted for a period of 180 days or more within a continuous 

period of 365 days. Under clause 32.4.1, the termination notice was 

to be given in writing by giving a ninety days' notice under clause. 

37. 
Mr. Chagla submitted that the findings given by the 

Arbitral Tribunal in paragraph 70 of the Award upholding the 

termination of the Concession Agreement under clauses 32.4.1(1) 

and 32.4.1(3) thereof, are wholly illegal and perverse. He submitted 

that PLUS, by its termination notice dated 19 th March, 2013, sought 

to terminate the Concession Agreement under clause 32.4 thereof. 

In order for it to be a valid termination, clause 32.4 requires four 

conditions that need to be satisfied, namely: (1) that there is a 

::: Uploaded on -19/04/2021 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 46 of 169 

breach of the Concession Agreement; (2) The breach should have a 

material adverse effect on the project; (3) that a 90 days' notice be 

given; and (4) MSRDC failing to cure the said breach or take 

effective steps for curing the said breach within 90 days of receipt of 

the notice. Mr. Chagla submitted that in the facts of the present 

case, none of the aforesaid conditions are satisfied. He submitted 

that firstly clause 32.4 mandatorily required termination to be 90 

days after a written notice in respect thereto was given to MSRDC. 

It is an admitted position that the 90 days' notice has not been 

given. Despite this, the Arbitral Tribunal, in paragraph 70 of the 

Award records that though a 90 day notice was required, the notice 

period was complied with as PLUS had only refrained from issuing a 

formal termination notice on the assurance of MSRDC and, 

therefore, MSRDC had much more than the 90 day notice period to 

cure the breach. The Tribunal has, in this respect, referred to a 

letter dated 4 th February, 2013. Mr. Chagla submitted that even 

assuming whilst denying that this letter amounted to a written 

notice under clause 32.4, the time period from 4 th February, 2013 to 

28 th April, 2013, did not satisfy the 90 day notice period. He 

submitted that termination under clause 32.4 requires strict 

compliance and failure to give notice of 90 days clearly renders the

Page 47 of 169 

termination illegal and invalid. He, therefore, submitted that on this 

ground alone it should be held that the Award is illegal and perverse 

as it runs directly contrary to the express wordings of clause 32.4. 

38. 
Mr. Chagla then submitted that in any event, the 

termination under clause 32.4 cannot be held to be valid as there 

was no breach on the part of MSRDC. He submitted that MSRDC was 

obliged to provide the land for the approach road to the Railway 

Over Bridge (ROB). MSRDC had complied with its obligation by the 

time the Railways modified the dimensions of the ROB. This 

modification necessitated additional land to be acquired and also for 

the drawings to be approved by the Railways. The preparation and 

approval of the drawings were the obligations of PLUS. Therefore, 

until the drawings were approved, the ROB could not be constructed. 

The Arbitral Tribunal has completely ignored the obligation of PLUS 

as contained in clause 2 of Schedule B, clause 9.8(ii), notes 3 and 4 

to the drawing of the Katai ROB and clause 9.4(v) of the Concession 

Agreement. Mr. Chagla submitted that the admitted position is that 

MSRDC had acquired the additional land before the drawings were 

approved by the Railways as recorded in the letters dated 2 nd May, 

2009 and 11 th September, 2009. Therefore, there was no delay

Page 48 of 169 

occasioned or prejudice caused to PLUS by reason of the delay in 

acquisition in land and, therefore, no breach was committed by 

MSRDC. 

39. 
Mr. Chagla thereafter submitted that even assuming 

that there was a breach on the part of MSRDC, there was no 

material adverse effect on PLUS. He submitted that the only 

evidence led by PLUS before the Arbitral Tribunal was the 

correspondence addressed complaining of "losses"; constraint on its 

"cash flow position"; that its operations were being jeopardized; and 

mentioning alleged figures of loss etc. PLUS led no evidence in 

support of the alleged losses or constraint on its cash flow or its 

operations being jeopardized, save and except what transpired 

before the IC in the course of conciliation proceedings. As recorded 

by the Tribunal in paragraph 77 of the Award, various figures of loss 

were proposed by either side in the spirit of settlement while they 

were trying to work out a rough and ready compromise. These were 

sought to be relied upon by PLUS as admissions of liability and 

which were expressly rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal. In fact, the 

finding of the Tribunal is that it is for PLUS to prove and quantify 

the loss it has suffered and claim damages on that basis and that the 

::: Uploaded on -19/04/2021

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 49 of 169 

claim for Rs.112 crores was based only on admissions made by 

MSRDC in the course of conciliation which the Arbitral Tribunal did 

not accept. Mr. Chagla submitted that for the Tribunal to come to a 

finding that there had been a material adverse effect, it was 

essential for the Tribunal to examine the evidence and conclude that 

PLUS had suffered loss or damage which, in turn, would be the 

material adverse effect caused to PLUS. 
On coming to the 

conclusion that on the available evidence, the Tribunal was not in a 

position to conclude that there was a loss or damage, the Arbitral 

Tribunal could not have concluded that there was a material 

adverse effect. The findings in this regard, therefore, are patently 

illegal and wholly perverse, was the submission of Mr. Chagla. 

40. 
In the alternative to the above argument, Mr. Chagla 

submitted that even assuming that MSRDC had committed a breach, 

it had taken effective steps to cure the same. He submitted that 

clause 32.4 allows MSRDC a period of 90 days to cure the alleged 

breach. The Arbitral Tribunal has held that MSRDC had granted an 

extension of 674 days to the construction period vide its letter dated 

18 th June, 2010. The said letter clearly records that the extension 

was granted under clause 29.6(b) of the Concession Agreement and,

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 50 of 169 

therefore, the monetary claim was rejected by MSRDC. Further, 

MSRDC had also got an interim Toll Notification issued on 26 th April, 

2013 permitting PLUS to collect Toll for a period three months from 

28 th April, 2013. PLUS refused the said interim Notification on the 

ground that there was a new condition of depositing the amount of 

Toll in an Escrow Account. Mr. Chagla submitted that there was no 

new condition of depositing the money in the Escrow Account as the 

same was already provided for in clauses 6.3. 6.4, 25 and 34.11 of 

the Concession Agreement. He submitted that it is pertinent to note 

that the Arbitral Tribunal has categorically held that the default of 

the MSRDC is not the failure to have a Toll Notification issued in 

respect of the proposed extended concession period. In light of all 

this, Mr Chagla submitted that MSRDC had taken all effective steps 

to cure the breach, if any. In any event, PLUS terminated the 

Concession Agreement even before the 90 day period was over and, 

therefore, the Tribunal could not have held that MSRDC had not 

cured the breach within the period of 90 days. 
In these 

circumstances, Mr. Chagla submitted that the finding of the Arbitral 

Tribunal upholding the termination of the Concession Agreement 

under clause 32.4.1 is patently illegal and perverse and ought to be 

set aside.

41. 
Similarly, Mr. Chagla submitted that the findings of the 

Arbitral Tribunal upholding the termination of the Concession 

Agreement under clause 29.8 are also patently illegal and ought to 

interfered with. Mr. Chagla submitted that in the termination notice 

dated 19 th March, 2013, PLUS sought to terminate the Concession 

Agreement under clause 29.8, inter alia, on the following grounds: 

(a) Non issuance of Toll Notification by the Government 

of Maharashtra till 10 th July, 2024 in pursuance of 

the Settlement Agreement; 

(b) Refusal of KDMT and NMMT buses to pay Toll; and 

(c) Traffic Control Notification dated 11 th May, 2009, 

banning entry of multi axle vehicles through 

Kalyan city and Notification dated 29 th December, 

2009 closing entry of all heavy vehicles on the said 

Project Road. 

42. 
Mr. Chagla brought to my attention that the Arbitral 

Tribunal upheld the termination of the Concession Agreement under 

clause 29.8 on grounds (b) and (c) above and rejected the 

termination on ground (a). Mr. Chagla took me through clause 29 of

the Concession Agreement and which deals with the events of Force 

Majeure. He submitted that in the present case, PLUS has claimed 

existence of a Political Force Majeure event and which is defined in 

clause 29.4. He submitted that a Political Force Majeure event shall 

mean one or more of the acts of events by or on account of MSRDC, 

GOM or any other Governmental agency, as more particularly set 

out in clauses 29.4(i) and 29.4(iii). 
Whilst interpreting the 

aforesaid clauses, Mr. Chagla submitted that it was clear that five 

conditions required fulfilling. They were: (a) the event should be a 

Political Force Majeure event as defined in clause 29.4 of the 

Concession Agreement; (b) the said event should prevent the party 

from performing its obligations under the Concession Agreement; 

(c) the said event is beyond the reasonable control and not arising 

out of the fault of the affected party; (d) the affected party is unable 

to overcome the said event by exercise of due diligence and 

reasonable efforts, skill and care, including through expenditure of 

reasonable sums of money; and (e) the said event has a material 

adverse effect on the Project. Mr. Chagla submitted that the 

Arbitral Tribunal held that refusal of KDMT and NMMT buses to pay 

Toll [ground (b) above] is an expropriation of the rights of PLUS 

and, therefore, constitutes a Political Force Majeure event within

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 53 of 169 

the meaning of clause 29.4 of the Concession Agreement. This 

finding can be found at paragraph 61 of the Award. Mr. Chagla 

submitted that the said finding offends the plain dictionary meaning 

of the word 'expropriation' in that the refusal to pay Toll, can by no 

stretch of the imagination, be termed as an expropriation. In this 

regard, he relied upon the Black's Law Dictionary and the Oxford 

English Dictionary meanings of the word "expropriation". 

43. 
This apart, Mr. Chagla submitted that in any event PLUS 

was not prevented from performing its obligations. The finding that 

PLUS was prevented from performance of its obligations is illegal 

and perverse as it is contrary to a categorical admission made by the 

Director of PLUS during cross-examination, wherein he admitted 

that PLUS had the ability to perform its obligations. In this regard, 

he brought to my attention a question put to the Director of PLUS 

wherein he was asked as to whether it would be correct to say that 

from 4 th November, 2011 to 28 th April, 2013, PLUS was not 

prevented from performing its obligations under the Concession 

Agreement. The answer to this question was "We had the ability to 

perform because the toll notification was there and we were able to 

collect toll upto 28 th April, 2013". 

Mr. Chagla submitted that

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 54 of 169 

despite this admission, the Arbitral Tribunal, in paragraph 62 of the 

Award, completely disregards and dismisses the same as an isolated 

statement, holding instead that regard must be had to the entirety of 

the documents on record to ascertain whether, in fact, PLUS was 

prevented in performance of its obligations. Mr. Chagla submitted 

that the said finding has been arrived at without identifying the 

documentary evidence on record in support of such a finding. This 

finding is also contrary to the Arbitral Tribunal's own finding in 

paragraph 43 of the Award wherein it held that the period from 

November, 2011 to April, 2013, PLUS was still able to collect and 

retain Toll on account of the original Toll Notification till 28 th April, 

2013. 
Mr. Chagla submitted that, therefore, the findings in 

paragraph 62 of the Award are not only self-contradictory but also 

contrary to the admission made by the witness of PLUS. 

44. 
Mr. Chagla next submitted that even if a Political Force 

Majeure event arose, the same was on account of the fault of PLUS. 

He submitted that the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that the said 

event, namely, refusal of KDMT and NMMT buses to pay Toll was 

entirely beyond the control of PLUS and certainly not on account of 

any fault of PLUS, is patently illegal and perverse inasmuch as the

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 55 of 169 

said event occurred solely on account of the failure on the part of 

PLUS to perform its obligations under the Concession Agreement. 

Mr. Chagla submitted that clause 18.1 of the Concession Agreement 

obliged PLUS to prevent unauthorised entry and exit from the 

Project Road. Further, it was the duty and obligation of PLUS to levy 

and collect Toll from the users of the Project Road and refuse entry 

of any vehicle if the Toll fee was not paid. Mr. Chagla submitted that 

the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal on this aspect is arrived at 

without considering the material clauses of the Concession 

Agreement and has resulted in PLUS being virtually absolved from 

its obligations under the Concession Agreement and which is clearly 

impermissible. He submitted that PLUS could have overcome the 

event by exercising due diligence and reasonable efforts, skill and 

care, including through expenditure of reasonable sums of money. 

The finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that PLUS exercised necessary 

due diligence and that precipitating matters any further could lead 

to serious law and order repercussions is incorrect and contrary to 

its own conclusion that it was for PLUS to exercise legal remedies to 

enforce its rights under the Toll Notification. Mr. Chagla submitted 

that the Arbitral Tribunal has arrived at this finding on the basis of 

assumptions and presumptions and has virtually absolved PLUS of

CARBP371.17.doc

Page 56 of 169 

its obligations to collect Toll and prevent entry of any vehicle that 

was not authorised to use the Project Road. Since PLUS chose not to 

collect Toll from the KDMT and NMMT buses though they were 

entitled to under the Concession Agreement, PLUS now cannot claim 

that the same amounts to a Political Force Majeure event which 

entitles them to terminate the agreement. To put it differently, Mr. 

Chagla submitted that PLUS cannot take advantage of its own 

wrong. 

45. 
Mr. Chagla lastly submitted that in any event there was 

no material adverse effect caused to PLUS by KDMT and NMMT 

buses not paying the Toll. He submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal 

has held that it is unable to arrive at a quantum determination 

based on the existing record and submissions and the Tribunal 

cannot place much weight on the quantum figures arrived at during 

the stage of settlement. Further, the loss on account of Toll revenue 

from KDMT and NMMT buses was also submitted to the IC during 

conciliation proceedings initiated by PLUS. There was, therefore, no 

evidence or material before the Tribunal on the basis of which the 

Tribunal could have arrived at a finding that there was any material 

adverse effect. Further, the Arbitral Tribunal has not referred to

any evidence in order to arrive at the said finding, was the 

submission of Mr. Chagla. He, therefore, submitted that the finding 

of the Arbitral Tribunal in this respect is patently illegal and 

perverse. 

46. 
Mr. Chagla then submitted that similar is the case with 

reference to the ban on heavy vehicles and multi axle vehicles 

[ground (c) above]. He submitted that the ban on heavy vehicles and 

multi axle vehicles did not constitute a Political Force Majeure event 

and the same is evident from the fact that the ban on the said 

vehicles did not amount to a change in law and there was no 

material adverse effect on account of the said ban. Mr. Chagla 

submitted that the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that PLUS was 

not aware of the resolution passed by KDMC allowing heavy vehicles 

to ply on the project road/project highway only from 10.00 p.m. to 

6.00 a.m. is contrary to the evidence on record. He submitted that 

PLUS was all along aware about the circular dated 20 th March, 2006 

as by the very circular itself, NOC was granted to KDMC to carry out 

the work. The said NOC was admittedly obtained by PLUS as 

recorded in the Minutes of the Meeting held on 31 st July, 2006 and 

which Minutes were forwarded to MSRDC by PLUS by its letter

dated 3 rd August, 2006. The finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that 

PLUS was unaware of the said circular is belied by the deposition 

and cross-examination of MSRDC's witness wherein the witness of 

MSRDC has clearly stated that the ban on heavy vehicles was 

applicable much before the tender was issued for the Project Road 

and the said Resolutions dated 9 th March, 2006 and 20 th March, 

2006 were public documents and known to the public. Mr. Chagla 

submitted that the Notifications of 11 th May 2009 and 29 th 

December, 2009 imposing a complete ban did not amount to a 

change in the law or an expropriation of the rights of PLUS within 

the meaning of clause 29. He, therefore, submitted that the ban on 

heavy vehicles, in any event, did not amount to a Political Force 

Majeure event as it did not amount to a change in law. 

47. 
Even assuming for the sake of argument that it would 

amount to a Political Force Majeure event, Mr. Chagla submitted 

that there was no material adverse effect as a result of the said ban. 

The finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that undoubtedly the event had 

a material adverse effect on the Project as the amount of uncollected 

Toll was allegedly in excess of Rs.60 crores is perverse as the 

Arbitral Tribunal has arrived at this conclusion in the absence of

any evidence as no loss has been proved by PLUS. In any event, this 

finding in respect of the figure of Rs.60 crores is also on the basis of 

a figure worked out by the IC during the course of conciliation 

proceedings. PLUS has even admitted in paragraph 6.53 of the 

Statement of Claim that the loss on account of ban on heavy vehicles 

was calculated by the IC vide its letter dated 14 th July, 2010, in 

furtherance of the conciliation proceedings initiated by it. This 

finding has been arrived at by relying upon documents exchanged 

between the parties during the course of mediation and/or 

conciliation and/or amicable settlement. Further, the said figure of 

Rs.60 crores is included in the figure of Rs.112 crores. The Arbitral 

Tribunal has rejected the said claim as is evident from the finding of 

the Arbitral Tribunal in paragraphs 77, 79, 86 and 87 of the Award. 

Therefore, the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that ban on heavy 

vehicles resulted in a material adverse effect is not only self-

contradictory, but without any basis. He, therefore, submitted that 

even the termination under clause 29.8 was wholly unwarranted 

and the findings of the Tribunal in this regard are contrary to the 

record and are patently illegal and perverse and ought to be 

interfered with under section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation 

Act, 1996.

SUBMISSIONS OF PLUS: 

48. 
On the other hand, Mr. Khambatta, the learned senior 

counsel appearing on behalf of PLUS, submitted that in the present 

case, the issue whether the termination of the contract was valid or 

not is a finding of fact. If it is a finding of fact, the challenge to the 

findings on the termination being valid is not maintainable under 

section 34 as the Arbitral Tribunal is the final Judge of the facts of 

the matter. He submitted that this Court under section 34 does not 

sit in appeal over the findings given by the Arbitral Tribunal. He 

submitted that the Concession Agreement was terminated by two 

separate termination notices, both dated 19 th March, 2013. One was 

for termination on the ground of Political Force Majeure (under 

clause 29.8) and the other was for defaults committed by MSRDC 

(under clause 32.4). Mr. Khambatta submitted that the termination 

notice issued pursuant to clause 32.4 of the Concession Agreement 

was on account of defaults committed by MSRDC in failing to pay the 

admitted claims of the petitioner, including the 'additional direct 

cost' incurred by PLUS due to the lapses of MSRDC. Mr. Khambatta 

brought to my attention paragraph 70 of the Award wherein the 

Tribunal clearly observed that the terms of the Agreement leave no

Page 61 of 169 

doubt that it was MSRDC's obligation to make the Project site 

available and MSRDC defaulted on this obligation. Thus, MSRDC 

was in breach of its obligations under clause 4.1(b) as well as 

clauses 10.1(i), 10.1(ii) and 10.1(iii). The Tribunal, therefore, held 

that there does exist a valid basis for termination, both under clause 

32.4.1(1) and 32.4.1(3). Mr. Khambatta also brought to my 

attention that the Tribunal has also observed in paragraph 70 of the 

Award that there were enough documents on record wherein the IC 

and MSRDC have acknowledged that MSRDC was responsible for 

making the Project site available. In fact, MSRDC itself admitted 

that PLUS was entitled to extension both on account of delayed 

acquisition of land as well as for the delay in the construction of the 

Railway Over Bridge (ROB). Even as far as the 90 day notice period 

is concerned, Mr. Khambatta submitted that the Tribunal correctly 

held in paragraph 70 that the requirements under clause 32.4 of the 

Concession Agreement for a 90 day notice was complied with by 

PLUS since it had held out the prospect of termination long before it 

was terminated and had refrained from issuing a formal notice due 

to MSRDC's assurance that the issue would be sorted out. This being 

the case, Mr. Khambatta submitted that if one goes through the 

Award on the issue of termination under clause 32.4, it is clear that

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 62 of 169 

the Tribunal has taken everything into consideration and has 

thereafter come to its finding that the termination is valid under the 

said clause. He submitted that the finding of the Tribunal on this 

aspect can certainly not be termed as either patently illegal or 

perverse and is certainly a plausible view. If this be the case, then, 

there is no question of interfering with the impugned Award on this 

count, was the submission. 

49. 
Similarly, Mr. Khambatta submitted that even 

termination under clause 29.8 (for a Political Force Majeure event) 

is legal and valid as held by the Arbitral Tribunal. Mr. Khambatta 

pointed out that paragraphs 61 and 62 of the Interim Award hold 

that the right to collect Toll is an entitlement of PLUS under clause 

6.1 of the Concession Agreement. The refusal to pay Toll by KDMT 

and NMMT Government buses was held as amounting to 

expropriation or taking away the rights of PLUS to collect and retain 

Toll from these buses in accordance with the Toll Notification. He 

submitted that in paragraph 62, the Tribunal held that PLUS took up 

this issue with KDMT and NMMT, and MSRDC was also alerted in 

January, 2010 that these Government buses were not paying Toll. 

Further, it was also observed that an account was kept of the

CARBP371.17.doc

Page 63 of 169 

number of Government buses passing through the Toll on a daily 

basis and PLUS, therefore, took all necessary steps to overcome the 

Political Force Majeure event. The Tribunal further held that non-

payment of Toll by the Government buses seriously impacted the 

amount of revenue that was to be received by PLUS under the Toll 

Notification. 

50. 
Mr. Khambatta submitted that the Government buses of 

KDMT and NMMT were specifically shown in the Project 

Information Memorandum (PIM) and the Concession Agreement as 

a category of vehicles which would have to pay Toll and was not 

listed as exempted vehicles either in the Concession Agreement or 

in the Toll Notification. Accordingly, the bid submitted by PLUS was 

on the basis that these buses would be paying Toll. MSRDC always 

admitted that PLUS had a right to collect Toll as is evident from its 

letter dated 18 th July, 2011 to the Transport Commissioner, KDMT. 

MSRDC also wrote to the Government of Maharashtra asking it to 

ensure that KDMT and NMMT pay the Toll failing which MSRDC 

itself would have to pay the balance Toll. Mr. Khambatta pointed 

out that these letters can never be termed as letters exchanged 

during conciliation proceedings as this was correspondence

addressed to third parties. This was a clear admission on the part of 

MSRDC that KDMT and NMMT were refusing to pay the Toll. This 

non-payment amounts to an expropriation of PLUS rights to collect 

and retain the Toll under clause 6.1 of the agreement. Not only that, 

it was also an obligation of PLUS under clause 9.1(xv) to levy and 

collect Toll from users of the Project Highway as per the rates set 

forth in the Toll Notification and in accordance with the Concession 

Agreement and regulate the traffic on the Project Highway in 

accordance with the applicable laws. Mr. Khambatta, therefore, 

submitted that non-payment of the Toll by these Government buses 

was thus clearly a Political Force Majeure event as it satisfied all the 

ingredients required as per clause 29.1 of the Concession Agreement 

and correctly spelt out by the Tribunal in paragraph 58 of the 

impugned Award. 

51. 
Mr. Khambatta then submitted that the Tribunal has 

correctly held that the termination under clause 29.8 is valid also 

on account of the ban / diversion of heavy and multi axle vehicles 

and which also constituted a Political Force Majeure event. In this 

regard, Mr. Khambatta brought to my attention, paragraph 63 of the 

Interim Award regarding the ban on heavy vehicles by the Police

authorities. The Tribunal held that all the ingredients (as set out in 

paragraph 58 of the Award), for a Political Force Majeure event are 

made out. It was further held that the said statutory traffic 

Notifications passed under section 15 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 

1988 amounted to a change in law in terms of Article 29.4(i). Mr. 

Khambatta submitted that as per the PIM, the Concession 

Agreement and the Toll Notification, heavy vehicles, including two 

axle, three axle and multi axle vehicles were shown as a category of 

vehicles which would use the Project Highway and pay Toll and were 

not in the exempted category. As per clause 10.1(v) of the 

Concession Agreement, it was the duty of MSRDC to ensure that no 

barriers were put on the Highway. However, the Police authorities 

issued a Notification dated 11 th May, 2009, whereby these multi 

axle vehicles were completely banned and heavy vehicles were 

partially banned from the said Project Road. 
These Traffic 

Regulation Notifications were issued by the Maharashtra Police 

which is a limb of the Government of Maharashtra and, therefore, a 

Governmental agency. These Government Notifications, therefore, 

clearly amounted to a change in law. Mr. Khambatta submitted that 

this does not stop here. In fact, MSRDC admits that PLUS has a 

right to collect Toll from heavy and multi axle vehicles. This is

evident from the letter dated 2 nd August, 2010 written by MSRDC to 

the Police authorities asking them to lift the ban on multi axle 

vehicles. Even upon the termination of the Concession Agreement, 

MSRDC began collecting Toll and itself wrote several letters to the 

Chief Secretary, Home Department asking for lifting the traffic ban 

on heavy vehicles. He, therefore, submitted that all this material 

would show that the complete ban imposed on multi axle vehicles 

and a partial ban on heavy vehicles from using the Project Road was 

clearly a Political Force Majeure event which entitled PLUS to 

terminate the Concession Agreement under clause 29.8 thereof. 

52. 
Mr. Khambatta, lastly submitted that if one goes through 

the Award and especially its findings with reference to termination, 

either under clause 29.8 or clause 32.4, it is clear that the findings 

given therein are purely factual in nature and the said findings are 

rendered after examining the record and the evidence led by the 

parties. In such circumstances, it is not for this Court under section 

34 to sit in appeal over those findings. The findings arrived at are 

certainly a view which is a possible view and hence ought not to be 

interfered with under section 34 of the Act. 
Consequently, he

submitted that even this ground raised by the petitioner is of no 

merit and ought to be rejected. 

FINDINGS OF THE COURT: 

53. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length 

on this issue and have also perused the papers and proceedings in 

the above petition, including the impugned Award. In the impugned 

Award, the Tribunal had framed the following issues/points for 

determination:-

"(a) the validity of the termination under Clause 29.8 on the 
ground of various force majeure events, as alleged; 

(b) 
The validity of the termination under Clause 32.4 on the 
ground of various acts/ omissions / delays in performance of 
its obligations by MSRDC which had a material adverse 
impact on the Claimant; 

(c) 
The relief to which the Claimant is entitled if either or both of 
the termination notices are upheld as being valid. 

(d) 
The amount to which the Respondent MSRDC is entitled on 
account of Counter Claims filed by it." 

54. 
Issue (a) was whether the Concession Agreement was 

validly terminated under Clause 29.8 on the ground of various Force 

Majeure Events and issue (b) was whether the termination was 

valid under Clause 32.4 on the ground of various acts/ omissions /

Page 68 of 169 

delays in performance of its obligations by MSRDC which had a 

material adverse impact on PLUS. The Tribunal noted that although 

the issues (a) and (b) have been framed separately, it would in fact 

be sufficient if PLUS were in a position to justify the termination 

either under clause 29.8 or 32.4. This is for the simple reason that 

the Concession Agreement could be terminated only once. 

Therefore, termination could be held to be valid either under clause 

29.8 (the Force Majeure events) or clause 32.4 (material default by 

MSRDC), if the same are made good by PLUS. Further the Tribunal 

held that even within each of these grounds there are several sub-

grounds, and it would be enough for PLUS to show that any one 

particular Political Force Majeure event existed/occurred as a basis 

for terminating the Concession Agreement, or any one particular 

material default is committed by MSRDC for terminating the said 

Agreement. 

55. 
While discussing the facts of the matter, the Tribunal 

noted that PLUS' grievances were three-fold: (i) the delays in land 

acquisition as well as in finalization of plans for the Railway Over 

Bridge (for short "ROB") at Katai which led to an overall delay in the 

construction of the project. This resulted in an 'additional direct

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc

Page 69 of 169 

cost' being incurred by PLUS; (ii) that traffic police restricted the 

entry of certain heavy vehicles on the Project Highway, thus 

reducing the traffic flow, which in turn led to a reduction in Toll 

received; and (iii) that the municipality buses (namely KDMT and 

NMMT buses) refused to pay Toll that they ought to have paid and 

which also led to a reduction in Toll received by PLUS. The Tribunal 

records that these grievances unfolded at different points in time 

during the execution of the project, and voluminous correspondence 

has been exchanged by the parties and the IC on each of these 

issues, much of which has been placed on record before the Tribunal. 

The Tribunal notes that to some extent, the stand taken by MSRDC 

in these proceedings is at variance with the position adopted by it in 

the contemporaneous correspondence exchanged between the 

parties. Therefore, while the Tribunal found it unnecessary to refer 

to each and every document, it referred to some of the key 

correspondence exchanged between the parties as the project 

progressed. The Tribunal noted that the 18 month period from the 

signing of the Concession Agreement [during which construction 

was expected to be completed], was to end on 24 th February, 2008. 

Immediately prior to this, in a communication dated 22 nd February, 

2008, MSRDC itself acknowledged that 95% of the work was

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc

Page 70 of 169 

completed. It further noted that the remaining work was delayed on 

account of land acquisition issues as well as the delay in approval of 

the design of the Katai ROB, by the Railways. The Tribunal, after 

examining the record, noted the correspondence exchanged 

between the parties for completion of the construction due to delays 

in land acquisition as well as the delayed approvals of the design of 

the ROB at Katai. 
In effect, PLUS sought extension of the 

construction period up till 12 th January, 2010. Despite this request, 

PLUS actually completed the work by 23 rd May, 2009 and claims to 

have done so by making a significant capital commitment to bring in 

extra resources. The Tribunal notes that from the correspondence 

referred to, it is clear that (i) there were delays with land 

acquisition as well as with the approval from the Railways with 

regard to the ROB at Katai; (ii) that these delays were on account of 

MSRDC (or, at any rate, not on account of PLUS), and were 

acknowledged by both, the IC and MSRDC at the time; (iii) the 

construction period was extended from time to time, and ultimately 

extended by a period of 674 days up till 29 th December, 2009; (iv) 

PLUS had requested a consequent extension in the concession 

period and the IC had endorsed the request by making a 

recommendation that the concession period be extended; (v) the

Page 71 of 169 

ultimate extension granted by MSRDC did not expressly state that 

the concession period had also been extended, but noted that it 

would be determined after taking into account various other factors. 

56. 
Thereafter, the Tribunal also notes that on 11 th May, 

2009, i.e. a week before PLUS was to complete the actual 

construction of the project, the Police Commissioner (Thane) issued 

a Traffic Regulation Notification banning the entry of heavy 

commercial vehicles in Kalyan city. Though PLUS does not appear 

to have protested immediately, it wrote to MSRDC on 18 th 

September, 2009 protesting the traffic restriction and cited clauses 

10.1(v) and (vii) of the Concession Agreement to contend that 

MSRDC had an obligation to ensure that no barrier was erected to 

the collection of Toll. It, therefore, requested MSRDC to take this up 

with the police authorities so that an amicable resolution could be 

found. Despite this protest, on 29 th December, 2009, another 

Notification came to be issued by the Police Commissioner (Thane) 

banning/restricting the entry of certain other categories of vehicles 

on the Project Highway. On 25 th February, 2010, PLUS wrote to the 

Police Department, with a copy marked to MSRDC, requesting that 

the traffic restrictions be lifted and the same be re-diverted onto the

Project Highway. The Tribunal notes that there is extensive 

correspondence exchanged between PLUS, MSRDC, the IC and also 

the Police Department on the losses being suffered by PLUS on 

account of the traffic restrictions and it, therefore, states that apart 

from the 'additional direct cost' claim, the traffic restrictions 

leading to a loss in Toll collection, constituted an independent basis 

for a claim by PLUS. Similar is the case with reference to non-

payment of Toll by the Municipal buses. The Tribunal notes that on 

23 rd January, 2010, PLUS wrote to MSRDC alerting them that 

KDMT buses were using the Project Highway, but refusing to pay 

Toll. As a result, PLUS had incurred losses for which it sought 

compensation. 
It also requested MSRDC to issue necessary 

instructions to KDMC for their buses to pay the Toll. A week later, 

on 30 th January, 2010, PLUS issued a similar letter to MSRDC about 

non-payment of Toll by NMMT buses. The Tribunal notes that 

despite these grievances being pointed out by PLUS, this stalemate 

continued and these buses continued to use the Project Highway, but 

did not pay the Toll. PLUS maintained that restraining/stopping 

these buses would have led to a law and order situation, given the 

voluminous number of trips made by such buses and the fact that 

they were transporting ordinary citizens. Thus, the only option for

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 73 of 169 

PLUS was to maintain a record/details of the trips done by such 

buses on a daily basis, and compute and maintain the amount of the 

forsaken Toll, which was informed to MSRDC at regular intervals. 

The amount of loss naturally kept increasing as the period of such 

non-payment of Toll was continuing. The Tribunal notes that there 

is correspondence to suggest that MSRDC agreed with the position 

that these buses ought to pay Toll, and has even stated as such to 

the concerned Municipal Commissioner (Transport), on certain 

occasions. However, MSRDC was unable to resolve the deadlock and 

impress upon KDMT and NMMT to have their buses pay the 

requisite Toll. The Tribunal notes that from November 2011 to early 

2013, the parties exchanged correspondence without the matter 

progressing any further. During this period, PLUS was still able to 

collect and retain Toll on account of the original Toll Notification, 

which subsisted till 28 th April, 2013. However, according to the 

Tribunal, it was quite clear that as the expiry of that Notification 

drew near, PLUS was increasingly anxious about the finalization of 

the settlement terms and the consequent extension in the Toll 

Notification. On 4 th February, 2013, PLUS wrote to MSRDC again 

pointing out that it retains the right to terminate the Agreement. 

On 8 th February, 2013, MSRDC writes to PLUS dissuading it from

Page 74 of 169 

terminating and assuring it that the rights accrued to it under the 

amicable settlement remain unaffected and the matter is 

progressing. 
Quite evidently, these words of comfort were 

insufficient to assuage PLUS and with the matter having dragged on 

for more than a year, PLUS finally issued two termination notices, 

both dated 19 th March, 2013. One was issued under Clause 29.8 and 

the other under Clause 32.4 of the Concession Agreement. 

57. 
After examining both the termination notices as well as 

the correspondence exchanged between the parties, the Tribunal in 

paragraph 53 set out certain basic features that appear from the 

facts and circumstances narrated in the impugned Award. They 

were:-

(i) 
Despite repeatedly pointing to the economic un-

viability of the project and holding out threats of 

termination, it was clear that PLUS was in fact 

anxious to carry on with the project. Perhaps it 

hoped that the project would turn profitable if 

MSRDC acceded to its demands, or perhaps it 

looked upon this project as a launching pad for 

further such projects in this country. Whatever be 

the reason, PLUS did its very best to accommodate 

so that the issues could somehow be resolved, until

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 75 of 169 

the matters reached an absolute breaking point 

when it was constrained to terminate the 

Agreement; 

(ii) MSRDC and the IC consistently acknowledged that 

there was substance in the grievances being raised 

by PLUS at different points in time under different 

heads, and yet, even while acknowledging this, 

MSRDC stopped short of committing itself to any 

position, and resorted to the easier course of 

referring matters to the Government of 

Maharashtra; and 

(iii) The Government of Maharashtra, for its part, 

adopted a somewhat casual approach in simply 

sitting idle even though various issues of pressing 

importance to the project had been referred to it by 

MSRDC. While MSRDC had referred the matters to 

the Government of Maharashtra, the Government 

of Maharashtra failed to take any decision at all. 

58. 
It is in this background that the Tribunal framed the 

four issues referred to earlier. 

59. 
Turning to the termination on the ground of Political 

Force Majeure (clause 29.8), the Tribunal discussed the same from

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 76 of 169 

paragraphs 58 to 64 of the impugned Award. The Tribunal notes 

that there are five key ingredients that must exist for there to be a 

finding that a Force Majeure event exists. These ingredients are:-

(a) the existence of an event, namely, a non-political 

event or an indirect political event or a political 

event as defined in the Concession Agreement. 

Since, in the present case, the allegation is that 

there was a political event, it may be noticed that 

clause 29.4, in turn, identifies three categories of 

political events. Briefly, they are (i) change in law; 

(ii) expropriation by any governmental agency of 

any project assets or rights of the Concessionaire 

(PLUS); or (iii) unjustified refusal to grant or renew 

any consent or approval required by the 

Concessionaire (PLUS); 

(b) the event must frustrate the performance of 

obligations, namely, those events must be such that 

they prevent the party claiming the Force Majeure 

Event from performing its obligations under the 

Agreement; 

(c) that the event was beyond the control of the party 

claiming the Force Majeure and not arising on 

account of its own fault;

(d) duty to mitigate, namely, the party claiming Force 

Majeure has an obligation to attempt to overcome 

the event by exercising due diligence and 

reasonable efforts, skill and care, including the 

expenditure of reasonable sums of money; and 

(e) the event must have a material adverse impact on 

the project. 

60. 
The Tribunal also noted that once a Force Majeure Event 

is found to exist, the effect of that Force Majeure Event depends on 

the stage at which such event occurs. In cases where the event 

occurs after the Commercial Operations Date (COD) under the 

Concession Agreement, the effect is provided in Clause 29.6 (c). 

However, in certain cases, if the Force Majeure Event subsists for a 

period of more than 180 days within a continuous period of 365 

days, it furnishes a right to either party to terminate the Agreement 

with a notice period of thirty days. 

61. 
In this background, the Tribunal thereafter went on to 

examine the Force Majeure Events. The first Force Majeure Event 

alleged by PLUS was that the parties had reached a settlement on

account of exchange of letters dated 20 th October, 2011 and 4 th 

November, 2011 and by virtue of such settlement, a Toll Notification 

was to be issued for the extended concession period. The non-

issuance of such Toll Notification was claimed as a Political Force 

Majeure Event. This Force Majeure Event was negated by the 

Tribunal as can be seen from paragraph 60 of the impugned Award. 

62. 
Thereafter, the second Force Majeure Event canvassed 

by PLUS was the non-payment of Toll by the NMMT and KDMT 

buses, which is alleged to be an expropriation of the rights of the 

Concessionaire (PLUS), and therefore, a Political Force Majeure 

Event. In this regard, the Tribunal held that the right to collect Toll 

is an entitlement of PLUS under Clause 6.1 of the Concession 

Agreement. The concerned Municipal undertakings are undeniably 

Government agencies within the meaning of clause 29.4 (ii) of the 

Concession Agreement. The refusal to pay Toll by the buses owned 

by these undertakings is an expropriation of the rights of the 

Concessionaire (PLUS), and specifically the right to collect and 

retain Toll in accordance with the Toll Notification. The Tribunal, 

therefore, found that this did constitute a Political Force Majeure 

Event within the meaning of Clause 29.4. The Tribunal thereafter

Page 79 of 169 

went on to examine whether the other elements necessary for 

constituting a Force Majeure Event are also made out. In paragraph 

62, the Tribunal examined the other elements. The Tribunal held 

that MSRDC (in its Written Submissions: Part VI) has relied upon 

the cross-examination transcript to contend that it is an admitted 

position that PLUS was not prevented from performing its 

obligations under the Concession Agreement. The Tribunal further 

found that the reliance on an isolated statement in response to one 

question put in cross-examination may not be conclusive on 

whether, in fact, PLUS was prevented from performing its 

obligations. Moreover, regard must be had to the terms of the 

Concession Agreement (which specify the obligations of each party) 

and also to the entirety of the documentary evidence on record, to 

ascertain whether in fact PLUS was prevented in the performance of 

its obligations. The Tribunal further held that the collection and 

retention of Toll is not just an entitlement, but also an obligation of 

PLUS in terms of clause 9.1(xv) of the Concession Agreement. The 

performance of this obligation was directly interfered with by the 

actions of NMMT and KDMT buses and, therefore, the Political 

Event did prevent PLUS from performing its obligations. It further 

held that this was entirely beyond the control of PLUS and certainly

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc

Page 80 of 169 

not on account of any fault of PLUS. The Tribunal thereafter opined 

that the position with respect to duty to mitigate is more finely 

balanced. The Tribunal held that it is reasonable to contend, as 

MSRDC has done, that the Toll Notification statutorily authorized 

PLUS to collect Toll from all vehicles other than those specifically 

exempted, and it was for PLUS to exercise legal remedies to enforce 

its rights under the Toll Notification. At the same time, it must be 

borne in mind that Municipal buses account for a large part of the 

traffic on the Project Highway, and such buses make several trips in 

a day, ferrying different passengers, some of whom may have no 

other mode of transport. Preventing the passage of these vehicles 

would, in the circumstances, have created a law and order situation 

and PLUS cannot be faulted for not carrying these matters ahead. 

PLUS has also pointed out that stopping the Municipal buses would 

have jammed the entire Toll plaza, and led to PLUS being in breach 

of its obligations under the Concession Agreement. The Tribunal 

also held that it is not as if PLUS was idle or slept over its rights or 

failed entirely to press its legitimate claims. The matter was taken 

up with the concerned Municipal Authorities, and MSRDC was also 

alerted as early as January 2010 that NMMT and KDMT buses were 

not paying Toll, even though they were required to do so in terms of

the Notification. Further, this issue was raised repeatedly, and an 

account was kept of the number of such vehicles passing the Toll 

collection point on a daily basis. This data was made available to 

MSRDC at regular intervals (as well as to the Municipal 

Authorities), and MSRDC by and large appeared to have accepted 

the claim of PLUS and even took up the matter with the concerned 

Municipal Commissioners. The Tribunal, therefore, held that PLUS 

made several efforts to prevail upon the concerned Municipal 

undertakings to issue necessary directions for the Municipal buses 

to pay the Toll. In these circumstances, the Tribunal was of the view 

that PLUS had exercised necessary due diligence and precipitating 

the matters any further could have had serious law and order 

repercussions, as well as an impact on traffic regulation at the Toll 

Plaza. The Tribunal, therefore, came to a finding that the steps 

necessary in the circumstances to overcome the Force Majeure 

Event were duly taken by PLUS. Finally, even the loss of revenue to 

PLUS from non-payment of Toll by so many vehicles making so 

many trips over so many months, clearly amounted to a material 

adverse effect on the project. The Tribunal held that there is ample 

correspondence to show that the failure to collect Toll contributed to 

the cash flow issues faced by PLUS, which had an impact on loan

servicing as well as operational expenses. The Tribunal, therefore, 

was of the view that there was a material adverse effect on the 

project. Accordingly, the non-payment of Toll by the Municipal buses 

was a Force Majeure event within the meaning of Clause 29.1 of the 

Concession Agreement. Since the said event subsisted for more 

than 180 days within a continuous period of 365 days (it 

commenced on 22 nd August, 2009, from which date the Toll 

collection commenced, and continued up till the termination date 

and beyond), it did give rise to a right to terminate the Concession 

Agreement under Clause 29.8. The Tribunal, therefore, held that 

the termination notice was valid on this ground. 

63. 
The third Force Majeure Event which was alleged by 

PLUS was the traffic regulation banning the entry of heavy vehicles 

during certain specified hours. It was the case of PLUS that this 

amounted to a change in law, or alternatively expropriation of its 

rights, and therefore, a Political Force Majeure Event occurred. In 

response to this, MSRDC contended that the ban on heavy vehicles 

pre-dated the Agreement, and PLUS was aware of this fact, or at any 

rate, ought to have been aware. MSRDC relied on a Resolution of the 

Municipal Corporation, which notes that "heavy vehicles are allowed 

::: Uploaded on -19/04/2021 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 83 of 169 

to run on this road from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. and it should not be 

changed." The Tribunal found that this resolution was not a public 

document and PLUS, therefore, cannot be expected to be aware of it. 

Further, even if the said decision was communicated to MSRDC, it 

was for MSRDC to refer to it in the Project Information 

Memorandum (PIM). 
The PIM, however, contained no such 

reference and bids were invited on the basis that heavy commercial 

vehicles would be part of the traffic flow which determines the 

revenue base of PLUS. The Tribunal thereafter held that in any 

event PLUS is correct to point out that (i) the restrictions that were 

imposed in May 2009 went further and beyond the resolution to 

impose a total ban on entry of certain categories of vehicles; and (ii) 

the Notifications were statutory Notifications issued under the 

Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and it was only with the issuance of such 

Notifications that a ban/restriction operationally came into effect. 

The Tribunal noted that it is not even MSRDC's contention that prior 

to this, there was any such Notification issued under the Motor 

Vehicles Act, 1988. The Tribunal, therefore, was of the view that 

this amounted to a change in law and in the alternative would, in 

any event, amount to an expropriation of the rights of PLUS as the 

project bid had been made on the basis of certain traffic projections.

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 84 of 169 

The ban/restrictions that were imposed on various categories of 

vehicles had a drastic effect on those projections, as it severely 

curtailed the heavy vehicular traffic on the said road. Thus, the 

Tribunal was of the view that there was a Political Force Majeure 

Event. The Tribunal held that all other ingredients of the Force 

Majeure Event were also made out. It noted that PLUS was 

prevented from performing its obligations (collecting Toll) under the 

agreement. It was also prevented for reasons beyond its control and 

not on account of its own fault. PLUS did exercise the necessary due 

diligence to overcome this event by taking up the issue with the 

police authorities as well as with MSRDC and undoubtedly the event 

had a material adverse effect on the project, as the amount of 

uncollected Toll was allegedly in excess of Rs.60 Crores. Further, 

the event subsisted for the requisite period as specified under Clause 

29.8 of the agreement, and therefore, PLUS was justified in 

terminating the Agreement. The Tribunal, therefore, held that the 

termination on this ground was valid. In conclusion, the Tribunal 

held that as far as the termination on account of Force Majeure is 

concerned, the validity of the said termination is upheld to the 

extent it was occasioned by non-payment of Toll by Municipal buses 

and the traffic restrictions on heavy vehicular traffic. The Tribunal

Page 85 of 169 

also noted that the termination on the ground of non-issuance of the 

Toll Notification for the extended period pursuant to an alleged 

settlement/ agreement between the parties, stood rejected. 

64. 
Looking at the facts adverted to by the Tribunal (set out 

above) and its findings in relation thereto, I find that the Tribunal 

has carefully examined all the facts, including the correspondence 

between the parties and thereafter come to its conclusion. I am in 

full agreement with Mr. Khambatta that all these findings are really 

findings of facts. Clause 6.1 of the Concession Agreement clearly 

stipulates that the right to claim Toll is an entitlement of PLUS. 

Refusal to pay Toll by KDMT and NMMT buses was held as 

amounting to expropriation or taking away the rights of PLUS to 

collect Toll from these buses in accordance with the Toll 

Notification. It is not as if PLUS sat idle and did nothing. This issue 

was specifically taken up by PLUS with KDMT & NMMT, and MSRDC 

was also alerted of the same. In fact, PLUS also kept an account of all 

these buses passing through the Toll Plaza without paying Toll and 

which was regularly submitted to MSRDC. It can therefore hardly 

be contended that in such a scenario the same did not have a 

material adverse effect on the project. Merely because the exact loss

wasn't quantified would make little difference. The fact that these 

buses (and which were large in number) were to pay Toll and which 

they refused to do, would clearly indicate that there was a material 

adverse effect on the project. Further, these Government buses were 

specifically shown in the PIM and the Concession Agreement as 

category of vehicles which would pay Toll and were not listed as 

exempted vehicles. In fact, by its letter dated 18 th July, 2011, 

MSRDC informed the Transport Commissioner of KDMT that PLUS 

had the right to collect Toll under the Concession Agreement. 

MSRDC also wrote to the Government of Maharashtra asking it to 

ensure that KDMT and NMMT buses pay the Toll, failing which 

MSRDC itself would have to pay the balance Toll. This is a clear 

admission on the part of MSRDC that KDMT and NMMT were 

refusing to pay Toll. Even if I was to assume for the sake of argument 

that certain correspondence between MSRDC and PLUS forming the 

subject matter of the Arbitration are inadmissible (and which I have 

rejected earlier), the letters written by MSRDC to the Transport 

Commissioner of KDMT and to the Government of Maharashtra is 

correspondence addressed to third parties, and therefore, can never 

amount to correspondence entered into between MSRDC and PLUS 

during conciliation proceedings.

65. 
Even the Notifications issued under the Motor Vehicles 

Act, 1988 banning of heavy vehicles, MSRDC admits that PLUS has 

a right to collect Toll from heavy and multi axle vehicles. This is 

evident from the letter dated 2 nd August, 2010 written by MSRDC to 

the Police authorities asking them to lift the ban on multi axle 

vehicles. Even upon the termination of the Concession Agreement, 

MSRDC began collecting Toll and itself wrote several letters to the 

Chief Secretary, Home Department asking for lifting the traffic ban 

on heavy vehicles. When one looks at the findings given by the 

Tribunal, I find that the Tribunal has given appropriate and cogent 

reasons for upholding the termination of the Concession Agreement 

under Clause 29.8 thereof. The Tribunal has considered the 

relevant documents and the evidence on record, the arguments 

canvassed by the parties and thereafter come to its conclusion. Not 

only do I find that the said conclusion is correct, but even otherwise 

it is certainly a plausible conclusion. The Tribunal has considered 

everything on record and thereafter held that the Concession 

Agreement is validly terminated due to Force Majeure Events. I do 

not find anything patently illegal or perverse in the said findings so 

as to interfere with the same under Section 34 of the Act. I am

unable to agree with the submissions of Mr. Chagla that the findings 

in the impugned Award on this issue are either contradictory or 

ignores any vital evidence. The Tribunal has considered all the 

evidence, including the so called admission made by the witness of 

PLUS. What weightage is to be given to the evidence is left entirely 

upto the Tribunal and this Court is not supposed to sit in appeal and 

re-examine and re-appreciate the evidence. The Tribunal, after 

noting the admission, held that one isolated statement cannot form 

a basis of their finding. The entirety of the documents on record has 

to be looked into, as well as the evidence, to ascertain whether in 

fact PLUS was prevented in performance of its obligations. I do not 

find that the approach of the Tribunal in this regard can be faulted. 

As mentioned earlier, I find that the impugned Award on this issue 

has given appropriate and cogent reasoning which requires no 

interference. In these circumstances, in so far as the Tribunal holds 

that the Concession Agreement was validly terminated under clause 

29.8 (due to Force Majeure Events) requires no interference by this 

Court. 

66. 
Apart from upholding the termination of the Concession 

Agreement due to Force Majeure Events, the Tribunal also held that

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 89 of 169 

the said Agreement was validly terminated under Clause 32.4 on 

account of material defaults by MSRDC. The discussion and the 

findings with reference to termination under Clause 32.4 can be 

found from paragraphs 65 to 70 of the impugned Award. In 

paragraph 65, the Tribunal held that the termination notice refers 

to a letter dated 10 th May, 2010 and the letters issued earlier to it, 

which are stated to be relied upon by PLUS. However, the letters do 

not actually refer to six claims, but rather only to the claim for 

'additional direct cost'. This claim was forwarded by letter dated 

24 th February, 2010 wherein PLUS claimed an amount of Rs.161 

Crores as the escalated project cost on account of material default 

by MSRDC. Subsequently, this claim was pursued by further letters 

and finally by means of the letter dated 10 th May, 2010 PLUS 

proposed conciliation. Thus, the offer for conciliation was in relation 

to the claim of the 'additional direct cost' and not the other claims. 

The Tribunal noted that it is true that other claims had also been 

raised by that time and those were by means of separate letters and 

were separately pursued. It is only much later that the IC, by its 

communication dated 2 nd August, 2011, clubbed various claims 

under six heads and which I have adverted to earlier. The Tribunal 

therefore, proceeded to examine whether any defaults by MSRDC

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 90 of 169 

furnished a valid basis for terminating the Concession Agreement 

under clause 32.4. The Tribunal noted that the principal claim with 

respect to material default is the claim for 'additional direct cost'. 

This claim has been clubbed with the claim of project costs together 

with escalated project costs. PLUS contended that this claim arises 

due to default on the part of the MSRDC to complete the land 

acquisition process in a timely manner and also on account of delays 

in getting design approvals from the Railway Authorities in respect 

of the Katai ROB. The discussion on this can be found in paragraph 

70 of the Award which reads thus:-

"70 The principal claim with respect to material default is the 
claim for direct additional cost. This claim has been clubbed with 
the claim for variation in project work. Together, they resulted in an 
escalation of project cost. Together, they resulted in an escalation 
of project cost. The Claimant's contention is that the delay resulted 
on account of the failure of the MSRDC to complete the land 
acquisition process in a timely manner, and also on account of 
delays in getting design approvals from the Railway Authorities in 
respect of Katai ROB. As a factual matter, on a review of the 
documentary record, it is very clear that the delays did in fact take 
place, and that these delays were acknowledged both by the IC 
and the MSRDC. Two days before construction was scheduled to 
be completed, in its letter dated 22.2.2008, the MSRDC noted that 
95% of the project work was complete, and the remaining could not 
be completed because of land acquisition issues and delays in 
getting approvals. This was also acknowledged by the IC on 
several occasions. The details of this correspondence have 
already been set out in the factual narration above, and need not 
be repeated. The Claimant put forward a detailed summary of the 
various causes of delay in its communication dated 11.5.2009. This 
ultimately led to the construction period being extended, and a 
consequent extension in the concession period. However, by its 
communication dated 24.2.2010 (Exh. CD 52), the Claimant stated 

::: Uploaded on -19/04/2021 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 91 of 169 

that the revised project cost was in excess of Rs.280 crore, and 
made a claim for Rs.161.5 crore as direct additional cost (i.e. 
escalation in project cost because of the delays and defaults). It 
stated that it was an acknowledged and documented position that 
the MSRDC had defaulted in its obligations to make the project site 
available free from all encumbrances and to assist in the obtaining 
of all applicable permits. The claim, at that stage, was put forward 
both as a material default claim and as a force majeure claim. The 
Claimant sought compensation under Clause 31.2 and costs for 
subsisting force majeure under Clause 29.7 (c). However, in the 
subsequent termination notices, and in these proceedings, the 
claim for direct additional costs is presented only as a claim based 
on MSRDC's material default, and not as a force majeure claim. 
We are of the view that the record is replete with acknowledgments 
from IC and MSRDC regarding the delays that took place with 
regard to making available the project site. The record is further 
replete with correspondence from the Claimant pointing out how 
this delay is constraining its cash flow position, and jeopardizing 
operations. The terms of the Agreement leave no doubt that it was 
MSRDC's obligation to make the project site available, and MSRDC 
defaulted on this obligation. Thus, MSRDC was in breach of its 
obligations under Clause 4.1(b) of the Agreement, as well as 
Clauses 10.1 (i) , 10.1(ii) and 10.1(iii). Accordingly, there does exist 
a valid basis for termination both under Clause 32.4.1(1) and 
Clause 32.4.1(3). Accordingly, the termination for MSRDC default 
is upheld to this extent. We may clarify, here, that the default of 
MSRDC is not the failure to have a toll notification issued in respect 
of the proposed extended concession period. As we have notified 
earlier, there was no final settlement with regard to the extended 
concession period, as it was necessarily subject to approval from 
Government of Maharashtra, which approval was never 
forthcoming. However, the underlying defaults, which provided the 
basis for the direct additional cost claim, remain -and the Claimant 
was entitled to terminate the Agreement on this notice. We may 
further point out that although Clause 32.4 requires 90 days notice 
to be given, and the Claimant provided less than 90 days from its 
notice dated 19.3.2013, the notice period must be viewed in the 
overall context of the entirety of correspondence. The Claimant 
had held out the prospect of termination long before 19.3.2013, and 
had only refrained from issuing a formal notice at the specific 
request of MSRDC, with the assurance that matters would be 
sorted out. MSRDC had much more than the required 90 days 
notice period to actually cure the defaults, if it had so intended. 
Instead, it kept holding out a carrot to the Claimant, and dragging

matters perilously close to the expiry of the period covered by the 
toll notification. In these circumstances, in our view, the notice 
period must be held to have been complied with." 

(emphasis supplied) 

67. 
As can be seen from the paragraph reproduced above, 

the Tribunal opined that the record before the Tribunal was replete 

with acknowledgments from the IC and MSRDC regarding the delays 

that took place with regard to making available the project site. The 

record is replete with further correspondence from PLUS pointing 

out how this delay is constraining its cash flow position and 

jeopardizing operations. The Tribunal further held that the terms of 

the Agreement leave no doubt that it was MSRDC's obligation to 

make the project site available, and MSRDC defaulted on this 

obligation. MSRDC was, therefore, in breach of its obligations under 

Clause 4.1(d) as well as Clauses 10.1(i), 10.1(ii) and 10.1(iii). The 

Tribunal, therefore, came to a finding that there exists a valid basis 

for termination, both under clauses 32.4.1(1) and Clause 32.4.1(3). 

68. 
Before I examine this aspect, it would be apposite to set 

out clause 32.4.1 which reads thus:-

"32.4 Termination for MSRDC Event of Default.

clause and described as MSRDC's event of default, by giving a 90 

day notice in writing to MSRDC. In the event MSRDC's event of 

default has occurred because of PLUS' default or due to Force 

Majeure events, then PLUS would not be entitled to terminate 

Concession Agreement under the said clause. Clause 32.4.1(1) 

stipulates that PLUS is entitled to terminate if MSRDC is in breach of 

the Concession Agreement and such breach has a material adverse 

effect on PLUS and MSRDC has failed to cure such breach or take 

effective steps for curing the same within 90 days of receipt of a 

notice in that behalf from PLUS. Similarly, clause 32.4.1(3) 

stipulates that if MSRDC or the Government of Maharashtra or any 

Government Agency have, by an act of commission or omission 

created circumstances that had a material adverse effect on the 

performance of the obligations of PLUS and have failed to cure the 

same within 90 days of receipt of a notice issued by PLUS to MSRDC, 

PLUS would be entitled to terminate the Agreement. On a conjoint 

reading of clauses 32.4.1(1) and 32.4.1(3), it is clear that the 

following conditions need to be fulfilled: (i) that there is an event of 

default by MSRDC; (ii) The said default should have a material 

adverse effect on PLUS; (iii) PLUS must give a 90 day notice in 

writing to MSRDC to terminate the Concession Agreement; and (iv)

MSRDC fails to cure the said default / breach or take effective steps 

for curing the same within 90 days of receipt of such notice. 

70. 
In the present case, it is not in dispute that the 90 day 

notice (as contemplated in clause 32.4.1) was not given by PLUS to 

MSRDC. It is specifically recorded by the Tribunal in paragraph 70 

of the Award, that although clause 32.4 requires a 90 day notice to 

be given, and PLUS provided less than 90 days from its notice dated 

19 th March, 2013, the notice period must be viewed in the overall 

context. The Tribunal held that PLUS had held out the prospect of 

termination long before 19 th March, 2013 and it also refrained from 

issuing a formal notice at the specific request of MSRDC, with the 

assurance that matters would be sorted out. The Tribunal held that 

MSRDC had much more than the required 90 day notice period to 

actually cure the defaults, if it had so intended. Instead, it kept 

holding out a carrot to PLUS and dragging matters perilously close 

to the expiry of the period covered by the Toll Notification. It is in 

these circumstances that the Tribunal held that the notice period 

must be held to have been complied with.

THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT DATED AUGUST 25, 
2006 ("CONCESSION AGREEMENT") ENTERED INTO 
BETWEEN MAHARASHTRA STATE ROAD 
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION LIMITED ("MSRDC") 
AND PLUS BKSP TOLL LIMITED ("PLUS BKSP") 

Dear Sir, 

1. 
With reference to the Concession Agreement, 
PLUS BKSP had, vide a letter dated May 10, 
2010 and earlier letters, raised 6 claims on 
MSRDC which related to losses incurred by 
PLUS BKSP due to acts/ omissions/ delays in 
performance of obligations under the Concession 
Agreement by MSRDC. 

2. 
MSRDC subsequently made an offer of an 
amicable settlement to PLUS BKSP vide its letter 
dated October 20, 2011 ("Offer Letter"). In the 
said Offer Letter, MSRDC offered an extension of 
the Concession Period until July 10, 2024 in lieu 
of cash payments for compensating PLUS BKSP.

3. 
In the spirit of resolving the matter, PLUS BKSP 
has accepted MSRDC's offer; PLUS BKSP's 
acceptance is contained in its letter dated 
November 4, 2011 ("Acceptance Letter"). With the 
acceptance of MSRDC's offer, PLUS BKSP was 
hopeful that MSRDC will be able to expedite the 
issuance of toll notification until the proposed 
extended term of the Concession Agreement i.e. 
July 10, 2024 ("Toll Notification"). 

4. 
We note that unfortunately till date MSRDC has 
not been able to cause issuance of the Toll 
Notification while the present toll notification is 
due to end on April 28, 2013, which is fast 
approaching. 

5. 
Hence, we are hereby issuing this notice under 
Clause 32.4 of Concession Agreement. The 
breaches/ acts/ omissions by MSRDC under the 
Concession Agreement have caused a Material 
Adverse Effect on PLUS BKSP and thus, making 
PLUS BKSP entitled to compensation under 
Clause 31.2 and to exercise its right of 
termination under Clause 32.4. 

6. 
PLUS BKSP previously refrained to terminate the 
concession in response to MSRDC's request to 
do so in its letter dated Feb 8, 2013. Please note 
that PLUS BKSP will not be able to proceed with 
its operations beyond April 28, 2013 until the 
issuance of the Toll Notification. Therefore, kindly 
issue by April 28, 2013, the extension of the 
concession period and Toll Notification to July 10, 
2024. 
If MSRDC shall fail to do so, the 
Concession Agreement shall terminate on April 
28, 2013 and MSRDC shall be liable to pay us the 
Termination Payment as provided in Clause 
32.4.2 and the settlement of claims as provided in 
Clause 31.2 both with interest until date of 
payment.

Without prejudice to any rights accrued/ available 
to PLUS BKSP under law or otherwise, the 
Parties shall continue to be bound by the clauses 
of the Concession Agreement which survive 
termination, including without limitation, the 
clauses relating to Termination Payment, 
Compensation, 
Divestment 
Requirements, 
release of funds lying in Escrow Account and 
release of Performance Security.

For avoidance of doubt, it is hereby clarified that 
the initially capitalized term used herein but not

assigned to them in the Concession Agreement.

From the aforesaid termination notice, it is clear that 

the said notice was issued under clause 32.4 of the Concession 

Agreement. Clause 32.4.1 clearly required PLUS to give a 90 day 

notice in writing to MSRDC for terminating the Agreement upon 

occurrence and continuation of any of the events of default as set 

out therein. The 90 day period was to enable MSRDC to cure any 

breach or to take effective steps for curing the same. However, in 

the aforesaid notice, PLUS requests MSRDC to issue, by 28 th April,

2013, the extension of the concession period and the Toll 

Notification upto 10 th July, 2024 failing which the Concession 

Agreement is to stand terminated on 28 th April, 2013. From the 

aforesaid notice it is clear that time was granted to MSRDC to cure 

any defect on its part from 19 th March, 2013 to 28 th April, 2013. 

This is far less than the period of 90 days as stipulated in clause 

32.4.1. On a plain reading of the said notice, I find that the 

submission of Mr. Chagla is well founded when he submits that the 

findings given by the Tribunal that MSRDC had much more than 90 

days to cure the breaches, is factually incorrect. I must mention that 

the Tribunal whilst coming to the aforesaid finding opined that PLUS 

had held out the prospect of termination long before 19 th March, 

2013 and refrained from issuing a formal notice at the specific 

request of MSRDC. In this regard, the only letter referred to by the 

Tribunal is a letter dated 4 th February, 2013 issued by PLUS to 

MSRDC (paragraph 43 of the impugned Award). By the said letter, 

PLUS informs MSRDC that in the spirit of amicable settlement, PLUS 

desires to draw the attention of MSRDC to the Toll Notification 

which is valid upto 28 th April, 2013 whereas their actual original 

concession period runs upto 3 rd March, 2015. It therefore informs 

MSRDC that despite the present Toll Notification expiring less than

90 days from the date of the said letter, PLUS' right to serve a 

termination notice under the Concession Agreement remains intact 

and in full force and they reserve their right to exercise the right of 

termination any time before 28 th April, 2013 and such notice, if and 

when served upon MSRDC, shall be fully binding on MSRDC with 

respect to its obligation to pay Termination Payment as certified by 

the statutory auditors of PLUS. This letter is clearly not a 

termination notice as contemplated under clause 32.4.1 of the 

Concession Agreement. Be that as it may, even if I was to assume 

that this letter is a notice as contemplated under clause 32.4.1, the 

time period between 4 th February, 2013 till 28 th April, 2013 (the 

date on which the Toll Notification came to an end), still does not 

comply with the period of 90 days, as contemplated under the 

aforesaid clause. I am in agreement with Mr. Chagla that 

termination of a contract has serious consequences. Therefore, 

termination under clause 32.4.1 requires strict compliance. Failure 

to give notice of 90 days would clearly render the termination under 

clause 32.4.1 of the Concession Agreement illegal and invalid. I 

therefore am of the view that the finding of the Tribunal in so far as 

it upholds the termination of the Concession Agreement under 

clause 32.4 suffers from a patent illegality as its findings run in the

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc

Page 101 of 169 

teeth of the plain language of clause 32.4.1 and hence cannot be 

sustained. 

73. 
As far as the argument of Mr. Chagla that the 

actions/omissions of MSRDC did not have a material adverse effect 

on the project, I am unable to agree with the same as that is a 

question of fact which is examined by the Tribunal. The Tribunal 

finds that the record is replete with correspondence from PLUS 

pointing out how this delay is constraining its cash flow position, 

and jeopardizing operations. This would clearly amount to a 

material adverse effect on the project. However, as mentioned 

earlier, termination under Clause 32.4.1 cannot be held to be valid 

in view of the fact that a 90 day notice was not given by PLUS to 

MSRDC as contemplated in clause 32.4.1 of the Concession 

Agreement. 

74. 
Despite having held that the termination of the 

Concession Agreement under clause 32.4 cannot be held to be valid, 

I find that it makes little difference in the present matter. As noted 

earlier, the Concession Agreement could be terminated under 

Clauses 29.8 as well as 32.4. Even if one of them is held to be valid

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 102 of 169 

then the Concession Agreement would stand validly terminated. 

Considering that I have held that the findings of the Tribunal 

regarding termination of the Concession Agreement under Clause 

29.8 does not require any interference, it makes little difference 

whether termination under Clause 32.4 is held valid or otherwise. 

This is more so when one takes into consideration that the 

Termination Payment formula under clause 29.9(c) and 32.4.2 is 

exactly the same. 

III(A) -AWARD IS CONTRARY TO THE PROCEDURE 
AGREED UPON BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS PER SECTION

TRIBUNAL; AND 

III(C) -FAILURE OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL TO 
CONSIDER/DECIDE THE COUNTER CLAIM FILED BY 
MSRDC: 

SUBMISSIONS OF MSRDC: 

75. 
As mentioned earlier, I find that the aforesaid three 

grounds of challenge, namely: (i) the Award is contrary to the 

procedure agreed to between the parties; (ii) the failure of the 

Tribunal to consider / decide the Counter Claim of MSRDC; and (iii)

Page 103 of 169 

legal misconduct on the part of the Tribunal; are all inter-twined 

together and hence these three grounds are being decided together. 

76. 
Firstly, Mr. Chagla submitted that the Tribunal, with the 

consent of the parties, laid down the entire schedule for the arbitral 

proceedings as recorded in the minutes of the meeting dated 20 th 

February, 2016. In the said minutes, the Tribunal passed a detailed 

procedural order wherein the Tribunal made it clear that the dates 

fixed for hearing, i.e. for the evidence and final arguments were 

inflexible. Mr. Chagla submitted that the Tribunal reiterated upon 

the inflexibility of the aforesaid dates in its further procedural 

orders dated 4 th May, 2016 and 12 th May, 2016. He submitted that 

on a conjoint reading of the procedural orders passed by the 

Tribunal from time to time, namely, procedural orders dated 20 th 

February, 2016, 4 th May, 2016, 12 th May, 2016 and 17 th October, 

2016, read along with the transcripts dated 17 th January, 2017, 

20 th January, 2017, 3 rd February, 2017 and 4 th February, 2017, 

establish beyond a doubt that the dates fixed by the Tribunal were 

not only inflexible, but the proceedings were to be conducted as one 

consolidated proceeding and the Tribunal was to pass one Award. 

He submitted that the Tribunal's directions to make payment of the

CARBP371.17.doc

Page 104 of 169 

full fees for hearings scheduled on 17 th January, 2017 to 21 st 

January, 2017 and thereafter from 31 st January, 2017 to 4 th 

February, 2017 also indicated that there was to be only one 

consolidated hearing and was not to be broken up, as was done in 

the present case. He submitted that the transcript of 4 th February, 

2017, and which was the last date of hearing, expressly records that 

arguments were closed. 

77. 
Mr. Chagla submitted that party autonomy is considered 

to be the backbone of arbitration and failure to follow the procedure 

agreed upon between the parties vitiates the entire arbitral 

procedure. He submitted that by its procedural order dated 17 th 

October, 2016, the Tribunal directed that all documents were taken 

on record, subject to the proof of objection as to admissibility. PLUS 

filed four affidavits of evidence and MSRDC filed three affidavits of 

evidence on record along with all the documentary evidence in their 

custody. He submitted that in the present case, the parties led 

evidence before the Arbitral Tribunal, both oral and documentary. 

Parties also advanced oral arguments and filed written submissions 

in support of their respective cases. At no point of time did PLUS 

seek an opportunity to lead any further evidence or to amend its

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 105 of 169 

claims. The Arbitral Tribunal was, therefore, bound to decide all 

issues as set out in paragraph 54 of the Award and not break up the 

hearing as was sought to be done by the impugned Award. Mr. 

Chagla submitted that what was even more shocking was that after 

considering the complete evidence and the submission of the parties, 

the Tribunal rejected certain specific claims of PLUS and expressed 

its inability to decide the other claims on the available evidence. He 

submitted that the parties are required in law to produce all 

evidence in support of their case which, in the present case, PLUS 

claimed it had done and having regard to the findings of the Arbitral 

Tribunal, the claims of PLUS ought to have been dismissed. He 

submitted that the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal amount to a final 

adjudication and the nomenclature "Interim Award" is misplaced 

and unwarranted and has been done only to permit PLUS to file 

further pleadings and lead further evidence. Mr. Chagla submitted 

that, in effect, the Tribunal ex-facie seeks to review its own final 

adjudication, which is impermissible in law. 

78. 
Mr. Chagla thereafter brought to my attention the 

findings of the Arbitral Tribunal in respect of various claims made 

by PLUS. The first claim made by PLUS was for Termination

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 106 of 169 

Payment of Rs.495 crores. Mr. Chagla submitted that this claim was 

purportedly made under clause 29.9(c) and clause 32.4.2 of the 

Concession Agreement. He submitted that it was the express case of 

PLUS that Termination Payment became mechanically / 

automatically due and payable on the expiry of thirty days from the 

date of the Statutory Auditor's certificate certifying the 

'Termination Payment' being submitted to MSRDC. It was also the 

contention of PLUS that once the same became due and payable, 

there was no mechanism in the Concession Agreement to reverse 

the same and no further evidence, apart from the Statutory 

Auditor's certificate, was required to be led by it to prove its claim. 

MSRDC, on the other hand, contended that as per the formula for 

the calculation of Termination Payment, the same could not be 

applied mechanically and that damages could not be awarded unless 

PLUS proved that it had suffered actual losses / damages and the 

quantum thereof. Mr. Chagla submitted that in this connection, the 

Arbitral Tribunal in paragraph 72 of the Award has, inter alia, held 

as under: 

"Prima facie the Tribunal would need to be satisfied about the 
element of proportionality in the working of the Termination 
Payment clause. We notice that the MSRDC has strongly contested

CARBP371.17.doc

Page 107 of 169 

the Termination Payment also on the ground of each individual 
head that is to be calculated under the formula, and it would be 
beneficial to the Tribunal to invite further hearing and 
on this issue." 

79. 
Mr. Chagla submitted that if the Tribunal required any 

further hearings and submissions, it should have fixed such further 

hearings and heard the submissions on the issue and not defer the 

same to a further arbitral hearing after passing the impugned 

Award. He submitted that, in effect, when one reads the aforesaid 

paragraph, the claims of PLUS, on the available evidence and 

submissions, stood rejected. 

80. 
Mr. Chagla submitted that similar is the case for the 

claim of Rs.469 crores and which is in the alternative to the claim 

for Termination Payment. He submitted that the alternative claim 

of Rs.469 crores was allegedly based on amounts invested by the 

shareholders of PLUS. He submitted that the Tribunal held that this 

figure was virtually a proxy claim for Termination Payment. In 

view of this finding, the Tribunal ought to have rejected this claim. 

Instead, the Tribunal held that since the Tribunal is inclined to defer 

its decision on the issue of Termination Payment, the decision on

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 108 of 169 

this alternative claim also stood deferred. In this regard, Mr. Chagla 

brought to my attention, paragraph 73 of the Award. 

81. 
Mr. Chagla then brought to my attention that over and 

above the aforesaid two claims, a claim of Rs.112 crores was also 

made for reimbursement of 'additional direct cost', the loss of Toll 

revenue and restoration charges. 
In the arbitration, PLUS 

proceeded on the express basis that these amounts were admitted 

by MSRDC in the correspondence exchanged in the course of 

settlement/conciliation. However, the Tribunal conclusively held 

that these cannot be said to constitute admissions of quantum of 

liability as placing weight on the quantum figures exchanged 

between the parties while working out a compromise would not be 

fair as they were made during the course of settlement. In this 

regard, Mr. Chagla brought to my attention the finding of the 

Tribunal in paragraph 77 of the Award. He submitted that the 

Tribunal further held that the same would not be a sound basis to 

arrive at any conclusion on the quantum of loss. It was the 

submission of Mr. Chagla that reading paragraphs 77, 79 and 86 of 

the Award clearly constituted a rejection of PLUS' claims.

CARBP371.17.doc

Page 109 of 169 

82. 
Mr. Chagla then submitted that the finding of the 

Arbitral Tribunal in paragraph 86 of the Award, namely, "The 

Tribunal cannot arrive at a quantum determination based on the 

existing record and submissions" applied to all claims made by PLUS 

and is final and binding. The said finding has not been challenged by 

PLUS and has, therefore, attained finality and operates as res 

judicata and/or issue estoppel between the parties. Mr. Chagla 

submitted that looking at the way the matter progressed before the 

Arbitral Tribunal (and which is clear from the different Procedural 

Orders as well as the transcripts referred to above), what emerges is 

that (i) there was to be one consolidated hearing determining the 

claims of PLUS as well as the Counter Claim filed by MSRDC; (ii) the 

dates fixed by the Tribunal were to be strictly adhered to and were 

inflexible; (iii) the evidence of both parties was complete; (iv) 

arguments on all the issues were addressed before the Tribunal and 

even the written submissions filed by both parties covered the claim 

and the Counter Claim on all issues; (v) the hearing was finally 

concluded on 4 th February, 2017 and the matter was stood over only 

for pronouncement of the Award. He submitted that from the record 

it was clear that no further hearing was contemplated except a short 

focused hearing, if required by the Tribunal and that too after they

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 110 of 169 

perused the written submissions filed by the parties. He submitted 

that no further procedural order was passed after 4 th February, 

2017 and no further hearing was held before the passing of the 

Interim Award, either for a clarification or otherwise. He submitted 

that neither the parties nor the Tribunal ever contemplated the 

passing of an Interim Award and deferring the hearing on the 

quantum at a later date. He submitted that, in fact, the parties had 

led their entire evidence before the Arbitral Tribunal and the 

Tribunal, therefore, could not have given the directions it did in 

paragraphs 77, 79, 84 and 85 of the impugned Award. Mr. Chagla 

submitted that in effect, once having come to the conclusion that the 

evidence led by PLUS was inadequate to decide on the quantum of 

the claims, it should have rejected the claims of PLUS for want of 

evidence. Instead, it has effectively allowed PLUS to improve its 

case by leading further evidence, if necessary. Mr. Chagla submitted 

that this was wholly impermissible in law, especially considering 

that the Tribunal itself had made it clear that there would be only 

one Award for the entire proceedings and both parties had led their 

respective evidence in its entirety to prove their respective claims. 

In these circumstances, there was no question of allowing either 

party to lead further evidence to prove their claims. If the evidence

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 111 of 169 

was inadequate, the only option available to the Tribunal was to 

reject the claims. He submitted that adoption of such a procedure by 

the Tribunal not only vitiates the Award on the ground of 

perversity, but also suffers from a patent illegality, and clearly 

amounts to legal misconduct on the part of the Arbitral Tribunal. 

Mr. Chagla submitted that the record would clearly establish that 

the counsel for MSRDC asked for further time for cross-examination 

and for presentation of its arguments which was rejected by the 

Tribunal. However, the Tribunal nevertheless granted liberty to 

PLUS to fill up any lacuna in its pleadings and evidence by making 

the observations as mentioned in paragraphs 77, 79 and 85 of the 

Award. This clearly amounted to legal misconduct on the part of the 

Tribunal and which indicated a definite bias in favour of PLUS and 

against MSRDC. To put it in a nutshell, Mr. Chagla submitted that 

the Tribunal had not treated the parties equally and had acted in 

violation of section 18 of the Act and would, therefore, clearly 

amount to legal misconduct on the part of the Tribunal. 

83. 
Lastly, Mr. Chagla submitted that the transcripts clearly 

show that the procedure was agreed and the parties also always 

understood that there would be one consolidated Award and one

consolidated proceeding, including a decision on the Counter Claim 

filed by MSRDC. Though MSRDC made a Counter Claim of around 

Rs.93 crores under twelve different heads, and despite the Tribunal 

framing an issue as to what would be the amount to which MSRDC 

would be entitled to on account of its Counter Claim, the finding of 

the Arbitral Tribunal in paragraph 85 of the Award that sufficient 

time was not devoted to the Counter Claim is patently illegal and 

perverse considering that pursuant to the directions passed by the 

Tribunal, both, the claim and Counter Claim were heard. In fact, the 

parties filed their detailed written submissions in support of and in 

reply to the Counter Claim. Despite this, the fact that the Counter 

Claim was not adjudicated upon by the Arbitral Tribunal vitiates the 

Award. In support of this submission, Mr. Chagla relied upon the 

following: 

a. 
An Award should be final and the arbitrator cannot, in 
his Award, reserve to himself the power of performing in 
future, any act of a judicial nature in respect of the 
matters submitted. [Russel on the Law of Arbitration 
24 th Edition, para (b)] 

b. 
Failure by the arbitral tribunal to deal with all the issues 
that were put to it would amount to serious irregularity 
and the Award can be challenged on that ground

entire Award is vitiated as the same was in violation of the agreed 

procedure as contemplated under section 19, legal misconduct on 

the part of the Tribunal as well as on the ground that it failed to 

consider the Counter Claim filed by MSRDC. Consequently, he 

submitted that the arbitration Petition be allowed and the impugned 

Award be set aside. 

SUBMISSIONS OF PLUS: 

85. 
On the other hand, Mr. Khambatta, the learned senior 

counsel appearing on behalf of PLUS submitted that the entire 

decision to bifurcate the arbitral proceedings into two phases, first 

to make an Interim Award and thereafter defer the hearing to 

decide on the quantum of the claims was neither contrary to the 

agreed procedure and nor was it patently illegal or against the

fundamental policy of Indian law. He submitted that the Tribunal is 

empowered to devise its own procedure. In this regard, he brought 

to my attention, sections 19(2) and 19(3) of the Act which, inter 

alia, stipulate that subject to Part I of the Act, the parties are free to 

agree on the procedure to be followed by the Arbitral Tribunal in 

conducting the proceedings and failing any such agreement between 

the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal may conduct the proceedings in 

the manner it considers appropriate. Mr. Khambatta submitted that 

section 19(3) of the Act clearly empowers the Tribunal to devise its 

own procedure, unless there is an agreement between the parties to 

the contrary. It was his submission that in the present case, there 

was no agreement regarding the procedure to be followed by the 

Tribunal and, therefore, the Tribunal devised its own procedure 

under section 19(3). He submitted that in its procedural order 

dated 20 th February, 2016, the Tribunal gave directions in respect of 

the procedure it proposed to follow. This was after discussion with 

the parties who agreed to the practice and procedure suggested by 

the Tribunal. Mr. Khambatta submitted that these directions were 

not exhaustive of the procedure and neither did they restrict the 

Tribunal to pass a single unified Award. He submitted that under 

section 19(3) of the Act, the Arbitrators have procedural autonomy,

unless the same is restricted or modified by the parties by 

agreement. He submitted that in the facts of the present case, there 

is no restriction placed by the parties on the Tribunal's power to 

bifurcate the proceedings and to pass two Awards. Mr. Khambatta 

strongly relied upon paragraph 15 of the procedural order dated 

20 th February, 2016 to contend that the Tribunal expressly 

reserved the discretion to itself to amend or modify the procedure 

pursuant to such further directions or procedural orders as the 

Tribunal may, from time to time, consider necessary. He submitted 

that the said procedural order was passed after discussion with the 

parties who agreed to the practice and procedure to be followed, 

including paragraph 15 of the said order. Thus, the Tribunal was 

entitled to amend the procedure for conducting the proceedings if it 

considered it necessary, was the submission of Mr. Khambatta. In 

any event, Mr. Khambatta submitted that the said procedural order 

did not exclude the power of the Tribunal under section 19(3) of the 

Act to determine the procedure nor did it describe that there would 

be only one final Award. 
He, therefore, submitted that the 

submission of Mr. Chagla that the procedure contemplated by the 

Tribunal was to pass one final Award is not well founded.

86. 
Mr. Khambatta then submitted that it is not uncommon 

in both International and domestic arbitrations for a Tribunal to 

pass an Interim or Partial Award, bifurcating the proceedings. 

Under section 2(c) of the Act, an Arbitral Award includes an Interim 

Award. Section 31(6) of the Act provides for passing an Interim 

Award. The Interim Award is a final Award in relation to issues 

which are finally decided therein. An Interim Award finally decides 

an issue without necessarily disposing off all the claims. He 

submitted that the term "Interim Award" is often used 

synonymously with the term "Partial Award". In the present case, 

Mr. Khambatta pointed out that by way of an Interim Award, issues 

(a) and (b) [framed by the Tribunal in paragraph 54 of the Award] 

regarding the validity of the termination notices were finally 

decided by the Tribunal and issues (c) and (d) relating to quantum 

of the claims [of PLUS] and the Counter Claims [of MSRDC] were 

deferred to the second phase. He submitted that there was 

absolutely nothing wrong in the Tribunal adopting this procedure, 

especially considering that the Tribunal was empowered to do so 

under section 19(3) of the Act. He submitted that this has also been 

held to be valid by the Supreme Court in the case of McDermott 

International Inc. vs. Burn Standard Company Ltd. & Ors.,

[(2006) 11 SCC 181]. Mr. Khambatta submitted that even under 

section 27 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 [corresponding to section 

31(6) of the Act], the Arbitral Tribunal had the power to make an 

Interim Award, deciding the question of liability first and permitting 

the leading of evidence thereafter on the question of damages. In 

this regard, Mr. Khambatta relied upon a decision of a Division 

Bench of this Court in the case of Manganese Ore (India) Ltd. & 

Ors. Vs. Ram Bahadur Thakur Limited [2006 SCC Online Bom. 

507]. Mr. Khambatta submitted that even the second edition of 

Gary B. Born, International Commercial Edition recognises the 

utility and benefits of bifurcating the proceedings and the passing of 

Interim or Partial Awards. Only clear and unambiguous language 

should be permitted to produce the unusual and inefficient result of 

denying the arbitrators the authority to make Partial Awards. 

Allowing the arbitrator to pass Partial Awards enables the Tribunal 

and the parties to focus on and resolve issues sequentially, rather 

than in a single decision. This sometimes has very significant 

advantages in terms of efficiency and speed. A Tribunal's decision 

whether or not to bifurcate proceedings and to resolve certain issues

before others usually turns on minute assessments of efficiency that 

are the domain of the Arbitral Tribunal, was the submission. 

87. 
Mr. Khambatta then submitted that PLUS has placed all 

material / proof in support of its claims before the Tribunal including 

the one for Termination Payment. What the Tribunal has done is 

that it has only deferred the quantum of those claims and not 

rejected them as sought to be contended by Mr. Chagla. He 

submitted that Mr. Chagla's reliance on a single sentence of 

paragraph 86 of the impugned Award is completely misplaced and 

out of context. Mr. Khambatta submitted that the Concession 

Agreement provided for Termination Payment in terms of clause 

29.9(c) and 32.4.2 thereof and which are identical in nature. He 

submitted that such a clause is inserted to encourage Public Private 

Partnership. The concept of a Public Private Partnership (for short 

"PPP") Project is introduced to help in developing public 

infrastructure through private investment which otherwise would 

have to be funded by the Government. In PPP Projects, the concept 

of Termination Payment has been introduced by which, in the event 

of termination of the contract, regardless of who has committed the 

default, Termination Payment has to be paid by the Government or

the PSU in all cases of termination. This concept helps in attracting 

private entities and provides adequate security to the lenders as it is 

not possible to secure them through collateral assets as the assets 

belong to the public. He submitted that Termination Payment is not 

the same as damages or even liquidated damages. When the 

Concession Agreement is terminated for default by either party, the 

Government takes over the asset and the amount paid for such 

taking over of the asset is termed as 'Termination Payment'. 

Termination payment represents only a return on equity and 

repayment of debt as per the pre-agreed formula. On the other hand, 

damages or liquidated damages can never be claimed by a defaulting 

party whereas in case of Termination Payment in a PPP contract, 

even on the default of the Concessionaire, the Concessionaire would 

be entitled to Termination Payment. 

88. 
Mr. Khambatta submitted that all that the Tribunal has 

done is deferred the first claim for Termination Payment 

(Rs.4,95,80,21,040/-along with interest) to consider the issue of 

proportionality and which was actually done purely for the benefit 

of MSRDC. 
He submitted that all documents required for 

quantification of Termination Payment were duly filed and proved

by PLUS. The quantum of Termination Payment has to be done by 

applying the figures of debt, equity and subordinate debt to the 

formula as provided in clause 29.9(c) and 32.4.2 of the Concession 

Agreement and which are identical. 
He submitted that the 

Statutory Auditor's certificate, which provided the amount of 

Termination Payment payable, was never challenged by MSRDC. 

Under clause 28.1, the accounts of PLUS audited and certified by its 

Statutory Auditors would form the basis of various payments by 

either party under the Concession Agreement. MSRDC also chose 

not to appoint another firm of Chartered Accounts to audit and 

verify the Auditor's certificate which MSRDC was entitled to do as 

per clause 28.4. Reliance upon the Auditor's certificate by PLUS at 

paragraph 6.91 of the Statement of Claim was clearly met with 

merely a bald denial at paragraph 7.54 of the Statement of Defence. 

Hence, Mr. Khambatta submitted that as per clause 32.6 of the 

Concession Agreement, MSRDC was required to pay to PLUS the 

Termination Payment within thirty days of the demand being made 

by PLUS accompanied by such Statutory Auditor's certificate. Mr. 

Khambatta submitted that MSRDC accepts the fact that it is liable to 

make payment to PLUS. This is clear from the fact that the Toll 

Notifications that were issued by the Government of Maharashtra

Page 121 of 169 

after the termination of the Concession Agreement authorised 

MSRDC to collect the Toll and directed the amount so collected to be 

kept in an Escrow Account so that the same could be utilised to 

settle the claims of PLUS. 

89. 
Mr. Khambatta submitted that in paragraph 11 of the 

Interim Award, the Tribunal has observed that the point at which 

termination might take place did not have any bearing on the 

computation of the Termination Payment. 
Nevertheless, in 

paragraph 72, the Tribunal stated that it needed to be satisfied 

about the proportionality in the working of the Termination 

Payment clause as MSRDC had contested the said payment also 

under each individual head that was to be calculated under the 

formula and for this reason, the Tribunal wanted to have a further 

hearing and submissions. From all this material, Mr. Khambatta 

submitted that adopting proportionality as a factor in addition to the 

formula [as laid down in clauses 29.9(c) and 32.4.2], worked to 

MSRDC's advantage. Mr. Khambatta submitted that this was, in 

fact, done for the benefit and, in fact, benefitted MSRDC and, 

therefore, it does not lie in their mouth to contend that the Tribunal 

could not have done so. This is for the simple reason that otherwise

CARBP371.17.doc

Page 122 of 169 

PLUS would have been entitled to Termination Payment as per the 

formula set out in clauses 29.9(c) and 32.4.2 and which were 

identical in nature. The deferment to consider the proportionality 

was really for the benefit of MSRDC and not to the benefit of PLUS. 

90. 
Mr. Khambatta thereafter submitted that even the 

deferment of quantum of the second claim of PLUS towards damages 

on account of breaches committed by MSRDC (for Rs.112 crores) 

operates to the benefit of MSRDC and not to the benefit of PLUS. He 

submitted that this claim arose in terms of clause 32.8 of the 

Concession Agreement under the head "Other Claims". The loss 

suffered by PLUS was on account of breaches by MSRDC prior to the 

termination date. The loss had, therefore, accrued much before the 

termination and the amount would have merely compensated PLUS 

for the said loss. Mr. Khambatta submitted that PLUS had filed and 

proved documents in support of its claim by primarily relying on 

admissions by MSRDC on both, liability and quantum contained in 

MSRDC's various documents, including the letters dated 20 th 

October, 2011, 18 th July, 2011, 4 th March, 2008, 24 th / 25 th June, 

2009, 2 nd May, 2013, 2 nd August, 2010 and MSRDC's Director's 

Report for the year 2011. 
MSRDC had claimed that these

CARBP371.17.doc

Page 123 of 169 

documents were part of the conciliation proceedings and, therefore, 

inadmissible, which contention was rejected by the Tribunal. The 

Tribunal did not determine the quantum based on the figures quoted 

during the settlement discussions holding it would be unfair on 

MSRDC to do so. The Tribunal held that despite the fact that the 

documents were admissible, the Tribunal felt that it is still required 

to determine the weight that can be attached to these documents as 

evidence of an admitted quantum of loss. The Tribunal was of the 

view that it would be unfair on MSRDC to determine the issue of 

quantum with reference to the figures quoted during settlement 

discussions and in these circumstances, it would not be fair to place 

much weight on the quantum figures exchanged by the parties while 

working out the settlement. The Tribunal held that these cannot be 

said to constitute admissions of quantum of liability. Mr. Khambatta 

submitted that despite the fact that the amounts claimed under the 

head 'Other Claims' were admitted by MSRDC in various documents, 

the Tribunal nevertheless held as follows: 

"If, on the other hand, the Tribunal ultimately reaches the 
conclusion that the Termination Payment is not possible (despite 
there being a valid termination), then it is for the Claimant to prove 
and quantify the loss that it has suffered, and claim damages on 
that basis. The Tribunal is not inclined -at this stage -to award 
Rs. 112 crore in damages, based on any admissions by the 
MSRDC, as alleged. Since this figure is arrived at in course of

Page 124 of 169 

correspondence exchanged during the settlement phase, although 
the documentation itself is admissible, the Tribunal feels that it 
would not be a sound basis to arrive at any conclusion on the 
quantum of loss based on these figures alone. We are, therefore of 
the view that even on this issue, further hearing and submissions 
are required. We clarify that in making these submissions, the 
Claimant need not be restricted to the amounts allegedly admitted 
by MSRDC, but may even claim amounts higher than that should it 
elect to do so. However, if would need to prove and quantify its 
loss by leading appropriate evidence if necessary. Similarly, the 
MSRDC shall not be bound by any alleged admissions made during 
the settlement phase, but may independently rebut the Claimant's 
claim for damages, including by way of leading appropriate 
evidence if necessary." 

91. 
Mr. Khambatta submitted that it is in this context that 

the findings of the Tribunal have to be read and understood. When 

read and understood in that context, it is clear that the deferment 

was purely to benefit MSRDC and was not to be benefit of PLUS at 

all. This being the case, it can hardly lie in the mouth of MSRDC that 

any injustice has been done to them by the Tribunal by deferring the 

issue of quantum of PLUS' claims at a later stage. 

92. 
Even as far as MSRDC's Counter Claims are concerned 

(for Rs.93,04,88,558/-), Mr. Khambatta submitted that the same 

was deferred to allow MSRDC a full opportunity of presenting its 

case. Mr. Khambatta submitted that it is evident on a bare perusal 

of paragraph 85 of the Interim Award that the parties had filed

CARBP371.17.doc

several volumes in respect of the Counter Claims filed by MSRDC. 

However, during the hearings, sufficient attention was not devoted 

to the Counter Claims as the parties concentrated mainly on the 

claims made by PLUS and MSRDC's defence thereto. It was, 

therefore, decided by the Tribunal that it would not be fair to decide 

the rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to the Counter 

Claims without affording a fair opportunity to the parties to present 

their case qua each Counter Claim. It is in this light that the 

Tribunal, therefore, deferred the decision on the Counter Claim also 

to the second phase. Mr. Khambatta submitted that the Tribunal 

has thus given an opportunity to MSRDC to make good its case. It is 

in this context the one sentence relied upon by Mr. Chagla in 

paragraph 86 of the Interim Award has to be read and understood. 

Mr. Khambatta submitted that the Tribunal in paragraph 86, is not 

referring to insufficiency of evidence led by PLUS. In any event, 

whether or not the evidence was insufficient to award payment / 

damages is a matter to be dealt with while examining the final 

Award. Moreover, paragraph 87 of the Interim Award makes it 

clear that this observation is only prima facie in nature as the 

determinative findings in the Interim Award are only in respect of 

liability. He, therefore, submitted that all this clearly goes to show

CARBP371.17.doc

that there is absolutely no merit in the contention of Mr. Chagla that 

the Tribunal could not have bifurcated the proceedings which 

vitiates the Award. If this be the case, Mr. Khambatta submitted 

that there is no legal misconduct on the part of the Arbitral 

Tribunal. Consequently, he submitted that there was no merit in the 

aforesaid objection to the Interim Award and the same ought to be 

rejected. He therefore submitted that the above Petition has no 

merit and the same ought to be dismissed with costs. 

FINDING OF THE COURT: 

93. 
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at great 

length on this issue. To understand the present controversy, it 

would be necessary to understand how the arbitration proceedings 

progressed before the Arbitral Tribunal. On 20 th February, 2016, 

the Arbitral Tribunal passed a detailed procedural order giving 

various directions. A time-frame was set out by which the Statement 

of Claim as well as the Statement of Defence and Counter Claim were 

to be filed, so also the Statement of Defence of PLUS to MSRDC's 

Counter Claim. Directions were also given to MSRDC and PLUS to 

submit their affidavit of denial / dispute in respect of any document 

filed by each other and/or request for inspection and/or production

of documents. In the said procedural order, it was directed that the 

Tribunal will have sittings from 17 th January, 2017 to 21 st January, 

2017 for cross-examination of witnesses of each party by the other 

side and oral arguments would be heard by the Tribunal from 31 st 

January, 2017 to 4 th February, 2017. The timing for all sittings was 

fixed from 11.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. with an hour's break for lunch. In 

the said procedural order, Practice Directions under section 19(3) of 

the Act were also set out in great detail. The relevant portion of the 

Practice Directions read thus: 

"Practice Directions [under Section 19(3) of the 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996] 

After discussion, the Learned Counsel for the parties 
have agreed on the practice and procedure to be 
followed and in accordance therewith the following 
directions are issued by the Tribunal: 

1. Extension of time shall be granted by the Tribunal in its 

discretion: 

(a) in exceptional cases only; 
(b) provided that a request is submitted before the date 
scheduled; and 
(c) as soon as it appears that the deadline cannot be 
complied with. 

The Parties may also agree between themselves for 
short extensions of time, on the basis of mutual 
courtesy as long as those extensions do not materially 
affect the time table (the dates scheduled for the sittings 
of the Tribunal must not be affected) and that the 
Tribunal is informed prior to the scheduled deadline.

6. In arbitral disputes, it is not necessary to frame or 
settle issues. However, for the purpose of focusing 
attention of the parties and the Tribunal, the points for 
determination / list of disputes on which the Tribunal 
would be called upon to adjudicate may be settled. For 
this purpose, the Learned Counsel for the parties would 
exchange in advance draft / proposed points for 
determination (list of disputes) on which adjudication by 
the Tribunal would be needed. The Tribunal would 
appreciate if the Learned Counsel may sit together and 
file before the Tribunal an agreed memo of points for 
determination. 

7. Filing by either party of any pleading, document, 
application and communication etc., shall be deemed to 
have been effectively done and completed only on 
having been delivered to the Tribunal and its copy 
having been previously or simultaneously delivered to 
the opposite party. 

â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ 

15. The Procedural Order may be amended or 
supplemented, and the procedures for conduct of this 
Arbitration modified, pursuant to such further directions 
or Procedural Orders as the Tribunal may from time to 
time consider necessary and issue. 

â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ " 

(emphasis supplied) 

94. 
What can be seen from the aforesaid detailed procedural 

order is that the procedure was fixed by the Tribunal under section 

19(3) of the Act and after discussion with the learned counsel for 

the parties who agreed to the same. In the said procedural order, it 

was made clear that extension of time would be granted only in

exceptional circumstances and as long as the extensions do not 

materially affect the time table (the dates scheduled for the sittings 

of the Tribunal should not be affected) and that the Tribunal was 

informed prior to the scheduled deadline. The Tribunal also 

reserved to itself, to amend the procedural order or supplement the 

same for conducting the arbitration proceedings by issuing further 

directions or further procedural orders as the Tribunal may, from 

time to time, consider necessary. 

95. 
Since MSRDC could not adhere to the time-table for filing 

its Statement of Defence and Counter Claim, on 28 th April, 2016, it e-

mailed the Arbitral Tribunal asking for four weeks' extension. This 

was objected to by the counsel of PLUS. Whilst dealing with the 

aforesaid extension, the Tribunal, by its order dated 4 th May, 2016, 

inter alia held as under: 

"The respondent's request is based primarily on three 
grounds; (i) the respondent is still in the process of tracing 
out and ascertaining the necessary correspondences / 
documents relevant in the matter, (ii) The concerned 
engineers/officers of the respondent who were dealing in 
the said matter have either retired or transferred and 
hence, it is taking sometime for the respondent to trace 
out and ascertain all the relevant documents and (iii) The 
pleadings and documents filed by the claimants are 
voluminous in nature.

CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 130 of 169 

It may be recalled that the schedule of proceedings under 
the Procedural Order passed on 20 th February 2016 were 
fixed in consultation with the counsel for the parties and 
dates were assigned to the parties to take steps in the 
arbitration proceedings, allowing full accommodation to 
the request made by the counsel appearing on their 
behalf. Though, the claimant was allowed four weeks' 
time for filing the Statement of Claim, on the request of the 
counsel for the respondent, six weeks' time was allowed 
for filing Statement of Defence and Counter-claim. At the 
same time it was also made clear to all concerned that the 
schedule fixed in the Procedural Order was inflexible and 
must be adhered to by both the sides. A stipulation to this 
effect was also made in the very opening paragraph of the 
Practice Directions given at the end of the schedule of 
dates. 

All the grounds on which the request for four weeks' 
further time for filing Statement of Defence and Counter-
claim is made were fully within the knowledge of the 
respondent even on the date the Procedural Order was 
passed or at any rate when the claimant submitted its 
Statement of Claim as per the schedule on 19 th March, 
2016. 

It is, therefore, clear that the request for extension of time 
by four weeks is quite unreasonable and the point of time 
at which it is made (just two days before the date of 
submission) makes it even more so. Further, acceding to 
the respondent's request for extension of time by four 
weeks would completely disrupt the entire schedule and it 
will become nearly impossible to hold the final sittings, as 
fixed in the schedule, from 30 th January to 4 th February 
2017. 

However, rejecting the respondent's request for extension 
of time altogether at this stage would mean shutting out 
the respondent completely from raising any defence or 
any counter claim in the matter. Such a consequence 
would be indeed quite unjust and the Tribunal would 
certainly not like any procedural order passed by it to lead 
to such consequences.

Balancing the rights of the parties, the respondent is 
allowed two weeks' further time for submission of 
Statement of Defence and Counter-claim, if any. The 
respondent may thus submit its Statement of Defence and 
Counter Claim, if any by 15 th May 2016. 

It is made clear that no further extension of time will be 
allowed for submission of the Statement of Defence and 
Counter Claim. It is further made clear once again that 
the Tribunal intends to maintain the dates fixed for the 
final sittings undisturbed. Hence, suitable adjustments will 
have to be made in the rest of the schedule by shortening 
the time allowed to the parties by a few days at the 
different stages in the proceedings before the final sittings. 
The parties will be intimated of the amended schedule in 
due course. 

The parties are once again advised to realise that the 
schedule fixed under the Procedural Order passed on 20 th 
February 2016 is inflexible and if any request for 
adjournment is made at all, it must be made in accordance 
with the provision in the Practice Directions." 

(emphasis supplied) 

96. 
As can be seen from this order, the Tribunal had made it 

clear to all concerned that the schedule fixed in the procedural 

order dated 20 th February, 2016 was inflexible and must be adhered 

to by both sides. It held that the request for four weeks' further time 

for filing the Statement of Defence and Counter Claim was on 

grounds which were fully within the knowledge of MSRDC even on 

the date of the procedural order dated 20 th February, 2016 and, in 

any event, when PLUS submitted its Statement of Claim on 19 th

March, 2016. The Tribunal further felt that the request for 

extension of time by four weeks was quite unreasonable as granting 

the aforesaid extension would completely disrupt the entire 

schedule and it would become nearly impossible to hold the final 

sittings as scheduled from 31 st January, 2017 (wrongly mentioned 

as 30 th January, 2017) to 4 th February, 2017. However, the 

Tribunal felt that rejecting MSRDC's request for extension 

altogether would be unjust and, therefore, to balance the equities, 

MSRDC was allowed two weeks' time for submission of its Statement 

of Defence and Counter Claim. It was made clear that no further 

time would be allowed and that the Tribunal intends to maintain the 

dates fixed for the final sittings undisturbed. Hence, suitable 

adjustments would have to be made in the rest of the schedule by 

shortening the time allowed to the parties by a few days at the 

different stages in the proceedings before the final sittings and the 

parties would be intimated of the amended Schedule in due course. 

It was once again reiterated that the Schedule fixed under the 

procedural order passed on 20 th February, 2016 was inflexible and 

if any request for adjournment was made, it would have to be in 

accordance with the Practice Directions issued on 20 th February, 

2016.

97. 
Pursuant to the aforesaid order dated 4 th May, 2016, on 

12 th May, 2016, the Arbitral Tribunal, accordingly, changed the 

dates by which the pleadings and evidence of the parties was to be 

filed. The Tribunal set out that the dates mentioned in the 

procedural order from Sr. Nos.1 to 10 were uniformly extended by a 

fortnight as set out in the said order. The dates with reference to 

the cross-examination of witnesses from 17 th January, 2017 to 21 st 

January, 2017 as well as the sittings of the Tribunal to hear oral 

arguments from 31 st January, 2017 to 4 th February, 2017 remain 

unchanged. 

98. 
Thereafter, in the meeting of the Tribunal on 17 th 

October, 2016, the Tribunal considered several applications filed by 

the parties. They were: (i) the application of PLUS regarding 

averments submitted along with the affidavit of admission/denial of 

documents; (ii) application dated 31 st August, 2016 filed by MSRDC 

for production of documents by PLUS; (iii) application by MSRDC for 

leave to file sur-rejoinder; (iv) application for production of 

documents by PLUS and MSRDC respectively; and (v) application by 

PLUS to file additional documents. After considering all these

Page 134 of 169 

applications and passing its order thereon, the Tribunal, inter alia, 

clarified that the remaining schedule as per the amended procedural 

order dated 20 th February, 2016, shall remain the same. In other 

words, the arbitration sittings fixed for cross-examination of 

witnesses from 17 th January, 2017 to 21 st January, 2017 as well as 

for hearing oral arguments from 31 st January, 2017 to 4 th February, 

2017, were to remain unaffected. 

99. 
On reading all the aforesaid procedural orders, two 

things become absolutely clear: (i) both parties, namely, PLUS as 

well as MSRDC were to file their pleadings and evidence in a time-

bound manner. If any party sought an extension, the same was to be 

granted only in exceptional circumstances and as long as those 

extensions did not materially affect the sittings of the Tribunal that 

were to be held between 17 th January, 2017 to 21 st January, 2017 

and from 31 st January, 2017 to 4 th February, 2017; (ii) the dates for 

hearing the matter, namely, for cross-examination of witnesses 

(from 17 th January, 2017 to 21 st January, 2017) and for hearing 

oral arguments (from 31 st January, 2017 to 4 th February, 2017) 

were inflexible. This was made abundantly clear by the Tribunal in 

its various procedural orders referred to above. Another thing that

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 135 of 169 

emerges from these procedural orders is that both parties were to 

lead their entire evidence in support of their respective claims. In 

none of these procedural orders was there any indication to either of 

the parties that the proceedings would be bifurcated wherein the 

Tribunal would first decide on issues (a) and (b) set out in 

paragraph 54 of the impugned Award [relating to the validity of the 

termination of the Concession Agreement] and defer the hearing for 

deciding issues (c) and (d) [which related to quantum of the claims 

and Counter Claim]. I may hasten to add that I am not for a moment 

suggesting that the Tribunal could not have done the same, 

especially considering that the Practice Directions that were issued 

by the Tribunal were under section 19(3) of the Act where the 

Tribunal is empowered to decide its own procedure. The only reason 

I am stating this is because the Tribunal insisted on both sides filing 

their complete pleadings as well as leading the entire evidence at 

one go. It was not in contemplation of either of the parties that 

evidence would be led in a piece-meal manner, whereby first it would 

be on the issue of whether there was a valid termination of the 

Concession Agreement and depending on the finding thereof, further 

evidence would be led on the quantum of the claims and Counter 

Claim. In fact, the arguments were also closed on 4 th February, 2017

and only the passing of the Award was reserved. This will become 

further clear when I refer to the relevant portions of the transcripts 

before the Tribunal on 17 th January, 2017, 20 th January, 2017, 3 rd 

February, 2017 and 4 th February, 2017, respectively. 

100. 
During the hearing on 17 th January, 2017, the counsel 

for MSRDC (MR. KUMAR) sought a clarification as to whether they 

were going to lead evidence on the Counter Claim at the same time 

and whether there would be two separate Awards or there would be 

one Award. The Tribunal clarified that there would only be one 

Award. This was also the understanding of the counsel for PLUS 

(MR. MUKHOPADHAYA). The relevant portion of the aforesaid 

Minutes is reproduced hereunder: 

"MR. KUMAR: 
I want clarification, as per the last 
minutes, there is no clarification as to 
whether we are going to lead evidence 
on the counterclaim at the same time. 
He's tendering affidavits which are in 
rebuttal for the counterclaim. So, do we 
take it that there's going to be common 
evidence, because we were not aware 
of that? 

CHAIRMAN: 
Yes, I think so. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: Yes, but normally you wouldn't expect 
the witness to come back -

Page 137 of 169 

MR. KUMAR: 
No, Sir, because as far as counterclaim 
is my claim and he's tendering his 
affidavits in rebuttal, I don't mind. But 
the minutes should then be clear on 
that, that we will have separate awards 
or we'll have one award. It's my claim. 

CHAIRMAN: 
One award. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: Consolidated proceedings. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
We'll have one award, we'll clarify it in 
today's minutes. 

MR. KUMAR: 
Very well. Then my time constraint will 
change. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: Because as far as time is concerned, I 
want submissions as we all went on the 
basis of a 5-day hearing which is equal 
time two and a half days each, and we 
have to structure our cross-examination 
based on that. I have two witnesses to 
cross-examine, but I must do it in two 
and a half days, whether I do it in less, 
that's a different matter, but even if I 
can't take more than that, because 
that's the basis on which you proceed 
and you finish the cross-examination. 
You don't have to put every document, 
everything of your case, you have to put 
your main case, you have to make sure 
that you have put the main case. There 
are ancillary points, suggestions, for 
example, we take it is not necessary if 
you don't give a particular suggestion, 
doesn't mean that it will be held against 
you, as long as you put your main case. 
You can save time. 

CHAIRMAN: 
We can record that you have not put 
your case for denial, just simply for 
denial.

MR. KUMAR: 
No, sir, I understand, there's no need to. 
But on the last occasion when we met, 
we did not have their affidavit of 
evidence, we only had the pleadings. 
After we have received their affidavit of 
evidence there are several documents 
which have been introduced by way of 
his evidence and there are several 
documents which are incomplete, which 
we want to point out just now and we 
were not aware about the counterclaim. 
We had the understanding that as far as 
the counterclaim is concerned, my 
witness will go in the box and then they 
will step in for rebuttal. 

CHAIRMAN: 
That 
will 
be 
more 
convenient. 
Separately we record this one. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
It will only extend the proceedings you 
want to split it into two "proceedings", it 
will extend the proceedings, time 
constraint, expenses involved, but it's up 
to you. I thought that will be one 
consolidated proceeding. 

MR. KUMAR: 
Then, sir, personally, I have no objection 
to that. Only thing is that time constraint 
of two and a half days should not apply 
to me. But that's my only request. I'll 
try my best to complete. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
What time you think -

MR. KUMAR: 
I would like to then take this entire 
session, because if the counterclaim is 
involved, then I will have to take that 
entire session. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
Then we come back to the same 
situation, because it will be -

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: We have serious reservations about 
that, because even I have to cross-

examine on his counterclaim, as also his 
defence, within that two and a half days. 
That's how it is done always, when we 
do have time restrictions, we have to 
manage our affairs in that way, it is not 
unusual, in fact it is done in every case 
that you do claims and counterclaims to 
the witness in one shot, so the witness 
doesn't have to come back. So I'm the 
claimant, I'm putting him in rebuttal, as 
we know each other's case, we know 
which documents are on the record, so 
it is possible to ---

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
No, but if he says that he needs more 
time, we must allow him to explain his 
position. 

MR. KUMAR: 
I'll try to keep myself within the two and 
a half, three days period, but as I see 
from the documents, I don't think that 
will be possible. So I must tell the 
tribunal. I'll try my best. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
We don't have that manual kind of 
taking down of the witness statement. 
These ladies are going very fast. 

MR. KUMAR: 
That's right, I know. I'm aware of that. I'll 
try my best. That's all I can say. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
Please. 

MR. KUMAR: 
Only I'll request your Lordships to keep 
that in mind that in view of the affidavit 
which 
is 
dealing 
with 
several 
documents, 
there 
are 
some 
inconsistencies between the statement 
of claim and the evidence. I may take 
more time. Now that the counterclaim is 
also introduced, I will have to now deal 
with though he's taking a risk by calling 
his witness and he is understood the 
counterclaim. For me, I will not object to

that. But to deal with that, it will be a 
different aspect altogether. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
Let us proceed. Let us see how it 
unfolds." 

(emphasis supplied) 

101. 
Thereafter, the cross-examination continued on 18 th 

January, 2017 and 19 th January, 2017 where the Tribunal 

consistently called upon the counsel for MSRDC to tell them as to 

what would be the reasonable time required to complete the 

evidence on the Counter Claim. In fact, the counsel for PLUS 

submitted before the Tribunal that there was no question of the 

Counter Claim coming later as there were two sets of dates for 

completing the entire proceedings. During the cross-examination, 

on 20 th January, 2017, it appears that the Tribunal was quite 

peeved at the fact that the counsel for MSRDC was not adhering to 

the strict time schedule. The relevant portion of the transcripts of 

20 th January, 2017 read thus: 

"MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
I'm anxious that you complete by the 
lunchtime. I'm feeling a little bad, but 
you seem to be telling us that you just 
don't care for the schedule fixed by the 
tribunal and you will go as you think best 
and as you please.

Page 141 of 169 

MR. KUMAR: 
No sir, I'm sorry if I have given you that 
impression. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
See the first order. The schedule was in 
presence of both sides with the express 
consent of both sides. You knew the 
magnitude of the case then. Of course, 
you were not there in the first hearing, 
but after you came and you thought that 
this matter may take longer time, you 
could have always asked us, told us that 
this schedule is not realistic, it needs to 
be reviewed. We had fixed five days for 
witnesses examination. Three and a 
half days still over. So what time will he 
get? This will completely change the 
entire schedule. 

We have other commitments. He might 
have other commitments. If you thought 
that this five days for witnesses was not 
realistic, you could have told us, 
requested for a review of the schedule, 
months or weeks ago. 

MR. KUMAR: 
That I should have done. We should 
have done that. I'm sorry about that. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
We are at a stage when the whole 
schedule is getting disturbed and, as I 
said, that the order that we passed, the 
first procedural order is practically 
meaningless. 

MR. KUMAR: 
I'll only say one thing. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
If you take four days, he may also say. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: My I make one suggestion? I think that 
even if he finishes by the end of the day 
today and that should be the ultimate 
time limit, no longer than that, I have 
one full day tomorrow. I will complete 
the cross-examination of Mr. Kulkarni,

who's the main witnesses tomorrow 
itself. On the second witness, who's Mr. 
Jadhav, he's speaking on a very limited 
aspect. That is during a period of 14 
January 2014 to some time in 2015 on 
costs incurred by them, which is in 
relation to the counterclaim only. Maybe 
we don't even need to cross-examine 
him. I'll discuss with Mr. Kumar at the 
end of the day on that and see whether 
we can reach an agreement as to what 
the status of his affidavit should be, 
given the time constraints that have 
developed. Otherwise, I mean, anyway, 
I could have done his cross-examination 
about two hours maximum, maybe even 
less. 

But we can dispense with that, if we can 
reach an agreement on -

MR. KUMAR: 
You have already told me in the 
morning. I'll talk to the clients about it. 

Sir, I must tell you --

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
Please don't misunderstand me. 

MR. KUMAR: 
Not at all, sir. 

MR. JUJSTICE ALAM: 
I respect you and think that you're 
entitled to your cross-examination but in 
that case, we should have been 
informed earlier. Then we would have 
considered changing the schedule then. 
This leads me to ask, what about the 
hearing dates? 

MR. KUMAR: 
Hearing dates, I must tell you, I will need 
five days. I'm telling you now. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: I have one submission on that. I don't 
think a hearing of this nature needs five 
days. I think two and a half days each is

more than enough. 
It's documents 
which are on the record that we have to 
deal with. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
Mr. Mukhopadhaya, everyone has his 
own way of making submissions. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: No, there are time constraints to every 
tribunal, time constraints to parties and 
the cost involved in every day's hearing. 

CHAIRMAN: 
Do you have time for rejoinder in the 
argument? 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: I'll take one and a half hours for 
rejoinder, that's it. We'll give written 
submissions after the hearing, so that 
whatever time is --this is done in all 
major arbitrations. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
You will make submissions first. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: Yes, as claimant, I would make the 
submissions first. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
You will take how much time? 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: I will finish in two days maximum, so 
that he can have two and a half days for 
his reply. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
We can give you a maximum of three 
days. 

MR. KUMAR: 
I'm telling you now that my request is I 
need five days. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
No, we can give you three days and 
after that, you can give us your written 
submissions. 
Kindly 
tailor 
your 
arguments that way."

In the very same transcript (of 20 th January, 2017), 

during cross-examination, the Tribunal, in fact, made a comment on 

the way the documents were being marked considering that there 

was going to be one consolidated Award. The relevant portion of this 

portion of the transcript of 20 th January, 2017 reads thus: 

"MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
I wish to say something about the 
marking of the documents. If there's 
going to be one consolidated award, it 
will create a lot of confusion. So kindly 
re-number or re-mark your documents. 

MR. DELHIWALA: 
Only RD three will be a problem. 

MR. KUMAR: 
We said CCD because commercial 
documents. 

MR. TYAGI: 
In RD also it will be only 15 documents, 
because you have filed only till RD15. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: Now 16. 

MR. TYAGI: 
Now 18. So after that, it is only RRDS. 
So it is only about those 18 documents. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
Whatever. 

MR. TYAGI: 
We'll work that out. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
Be careful, because I think in the award, 
there will be a lot of confusion. I don't 
know at what stage somehow or other 
you took it that there would be two 
different proceedings."

From the aforesaid two transcripts of 17 th January, 

2017 and 20 th January, 2017, it clearly appears that the parties 

were to lead their entire evidence on all issues and the Tribunal was 

going to pass one consolidated Award. This was made clear, not only 

in the transcript of 17 th January, 2017, but also in the transcript of 

20 th January, 2017. Thereafter, the cross-examination continued 

and was completed on the scheduled date of 21 st January, 2017. The 

arguments thereafter commenced as per the schedule laid down by 

the Tribunal. The transcript of 1 st February, 2017, in fact, indicates 

as to how the matter was under progress during oral arguments. 

The parties, in fact, were directed to file their written submissions 

by the dates mentioned in the said transcript. The relevant portion 

of the said transcript of 1 st February, 2017 reads thus: 

"MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
Both of them will submit their respective 
written submissions by 14 th . With liberty 
to file reply to the other side's by 20 th . 
And then we will decide whether we 
need any clarification or any further 
sittings. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: That's fair. 

MR. PREMKUMAR: 
Right now, the discipline imposed by the 
schedule, I think we need to follow that 
in terms of completing it and then written 
submissions. 

CHAIRMAN: 
Both of you file your written submissions 
by 14 th and then thereafter you will both

have the occasion to reply to each 
other's submissions, then we will 
consider whether we need the hearing. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
We will consider in two or three days 
and intimate whether we need a further 
hearing or not. 

MR. KUMAR: 
Therefore, he will file submissions, I will 
submissions of what we argue? 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
With copies to each other. It will be 
open to both of you to file your reply to 
the written submissions filed by the 
other side by 20 th . Definitely by 20 th . 
You may."

104. 
On 3 rd February, 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal passed 

certain directions with reference to payment of their fees. The 

relevant portion reads thus: 

"CHAIRMAN: 
Now, we have to issue certain directions 
about the payment of the arbitrators' 
fees. 
You are requested to pay deposit for the 
fees of arbitrators for a period of three 
days working. That is two days for 
internal 
discussion 
among 
the 
arbitrators and one day for the 
pronouncement of the award. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: What about writing of the award itself? 
That also takes time. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
Two sittings for that. Third sitting for 
pronouncement.

CHAIRMAN: 
So three days' fees for the arbitrators at 
the rate of --

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: 50 per cent. 

CHAIRMAN: 
--2 lakhs per arbitrator per day. That to 
be deposited by 28 February." 

105. 
Then, we come to the transcript of 4 th February, 2017. 

After the hearing was over, on 4 th February, 2017, this is what 

transpired before the Tribunal: 

"17.08 
We will give that in our submission. 

MR. PREMKUMAR: 
I think in all fairness we will require a 
little more time for this. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
If both sides agree, we are willing to sit. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: The problem is the time, really speaking, 
that is the difficulty. If we had booked 
earlier, seven days, eight days, we 
would have kept our diaries open for 
that. 

MR. PREMKUMAR: 
I mention if both sides agree, we can sit 
for a day or something. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: It is better to do it after the submissions. 

MR. PREMKUMAR: 
So that we have more clarity. 

MR. MUKHOPADHAYA: What some tribunals do, if I may 
suggest, before the hearing also if your 
Lordships 
have 
any 
clarification 
questions, 
because 
instead 
of 
addressing everything again, your 
Lordships have heard everything, but if 
there are specific points which your 
Lordships need clarification on, just say

that these are the points on which we 
want clarification, so we are prepared 
with that and it can be a short, focused 
hearing, everything else will be on 
written submissions. If your Lordships 
feel it is necessary we have no difficulty 
with that.

So arguments from both sides are 
closed today. Both sides are given time 
approved, 14 February to file their 
written submissions.

So your submissions by 20 February 
and thereafter by 27 February you can 
file reply, if any, to these submissions by 
the other side. Thereafter, if we feel that 
it requires some hearing clarifications 
after going through your submissions, 
the date will be fixed for the further 
hearing if any required. 

MR. KUMAR: 
Sir, my request would be that in case 
you do decide to hold the hearing, 
between 25 March and 5 April, I will 
have a difficulty. 

MR. JUSTICE ALAM: 
The date will be fixed only by consent. 

CHAIRMAN: 
We are closed for the day. 

MR. KUMAR: 
We are grateful to your Lordships for at 
least tolerating us. It is a pleasure 
appearing before your Lordships. And I 
must thank my learned friend. 

CHAIRMAN: 
Both sides helped us very well.

What is clear from this transcript is that arguments 

from both sides were closed and both sides were given time to file 

their written submissions. 
After going through the written 

submissions, if the Tribunal felt that it required any hearing for 

clarifications, a date would be fixed for a further hearing. In fact, 

this transcript makes it very clear that after going through the 

submissions given by the parties, if the Tribunal required any 

clarification in relation thereto, it would fix a further focused 

hearing. 

107. 
When one reads the procedural orders set out earlier 

along with the transcripts referred to above, it becomes clear that on 

4 th February, 2017, all arguments were concluded and all evidence 

was led and all that was required to be done was to pass an Award. 

After going through the submissions of the parties, if the Tribunal 

felt that it required any clarification, only then it would fix a further 

hearing. On reading these procedural orders and transcripts, I find 

that it was never in contemplation, either of the parties or the 

Tribunal, that the proceedings would be bifurcated wherein the 

Tribunal would pass an Interim Award, first deciding on the issue of

termination of the Concession Agreement and thereafter defer the 

hearing on the question of quantum of the respective claims. The 

way the matter has proceeded before the Tribunal, it is quite clear to 

me that parties were directed to lead their entire evidence on all 

issues, including the quantum, and the arguments also proceeded on 

that basis. I, therefore, fail to see as to what was the need to 

bifurcate the proceedings by first passing an Interim Award on the 

issue of termination and thereafter defer the hearing on the 

question of quantum. I am not for a moment suggesting that an 

Arbitral Tribunal is not empowered to do so. It certainly does. In 

fact, in the present case, if the Tribunal had simply said that they 

want to hear further arguments on the question of quantum 

[without suo-moto giving liberty to the parties to file fresh pleadings 

and lead further evidence], I do not think there could have been any 

objection to the bifurcation of the proceedings as set out in the 

Interim Award. However, that is not the case. What the Tribunal 

has done in the impugned Award is allowed the parties to file fresh 

pleadings and lead further evidence in the second stage of the 

arbitration. In fact, after considering the evidence and submissions 

of the parties, the Tribunal rejected certain specific claims of PLUS 

and expressed its inability to decide the other claims on the

available evidence. It is even the case of PLUS that it had produced 

all the evidence in support of its case and never made any request to 

the Tribunal for leading any further evidence. Despite this, when it 

came to the issue of Termination Payment, both under clause 

29.9(c) and clause 32.4.2, the Tribunal in the Interim Award, inter 

alia, held that prima facie Termination Payment payable to PLUS 

would have to be decided on the element of proportionality in the 

working of the Termination Payment clause. The Tribunal noticed 

that MSRDC had strongly contested the Termination Payment also 

on the ground of each individual head that is to be calculated under 

the formula and it would be beneficial to the Tribunal to invite 

further hearings and submissions on this issue. As far as the 

alternative to the claim for Termination Payment (of Rs.469 crores) 

is concerned, the Tribunal was of the opinion that since it was 

deferring its decision on the issue of Termination Payment, the 

decision on the alternative claim also ought to stand deferred. 

Paragraphs 72 and 73 of the impugned Award clarifies the above 

position. The said paragraphs read thus: 

"72. As regards Termination Payment, both under Clause 
29.9 and Clause 32.4.2, an issue arises as to whether 
such payment becomes ipso facto payable in the event of 
a termination, without regard to either the stage at which 
the Agreement is terminated or the losses caused to the

Claimant / Concessionaire. To take an example, if the 
Agreement were to be terminated at the inception stage 
(say, for example, after a mere seven months post the 
COD), would such termination attract the same 
Termination Payment as a case where the Concessionaire 
has been collecting toll for the entire duration of the toll 
notification, and elects to terminate the Agreement on the 
very last day of the toll collection period, having exhausted 
its revenue stream. This is particularly relevant because 
many of the costs in such projects may be incurred up-
front, or at any rate, may be front-loaded. Therefore a 
termination in the early stages of the Agreement, would 
arguably leave a Concessionaire stranded having incurred 
significant costs, and not having had the opportunity to 
recover any revenue. But a termination on the last date of 
the subsistence of a toll notification finds the 
Concessionaire in a position where he has finished 
collecting revenue for a period of several years, as per the 
original toll notification. Should two such cases be treated 
the same, inasmuch as should the same Termination 
Payment be payable -as a mechanical application of the 
formula in the Agreement. Prima facie, the Tribunal would 
need to be satisfied about the element of proportionality in 
the working of the Termination Payment clause. We 
notice that the MSRDC has strongly contested the 
Termination Payment also on the ground of each 
individual head that is to be calculated under the formula, 
and it would be beneficial to the Tribunal to invite further 
hearing and submissions on this issue. 

73. As an alternative to its claim for Termination Payment, 
the Claimant has also made a claim of approximately 
Rs.469 crore, based on amounts invested by shareholders 
and an assumed return of 14.74%. This alternative claim 
is virtually a proxy claim for Termination Payment, but 
calculated not as per the contractual formula, but based 
on the actual amount invested by shareholders. Since the 
Tribunal is inclined to defer its decision on the issue of 
Termination Payment, the decision on this alternative 
claim of Rs.469 crore approximately also stands deferred."

108. 
Thereafter, the Tribunal deals with the claim for Rs.112 

crores which claim the Tribunal records is largely predicated and 

premised on the alleged admissions of liability (and quantum) made 

by MSRDC and recorded in the Director's Report of July, 2011. The 

objection taken with reference to these admissions by MSRDC was 

that all the alleged admissions were made during conciliation 

proceedings and hence were inadmissible. Despite over-ruling this 

objection, the Tribunal opined that it was still required to determine 

what weight could be attached to these documents as evidence of an 

admitted quantum of loss. The Tribunal was of the view that it would 

be unfair on MSRDC to determine the issue of quantum with 

reference to the figures quoted during settlement discussions. The 

Tribunal did not agree with PLUS that the figures cited in the IC's 

correspondence necessarily reflected any independent analysis or 

calculation of loss, either by the IC or MSRDC. The Tribunal was 

prima facie of the view that these figures were put forward by PLUS' 

representatives and accepted (with minor modifications) by the IC. 

In fact, the Tribunal noted that initially on the specific issue of 

'additional direct cost', PLUS' representative put forward a figure of 

Rs.162.37 crores, which was then accepted by the IC with minor 

modifications as the revised project cost of Rs.161.19 crores. The

::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 154 of 169 

Tribunal also further noted that a huge difference in the revised 

project cost first projected by PLUS on 24 th February, 2010 and the 

other put forward by its representative (as recorded in the letter 

dated 23 rd June, 2011) is itself indicative of the fact that figures 

quoted in the correspondence have themselves fluctuated with time 

and that too, quite significantly. This, according to the Tribunal, was 

further indicative of the fact that these figures were proposed by 

either side in the spirit of settlement while they were trying to work 

out a rough and ready compromise. It is in these circumstances that 

the Tribunal was of the opinion that it would not be fair on their part 

to place much weight on the quantum figures exchanged by the 

parties while working out a settlement. According to the Tribunal, 

these figures did not constitute admissions of quantum of liability. 

The Tribunal thereafter also opined that PLUS had made its claim 

for damages of Rs.112 crores in addition to its claim for Termination 

Payment. Prima facie, the Tribunal was of the view that this claim 

can only be in the alternative. If PLUS was to satisfy the Tribunal 

that Termination Payment is payable, then that would exhaust all 

reliefs and would be to the exclusion of other reliefs that PLUS had 

made under section 73 of the Contract Act or otherwise. If, on the 

other hand, the Tribunal ultimately reached the conclusion that 

::: Uploaded on -19/04/2021 
::: Downloaded on -18/03/2022 20:17:15 ::: 


CARBP371.17.doc 

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 155 of 169 

Termination Payment was not payable (despite there being a valid 

termination), then, it would be for PLUS to prove and quantify the 

loss that it had suffered and claim damages on that basis. The 

Tribunal was, therefore, not inclined at that stage to award Rs.112 

crores in damages based on the alleged admissions of MSRDC. The 

Tribunal was, therefore, of the view that even on this issue, further 

hearings and submissions were required. It was clarified that in 

making these submissions, PLUS need not be restricted to the 

amounts allegedly admitted by MSRDC, but may even claim 

amounts higher than that, should it be allowed to do so. However, it 

would need to prove and quantify its loss by leading appropriate 

evidence, if necessary. Similarly, MSRDC was not bound by any 

alleged admissions and was free to independently reject PLUS' claim 

for damages, including by way of leading appropriate evidence, if 

necessary. It is thereafter highlighted in paragraph 86 of the Award 

that while deferring the quantum issue to a second stage, the 

Tribunal is very mindful of the fact that such a second phase of the 

arbitration is likely to involve both time and expense. The Tribunal 

further holds that this is unavoidable in the circumstances as the 

Tribunal cannot arrive at a quantum determination based on the 

existing record and submissions.

109. 
It is all these parts of the Award and which I have set out 

earlier, to which Mr. Chagla has taken strong objection and in which 

I find considerable merit. As mentioned earlier, the arbitration 

proceedings had commenced and continued before the Arbitral 

Tribunal on the basis that the entire evidence was led by both 

parties. In fact, the written submissions also filed before the 

Tribunal by both parties would reflect the same. If the Tribunal was 

not satisfied with the evidence led by either of the parties, it ought to 

have rejected the claims on which the evidence was inadequate. 

After making the parties lead their entire evidence, the Tribunal 

could not have allowed either party to lead further evidence to 

substantiate their claims when neither party made any such 

request. If the Tribunal was of the opinion that the evidence was 

inadequate, either to grant any claim of PLUS or any Counter Claim 

of MSRDC, it ought to have rejected the claim / Counter Claim, as the 

case may be. This entire exercise by the Tribunal of suo-moto 

allowing the parties to lead further evidence, once the evidence was 

closed and final arguments were also concluded, to my mind, clearly 

vitiates the Award in so far as it allows parties to file fresh pleadings 

and lead further evidence. The Tribunal has no power to allow a

party to lead further evidence after the evidence is closed without 

the concerned party seeking leave of the Tribunal to lead further 

evidence in that regard. I say this because if an application to lead 

further evidence [after it is closed] is made by either party, the 

Arbitral Tribunal would be bound to permit the other party to 

respond to the same and thereafter render its decision thereon. 

Failing to do so [i.e. granting the opposite party an opportunity to 

contest the application for leading further evidence] would itself 

render the Award vulnerable inter alia on the ground of breach of 

principles of natural justice. The Tribunal, after the evidence is 

closed, cannot suo-moto allow either party to lead further evidence 

merely to accommodate a party to improve its case. That would be 

contrary to all principles of fair play in any adversarial litigation 

and would be in breach of the provisions of section 18 of the Act. In 

the present case, the situation would have been quite different if the 

Tribunal had made it clear to the parties that they need to lead 

evidence only with reference to the issue of termination first, and 

depending on the answer to the aforesaid issue, further evidence 

would be allowed to be led by the parties regarding the quantum. 

The situation would also have been different if the Tribunal had 

bifurcated the proceedings to hear further arguments on the

Page 158 of 169 

quantum issue on the basis of the evidence already led by the 

parties. However, that is not the case. The parties led their entire 

evidence before the Tribunal and arguments were also canvassed in 

relation thereto. Evidence was led not only with reference to 

termination but also with reference to the quantum of each claim. In 

other words, the parties proceeded before the Tribunal on the basis 

that all issues would be decided by the Tribunal at one and the same 

time and that they had presented their entire evidence and case 

before the Tribunal. This being the situation, the Tribunal, on its 

own, could not allow either party to lead further evidence, after the 

evidence was already closed and all arguments were also canvassed 

and written submissions filed. I am therefore of the view that the 

Award is vitiated to the extent that it allows the parties to file fresh 

pleadings and lead further evidence in the second stage of the 

arbitration. 

110. 
I am unable to agree with the submission of Mr. 

Khambatta that all this was done primarily for the benefit of MSRDC 

and, therefore, it does not lie in their mouth to complain of the 

procedure adopted by the Tribunal. Firstly, from the Award itself, it 

is clear that with relation to Termination Payment, the Tribunal was

Page 159 of 169 

of the opinion that it would have to consider whether payment 

under clause 29.9(c) or 32.4.2 ought to be mechanically granted to 

PLUS or whether it ought to be done on the basis of proportionality. 

If Mr. Khambatta is correct that in relation to Termination Payment, 

the evidence was already on record, nothing stopped the Tribunal 

from ruling in favour of PLUS on the aforesaid issue. However, 

obviously the view of the Tribunal was different. It is in these 

circumstances and taking into consideration the objections laid out 

by MSRDC that the Tribunal felt that the question of proportionality 

has to be gone into. 

111. 
Even as far as the claim for damages of Rs.112 crores is 

concerned, the Tribunal was clearly of the view that PLUS had based 

the aforesaid claim primarily on the admissions made by MSRDC 

and on which not much weightage could be applied considering that 

those admissions were made in the spirit of settlement. The 

Tribunal, therefore, held that PLUS would have to independently 

lead evidence to substantiate those claims. PLUS, clearly had not 

asked for any permission of the Tribunal to lead any further 

evidence. If PLUS was not interested in leading any further 

evidence, the Tribunal ought to have rejected the claim of PLUS if it

was dissatisfied with the evidence already led by PLUS on the 

aforesaid claim. The Tribunal could not have, on its own, given 

liberty to the parties to lead further evidence on the aforesaid claim. 

112. 
Similar is the case of the Counter Claim filed by MSRDC. 

MSRDC too had led all its evidence with reference to its Counter 

Claim and had even made oral arguments in relation thereto. 

MSRDC too had filed its written submissions before the Arbitral 

Tribunal. Despite this, I fail to understand as to how the Tribunal 

has come to a finding that it is deferring its decision on the Counter 

Claim as adequate time had not been dedicated to the Counter Claim. 

In fact, the transcripts reflect that the counsel for MSRDC had 

consistently been asking for further time which was refused and was 

asked to complete, not only the cross-examination, but also his 

arguments in the time-frame set out by the Tribunal. Once, having 

fixed those dates and which clearly the Tribunal held as inflexible, I 

fail to see how the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that 

inadequate time was devoted to the Counter Claim filed by MSRDC. 

The entire procedure followed by the Tribunal in relation to 

deferring the claim for quantum at a later date by allowing the 

parties to lead further evidence and file fresh pleadings is patently

illegal and cannot be allowed to stand. As mentioned earlier, 

considering that the procedure in relation to the arbitration 

proceedings was laid down by the Tribunal under section 19(3) of 

the Act, there would be nothing wrong if the Tribunal had bifurcated 

the proceedings to hear further arguments on the quantum issues 

[with reference to the claims of PLUS as well as the Counter Claim of 

MSRDC] on the basis of the evidence already led by the parties and 

the existing record before the Tribunal. However, to defer the 

decision on the quantum of each claim filed by PLUS as well as the 

Counter Claim filed by MSRDC to enable parties to file fresh 

pleadings and lead further evidence is patently illegal and wholly 

unacceptable. 

113. 
I must mention that the Supreme Court in the case of 

Associate Builders Vs. Delhi Development Authority [(2015) 3 

SCC 49] has held that "the juristic principle of a "judicial approach" demands 

that a decision be fair, reasonable and objective. On the obverse side, anything 

arbitrary and whimsical would obviously not be a determination which would 

either be fair, reasonable or objective." The relevant portion of this 

decision reads thus:-

"Fundamental Policy of Indian Law 
27. Coming to each of the heads contained in Saw Pipes [(2003) 5 SCC 
705 : AIR 2003 SC 2629] judgment, we will first deal with the head 
"fundamental policy of Indian law". It has already been seen 
from Renusagar [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 
Supp (1) SCC 644] judgment that violation of the Foreign Exchange Act 
and disregarding orders of superior courts in India would be regarded as 
being contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law. To this it could be 
added that the binding effect of the judgment of a superior court being 
disregarded would be equally violative of the fundamental policy of 
Indian law. 

28. In a recent judgment, ONGC Ltd. v. Western Geco International 
Ltd. [(2014) 9 SCC 263 : (2014) 5 SCC (Civ) 12] , this Court added three 
other distinct and fundamental juristic principles which must be 
understood as a part and parcel of the fundamental policy of Indian law. 
The Court held: (SCC pp. 278-80, paras 35 & 38-40) 

"35. What then would constitute the 'fundamental policy of Indian law' is 
the question. The decision in ONGC [(2003) 5 SCC 705 : AIR 2003 SC 
2629] does not elaborate that aspect. Even so, the expression must, in 
our opinion, include all such fundamental principles as providing a basis 
for administration of justice and enforcement of law in this country. 
Without meaning to exhaustively enumerate the purport of the 
expression 'fundamental policy of Indian law', we may refer to three 
distinct and fundamental juristic principles that must necessarily be 
understood as a part and parcel of the fundamental policy of Indian law. 
The first and foremost is the principle that in every determination 
whether by a court or other authority that affects the rights of a citizen or 
leads to any civil consequences, the court or authority concerned is 
bound to adopt what is in legal parlance called a 'judicial approach' in 
the matter. The duty to adopt a judicial approach arises from the very 
nature of the power exercised by the court or the authority does not have 
to be separately or additionally enjoined upon the fora concerned. What 
must be remembered is that the importance of a judicial approach in 
judicial and quasi-judicial determination lies in the fact that so long as 
the court, tribunal or the authority exercising powers that affect the rights 
or obligations of the parties before them shows fidelity to judicial 
approach, they cannot act in an arbitrary, capricious or whimsical 
manner. Judicial approach ensures that the authority acts bona fide and 
deals with the subject in a fair, reasonable and objective manner and 
that its decision is not actuated by any extraneous consideration.

Page 163 of 169 

Judicial approach in that sense acts as a check against flaws and faults 
that can render the decision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to 
challenge. 
*** 
38. Equally important and indeed fundamental to the policy of Indian law 
is the principle that a court and so also a quasi-judicial authority must, 
while determining the rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in 
accordance with the principles of natural justice. Besides the 
celebrated audi alteram partem rule one of the facets of the principles of 
natural justice is that the court/authority deciding the matter must apply 
its mind to the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a view 
one way or the other. Non-application of mind is a defect that is fatal to 
any adjudication. Application of mind is best demonstrated by disclosure 
of the mind and disclosure of mind is best done by recording reasons in 
support of the decision which the court or authority is taking. The 
requirement that an adjudicatory authority must apply its mind is, in that 
view, so deeply embedded in our jurisprudence that it can be described 
as a fundamental policy of Indian law. 

39. No less important is the principle now recognised as a salutary 
juristic fundamental in administrative law that a decision which is 
perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at 
the same will not be sustained in a court of law. Perversity or irrationality 
of decisions is tested on the touchstone of Wednesbury [Associated 
Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn., (1948) 1 KB 223 : 
(1947) 2 All ER 680 (CA)] principle of reasonableness. Decisions that fall 
short of the standards of reasonableness are open to challenge in a 
court of law often in writ jurisdiction of the superior courts but no less in 
statutory processes wherever the same are available. 

40. It is neither necessary nor proper for us to attempt an exhaustive 
enumeration of what would constitute the fundamental policy of Indian 
law nor is it possible to place the expression in the straitjacket of a 
definition. What is important in the context of the case at hand is that if 
on facts proved before them the arbitrators fail to draw an inference 
which ought to have been drawn or if they have drawn an inference 
which is on the face of it, untenable resulting in miscarriage of justice, 
the adjudication even when made by an Arbitral Tribunal that enjoys 
considerable latitude and play at the joints in making awards will be 
open to challenge and may be cast away or modified depending upon 
whether the offending part is or is not severable from the rest." 
(emphasis in original) 

29. It is clear that the juristic principle of a "judicial approach" demands 
that a decision be fair, reasonable and objective. On the obverse side,

SR Pasha, Sr PS 
Page 164 of 169 

anything arbitrary and whimsical would obviously not be a determination 
which would either be fair, reasonable or objective. 

30. The audi alteram partem principle which undoubtedly is a 
fundamental juristic principle in Indian law is also contained in Sections 
18 and 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. These sections 
read as follows: 

"18.Equal treatment of parties.-The parties shall be treated with 
equality and each party shall be given a full opportunity to present his 
case. 
*** 
34.Application for setting aside arbitral award.-(1)*** 
(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the court only if-
(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that-
*** 
(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the 
appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was 
otherwise unable to present his case;" 

************* 
34. It is with this very important caveat that the two fundamental 
principles which form part of the fundamental policy of Indian law (that 
the arbitrator must have a judicial approach and that he must not act 
perversely) are to be understood. 

************* 
Justice 
36. The third ground of public policy is, if an award is against justice or 
morality. These are two different concepts in law. An award can be said to 
be against justice only when it shocks the conscience of the court. An 
illustration of this can be given. A claimant is content with restricting his 
claim, let us say to Rs 30 lakhs in a statement of claim before the 
arbitrator and at no point does he seek to claim anything more. The 
arbitral award ultimately awards him Rs 45 lakhs without any acceptable 
reason or justification. Obviously, this would shock the conscience of the 
court and the arbitral award would be liable to be set aside on the 
ground that it is contrary to "justice"."

In the case of SSANGYONG Engineering and Construction Co. Ltd. 

Vs. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) [(2019) 15 

SCC 131] the Supreme Court has also explained the observations of 

Associate Builders and had inter alia opined that a decision which is 

perverse, will no longer being a ground for challenge under "public 

policy of India", but would certainly be a patent illegality appearing 

on the face of the Award. The observations of the Supreme Court in 

both these decisions would certainly apply to the facts of the present 

case and hence I have no hesitation in holding that the Impugned 

Award is vitiated to the extent that it allows the parties to file fresh 

pleadings and lead further evidence in the second stage of the 

arbitration. 

114. 
Before concluding it would only be fair to deal with the 

judgements relied upon by Mr. Khambatta and referred to earlier. I 

find that the reliance placed by Mr. Khambatta on the decision of the 

Supreme Court in the case of McDermott International Inc. Vs 

Burn Standard Co. Ltd. and Ors. [(2006) 11 Supreme Court 

Cases 181] is wholly misplaced. There is no dispute on the

proposition that the Arbitral Tribunal certainly has the power to 

pass an Interim Award /Partial Award if it so chooses to do. This 

power is statutorily given to the Arbitral Tribunal even under 

section 31(6) of the Act. However, that is not the issue before me. 

As mentioned earlier, the entire evidence of the parties was led 

before the Tribunal prior to the passing of the impugned Interim 

Award. In such a situation, the Arbitral Tribunal could not have 

passed an Interim Award determining the validity of the 

termination notices issued by PLUS and deferred the hearing for 

deciding the issue of quantum of each claim/Counter Claim at a later 

date by allowing the parties to file fresh pleadings and lead further 

evidence. It is this action of the Arbitral Tribunal that I find 

objectionable. The power of the Tribunal to pass an Interim/ Partial 

Award is certainly there and given by the Statute itself. Under what 

circumstances it is to be exercised, would certainly depend on how 

the arbitration has proceeded either as per the agreement between 

the parties or the procedure evolved by the Arbitral Tribunal. The 

reliance, therefore, placed by Mr. Khambatta on the aforesaid 

decision is of no assistance to PLUS.

115. 
Even the decision of the Division Bench of this Court 

relied upon by Mr. Khambatta in the case of Manganese Ore 

(India) Ltd. & Ors. Vs. Ram Bahadur Thakur Limited [2006 SCC 

Online Bom. 507] is wholly misconceived. The facts of this case 

would clearly reveal that the learned arbitrator made an Interim 

Award and held that the appellant had committed breach of the said 

agreement by failing to supply 15,000 metric tonnes of manganese 

ore of 46/48% grade as required under the contract and that the 

respondent was entitled to recover from the appellant damages, if 

any, by reason of breach of the contract. The learned arbitrator 

further held that no evidence on the quantum of damages could be 

led before him unless he first came to the conclusion that there was 

a breach of contract committed by the appellant, and therefore, 

fixed the date for further hearing for the purpose of enabling the 

parties to lead evidence on the question of damages. It was in this 

factual scenario that the Division Bench of this Court took a view 

that in such circumstances the procedure adopted by the arbitrator 

could not be faulted. The facts of this case would reveal that the 

parties had led no evidence whatsoever on the quantum of damages 

as the arbitrator (in the Interim Award) was only deciding whether

in fact there was a breach of the agreement. Only once he came to 

that conclusion, he gave liberty to the parties to lead evidence on the 

question of quantum. The facts of the case before me are however 

totally different. In the present case, the parties led their entire 

evidence, not only with reference to the validity of the termination 

notices issued by PLUS but also on the quantum of each 

claim/Counter Claim. Once this was done and the evidence was 

closed by the Tribunal, without there being any application for 

leading further evidence, the Tribunal could not have suo-moto 

allowed the parties to file fresh pleadings and lead further evidence 

in support of their respective claims. This being the case, I find that 

the reliance placed on the aforesaid decision is also wholly 

misplaced. 

116. 
In view of the foregoing discussion:-

(i) 
The challenge to Interim Award dated 25 th April, 

2017 on the ground that the Arbitral Tribunal relied 

upon evidence which was inadmissible in law is 

rejected; 

(ii) The challenge to the Interim Award upholding the 

validity of the termination of the Concession 

Agreement dated 25 th August, 2006, under clause

29.8 [Force Majeure Event] is rejected; 

(iii) The Interim Award is set aside in so far as it 

upholds the termination of the Concession 

Agreement dated 25 th August, 2006 under clauses 

32.4.1(1) and 32.4.1(3) [for material default of 

MSRDC]. However, as mentioned earlier, this would 

make little difference to the termination of the 

Concession Agreement as the termination under 

Clause 29.8 is upheld, and therefore, the Concession 

Agreement dated 25 th August, 2006 validly stands 

terminated; 

(iv) The Interim Award is set aside in so far as it 

permits the parties to file fresh pleadings and lead 

further evidence in the second stage of the 

arbitration. 

117. 
The Arbitration Petition is disposed of in the aforesaid 

terms. However, there shall be no order as to costs. 

118. 
All parties to act on an authenticated copy of this order 

duly signed by the Private Secretary/Personal Assistant/Associate 

of this Court.
