Reportable 
Judgment 

25/11/2021 

These petitions arise out of common background. They have 

been heard together and are being disposed of by this common 

judgment. 

2. 
The petitions can be divided into two groups. Civil Writ 

Petition No.6587/2021 filed by Mukesh Kumar Royal and others 

and connected petitions call in question the vires of the 

notification dated 28.06.2018 issued by the National Council for 

Teacher Education ('NCTE', for short), by which the B.Ed. degree 

holders, subject to certain conditions, are made eligible for 

appointment to the post of primary school teacher grade-III 

(level-1) (classes-I to V), along with other qualifications already 

prescribed under its notification dated 23.08.2010 as amended 

from time to time. The writ petition No.2108/2021 filed by Sunita 

and other connected petitions are filed by the B.Ed. degree 

holders. They support the notification dated 28.06.2018 and have 

challenged the advertisement issued by the Board of Secondary 

Education, State of Rajasthan inviting applications for Rajasthan 

Eligibility Entrance Test ('REET', for short) (level-1) in which the 

B.Ed. degree holders are excluded. 

3. 
In brief, the controversy revolves around the question 

whether the NCTE had correctly and legally included B.Ed. as 

essential qualification for eligibility for appointment to the post of 


(133 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

primary school teacher (level-I). The petitioner Mukesh Kumar 

Royal and others were qualified as per the unamended 

notification. 
They possess the basic educational qualification 

(Higher Secondary Examination pass) and the certificate of 

Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed.) pass. They argue that 

B.Ed. course per se cannot be stated to be a higher qualification. 

According to them even the Ministry of HRD and NCTE have 

viewed the situation in this manner. It is, therefore, that while 

including B.Ed. degree as one of the eligibility criteria, the 

notification dated 28.06.2018 provides that such a candidate upon 

appointment shall have to pass a bridge course of six months 

within two years of the appointment. Counter petitioners Sunita 

and others contend that this amendment is proper and legal and 

the state government had no authority to ignore this additional 

qualification prescribed by NCTE while declaring the REET. It is a 

common ground that REET result is the source for appointment for 

the primary teachers in the State. 

4. 
In order to appreciate the controversy, we may note in brief 

the factual background as well as the statutory framework. Article 

21A was inserted in the Constitution by Constitution (Eighty-sixth 

Amendment) Act, 2002 with effect from 01.04.2010 which 

provides that the State shall provide free and compulsory 

education to all children of the age of 6 to 14 years in such 

manner as the State may, by law, determine. Long before the 

amendment of the Constitution and insertion of Article 21A, the 

right to primary education was recognized as a fundamental right 

being part of Article 21 by the Supreme court in the cases of 

Mohini Jain vs. State of Karnataka [(1992) 3 SCC 666] and 

in the case of Unni Krishnan J.P. vs. State of Andhra Pradesh 


(134 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

[(1993) 1 SCC 645]. With the insertion of Article 21A, this right 

was recognized as an independent fundamental right in the 

Constitution. To operationalise this valuable right, the Parliament 

framed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education 

Act, 2009 ('RTE Act', for short). The term 'school' has been 

defined in Section 2(n) as to mean any recognized school 

imparting elementary education and would include the schools 

established, owned or controlled by the appropriate Government 

or a local authority, schools receiving aid and even unaided 

schools. Clause (g) of Section 8 of the RTE Act, pertaining to 

duties of appropriate Government, requires that the appropriate 

Government shall ensure good quality elementary education 

conforming to the standards and norms specified in the Schedule. 

Section 18 requires compulsory recognition of all schools. Section 

19 of the RTE Act pertains to norms and standards for school. 

Sub-section (1) of Section 19 provides that no school shall be 

established or recognized under Section 18, unless it fulfills the 

norms and standards specified in the Schedule. The Schedule lists 

norms and standards for the schools imparting education for the 

classes-I to V. There are different prescriptions for the number of 

teachers for this section as compared to classes-VI to VIII. 

5. 
Section 23 of the RTE Act, which is of considerable 

importance pertains to qualifications for appointment and terms 

and conditions of service of teachers and reads as under: 

"23. Qualifications for appointment and terms and 
conditions of service of teachers-
(1) Any person possessing such minimum qualifications, 
as laid down by an academic authority, authorised by 
the Central Government, by notification, shall be 
eligible for appointment as a teacher. 


(135 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

(2) Where a State does not have adequate institutions 
offering courses or training in teacher education, or 
teachers possessing minimum qualifications as laid 
down under sub-section (1) are not available in 
sufficient numbers, the Central Government may, if it 
deems necessary, by notification, relax the minimum 
qualifications required for appointment as a teacher, for 
such period, not exceeding five years, as may be 
specified in that notification: 
Provided 
that 
a 
teacher 
who, 
at 
the 
commencement of this Act, does not possess minimum 
qualifications as laid down under sub-section (1), shall 
acquire such minimum qualifications within a period of 
five years: 
[Provided further that every teacher appointed or 
in position as on the 31st March, 2015, who does not 
possess minimum qualifications as laid down under sub-
section (1), shall acquire such minimum qualifications 
within a period of four years from the date of 
commencement of the Right of Children to Free and 
Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act, 2017.] 
(3) The salary and allowances payable to, and the 
terms and conditions of service of, teachers shall be 
such as may be prescribed." 

6. 
As per Sub-section (1) of Section 23, thus a person 

possessing such minimum qualifications as laid down by an 

academic authority authorised by the Central Government shall be 

eligible for appointment as a teacher. Sub-section (2) of Section 

23, empowers the Central Government to relax such minimum 

qualifications under certain circumstances subject to conditions. 

We would make a detailed reference to this Section at a later 

stage. 

7. 
Chapter-V of the RTE Act pertains to curriculum and 

completion of elementary education. Section 29 contained in the 

said part pertains to curriculum and evaluation procedure, and it 

reads as under: 

"29. Curriculum and evaluation procedure.-(1) 
The curriculum and the evaluation procedure for 
elementary education shall be laid down by an 
academic authority to be specified by the appropriate 
Government, by notification. 


(136 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

(2) The academic authority, while laying down the 
curriculum and the evaluation procedure under 
sub-section (1), shall take into consideration the 
following, namely:-
(a) conformity with the values enshrined in the 
Constitution; 
(b) all round development of the child; 
(c) building up child's knowledge, potentiality and 
talent; 
(d) development of physical and mental abilities to 
the fullest extent; 
(e) learning through activities, discovery and 
exploration in a child friendly and child-centered 
manner; 
(f) medium of instructions shall, as far as 
practicable, be in child's mother tongue; 
(g) making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety 
and helping the child to express views 
freely; 
(h) comprehensive and continuous evaluation of 
child's understanding of knowledge and his or her 
ability to apply the same." 

8. 
Last section to be noted from the RTE Act is Section 35 

contained in Chapter-VII of Miscellaneous provisions and reads 

under: 

"35. Power to issue directions.-(1) The Central 
Government may issue such guidelines to the 
appropriate Government or, as the case may be, the 
local authority, as it deems fit for the purposes of 
implementation of the provisions of this Act. 
(2) The appropriate Government may issue guidelines 
and give such directions, as it deems fit, to the 
local authority or the School Management Committee 
regarding implementation of the provisions of this 
Act. 
(3) The local authority may issue guidelines and give 
such directions, as it deems fit, to the School 
Management Committee regarding implementation of 
the provisions of this Act." 

9. 
Sub-section (1) of Section 35 of the RTE Act, as noted 

above, empowers the Central Government to issue such guidelines 

to appropriate Government or the local authority, as it deems fit 

for the purpose of implementation of the provisions of the Act. 

Under Sub-section (2) of Section 35, the appropriate Government 


(137 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

may issue guidelines and give directions, as it deems fit, to the 

local authority or the school management committee regarding 

implementation of the provisions of this Act. Under Sub-section 

(3) of Section 35, the local authority may issue such guidelines 

and directions as it deems fit to the school management 

committee. 

10. It is not in dispute that the Central Government has notified 

the NCTE as the 'academic authority' for the purposes of Sub-

section (1) of Section 23 as well as Sub-section (1) of Section 29 

of the RTE Act. In terms of Sub-section (1) of Section 23, thus, it 

is the NCTE which has the authority to prescribe the minimum 

eligibility qualifications for appointment as a teacher. Likewise, 

the NCTE is authorised in terms of Sub-section (1) of Section 29 

to lay down the curriculum and evaluation procedure for 

elementary education. It may be noted that the NCTE has been 

constituted under the National Council for Teacher Education Act, 

1993 ('NCTE ACT', for short). In its original form, the preamble to 

the NCTE Act provided that it was an Act to provide for 

establishment of NCTE with a view to achieving planned and co-

ordinated development of the teacher education system 

throughout the country, the regulations and proper maintenance 

of norms and standards in the teacher education system and for 

matters connected therewith. By Amendment Act 18 of 2011 with 

effect from 01.06.2012 the words "including qualifications of 

school teachers" were inserted in the preamble. 
Similar 

amendments were made in the Act and the applicability of the Act 

as provided in Sub-section (4) of Section 1 of the NCTE Act, was 

expanded to schools imparting pre-primary, primary, upper 

primary education. The functions of the NCTE as contained in 


(138 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

Section 12 were expanded to include laying down of guidelines in 

respect of minimum qualifications for a persons to be employed as 

a teacher in recognized institutions. Section 12A was inserted 

with effect from 01.06.2012, which provides that for the purpose 

of maintaining standards of education in schools, the NCTE may, 

by regulations, determine the qualifications of persons for being 

recruited as teachers in any pre-primary, primary, upper primary, 

secondary, senior secondary or intermediate school or college, by 

whatever names called, established, run, aided or recognised by 

the Central Government or a State Government or a local 

authority or other authority. First proviso, while protecting the 

existing teachers, was subject to further proviso, which provides 

that the minimum qualifications of a teacher shall be acquired 

within the period specified in the NCTE Act or under the RTE Act. 

11. Section 29 of the NCTE Act pertains to directions by the 

Central Government. Sub-section (1) of Section 29 provides that 

the NCTE shall, in the discharge of its functions and duties under 

this Act, be bound by such directions on questions of policy as the 

Central Government may give in writing to it from time to time. 

Sub-section (2) of Section 29 provides that the decision of the 

Central Government as to whether a question is one of policy or 

not shall be final. 

12. Section 32 of the NCTE Act gives power to the NCTE to frame 

regulations. As per Sub-section (1) of Section 32, the NCTE may, 

by notification in the Official Gazette, make regulations not 

inconsistent with the provisions of this Act and the rules made 

thereunder, generally to carry out the provisions of this Act. Sub-

section (2) of Section 32 which provides that in particular, and 

without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such 


(139 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

regulations may provide for all or any of the following matters, 

namely those contained in various sub-clauses of the said Sub-

section, which was amended by insertion of Clause (dd) pertaining 

to the minimum qualifications of teachers under Section 12A. 

13. Section 33 of the NCTE Act requires the rules and regulations 

framed by the NCTE to be laid before the Parliament, which reads 

as under: 

"33. Rules and regulations to be laid before 
Parliament.-Every rule and every regulation made 
under this Act shall be laid, as soon as may be after it 
is made, before each House of Parliament, while it 
is in session, for a total period of thirty days which 
may be comprised in one session or in two or more 
successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of the 
session immediately following the session or the 
successive sessions aforesaid, both House agree in 
making any modification in the rule or regulation, or 
both House agree that the rule or regulation should 
not be made, the rule or regulation shall thereafter 
have effect only in such modified form or be of no 
effect, as the case may be; so, however, that any such 
modification or annulment shall be without prejudice 
to the validity of anything previously done under 
that rule or regulation." 

14. The NCTE in exercise of powers under Sub-section (1) of 

Section 23 of the RTE Act had issued a notification dated 

23.08.2010 prescribing minimum qualifications for a person to be 

eligible for appointment as teacher in classes-I to VIII in a school 

referred to in Clause (n) of Section 2 of the RTE Act. Clause (1) of 

this notification pertains to minimum qualifications. Sub-clause (i) 

prescribed minimum qualifications classes-I to V. This recognized 

persons with senior secondary or equivalent with diploma in 

elementary education (which is, as noted, is called D.El.Ed.) by 

whatever name called or senior secondary passed with prescribed 

percentage and 4 years Bachelor of Elementary Education and 2 

year Diploma in Education as qualified for appointment provided 


(140 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

they possess Teacher Eligibility Test passed certificate as 

conducted in accordance with the guidelines framed by the NCTE. 

In contrast, for classes-VI to VIII, as per this notification a 

candidate must possess degree in B.A. or B.Sc. with Diploma in 

Elementary Education or such degree with minimum 50% marks 

with one year B.Ed. course and such similar qualifications. 

15. The notification dated 23.08.2010 was amended by the NCTE 

vide notification dated 29.07.2011. Certain modifications were 

made in the essential qualifications for appointment of a teacher 

for classes-I to V as well as classes-VI to VIII. We are not directly 

concerned with these changes brought about by the subsequent 

notification dated 29.07.2011. The entire controversy revolves 

around the notification dated 28.06.2018 issued by NCTE making 

certain amendments in the earlier notification dated 23.08.2010, 

as amended vide notification dated 29.07.2011. 
Since this 

notification is at the center of controversy, we may reproduce the 

same in its entirety: 

"NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR TEACHER EDUCATION 
NOTIFICATION 
New Delhi, the 28 th June, 2018 

F. No. NCTE-Regl 012/16/2018-In exercise of 
the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 23 
of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education 
Act. 2009 (35 of 2009) and in pursuance of notification 
number S.O. 750(E), dated the 31 st March, 2010 
issued by the Department of School Education and 
Literacy, Ministry of Human Resource Development, 
Government of India, the National Council for Teacher 
Education (NCTE) hereby makes the following further 
amendments to the notification number F.N. 61-
03/20/2010/NCTE/(N&S), dated the 23 rd August, 2010 
published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, Part 
III, Section 4, dated the 25 th August, 2010, hereinafter 
referred to as the said notification namely:-
(1) In the said notification, in para 1 in sub-para (i), 
in clause (a) after the words and brackets "Graduation 
and two year Diploma in Elementary Education (by 


(141 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

whatever name known), the following shall be 
inserted, namely:-
OR 
"Graduation with at least 50% marks and 
Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.)" 
2. In the said notification in para 3, for sub-para(a), 
the following sub-para shall be substituted namely:-
"(a) who has acquired the qualification of 
Bachelor of Education from any NCTE recognized 
institution shall be considered for appointment 
as a teacher in classes I to V provided the person 
so appointed as a teacher shall mandatorily 
undergo a six month Bridge Course in Elementary 
Education recognized by the NCTE, within two 
years of such appointment as primary teacher." 
SANJAY AWASTHI, Member Secy." 
(emphasis supplied by us) 

16. The petitioners, who are opponents of this notification 

particularly in the case of Mukesh Kumar Royal and others sought 

information from the NCTE and Ministry of Human Resources 

Development under the Right to Information Act, 2005 ('RTI Act', 

for short) as to the manner in which the decision to make 

amendments in the eligibility criteria was arrived at by NCTE. 

Through this process, they have brought on record certain 

documents and information, which need to be noted. It appears 

that on 30.05.2018 the Ministry of HRD had written to NCTE 

requiring the NCTE to amend the eligibility criteria for primary 

school teacher in classes-I to V as to include any person, who has 

acquired qualification of B.Ed. from a recognized institute provided 

the person so appointed shall compulsorily undergo a six month 

bridge course, which may be recognized by NCTE and such course 

would have to be completed within two years of appointment. This 

communication is also being challenged by the petitioners. It 

would be useful to take note of the contents thereof:

Government of India

Shahstri Bhawan, New Delhi, 


(142 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

Dated the 30 th May 2018 
To, 
The Chairperson NCTE, 
Haris Bhawan, 
Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, 
New Delhi-110002 
Dear Madam 

Kindly refer to the letter of even no dated 
12.04.2018 regarding request of Kendriya Vidayalaya 
Sangathan for recruiting primary teachers with higher 
qualification i.e. B.A./B.Sc. B.ed. Plus TET pass and 
letter no. NCTE-REG1012/16/2018-IJS (Regulation)-HQ 
dated 23.05.2018 received from NCTE regarding the 
same. 
2. 
The above request has been considered in the 
ministry, to order to safeguard the interest of the 
students and ensure the quality of education, the 
competent authority has decided to agree to the request 
of KVS to recruit Primary Teacher with Higher 
Qualification. The insufficient number of eligible D.EI.Ed. 
candidates due to tow pass percentage of TET 
examination has also become as issue for recruitment of 
primary teacher. Further, with the roll out of four year 
B.Ed. Integrated course from next academic year, the 
existing D.EI.E.D./B.Ed. Course will be phased out is 
due course of time. 
3. 
NCTE 
vide 
their 
letter 
No. 
NCTE-
REG1012/16/2018-IJS 
(Regulation)-HQ 
dated 
23.05.2018 stated that the MHRD may consider 
implementing the directions in the detailed noting of 
Hon'ble Minister of Human Resource Development 
Government of India. Further in view of the fact 
presented by the commissioner, KV and since the NCTE 
did not have any objection to permit KV schools to 
recruit primary teachers with higher qualifications, then 
there should be no objection to standing the to other 
schools. Therefore considering the powers vested 
in MHRD Under Section 29 of the NCTE Act 1993. 
The NCTE regulation 25.08.2010 (determining of 
teacher to be appointed at primary level class 1 st 
to 5 th ) shall be amended to include that any 
person who has acquired the qualification of 
B./Ed. from any NCTE recognised course will also 
be considered for appointment as a teacher in 
classes 1 st to 5 th provided the person so appointed 
as a teacher shall mandatory undergo a 6 month 
bridge course, which is recognised by NCTE, 
within two years of such appointment as primary 
teacher. 
4. 
It is therefore requested that the draft qualification 
to amend the NCTE regulation may please be submitted 
to this Ministry. This may please be treated as most 
urgent.

With regards. 
Yours sincerely

Director (TE)" 
(emphasis supplied by us) 

17. The petitioner Mukesh Kumar Royal had raised certain 

queries under the RTI Act, which were replied on 23.03.2021, in 

which it was provided that the bridge course had till then not been 

designed, however, a committee had been constituted to develop 

the norms and standards for six months bridge course and the 

report was awaited. 

18. Again through the means of RTI, the petitioners sought 

further information regarding deliberations, which took place 

before the impugned amendments were notified. Along with an 

order dated 28.10.2020 the appellate authority under the RTI Act 

provided certain internal documents, one of them was the minutes 

of the meeting dated 09.04.2018 of the officials of MHRD, 

according to which, the Kendriya Vidhyala Sangathan had 

informed the Ministry that up to the year 2011-2012 candidates 

having professional qualification of B.Ed. were also eligible for 

appointment in K.V.S. schools. However, from the year 2012-

2013, in compliance with the guidelines of NCTE, K.V.S. did not 

allow those candidates to be appointed. 
It was noted that 

sufficient number of candidates having the eligibility qualifications 

were not available, which adversely affected the quality in 

selection of teachers. 
It was recorded that the competent 

authority had given conditional approval to the K.V.S. to appoint 

primary teachers with higher qualification of BA, B.Sc. or B.Ed, in 

case sufficient number of D.El.Ed. candidates are not available. It 

was, therefore, suggested that it would not be appropriate to 


(144 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

remove first condition and the K.V.S. can decide as it is an 

autonomous body and competent to decide such matter. In short, 

the suggestion was not to include the B.Sc., B.A. or B.Ed. teachers 

in the eligibility criteria at par with other educational qualifications 

but to allow K.V.S. to expand the zone of consideration by 

including such qualifications, in case without inclusion of such 

candidates, it was not possible to fill up the posts. Significantly, 

these deliberations were with respect to K.V.S. schools alone. 

When this note was placed before the Hon'ble Minister of HRD, he 

placed detailed note expressing his opinion as under: 

"There are DL.ED. colleges is few states. Therefore, 
applications for primary teachers come from limited 
states. B.Ed. is a post graduate degree. They are ready 
to serve as Primary Teachers. So we get best more 
equipped teachers. The issue 
The issue therefore are two 
1. When more educated teachers are available why 
students should not get benefit of better qualified 
teachers, therefore, we must allow B.Ed. teachers. 
2. Second issue is pedagogical for primary teacher 
which is available in DL.Ed. & not in B.Ed. course. The 
member has been found by teaching one specific model 
through Swayam & contact programmer also. Thus, it 
is very clear that students have the right to have better 
teachers B.Ed. are more equipped as it is graduate +, 
while Dl.Ed. is 12+ 
Finally Decision should be 
1. Dl.Ed. will continue to the eligible to apply for 
Primary teacher post. 
2. Additionally, B.Ed. pass candidates will be also 
eligible to apply. 
3. When, Dl.Ed. candidates is selected they can start 
teaching after formalities. 
4. When B.Ed. candidate are selected, they will start 
teaching but will have to complete pedagogical module 
with in 2 years 
5. Thus Dl.Ed. & B.Ed. Candidates can apply for the job 
of Primary teacher in KV. 
Selected B.Ed. candidates will have to complete 
pedagogical module in 2 years of appointment." 


(145 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

19. According to the Minister, thus B.Ed. should be recognized as 

an additional qualification and not an alternative qualification for 

appointment to primary school teachers. However, this opinion 

also was confined to K.V.S. schools alone. 

20. Shri R.D. Rastogi, learned Additional Solicitor General 

appearing for the NCTE had placed before us further 

correspondence, which took place between NCTE and MHRD in this 

regard. These documents are taken on record. Perusal of 

these would show that after the Minister put his 

remarks on 11.04.2018, MHRD wrote to NCTE pointing out that 

the Minister has directed the NCTE to amend the qualifications and 

make B.Ed. also an eligibility for teaching primary level with a 

proviso of passing the module within two years of joining the 

service. We also note that in a meeting held on 28.05.2018 the 

officials of MHRD and Minister concerned discussed and 

deliberated the issues and decided to recognize B.Ed. degree 

course as an additional eligibility criteria for appointment to the 

post of primary school teachers in classes-I to V. The relevant 

portion of the minutes of this meeting reads as under: 

"File was called for. 
Kendriya Vidalaya Sangathan Vide letter No. F. 
11054/3/KVS(HQ)/RPS dated 18.05.2016 requested 
National Bank Council For Teacher Education to allow 
KVS to recruit Primary Teachers with higher 
qualification than prescribed by National Council for 
Teacher Education i.e. graduation with 50% marks 
and B.Ed. 
2. 
The matter was considered in this Ministry and 
HRM has approved the proposal of KVS to recruit 
primary teacher with higher qualification (i.e. 
B.A./B.Sc., B.Ed.+TET). Further, HRM has also 
directed that NCTE may amend the qualification and 
make B.A./B.Sc., B.Ed. also eligible for teaching at 
Primary level with provision of completing Pedagogical 
module in 2 years of joining the service, these 
directions were conveyed to NCTE on 12.04.2018, 
however, the action is still pending at their part. 


(146 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

3. 
The matter was again discussed and deliberated 
in detail in the meeting held today(28th May, 2018) 
chaired by HRM and attended by Special Secretary, 
Chairperson, NCTE, MS, NCTE, Joint Secretary (SE.I) 
and KVS Commissioner. KVS Commissioner raised the 
issues of insufficient number of candidates applying for 
the post of Primary teachers and candidates applying 
from few states rather than across the country. It was 
informed by MS, NCTE that approximately 7.5 lakh 
seat are available for D.El.Ed across the country out of 
which 50% seats are filled. However, the TET pass 
D.El.Ed. candidate would be much less as the result of 
TET varies from 6% to 16%. This makes the 
availability of eligible D.El.Ed. candidates much less 
than the desired. HRM also pointed out the need for 
better equipped teachers to ensure quality education 
in schools. Recruitment of Teachers with higher 
qualifications will ultimately be beneficial and in the 
interest of the students. 
4. 
In addition to above, NCTE will roll out four year 
B.Ed. integrated course from next academic year, 
therefore, the prevalent D.El.Ed./B.Ed. etc will phase 
out in time bound manner. Further, similar kind of 
request has also been from the state of Uttrakhand. 
5. 
In view of the above discussions, HRM directed 
NCTE to change its regulations, Directions are required 
to be given under section 29 of the NCTE Act, 1993. 
Section 29 of the NCTE Act is as follows: 
(1) The Council shall in the discharge of its functions 
and duties under this Act be bound by such directions 
on questions of policy as the Central Government may 
give in writing to it from time to time. 
(2) The decision of the Central Government as to 
whether a question is one of policy or not shall be 
final. 
6. 
We may request NCTE to submit draft notification 
to amend NCTE regulations at the earliest. The draft 
letter is attached for approval please. Once the draft 
notification is received, the same will be sent to 
Legislative Department for vetting with the approval of 
HRM. 
Submitted." 

21. This decision was summed up in a note dated 29.05.2018, 

which reads as under: 

"Please place on file the latter from NCTE which was 
handed over to the HRM by the MS, NCTE during the 
meeting, the details of which have been referred to in 
the draft reply. The meeting clearly took the decision 
that in view of the facts presented by the 
Commissioner, KV and since the NCTE did not have any 
objection to permit KV schools to recruit primary 


(147 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

teachers with higher qualifications, then there should 
be no objection to extending this to other schools, and 
therefore, this Ministry could issue directions to the 
NCTE under Section 29." 

22. The State Government holds a belief that such amendment 

was unconstitutional and could not have been thrust on the State. 

Ignoring such amendment, the State Government issued an 

advertisement dated 11 th January, 2021 inviting applications for 

REET aspirants. This advertisement did not recognize B.Ed degree 

holders as eligible for appearing in the test. In such scenario, the 

petitioner Mukesh Kumar Royal and others, who are non-B.Ed. 

degree holders have challenged the NCTE notification dated 

28.06.2018 Out of caution, they have also challenged the 

communication dated 30.05.2018 from MHRD to NCTE. The 

petitioner Sunita and others have supported the amendment and 

challenged the advertisement issued by the State Government 

inviting applications for REET. The State Government has 

supported the petitioners who have challenged the notification 

dated 28.06.2018. 

23. In such background, learned counsel appearing for the 

challengers of the notification dated 28.06.2018 including learned 

Advocate General appearing for the State Government have raised 

the following contentions:-

(i) 
B.Ed. qualification is not a higher qualification than D.El.Ed. 

and therefore, cannot be automatically included as eligibility 

criteria. 

(ii) Under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act, the 

authority for prescribing the qualifications for appointment 

as primary teachers lies with the NCTE. The Ministry of HRD 

had no authority to give any direction in this respect. 


(148 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

(iii) By virtue of the impugned notification, the candidates who 

are ineligible for appointment are made eligible subject to 

acquiring eligibility which is not permissible and in any case, 

is opposed to the basic idea of the responsibility of the State 

to provide quality primary education flowing from Article 21A 

of the Constitution. 

(iv) Even under the NCTE Act, MHRD has power only to give 

directions in relation to the policy matters. The question of 

prescribing eligibility criteria for appointment as teachers is 

exclusively within the domain of NCTE and it is not a policy 

matter in which the MHRD can have any say. 

(v) In terms of Section 35 of the NCTE Act any regulations 

framed by NCTE have to be placed before the Parliament for 

its approval, which has not been done in the present case. 

(vi) The eligibility criteria could not have been modified without 

amending the notification dated 12.11.2014 in which such 

minimum qualifications have been prescribed. 

(vii) It was contended that the power to relax the minimum 

qualifications were exercised without sufficient material 

available on record justifying exercise of such powers. It was 

argued that in the State of Rajasthan, there are large 

number of D.El.Ed. Pass candidates who are qualified for 

appointment as primary school teachers (classes I to V). 

Without examination of such data, the B.Ed. degree holders 

are made eligible. 

(viii) It was contended that the entire exercise before the Ministry 

of HRD was in relation to the request of the KVS to recognize 

B.Ed. degree as an alternative qualification, the source to be 

tapped when sufficient number of qualified candidates are 


(149 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

not available. This was also the view of the officials of MHRD. 

The Minister alone over-ruled this suggestion and required 

that B.Ed. may be recognized as additional qualification and 

that such decision may be projected across all schools in the 

country. 

(ix) It was argued by the learned Advocate General that the 

primary education is part of the Concurrent List in Schedule 

VII to the Constitution and under Article 309, it is the power 

of the State Government to make appointments to the posts 

created under the State Government. The Union Government 

while framing regulations contrary to the RTE Act and Rules 

framed thereunder, had usurped the power of the State 

Government to make appointment of qualified persons in the 

posts created under the State Government. 

24. On the other hand, the learned counsel for NCTE and the 

petitioners, who have supported the NCTE notification dated 

28.06.2018 have raised the following contentions:-

(i) The powers are exercised under Sub-section (1) of Section 

23 and not under Sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the RTE 

Act. It is therefore not necessary to examine the data in 

different States. 

(ii) The Ministry of HRD had the powers to give directions to the 

NCTE in relation to the policy matters. Essentially the 

educational qualification for appointment as primary teacher 

is an important policy issue. 

(iii) After due deliberations the MHRD formed a view that B.Ed. 

degree should be recognized as an additional qualification 

subject to passing the bridge course. 


(150 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

(iv) In policy matters, particularly in the area of technical fields 

such as education, the Court would not substitute its wisdom 

for that of the authorities duly empowered under the Statute 

and aided by experts in the field. 

(v) It was contended that the sufficiency of the materials before 

the Ministry for forming final opinion is not subject to judicial 

review. In any case, after full deliberations, the authority had 

come to the conclusion that the B.Ed. degree should be 

recognized as an additional qualification. It was pointed out 

that such qualification was recognized till the year 2012. 

(vi) It was contended that the earlier decisions of the Courts 

holding that B.Ed. is not a higher qualification were rendered 

in different background. If eventually the rule making 

authority was of the opinion that a person holding B.Ed. 

degree was just as qualified to impart education in primary 

schools (classes-I to V), the Court would not over-rule such 

matured decision arrived at after due deliberations. 

(vii) It was contended that not placing the regulations before the 

Parliament would not vitiate them since the provision under 

Section 35 of the NCTE Act, merely requires such regulations 

to be placed before the Parliament and does not attach any 

adverse consequences if this procedural requirement is not 

followed. 

(viii)It was argued that the purpose of constituting NCTE was 

principally for coordinated development of teacher education 

system across the country and the dominant purpose for 

constitution of NCTE was not for laying down qualifications 

for school teachers. 


(151 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

25. Both sides have relied upon and referred to various 

judgments, reference to which will be made at appropriate stages. 

26. As noted above, the NCTE has been authorized by the 

Central Government for the purposes of Sub-section (1) of Section 

23 as well as Sub-section (1) of Section 29 of the RTE Act. Sub-

section (1) of Section 23 pertains to minimum qualifications that a 

person must possess for eligibility for appointment as a teacher, 

whereas Sub-section (1) of Section 29 pertains to curriculum and 

evaluation procedure for elementary education to be laid down by 

the academic authority. The issues of eligibility for appointment as 

a teacher and the curriculum and evaluation procedure for 

elementary education are closely connected and interlinked. It is 

possibly for this reason, that in its wisdom, the Government of 

India has recognized NCTE as an academic authority for both the 

purposes. While exercising such powers, the NCTE evolves 

important criteria and guidelines for setting the curriculum and 

evaluation procedure for elementary education as well as 

prescribing minimum qualification for appointment as a teacher. 

27. Sub-section (1) of Section 23 thus authorizes NCTE as an 

academic authority duly notified by the Central Government for 

prescribing minimum qualifications for appointment as a teacher. 

The power and authority thus exclusively vests in NCTE. Sub-

section (2) of Section 23 is a special provision under which the 

Central Government retains its authority to relax the qualifications 

for appointment as a teacher under certain circumstances. As per 

this provision where a state does not have adequate institutions 

offering courses or training in teacher education or teachers 

possessing minimum qualifications as laid down under Sub-section 

(1) are not available in sufficient numbers, the Central 


(152 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

Government may, if it deems necessary, relax the minimum 

qualifications for appointment as a teacher for such period not 

exceeding 5 years as may be specified in the notification. First 

proviso of Sub-section (2) of Section 23 provides that a teacher 

who at the commencement of the Act does not possess minimum 

qualifications as laid down in Sub-section (1) shall acquire such 

qualification within a period of 5 years. Further proviso to Sub-

section (2) provides that every teacher appointed or in position as 

on 31.03.2015, who does not possess minimum qualifications as 

laid down under Sub-section (1) shall acquire such minimum 

qualification within a period of 4 years from the date of 

commencement of RTE (Amendment) Act 2017. 

28. Analysis of Sub-section (2) of Section 23 would thus show 

that the Central Government has the power to relax the 

qualifications laid down for appointment of the teacher where 

adequate number of institutions offering courses or training in 

teacher education or teachers possessing minimum qualifications 

in a state are not available. Such powers are in the nature of 

relaxation to the essential qualifications that may be prescribed 

under Sub-section (1) of Section 23. In the main body of Sub-

section (2) and the first and second proviso thereto reference is to 

the qualifications laid down under Sub-section (1). The emphasis 

is on the person to be appointed as a teacher to possess the 

qualification prescribed under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 which 

can be relaxed subject to fulfillment of conditions as provided. 

Thus, there is a clear distinction between the powers to be 

exercised under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 which are vested in 

the NCTE and those that can be exercised by the Central 


(153 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

Government under Sub-section (2) of Section 23 of relaxing the 

standards laid down by NCTE under Sub-section (1) of Section 23. 

29. With this clarity if we revert back to the materials on record, 

it would emerge that the entire exercise has been undertaken 

initially by the MHRD and thereafter by the NCTE as one under 

Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act. In fact, the learned 

Additional Solicitor General Shri Rastogi had repeatedly argued 

before us that the powers are exercised by NCTE under Sub-

section (1) of Section 23 and not Sub-section (2) of Section 23. If 

we proceed on such basis, immediate question of the authority of 

the Central Government to mandate the NCTE to make a certain 

change would arise. The RTE Act does not give power to the 

Central Government to give any such directions to the NCTE. We 

have reproduced Section 35 of the RTE Act which are in the nature 

of powers of the Central Government and other authorities to 

issue directions under Sub-section (1) of Section 35. The Central 

Government has the power to issue guidelines to the appropriate 

Government or the local authority for the purpose of 

implementation of the provisions of the Act. Local authority has 

been defined under clause (h) of Section 2 as to mean a Municipal 

Corporation or Municipal Council or Zila Parishad or Nagar 

Panchayat or Panchayat, by whatever names called and to include 

such authority or body having administrative control over the 

school or empowered by or under any law for the time being in 

force to function as local authority. Thus, the power of the Central 

Government to issue guidelines under Sub-section (1) of Section 

35 of the RTE Act does not extend to the NCTE as an academic 

authority notified under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE 

Act. A reference of-course was made to Section 29 of the NCTE 


(154 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

Act for such purpose. Under Sub-section (1) of Section 29, the 

NCTE shall in discharge of its functions and duties under the Act 

be bound by such directions on questions of policy as the Central 

Government may give in writing to it from time to time. However, 

in our opinion, the Central Government cannot trace the source of 

the power to give such directions to the NCTE in exercise of its 

power under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act. The 

primary source of the powers of the NCTE to frame regulations 

prescribing the minimum qualifications for appointment of 

teachers is in Sub-section (1) of Section 23. In exercise of such 

powers, the NCTE is not to be guided or be bound by any directive 

that the Central Government may issue. We do not find any such 

powers retained by the Central Government under the RTE Act. In 

plain terms therefore, the Ministry of HRD could not have 

mandated the NCTE to make the amendments in question. It is 

beyond dispute that the amendment is not the original work of 

NCTE. In fact, the opinion of the NCTE was that B.Ed. may be 

recognized as an alternative qualification for the purpose of KVS, 

where adequate number of otherwise qualified candidates are in 

short supply. Over-ruling such opinion of NCTE, the Ministry of 

HRD mandated that B.Ed. may be recognized as an additional 

qualification for all schools. This was clearly beyond the power of 

the Central Government. 

30. The RTE Act was enacted to provide for free and compulsory 

education to all children of the age of 6 to 14 years. As noted, as 

per Sub-section (1) of Section 23, a person possessing such 

minimum qualifications, as laid down by the academic authority 

authorised by the Central Government (i.e. NCTE) by notification 

shall be eligible for appointment as a teacher. The primary source 


(155 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

of the authority of the NCTE to lay down such minimum 

qualifications thus is Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act. 

We are not oblivion to the fact that Section 12A was inserted in 

NCTE Act with effect from 1.6.2012 which provides that for the 

purpose of maintaining standards of education in schools, the 

NCTE may, by regulations, determine the qualifications of persons 

for being recruited as teachers in various levels of schools and 

colleges. We may recall that the NCTE Act, as originally enacted, 

was to provide for establishment of a National Council for Teacher 

Education with a view to achieving planned and coordinate 

development of the teacher education system and for regulation 

and proper maintenance of norms and standards in the teacher 

education system. The purpose of qualifications of school teachers 

was inserted in the preamble only with effect from 1.6.2012. 

Essentially this Section 12A of the NCTE Act is an eco of the 

primary source of power of NCTE flowing from Section 23(1) of 

the RTE Act to lay down minimum qualifications for eligibility for 

appointment as a teacher. It is for this reason, therefore, in our 

opinion, the power of the Central Government to give directions to 

the NCTE under Section 29 of the NCTE Act cannot be utilized to 

require NCTE to frame regulations concerning eligibility for 

appointment as teacher under Section 23(1) of the RTE Act. 

31. Even otherwise, we do not think that the powers of the 

Central Government under Sub-section (1) of Section 29 of the 

NCTE Act are wide enough to require the NCTE to frame 

regulations for eligibility in a particular manner. As per Sub-

section (1) of Section 29, the NCTE shall in the discharge of its 

functions and duties under the Act be bound by directions on 

question of policy as the Central Government may give in writing 


(156 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

to it from time to time. The power of the Central Government to 

issue directions to the NCTE and its binding effect are confined to 

the question of policy. The legislature has advisedly limited the 

powers of the Central Government to issue directions only on the 

question of policy. 
The powers thus are not plenary or all 

pervasive but are restricted to the question of policy alone. Such 

provision, therefore, has to be interpreted strictly. The legislature 

has constituted the NCTE with specified duties, functions and 

powers and which Council consists of various experts in the field. 

The legislature has also while empowering the Central government 

to give directions to the Council, advisedly restricted such powers 

on the question of policy. 
The directions of the Central 

Government therefore cannot be for day to day functioning of the 

NCTE or for purposes other than the policy matters. Framing of 

regulations prescribing eligibility criteria or minimum qualifications 

for appointment as primary teachers certainly cannot be seen as a 

policy matter. 

32. In the case of A. Manoharan and others vs. Union of 

India and others [(2008) 3 SCC 641] while interpreting the 

powers of the Central Government to give directions to the Major 

Trust under Sub-section (1) of Section 111 of the Major Port Trusts 

Act, 1963, which provided that the authority in discharge of its 

functions under the Act be bound by such directions on questions 

of policy as the Central Government may give in writing from time 

to time, it was held and observed as under: 

"24. The power of the Central Government to issue 
directions as contained in Section 111 of the 1963 Act 
cannot be stretched to amend the Regulations. Power 
must be exercised by the Central Government only in 
regard to the administration of the Trust. Such a power 
to issue direction must be construed strictly. (See 


(157 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport 
Authority of India (1979) 3 SCC 489, Harjit Singh v. 
State of Punjab (2007) 9 SCC 582, Ashoka Smokeless 
Coal India (P) Ltd. v. Union of India (2007) 2 SCC 640 
and Poonam Verma v. DDA. (2007) 13 SCC 154)" 

33. We may also not be unduly perturbed by the finality attached 

to the decision of the Central Government under Section 29(2) of 

the NCTE Act on the question of what constitutes policy matter. 

Any such decision is open to judicial review of the court under 

Article 226 of the Constitution. Such judicial review being a basic 

feature of the Constitution as held by the judgment of the 

Supreme Court in the case of L. Chandra Kumar vs. Union of 

India and other [(1997) 3 SCC 261] cannot be barred. 

34. Though not so projected before us, if the Central 

Government was exercising powers under Sub-section (2) of 

Section 23, the same had to be upon fulfillment of conditions 

precedent for exercise of such powers. As noted, it is open for the 

Central Government to relax the qualifications prescribed under 

Sub-section (1) of Section 23, if adequate institutions offering 

courses or training in teacher education or teachers possessing 

minimum qualifications in a state are not available in sufficient 

numbers. Firstly, Sub-section (2) refers to such short fall arising in 

a state meaning thereby such powers have to be exercised state-

wise. Secondly, the powers can be exercised only upon the Central 

Government finding that in such a state adequate institutions 

offering courses or training are not available or teachers 

possessing minimum qualifications are not available in sufficient 

numbers. Only if these conditions are satisfied, the power of 

relaxing the minimum qualification prescribed under Sub-section 


(158 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

(1) of Section 23 can be exercised, not otherwise. In the present 

case, no such exercise has been undertaken. The broad discussion 

of number of vacancies and short fall in certain regions would not 

satisfy the requirements for exercise of powers under Sub-section 

(2) of Section 23. Further, as recorded above such powers were 

state specific and had to be exercised in relation to a particular 

state. Undoubtedly, within the state of Rajasthan no such exercise 

has been carried out. 

35. Learned counsel for the supporters of the impugned 

notification have argued before us that the State Government or 

the petitioners challenging the notification have not produced any 

data to show that sufficient number of candidates other than 

holding B.Ed. degree course were available. To our mind, this was 

not the requirement for exercise of powers under Sub-section (2) 

of Section 23. The requirement was establishing that the factors 

necessary for exercising the powers existed and the required 

collection of data as to the number of vacancies vis-a-vis number 

of eligible candidates available without relaxing the minimum 

qualifications was undertaken. Under the circumstances, it is not 

necessary to go into the details of the statements made before us 

either by the petitioners challenging the notification or the learned 

Advocate General appearing for the State Government, who had 

stated that in the REET conducted on 26.09.2021 for primary, 

upper primary school teacher (level-1), 3,50,000 odd candidates 

holding the qualifications of BSTC D.El.Ed. had participated against 

18850 vacant posts. 


(159 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

36. Even going by the insertion of B.Ed. as a recognized 

qualification, it is manifest that the B.Ed. per se is not sufficient 

educational qualification. It is for this reason that the MHRD 

desired and NCTE has introduced the requirement of passing of 

the bridge course. It is only on passing of such bridge course that 

the candidate would become eligible to hold the post of primary 

school teacher (classes-I to V). This should not be misunderstood 

as an in-service training after recruitment. This is a part and 

parcel of the eligibility criteria prescribed in the Rules. 

37. We may recall that the amended qualifications are that the 

person may have a B.Ed. degree and may compete for the 

appointment, however after appointment within a period of two 

years, he must pass the bridge course of six months which will be 

designed by the NCTE. In clear terms, the intention is to design a 

course which will equip a candidate to impart education at the 

primary school level (classes-I to V). This is an indirect admission 

on the part of the authorities that minus such bridge course, a 

B.Ed. degree holder is not qualified to hold the post of a primary 

school teacher (classes-I to V). If upon fulfillment of conditions 

required for exercising powers under Sub-section (2) of Section 

23, the Central Government had relaxed the standards by 

enabling a B.Ed. degree holder to secure appointment but to clear 

the bridge course within the specified time, perhaps no challenge 

would lie against exercise of such powers. However, even the 

Union of India has not taken the stand that the powers are 

exercised by the Central Government under Sub-section (2) of 

Section 23 of the RTE Act. In any case, we have concluded that no 

such powers could have been exercised without satisfying that the 

conditions precedent for exercising such powers existed. 


(160 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

38. Since the MHRD as well as NCTE through the process of 

framing the amendments and issuing the notification of 

amendment have recognized that B.Ed. degree per se is not a 

sufficient qualification for appointment as teacher in primary 

school (classes-I to V), it is not necessary to dilate on the 

question whether a B.Ed. degree is a higher qualification as 

compared to D.El.Ed. or not. To borrow mathematical phraseology, 

B.Ed. degree course does not form a super set of training of which 

D.El.Ed. Diploma training forms a sub set. In other words, a B.Ed. 

degree holder cannot argue that he has sufficient training to teach 

not only higher standards but also the primary level standard I to 

V and what is taught to a D.El.Ed. course is part and parcel of his 

training. This was rejected by the Supreme Court in the cases of 

P.M. Latha and others vs. State of Kerala and others [2003 

(3) SCC 541] and Yogesh Kumar and others vs. Government 

of NTC, Delhi and others [2003 (3) SCC 548]. 

39. In the case of P.M. Latha (supra), for recruitment to the post 

of lower and upper primary school teachers in Government 

schools, qualification prescribed was Trained Teachers Certificate 

('TTC', for short) pass. Instead of selecting the TTC holders, B.Ed. 

degree holders were selected on the basis that B.Ed. is higher 

qualification than TTC. It was in this background held that there is 

no force in the argument that B.Ed. qualification is higher 

qualification than TTC. Similar view was expressed in the case of 

Yogesh Kumar (supra). This is also a case where for the post of 

assistant teachers in primary schools of Municipal Corporation, 

qualifications prescribed were TTC holders. It was held that the 

candidates holding B.Ed. degree cannot be considered eligible as 

B.Ed. cannot be treated higher qualification than TTC. 


(161 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

40. Learned Additional Solicitor General however painstakingly 

argued that these judgments were rendered in vastly different 

background and arose in a situation which no longer prevails. For 

two reasons, we are not prepared to accept this contention in its 

fullest form. Despite the above noted judgments of the Supreme 

Court, if the rule making authority had after due deliberations 

come to a conclusion that it is necessary to recognize B.Ed. 

degree as one of the eligibility criteria for appointment, in exercise 

of judicial review, out of due deference to the expertise of the 

academic authority, we would perhaps have not interfered. 

However, even the academic authority has not proceeded on the 

basis that B.Ed. is a sufficient training for imparting education at 

the lowest level of primary schools. It is therefore that the bridge 

course, which literally would bridge the training gap has been 

envisaged. 

41. With these conclusions, we may deal with a few peripheral 

issues and contentions. 

42. Since we have held that the NCTE has exercised powers 

under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act and also held 

that in case the Central Government could not have given 

directions to the NCTE for framing the regulations in a particular 

manner for prescribing a particular eligibility criteria for 

appointment of a teacher under Section 29 of the NCTE Act, it is 

not necessary to examine the consequences of the regulations not 

being placed for approval before the Parliament. 

43. The learned counsel Shri Vigyan Shah was perhaps not 

correct in contending that NCTE could not have amended the 

eligibility criteria without amending the notification dated 

12.11.2014. Under this notification, Clause (4) provides for 


(162 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

qualification for recruitment as provided in the schedule. The first 

schedule pertains to minimum academic and professional 

qualifications at different level of schools. Clause 3 contained in 

the schedule pertains to primary and upper primary (Class I to 

VIII) and the qualification prescribed are "minimum qualifications 

as laid down by National Council for Teacher Education vide its 

notification dated 23.08.2010 as amended from time to time 

issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Sub-section (1) 

of Section 23 of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory 

Education Act, 2009 (35 of 2009)". As per these Regulations thus, 

the essential qualifications for appointment are those as 

prescribed under the notification issued under Sub-section (1) of 

Section 23 of the Act, namely, one dated 23.08.2010 as amended 

from time to time. Thus, the moment the notification dated 

23.08.2010 is amended by NCTE in exercise of powers under Sub-

section (1) of Section 23 automatically such change gets reflected 

and embedded in the qualifications prescribed in the first schedule 

of these regulations. Thereafter, therefore, there was no need to 

amend this notification. All challenges in the preliminary 

notification dated 23.08.2010 would automatically be recognized 

for the purpose of the said schedule. 

44. The debate has also taken place with respect to the stand of 

the State Government. Firstly, with respect to the State 

Government as a respondent challenging the notification of NCTE, 

it was argued by the learned Additional Solicitor General that such 

challenge without a counter petition being filed, was not 

maintainable as per the High Court Rules. Second contentious 

issue was the act of the State Government to ignore the NCTE 


(163 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

notification making amendment in the eligibility criteria and not 

recognizing B.Ed. degree holders for the purpose of REET. 

45. Since there are independent petitions and petitioners before 

us who have challenged the notification of NCTE, it is not 

necessary for us to examine whether the State Government on its 

own as respondent could maintain its challenge without filing an 

independent petition. However, with respect to the second ground, 

we are of the opinion that the State Government could not have 

ignored the notification while inviting applications for REET. Even if 

the State Government was of the opinion that such notification 

was unconstitutional or for any reason illegal, the same had to be 

stayed or set aside by a competent court before it could be 

ignored. 

46. The contention of Shri Rastogi that the challengers to the 

notification have no locus standi to bring the petition because the 

amendment merely expands the zone of consideration, cannot be 

accepted. Whether by mere expansion of zone of consideration the 

challenge will succeed or not is a matter of a different context but 

a person who is already eligible finds himself in a wider 

competition on account of widening the zone of consideration for 

appointment or promotion holds a belief that such amendment is 

illegal he has every right to call in question. To reiterate the 

question of locus standi of such a person and maintainability of his 

or her petition stands on vastly different footing as compared to 

the success or failure of such challenge to widening of the zone of 

consideration for appointment or promotion. The judgments relied 

upon in this context by Shri Rastogi in the cases of Government 

of Andhra Pradesh vs. P. Dilip Kumar and others [1993 (2) 

SCC 310] and Shyama Charan Dash and others vs. State of 


(164 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

Orissa and others [2003 (4) SCC 218] would fall in a latter 

category. It is open for him to argue that when the only 

consequence of the amendments in the regulations is expanding 

the zone of consideration, the Court should not strike down the 

amendment is entirely different from arguing that the persons 

recognized as eligible as per the existing regulations cannot 

question the amendment. 

47. We concede to the suggestion of the learned Additional 

Solicitor General that in policy matters and particularly in 

specialized and highly technical fields such as education, the Court 

always holds the opinion of the policy framers with highest 

regards and would not substitute its wisdom for that of the 

specialized body. The reference to the decisions of the Supreme 

Court in the case of All India Council for Technical Education 

vs. Surinder Kumar Dhawan and others [(2009) 11 SCC 

726] and Zahoor Ahmad Rather and others vs. Sheikh 

Imtiyaz Ahmad and others [(2019) 2 SCC 404] for such 

purpose is noted. However, in the present case, we have not 

questioned the wisdom of the rule making authority to make a 

certain change in the eligibility criteria. What we have held is that 

the same was done under the mandate of the Central Government 

without such powers being vested. 

48. The learned Advocate General is not quite accurate in 

contending that by prescribing these qualifications there is affront 

on the State's power to recruit persons on the posts under the 

State Government. Quite apart, the power under Article 309 of the 

Constitution to make recruitment by the State agencies, the 

eligibility criteria for various posts can be prescribed under 

respective statutes governing the terms and conditions of 


(165 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

education and such similar positions. Even under Sub-rule (3) of 

Rule 266 of the Rajasthan Panchayat Raj Rules, 1996, the State 

legislature has provided that the qualifications of the teachers 

would be as prescribed by the NCTE. 

49. We summarize our conclusions as thus: 

(i) 
The impugned notification dated 28.06.2018 is unlawful 

because:-

(a) it is under the direction of the Central Government, 

which power the Central Government under Sub-

section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act did not have; 

and 

(b) it is not in exercise of power of the Central Government 

under Sub-section (2) of Section 23 of RTE Act relaxing 

the eligibility criteria prescribed by the NCTE, nor there 

has been any exercise for ascertaining existence of the 

conditions precedent for exercising such power. 

(ii) The petitioners have locus standi to challenge the notification 

dated 28.06.2018. Merely because an additional qualification 

is recognized as one of the eligibility criteria, the petitioners 

cannot be prevented from challenging it. 

(iii) Accepting a candidate with B.Ed. degree as eligible for 

appointment and thereafter subjecting him to complete the 

bridge course within two years of appointment is in the 

nature of relaxing the existing eligibility criteria, which the 

Central Government could have done only within Sub-section 

(2) of Section 23 and subject to existence of circumstances 

necessary for exercise of such power. 

(iv) The State Government could not have ignored the 

notification of NCTE dated 28.06.2018 while issuing 


(166 of 166) 

[CW-1853/2021] 

advertisement for REET. However, when we have declared 

that this notification is illegal and are in the process of 

setting aside, the issue becomes one of academic value. 

50. In the result, the impugned notification dated 28.06.2018 is 

set aside. The latter dated 30 th May 2018 of the MHRD to NCTE 

being in the nature of internal communication, does not give rise 

to cause of action unless acted upon and therefore, it is not 

necessary to separately set it aside. 

51. The writ petitions being D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 

6587/2021 filed by Mukesh Kumar Royal and other similar 

connected petitions are allowed. 

52. The writ petitions being D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 

2108/2021 filed by Sunita and other similar connected petitions 

are dismissed. 

53. The interim orders granted earlier allowing the petitioners 

holding B.Ed. degree to appear in the REET are vacated. The 

candidature of those petitioners, who appeared in the REET under 

the interim orders of this Court, shall not be processed further. 

54. All applications stand disposed of accordingly.
