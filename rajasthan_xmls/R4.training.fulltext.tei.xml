			<item>[CW-85/2020]<lb/></item>

			<p>10/01/2022<lb/> In wake of instant surge in COVID-19 cases and spread of its<lb/> highly infectious Omicron variant, the lawyers have been advised<lb/> to refrain from coming to the Courts.<lb/> Since the controversy involved in all these writ petitions is<lb/> common, thus, are decided by a common order; Ramji Lal Kulhari<lb/> being the lead case.<lb/> The petitioners have preferred these writ petitions, in sum<lb/> and substance, for the following reliefs :-<lb/>SBCWP No.85/2020:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;To issue an appropriate writ and direct the respondents to grant one<lb/> notional increment to the petitioner with effect from 1.7.2019, on rendering 12<lb/> months service and re-fix his pension taking into account the same and revise all his<lb/> pensionary benefits and make payments of the consequential arrears thereof, along<lb/> with interest as per mandatory provisions for grant of interest on delayed payment<lb/> of retiral benefits, under Rule 89 of RSR. Any adverse order, if passed, on the<lb/> pending notice for demand of justice may also be quashed.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>The factual matrix of case in brief is that the petitioner was<lb/> initially appointed on the post of Vehicle Driver on 5.8.1996 and<lb/> posted in Prathmic Health Centre at Bhansali (Rajgarh). His date<lb/> of birth being 10.06.1959. The petitioner retired from service on<lb/> 30.6.2019 vide order dated 28.6.2019.<lb/> The bone of contention is Rule 14 of the Rajasthan Civil<lb/> Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as the<lb/> &quot;Rules of 2008&quot;) and Rule 13 of the Rajasthan Civil Services<lb/> (Revised Pay) Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Rules of<lb/> 2017&quot;). The petitioner is seeking implementation of retiral benefits<lb/> as on 01.07.2019.<lb/> Counsel for the petitioner has drawn attention of this Court<lb/> to order dated on 30.07.2021 passed by Hon`ble Orissa High<lb/> (23 of 32)<lb/> [CW-85/2020]<lb/> Court in Arun Kumar Biswal Vs. State of Odisha and Ors.,<lb/> reported in MANU/OR/0388/2021; relevant paras whereof are<lb/> reads as follows :-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;13. In the above order of the Madras High Court, it was held that<lb/> as the petitioner therein had completed one full year service as on<lb/> 30.06.2013, but the increment fell due on 01.07.2013, on which<lb/> date he was not in service, though the date of increment fell due on<lb/> the next date of his retirement, the petitioner would be given one<lb/> notional increment for the period from 01.07.2012 to 30.06.2013,<lb/> as he had completed full one year of service, for the purpose of<lb/> pensionary benefits and not for any other purpose. The said order<lb/> of the Madras High Court was challenged in SLP(C) Diary No(s).<lb/></item>

			<p>22283 of 2018 and the apex Court dismissed the said SLP preferred<lb/> by the Union of India and upheld the order of the Madras High<lb/> Court in P. Ayyamperumal (supra). Although a review petition was<lb/> filed by the Union of India bearing R.P.(C) No. 1731 of 2019, the<lb/> same was dismissed vide order dated 08.08.2019. Thereby, the<lb/> order of the Madras High Court has reached its finality by<lb/> dismissal of the SLP as well as the review petition preferred by the<lb/> Union of India.<lb/></p>

			<p>14. Similarly, in the case of Yogendra Singh Bhadauria, mentioned<lb/> supra, Madhya Pradesh High Court, by applying the ratio decided<lb/> in P. Ayyamperumal (supra), directed as follows:-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;(i) The official respondents are directed to release the<lb/> increment due to the appellants w.e.f. 01.07.2014,<lb/> 01.07.2010, 01.07.2013, 01.07.2012, 01.07.2015 and<lb/> 01.07.2015 respectively.<lb/></item>

			<item>(ii) The pension be refixed after adding the grant of<lb/> aforesaid increment and the arrears of pension be paid<lb/> to the petitioners.<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii) The petitioners are entitled to interest over the<lb/> aforesaid arrears of pension @ 10% p.a. from the date<lb/> the arrears became due till their payment.<lb/></item>

			<item>(iv) Despite the rule position having been explained by<lb/> the Division Bench of Madras High Court on 15.09.2017<lb/> against which Supreme Court declined to entertain the<lb/> (24 of 32)<lb/></item>

			<item>[CW-85/2020]<lb/> SLP of the employer on 23.07.2018, the official<lb/> respondents ought to have offered the benefit of one<lb/> increment to the petitioners without compelling the<lb/> petitioners to approach the court in the evening of 10 WA<lb/> 645-2020 their life. Not having done so, the official<lb/> respondents have failed to adhere to the policy of the<lb/> Government of being a welfare State and therefore,<lb/> respondents are liable to pay cost of this litigation to the<lb/> petitioners which are quantified at Rs. 5000/-to each of<lb/> the petitioners.<lb/></item>

			<item>(v) The aforesaid direction be complied with within a<lb/> period of 60 days from the date of receipt copy of this<lb/> order.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>15. In Gopal Singh (supra), the Delhi High Court in paragraph-10<lb/> of the order dated 23.01.2020 directed as follows:<lb/> &quot;10. Accordingly, the impugned order dated 3rd May,<lb/> 2019 is set aside. A direction is issued to the Respondents<lb/> to grant notional increment to the petitioner with effect<lb/> from 1st July, 2019. The petitioner&apos;s pension will<lb/> consequentially be refixed. The appropriate orders will be<lb/> issued and arrears of pension will be paid to the<lb/> petitioner within a period of 6 weeks, failing which the<lb/> respondents would be liable to simple interest at 6% per<lb/> annum on the arrears of period of delay.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>16. The cumulative effect of the ratio decided in all the<lb/> aforementioned judgments is that if a person continues in service<lb/> and completes one year, he shall be entitled to get the notional<lb/> increment to be fixed, as on the next date he is no more in<lb/> employment, for the purpose of grant of pensionary benefits.<lb/></p>

			<p>17. The stand taken in the present case by the opposite parties is<lb/> akin to the objection raised in P. Ayyamperumal (supra) by Union<lb/> of India contending that the petitioner being no more in<lb/> employment on the date the increment fallen due, even though he<lb/> had completed 12 months of service and on attaining the age of<lb/> superannuation he was retired. Having considered such contention,<lb/> the Madras High Court passed an order to fix the notional<lb/> increment for pensionary benefits and extend the same to the<lb/> petitioner therein. In such view of the matter, this Court is of the<lb/> view that the representations filed by the petitioner have been<lb/> (25 of 32)<lb/> [CW-85/2020]<lb/> rejected on 14.07.2020 in Annexure-3 without complying with the<lb/> provisions of law, as have been settled by the different High Courts<lb/> as well as the apex Court and, thereby, the same cannot sustain in<lb/> the eye of law.<lb/></p>

			<p>18. In view of the facts and law, as discussed above, this Court is of<lb/> the considered view that the petitioner, having rendered service<lb/> from 01.01.2019 to 31.12.2019 for a period of 12 months and his<lb/> increment having due on 01.01.2020 and he having stood at par<lb/> with P. Ayyamperumal (supra), is entitled to get the notional<lb/> increment for the year i.e. from 01.01.2019 to 31.12.2019 for the<lb/> purpose of pensionary benefits only. Accordingly, it is directed that<lb/> the benefits admissible to the petitioner be re-fixed taking into<lb/> account the notional increment admissible to the petitioner by<lb/> 01.01.2020 and the same should be paid as early as possible by<lb/> revising the pension as due, preferably within a period of 3 (three)<lb/> months from the date of communication of this judgment.<lb/> Consequentially, the order dated 14.07.2020 in Annexure-3,<lb/> whereby the representations of the petitioner have been rejected, is<lb/> liable to be quashed and is hereby quashed.<lb/></p>

			<p>19. In the result, the writ petition is allowed. There shall be no<lb/> order as to costs.<lb/> As the restrictions due to resurgence of COVID-19 situation are<lb/> continuing, learned counsel for the parties may utilize a printout of<lb/> the judgment available in the High Court&apos;s website, at par with<lb/> certified copy, subject to attestation by the concerned advocate, in<lb/> the manner prescribed vide Court&apos;s Notice No. 4587, dated 25th<lb/> March, 2020 as modified by Court&apos;s Notice No. 4798 dated 15th<lb/> April, 2021.&quot;<lb/> Counsel for the respondents, however, submits that the<lb/> controversy of benefit being applicable to the persons who have<lb/> retired on 30 th June of a particular year and not with effect from<lb/> 1 st July has already been decided by Hon`ble Division Bench of<lb/> this Court in the matter of Safi Mohammad Vs. State of<lb/> Rajasthan &amp; Anr. (D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.6024/2021),<lb/> (26 of 32)<lb/> [CW-85/2020]<lb/> decided on 01.12.2021. The order dated 01.12.2021 reads as<lb/> follows :-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;This petition is filed by several retired employees of the State of<lb/> Rajasthan. They all have retired in different years, however, the<lb/> common factor being that their date of retirement was 30th June of<lb/> the respective year. They have challenged Rule 14 of the Rajasthan<lb/> Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008 (hereinafter to be referred<lb/> as the &quot;Rules of 2008&quot;) and Rule 13 of the Rajasthan Civil<lb/> Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2017 (hereinafter to be referred to as<lb/> the &quot;Rules of 2017&quot;). They have also prayed for direction to grant<lb/> notional annual increment for having worked for one full year<lb/> before the date of retirement and to draw the pension accordingly.<lb/></item>

			<p>Briefly stated the case of the petitioners is that prior to the<lb/> promulgation of the Rules of 2008 in the State service, annual<lb/> increment of an employee was released on the date of completion of<lb/> a year in service. With introduction of the Rules of 2008, the<lb/> different dates of the increments falling due for different employees<lb/> was consolidated on 1st July of the year concerned, as provided in<lb/> Rule 14 which reads as under:-<lb/>&quot;14. Date of next increment in the running pay<lb/> band-There will be uniform date of annual increment,<lb/> viz. 1st July of every year. Employees completing 6<lb/> months and above in the running pay band as on 1st<lb/> of July will be eligible ot be granted the increment.<lb/> The first increment after fixation of pay on 01.09.2006<lb/> or thereafter as per option in the running pay band<lb/> will be granted to the employees, who have completed<lb/> 6 months and above as on 01.07.2007.<lb/> Provided that in the case of persons who had<lb/> been drawing maximum of the existing pay scale for<lb/> more than a year as on the 1st day of September,<lb/> 2006, the next increment in the running pay band shall<lb/> be allowed on the 1st day of September, 2006.<lb/> Thereafter, the provision of Rule 14 would apply.<lb/> Note-In cases where two existing scales, one being a<lb/> promotional scale for the other, are merged, and the<lb/> junior Government servant, now drawing his pay at<lb/> (27 of 32)<lb/> [CW-85/2020]<lb/> equal or lower stage in the lower scale of pay,<lb/> happens to draw more pay in the running pay band<lb/> than the pay of the Senior Government servant in the<lb/> existing higher scale, the pay in the running pay band<lb/> of the senior Government servant shall be stepped up<lb/> to that of his junior from the same date and he shall<lb/> draw next increment in accordance with Rule 14.&quot;<lb/> This pattern continued even under the Rules of<lb/> 2017 as provided in Rule 13 which reads as under:-<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;13. Date of next increment in revised pay structure-<lb/></item>

			<p>(1) There will be a uniform date of annual<lb/> increment viz. 1st July of every year after fixation of<lb/> pay under these rules. Employees completing 6<lb/> months and above in any Level as on 1st of July will<lb/> be eligible to be granted the increment.<lb/></p>

			<p>(2) Every new recruit on completion of<lb/> probation period successfully shall be allowed first<lb/> annual increment on 1st July, which immediately<lb/> follows the date of completion of probation period.&quot;<lb/> Since all the petitioners retired on 30th June of the<lb/> respective years, they were not granted the increment falling due<lb/> on the following 1st July. Their grievance is that they having<lb/> rendered Government service for one full year, the benefit of the<lb/> last increment has not been given to them. They argue that the rule<lb/> should be interpreted in such a way that they get this last<lb/> increment. In the alternative, their contention is that the rule<lb/> should be held ultra-vires and should be struck down. Learned<lb/> counsel for the petitioners have referred to certain decisions of<lb/> Madras High Court and Delhi High Court taking such a view. We<lb/> would make a reference to these judgments at a later stage.<lb/> On the other hand, learned Additional Advocate General<lb/> appearing for the Government opposed the petition contending that<lb/> the rule making authority has specified 1st July of the year for<lb/> release of annual increment for all Government employees. The<lb/> rule is reasonable and non-discriminatory. As the rule stands, the<lb/> only interpretation possible is that a person who retires w.e.f. 30th<lb/> June of a year, is not entitled to claim the increment falling due on<lb/> 1 st July of that year.<lb/></p>

			<p>(28 of 32)<lb/> [CW-85/2020]<lb/> Learned counsel relied on a decision of Division Bench of<lb/> Himachal Pradesh High Court in the case of Hari Prakash Vs.<lb/> State of Himanchal Pradesh and others reported in 2020 SCC<lb/> OnLine HP 2362, in which this interpretation has been accepted.<lb/> We have reproduced Rules 14 and 13 of the respective rules<lb/> which pertain to the date of next increment in a pay band. As noted,<lb/> prior to the promulgation of the Rules of 2008, the increments were<lb/> released in favour of a Government employee on different dates<lb/> depending on the date of joining the service. However, the Central<lb/> Government as well as the State Government rationalized this date<lb/> of release of annual increment for all Government employees on<lb/> 1st July of a particular year. In Rule 14 of Rules of 2008, therefore,<lb/> it is provided that there will be uniform date of annual increment,<lb/> namely, 1st July of every year. Such annual increment would be<lb/> released to every employee completing 6 months and above in the<lb/> running pay band as on 1st July. To obviate the difficulties of the<lb/> existing employees, this rule provides that the first increment after<lb/> fixation of pay on 01.09.2006 (i.e. the date from which the Rules of<lb/> 2008 were made effective) or thereafter as per the option in the<lb/> running pay band will be granted to the employees who had<lb/> completed 6 months and above as on 01.07.2007. Similar<lb/> provisions have been made in Rule 13 of the Rules of 2017.<lb/> We do not find any force in the submission of the learned<lb/> counsel for the petitioners that every employee who retires on 30th<lb/> June of a particular year, must receive the increment which as per<lb/> these rules falls due on 1st July. The grant of annual increment is<lb/> part of pay structure which the Government prescribes for its<lb/> employees and is governed by statutory rules. Annual increment is<lb/> granted by way of incentive in order to reward long service<lb/> rendered by the Government employee. It is different from the<lb/> dearness allowance which the Government declares from time to<lb/> time and is meant to offset for the diminished value of purchasing<lb/> price of the rupee with increase in inflation. Such increment can be<lb/> claimed only in terms of the statutory rules.<lb/> We are conscious that the Madras High Court and Delhi<lb/> High Court have taken a different view. Heavy reliance was placed<lb/> by the learned counsel for the petitioner on a Division Bench<lb/> judgment of Madras High Court in the case of P. Ayyamperumal<lb/> Vs. The Registar and others (W.P. No. 15732 of 2017 decided on<lb/> (29 of 32)<lb/></p>

			<item>[CW-85/2020]<lb/></item>

			<item>15.09.2017). This judgment proceeds on the earlier judgment of the<lb/> Court in the case of State of Tamil Nadu Vs. M.<lb/> Balasubramaniam (CDJ 2012 MHC 6525) which was rendered by<lb/> the Single Judge and approved by the Division Bench. Likewise, the<lb/> Division Bench of Delhi High Court in the case of Gopal Singh Vs.<lb/> Union of India and others (W.P.(C) 10509/2019 decided on<lb/> 23.01.2020), has also relied upon and accepted the decision in case<lb/> of M. Balasubramaniam(supra) of Madras High Court. Yet another<lb/> decision in the case of Arun Chhibber Vs. Union of Indian and<lb/> others (W.P.(C) 5539/2019 decided on 13.01.2020), the Division<lb/> Bench of Delhi High Court reiterated this proposition on the basis<lb/> of decision in the case of M. Balasubramaniam (supra).<lb/> We have perused the decision of the Madras High Court in<lb/> the case of M. Balasubramaniam (supra) which is the base<lb/> judgment, which the subsequent Division Benches of Madras High<lb/> Court and Delhi High Court have followed. This was a case in<lb/> which the petitioner, who was in State service, had retired w.e.f.<lb/> 31st March, 2003. He had claimed the benefit of pension on the<lb/> basis of increment which fell due on 01.04.2003, on the basis of the<lb/> judgment of Supreme Court in the case of S. Banerjee Vs. Union<lb/> of India and others (AIR 1990 SC 285). Upon his superannuation,<lb/> he was re-employed and continued in service up to 31st March,<lb/> 2003. It was on that basis that the petitioner had claimed the<lb/> benefit of an additional annual increment falling due on<lb/> 01.04.2003. This was opposed by the Government on the ground<lb/> that on 01.04.2003, he was not in Government service. In such<lb/> background, the High Court had allowed the petition and directed<lb/> that the representation of the petitioner for grant of annual<lb/> increment for the period from 01.04.2002 to 31.03.2003 shall be<lb/> considered in light of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the<lb/> case of S. Banerjee (supra).<lb/> If we peruse the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case<lb/> of S. Banerjee (supra), the facts were that the petitioner was<lb/> allowed to retire voluntarily from service with effect from the<lb/> forenoon of 1st January, 1986. He was not given the benefit of<lb/> revision of salary which was brought into effect from 01.01.1986.<lb/> The Government had argued before the Supreme Court that in view<lb/> of the proviso of Rule 5(2) of the Central Civil Service (Pension)<lb/> Rules, 1972, the petitioner will not be entitled to any salary for the<lb/> (30 of 32)</item>
