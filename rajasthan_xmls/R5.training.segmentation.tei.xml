JUSTICE SUDESH BANSAL <lb/>Order <lb/>29/11/2021 <lb/>In this group of petitions, the petitioners have challenged the <lb/>vires of Regulations 6(1)(c), 6(2)(c) and 6(4)(d) of the Indian <lb/>Medicine Central Council (Minimum Standards of Education in <lb/>Indian Medicine) Amendment Regulations, 2016 (hereinafter to be <lb/>referred to as the said Regulations). The petitioners have also <lb/>prayed for consequential directions for allowing them to appear in <lb/>the examination which was to be held shortly after the petitions <lb/>were filed. <lb/>The facts may be noted from Writ Petition No.2638/2021 in <lb/>the case of Rajesh Choudahry. The petitioner was admitted in <lb/>Mahatama Jyotiba Fule Ayurved Maha Vidhyalaya, Chomu, District <lb/>Jaipur in the academic year 2017 in the Aurved Medicine course <lb/>after passing his senior higher secondary Examination and on the <lb/>basis of pre-ayurvedic test conducted by the State of Rajasthan <lb/>for such purpose. He appeared in the examinations of first and <lb/></body>

			<page>(17 of 24) <lb/>[CW-2800/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>second professionals i.e. Academic Year 2017. He could not clear <lb/>the said examinations in four chances. <lb/>Based on Regulation <lb/>No.6(4)(d) of the said Regulations, he was debarred from <lb/>appearing in further examinations, upon which he filed this <lb/>petition in which, as noted, he has challenged the vires of <lb/>regulations concerned. <lb/>Learned counsel for the petitioners have vehemently argued <lb/>before us that these regulations are unreasonable and arbitrary <lb/>and are reconcilable with the provisions contained in the <lb/>regulations itself permitting total nine years duration for <lb/>completing the entire course. They have argued that earlier there <lb/>was no such bifurcation in the regulations requiring the students <lb/>to clear papers of each year within maximum number of years. <lb/>They have therefore submitted that the regulations are <lb/>unreasonable, arbitrary and thus violate Article 14 of the <lb/>Constitution and need to be struck down. <lb/>The learned advocates also contended that the Ministry of <lb/>Ayush, which is also an apex body governing the standards of <lb/>homeopathy medicines, has not framed any such regulations for <lb/>the said course. <lb/>Our attention was also drawn to the regulations <lb/>framed by the Medical Council of India for the purpose of medical <lb/>education in which barring the first year examination no ceiling of <lb/>number of attempts permissible to a student has been laid down. <lb/>Reliance was placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in case <lb/>of Kuldeep Singh and Others Vs. Unni &amp; Another [2007 (2) <lb/>SCC 365] to contend that a regulation, which is unreasonable or <lb/>arbitrary, should be set aside. <lb/>The Central Council of Indian Medicine respondent No.2 has <lb/>filed a reply in which it is contended that the regulations were <lb/></body>

			<page>(18 of 24) <lb/>[CW-2800/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>framed prescribing the minimum standards of education with the <lb/>aim of producing graduates having profound knowledge of <lb/>Ayurveda as well as knowledge of scientific advances in modern <lb/>medicines. It is pointed out that Bombay High Court in a Writ <lb/>Petition No.4720/2012 (Pawar Nitin Madhukar Vs. <lb/>Dadasaheb Swaroop Sinh Naik and Others -decided on <lb/>03.12.2013) had asked the council to file an affidavit as to how a <lb/>student despite failing in the first attempt endlessly goes on <lb/>appearing in the subsequent examinations without any limit of <lb/>chances. It was pursuant to this order passed by the Bombay <lb/>High Court, the counsel took a decision to further amend the <lb/>regulations providing limit of attempts to qualify in each <lb/>examination. The decision was taken by the Executive Council. In <lb/>short, the regulations of 2016 are valid. <lb/>Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having <lb/>perused the documents on record, we find that the Indian <lb/>Medicine Central Council Act, 1970 (&apos;the Act&apos; in short) was framed <lb/>to provide for constitution of Central Council of Indian Medical and <lb/>Maintenance of Central Register of Indian Medicine and matters <lb/>connected therewith. The statement of objects and reasons for <lb/>framing the said law provides that the question of establishing the <lb/>statutory composite Central Council for Indian systems of <lb/>medicine (Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani) and Homeopathic system <lb/>of medicine, on the analogy of Medical Council of India was under <lb/>consideration of the Government of India for sometime. <lb/>It was <lb/>found desirable to lay down minimum standards for admission, <lb/>duration of courses of training, details of curricula and syllabi of <lb/>studies and the title of degree or diploma that may be awarded. <lb/>The main functions of the Council would be to evolve uniform <lb/></body>

			<page>(19 of 24) <lb/>[CW-2800/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>standards of education in these systems. For such purpose, the <lb/>Council would constitute separate committees for Ayurveda, <lb/>Siddha, Unani and Homeopathy consisting of members of the <lb/>respective systems of medicine to deal with the matters pertaining <lb/>of those systems. <lb/>Section 3 of the Act envisages constitution of Central <lb/>Council. <lb/>Section 36 of the Act pertains to power to make <lb/>regulations. <lb/>Under sub-section 1 of section 36, the Central <lb/>Council may with the <lb/>previous sanction of the Central <lb/>Government make regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act <lb/>by issuing a notification and in particular with respect to several <lb/>matters referred to in clause (a) to (p) contained therein. Clause <lb/>(i) of sub-section of section 36 pertains to the courses and period <lb/>of study and of practical training to be undertaken, the subjects of <lb/>examination and the standards of proficiency therein to be <lb/>obtained, in any university, board or medical institutions for grant <lb/>of recognized medical qualifications. <lb/>Clause (k) pertains to <lb/>conduct of professional examinations, qualifications of examiners <lb/>and the conditions of admissions to such examinations. <lb/>In exercise of such powers, the Council had framed the <lb/>regulations which came to be amended by the impugned <lb/>regulations of 2016. The relevant portion of these regulations <lb/>reads as under: <lb/>&quot;6. Scheme of examination.-(1) (a) The first <lb/>professional session shall ordinarily start in July and the <lb/>first professional examination shall be at the end of one <lb/>academic year of first professional session; <lb/>(b) The first professional examination shall be held in <lb/>the following subjects, namely:-<lb/>(i) Padarth Vigyan evam Ayurved Itihas; <lb/>(ii) Sanskrit; <lb/>(iii) Kriya Sharir (Physiology); <lb/>(iv) Rachana Sharir (Anatomy); and <lb/></body>

			<body>(c) The failed student of third professional who have <lb/>passed all the subjects of first and second professional <lb/>examinations shall be allowed to appear in final <lb/>professional examination and maximum four chances <lb/>shall be given to pass third professional examination <lb/>within a period of maximum three years. <lb/>(4) (a) The final professional session shall be of one <lb/>year and six months duration and shall start every year <lb/>in the month of July following completion of third <lb/>professional examination and the final professional <lb/>examination shall be ordinarily held and completed by <lb/>the end of month of October or November every year <lb/>after completion of one year and six months of final <lb/>professional session; <lb/>(b) The final professional examination shall comprise of <lb/>the following subjects, namely:-<lb/>(i) Shalya Tantra (General Surgery); <lb/>(ii) Shalakya Tantra (Diseases of Head and Neck <lb/>including Ophthalmology, Ear, Nose, Throat and <lb/>Dentistry); <lb/>(iii) Kayachikitsa (Internal Medicine-including Manas <lb/>Roga, Rasayan and Vajikarana); <lb/>(iv) Panchakarma; and <lb/>(vi) Research Methodology and Medical-statistics; <lb/>(c) Research Methodology shall remain in the <lb/>department of Samhita Siddhant but for the purpose of <lb/>teaching, Bio-statistician shall be required as part time <lb/>to teach Research Methodology; <lb/>(d) The student failed in any of the four <lb/>professional examinations in four chances shall <lb/>not be allowed to continue his or her studies: <lb/>Provided that, in case of serious personal illness <lb/>of <lb/>a <lb/>student <lb/>and <lb/>in <lb/>any <lb/>unavoidable <lb/>circumstances, <lb/>the <lb/>Vice-Chancellor <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>concerned University may provide one more <lb/>chance <lb/>in <lb/>any <lb/>one <lb/>of <lb/>four <lb/>professional <lb/>examinations; <lb/>(e) To become eligible for joining the compulsory <lb/>internship programme, all four professional <lb/>examinations shall be passed within a period of <lb/>maximum nine years including all chances as <lb/>mentioned above.&quot; <lb/>As per these regulations thus in terms of clause 1(c) the <lb/>failed student of first professional examination can be allowed to <lb/>appear in second professional examination, but may not be <lb/>allowed to appear in third professional examination unless he or <lb/>she passes all subjects of first professional examination for which <lb/></body>

			<page>(22 of 24) <lb/>[CW-2800/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>purpose maximum four chances will be given within a maximum <lb/>period of three years. Likewise, as per clause 2(c), the student <lb/>who has failed in second professional examination would have a <lb/>maximum of four chances in three years to clear the same. As <lb/>per clause 4(d), a student who has failed in any of the four <lb/>professional examinations in the four chances shall not be allowed <lb/>to continue the studies. Proviso below clause (d) provides that in <lb/>case of serious personal illness of a student or in any unavoidable <lb/>circumstances, the Vice Chancellor of the concerned University <lb/>may provide one more chance in any of the four professional <lb/>examinations. <lb/>The combined effect of these Regulations is that at every <lb/>stage the regulation framing authority has put a ceiling of number <lb/>of chances and time duration for clearing a particular level. While <lb/>doing so, the proviso has given power to the Vice Chancellor to <lb/>grant limited relaxation under certain circumstances. Per se, the <lb/>said regulations cannot be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable. <lb/>To begin with, the Regulations are framed by the Medical Council <lb/>in exercise of statutory powers under Section 36 of the Act. <lb/>When an expert body specifically constituted for such purpose has <lb/>formed a matured opinion as to the number of maximum chances <lb/>and the maximum period that may be allowed to a student to <lb/>clear certain examinations, this Court would not substitute its own <lb/>wisdom and call in question the wisdom of the rule making <lb/>authority particularly in technical fields duly aided by the experts <lb/>of the field. <lb/>What should be the duration of the course, what <lb/>should be the number of chances that may be allowed to the <lb/>students for clearing a certain level of examination and such <lb/>similar issues are in the realm of the policy which the statutory <lb/></body>

			<page>(23 of 24) <lb/>[CW-2800/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>council is entrusted to decide. <lb/>Merely because clause (e) of <lb/>Regulation 6(4) envisages a maximum duration of nine years for <lb/>completing the entire course, would neither run counter to the <lb/>impugned regulations, nor would in any manner be contrary to the <lb/>scheme of Regulation 6. <lb/>The scheme that is discernible upon <lb/>reading of Regulation 6 as a whole is, that the Medical Council <lb/>while providing an upper limit of maximum nine years to complete <lb/>the entire course, has further sub-divided such time for the <lb/>students at each stage of such course. The argument of the <lb/>learned counsel for the petitioners that such further sub-division <lb/>was not permissible or was contrary to clause (e) of Regulation <lb/>6(4) is not correct. <lb/>Both these provisions namely the overall <lb/>ceiling of total duration for completing the course and further sub-<lb/>divisions within each stage of the course can co-exist and operate <lb/>simultaneously. <lb/>The individual provisions ensure maximum <lb/>chances and duration for clearing a stage of the course, whereas <lb/>clause 6(4)(e) envisages <lb/>completion of the entire course in <lb/>maximum nine years duration. <lb/>Merely because in the unamended Regulations there was no <lb/>such sub-division of total nine years of period granted to the <lb/>students for clearing the entire course would not mean that the <lb/>amendments are bad in law. Further, these Regulations cannot <lb/>be compared with other courses for deciding their validity. Each <lb/>stream of study particularly in the field of medicine has to be <lb/>treated and reckoned separately. It is the task of expert body such <lb/>as the Council created under the Act to prescribe necessary <lb/>requirements for conducting a course. <lb/></body>
