Joshi for Mr. Sunil Joshi,<lb/> Mr. Mukesh Rajpurohit, ASG with Mr.<lb/> Navneet Singh.<lb/> Mr. Suniel Purhoit.<lb/> HON&apos;BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AKIL KURESHI<lb/> HON&apos;BLE MR. JUSTICE SUDESH BANSAL<lb/> Order<lb/> 29/11/2021<lb/> In this group of petitions, the petitioners have challenged the<lb/> vires of Regulations 6(1)(c), 6(2)(c) and 6(4)(d) of the Indian<lb/> Medicine Central Council (Minimum Standards of Education in<lb/> Indian Medicine) Amendment Regulations, 2016 (hereinafter to be<lb/> referred to as the said Regulations). The petitioners have also<lb/> prayed for consequential directions for allowing them to appear in<lb/> the examination which was to be held shortly after the petitions<lb/> were filed.<lb/> The facts may be noted from Writ Petition No.2638/2021 in<lb/> the case of Rajesh Choudahry. The petitioner was admitted in<lb/> Mahatama Jyotiba Fule Ayurved Maha Vidhyalaya, Chomu, District<lb/> Jaipur in the academic year 2017 in the Aurved Medicine course<lb/> after passing his senior higher secondary Examination and on the<lb/> basis of pre-ayurvedic test conducted by the State of Rajasthan<lb/> for such purpose. He appeared in the examinations of first and<lb/> second professionals i.e. Academic Year 2017. He could not clear<lb/> the said examinations in four chances.<lb/> Based on Regulation<lb/> No.6(4)(d) of the said Regulations, he was debarred from<lb/> appearing in further examinations, upon which he filed this<lb/> petition in which, as noted, he has challenged the vires of<lb/> regulations concerned.<lb/> Learned counsel for the petitioners have vehemently argued<lb/> before us that these regulations are unreasonable and arbitrary<lb/> and are reconcilable with the provisions contained in the<lb/> regulations itself permitting total nine years duration for<lb/> completing the entire course. They have argued that earlier there<lb/> was no such bifurcation in the regulations requiring the students<lb/> to clear papers of each year within maximum number of years.<lb/> They have therefore submitted that the regulations are<lb/> unreasonable, arbitrary and thus violate Article 14 of the<lb/> Constitution and need to be struck down.<lb/> The learned advocates also contended that the Ministry of<lb/> Ayush, which is also an apex body governing the standards of<lb/> homeopathy medicines, has not framed any such regulations for<lb/> the said course.<lb/> Our attention was also drawn to the regulations<lb/> framed by the Medical Council of India for the purpose of medical<lb/> education in which barring the first year examination no ceiling of<lb/> number of attempts permissible to a student has been laid down.<lb/> Reliance was placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in case<lb/> of Kuldeep Singh and Others Vs. Unni &amp; Another [2007 (2)<lb/> SCC 365] to contend that a regulation, which is unreasonable or<lb/> arbitrary, should be set aside.<lb/> The Central Council of Indian Medicine respondent No.2 has<lb/> filed a reply in which it is contended that the regulations were<lb/> framed prescribing the minimum standards of education with the<lb/> aim of producing graduates having profound knowledge of<lb/> Ayurveda as well as knowledge of scientific advances in modern<lb/> medicines. It is pointed out that Bombay High Court in a Writ<lb/> Petition No.4720/2012 (Pawar Nitin Madhukar Vs.<lb/> Dadasaheb Swaroop Sinh Naik and Others -decided on<lb/> 03.12.2013) had asked the council to file an affidavit as to how a<lb/> student despite failing in the first attempt endlessly goes on<lb/> appearing in the subsequent examinations without any limit of<lb/> chances. It was pursuant to this order passed by the Bombay<lb/> High Court, the counsel took a decision to further amend the<lb/> regulations providing limit of attempts to qualify in each<lb/> examination. The decision was taken by the Executive Council. In<lb/> short, the regulations of 2016 are valid.<lb/> Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having<lb/> perused the documents on record, we find that the Indian<lb/> Medicine Central Council Act, 1970 (&apos;the Act&apos; in short) was framed<lb/> to provide for constitution of Central Council of Indian Medical and<lb/> Maintenance of Central Register of Indian Medicine and matters<lb/> connected therewith. The statement of objects and reasons for<lb/> framing the said law provides that the question of establishing the<lb/> statutory composite Central Council for Indian systems of<lb/> medicine (Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani) and Homeopathic system<lb/> of medicine, on the analogy of Medical Council of India was under<lb/> consideration of the Government of India for sometime.<lb/> It was<lb/> found desirable to lay down minimum standards for admission,<lb/> duration of courses of training, details of curricula and syllabi of<lb/> studies and the title of degree or diploma that may be awarded.<lb/> The main functions of the Council would be to evolve uniform<lb/> standards of education in these systems. For such purpose, the<lb/> Council would constitute separate committees for Ayurveda,<lb/> Siddha, Unani and Homeopathy consisting of members of the<lb/> respective systems of medicine to deal with the matters pertaining<lb/> of those systems.<lb/> Section 3 of the Act envisages constitution of Central<lb/> Council.<lb/> Section 36 of the Act pertains to power to make<lb/> regulations.<lb/> Under sub-section 1 of section 36, the Central<lb/> Council may with the<lb/> previous sanction of the Central<lb/> Government make regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act<lb/> by issuing a notification and in particular with respect to several<lb/> matters referred to in clause (a) to (p) contained therein. Clause<lb/> (i) of sub-section of section 36 pertains to the courses and period<lb/> of study and of practical training to be undertaken, the subjects of<lb/> examination and the standards of proficiency therein to be<lb/> obtained, in any university, board or medical institutions for grant<lb/> of recognized medical qualifications.<lb/> Clause (k) pertains to<lb/> conduct of professional examinations, qualifications of examiners<lb/> and the conditions of admissions to such examinations.<lb/> In exercise of such powers, the Council had framed the<lb/> regulations which came to be amended by the impugned<lb/> regulations of 2016. The relevant portion of these regulations<lb/> reads as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>(ii) Shalakya Tantra (Diseases of Head and Neck<lb/> including Ophthalmology, Ear, Nose, Throat and<lb/> Dentistry);<lb/></item>

			<item>Provided that, in case of serious personal illness<lb/> of<lb/> a<lb/> student<lb/> and<lb/> in<lb/> any<lb/> unavoidable<lb/> circumstances,<lb/> the<lb/> Vice-Chancellor<lb/> of<lb/> the<lb/> concerned University may provide one more<lb/> chance<lb/> in<lb/> any<lb/> one<lb/> of<lb/> four<lb/> professional<lb/> examinations;<lb/></item>

			<item>(e) To become eligible for joining the compulsory<lb/> internship programme, all four professional<lb/> examinations shall be passed within a period of<lb/> maximum nine years including all chances as<lb/> mentioned above.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>As per these regulations thus in terms of clause 1(c) the<lb/> failed student of first professional examination can be allowed to<lb/> appear in second professional examination, but may not be<lb/> allowed to appear in third professional examination unless he or<lb/> she passes all subjects of first professional examination for which<lb/> purpose maximum four chances will be given within a maximum<lb/> period of three years. Likewise, as per clause 2(c), the student<lb/> who has failed in second professional examination would have a<lb/> maximum of four chances in three years to clear the same. As<lb/> per clause 4(d), a student who has failed in any of the four<lb/> professional examinations in the four chances shall not be allowed<lb/> to continue the studies. Proviso below clause (d) provides that in<lb/> case of serious personal illness of a student or in any unavoidable<lb/> circumstances, the Vice Chancellor of the concerned University<lb/> may provide one more chance in any of the four professional<lb/> examinations.<lb/> The combined effect of these Regulations is that at every<lb/> stage the regulation framing authority has put a ceiling of number<lb/> of chances and time duration for clearing a particular level. While<lb/> doing so, the proviso has given power to the Vice Chancellor to<lb/> grant limited relaxation under certain circumstances. Per se, the<lb/> said regulations cannot be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable.<lb/> To begin with, the Regulations are framed by the Medical Council<lb/> in exercise of statutory powers under Section 36 of the Act.<lb/> When an expert body specifically constituted for such purpose has<lb/> formed a matured opinion as to the number of maximum chances<lb/> and the maximum period that may be allowed to a student to<lb/> clear certain examinations, this Court would not substitute its own<lb/> wisdom and call in question the wisdom of the rule making<lb/> authority particularly in technical fields duly aided by the experts<lb/> of the field.<lb/> What should be the duration of the course, what<lb/> should be the number of chances that may be allowed to the<lb/> students for clearing a certain level of examination and such<lb/> similar issues are in the realm of the policy which the statutory<lb/> council is entrusted to decide.<lb/> Merely because clause (e) of<lb/> Regulation 6(4) envisages a maximum duration of nine years for<lb/> completing the entire course, would neither run counter to the<lb/> impugned regulations, nor would in any manner be contrary to the<lb/> scheme of Regulation 6.<lb/> The scheme that is discernible upon<lb/> reading of Regulation 6 as a whole is, that the Medical Council<lb/> while providing an upper limit of maximum nine years to complete<lb/> the entire course, has further sub-divided such time for the<lb/> students at each stage of such course. The argument of the<lb/> learned counsel for the petitioners that such further sub-division<lb/> was not permissible or was contrary to clause (e) of Regulation<lb/> 6(4) is not correct.<lb/> Both these provisions namely the overall<lb/> ceiling of total duration for completing the course and further sub-<lb/>divisions within each stage of the course can co-exist and operate<lb/> simultaneously.<lb/> The individual provisions ensure maximum<lb/> chances and duration for clearing a stage of the course, whereas<lb/> clause 6(4)(e) envisages<lb/> completion of the entire course in<lb/> maximum nine years duration.<lb/> Merely because in the unamended Regulations there was no<lb/> such sub-division of total nine years of period granted to the<lb/> students for clearing the entire course would not mean that the<lb/> amendments are bad in law. Further, these Regulations cannot<lb/> be compared with other courses for deciding their validity. Each<lb/> stream of study particularly in the field of medicine has to be<lb/> treated and reckoned separately. It is the task of expert body such<lb/> as the Council created under the Act to prescribe necessary<lb/> requirements for conducting a course.<lb/> In the result, we find no merit in these petitions and are,<lb/> therefore, dismissed.<lb/></p>
