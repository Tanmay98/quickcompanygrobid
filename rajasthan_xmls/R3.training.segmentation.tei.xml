			<body>Judgment <lb/>Reportable : <lb/>19/03/2020 <lb/>1. The present group of writ petitions involves challenge to the <lb/>result of the written examination conducted by Rajasthan Public <lb/>Service Commission (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the RPSC&quot; or &quot;the <lb/>Commission&quot;) pursuant to the advertisement dated 28.03.2018 <lb/>issued for recruitment of Headmasters in Secondary Education. <lb/>2. The petitioners having failed to secure berth in the select list, <lb/>allege that because of the wrong assessment of the questions and <lb/>answers, they lagged behind. According to them, the answers of <lb/>some of the questions ought to have been, what they claim to be <lb/>correct and some of the questions deserve deletion. Grievance <lb/>has been raised in relation to host of questions -their improper <lb/>framing; difference in Hindi and English version of the questions; <lb/>so also regarding correctness of the answers. <lb/></body>

			<page>(5 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>3. Before embarking upon the journey of adjudicating answers to <lb/>the questions and correctness of the questions themselves, this <lb/>Court deems it appropriate to sail through the judgments, which <lb/>were cited by rival counsel at Bar. <lb/>4. Learned counsel for the petitioners cited judgment dated <lb/>12.03.2019 rendered in the case of Bhundaram Vs. State (D.B. <lb/>Civil Special Appeal No.922/2018); judgment dated <lb/>03.01.2020 rendered in the case of Vinod Kumar Vs. State of <lb/>Rajasthan (S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.12077/2019) and <lb/>judgment dated 16.04.2018 in Rameshwari Kumari Vs. State <lb/>of Rajasthan (S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.3083/2018), in a <lb/>bid to show that this court has been interfering in matters relating <lb/>to challenge to the questions and their respective answers. <lb/>5. As against this, Mr. Tarun Joshi, learned counsel appearing for <lb/>the Commission, informed that upon declaration of the result, <lb/>objections were invited; all the objections were laid before a <lb/>Committee of Experts, constituted by the Commission; and said <lb/>committee after thorough deliberation and consideration of <lb/>relevant material, has given its opinion and the Commission has <lb/>proceeded strictly in accordance with the recommendation of the <lb/>experts. <lb/>6. While informing that the questions under consideration are <lb/>from varied subjects, he opined that the Court should not act as <lb/>an expert and enter and traverse in an unfamiliar terrain. To <lb/>buttress such stand, learned counsel relied upon a rather recent <lb/>decision of Hon&apos;ble the Supreme Court in the case of Uttar <lb/>Pradeh Public Service Commission Vs. Rahul Singh and Anr. <lb/>[(2018) 7 SCC 254]. <lb/></body>

			<page>(6 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>7. So far as the judgments cited by the petitioners are <lb/>concerned, they are indicative of the fact that the Courts have <lb/>been indulgent in such cases; whereas the judgment of Hon&apos;ble <lb/>the Apex Court, which was cited by Mr. Joshi, in the case of Uttar <lb/>Pradesh Public Service Commission Vs. Rahul Singh (supra); lays <lb/>down the parameters within which the Court can interfere. <lb/>8. The relevant extract of the judgment of Hon&apos;ble the Supreme <lb/>Court is being reproduced hereunder:-<lb/>&quot;8. What is the extent and power of the Court <lb/>to interfere in matters of academic nature has <lb/>been the subject matter of a number of cases. <lb/>We shall deal with the two main cases cited <lb/>before us. <lb/>9. In Kanpur University v. Samir Gupta, this <lb/>Court was dealing with a case relating to the <lb/>Combined Pre Medical Test. Admittedly, the <lb/>examination setter himself had provided the <lb/>key answers and there were no committees to <lb/>moderate or verify the correctness of the key <lb/>answers provided by the examiner. This Court <lb/>upheld the view of the Allahabad High Court <lb/>that the students had proved that 3 of the key <lb/>answers were wrong. Following observations <lb/>of the Court are pertinent:-<lb/>16...........We agree that the key <lb/>answer should be assumed to be <lb/>correct unless it is proved to be <lb/>wrong and that it should not be <lb/>held to be wrong by an inferential <lb/>process of reasoning or by a <lb/>process of rationalization. It must <lb/>be clearly demonstrated to be <lb/>wrong, that is to say, it must be <lb/>such as no reasonable body of men <lb/>well-versed in the particular subject <lb/>would regard as correct. The Court <lb/>gave further directions but we are <lb/>concerned mainly with one that the <lb/>State Government should devise a <lb/>system for moderating the key <lb/>answers furnished by the paper <lb/>setters. <lb/></body>

			<page>(7 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>10. In Ran Vijay Singh and Others vs. State <lb/>of Uttar Pradesh and Others, this Court <lb/>after referring to a catena of judicial <lb/>pronouncements summarized the legal <lb/>position in the following terms:-<lb/>30. The law on the subject is <lb/>therefore, quite clear and we only <lb/>propose <lb/>to <lb/>highlight <lb/>a <lb/>few <lb/>significant conclusions. They are: <lb/>30.1. If a statute, Rule or <lb/>Regulation <lb/>governing <lb/>an <lb/>examination <lb/>permits <lb/>the <lb/>re-<lb/>evaluation of an answer sheet or <lb/>scrutiny of an answer sheet as a <lb/>matter of right, then the authority <lb/>conducting the examination may <lb/>permit it; <lb/>30.2. If a statute, Rule or <lb/>Regulation <lb/>governing <lb/>an <lb/>examination does not permit re-<lb/>evaluation or scrutiny of an answer <lb/>sheet (as distinct from prohibiting <lb/>it) then the court may permit re-<lb/>evaluation or scrutiny only if it is <lb/>demonstrated very clearly, without <lb/>any inferential process of reasoning <lb/>or by a process of rationalisation <lb/>and only in rare or exceptional <lb/>cases that a material error has <lb/>been committed; <lb/>30.3. The court should not at all re-<lb/>evaluate or scrutinise the answer <lb/>sheets of a candidate it has no <lb/>expertise in the matter and <lb/>academic matters are best left to <lb/>academics; <lb/>30.4. The court should presume the <lb/>correctness of the key answers and <lb/>proceed on that assumption; and <lb/>30.5. In the event of a doubt, the <lb/>benefit <lb/>should <lb/>go <lb/>to <lb/>the <lb/>examination authority rather than <lb/>to the candidate. <lb/>11. We may also refer to the following <lb/>observations in Paras 31 and 32 which show <lb/>why the Constitutional Courts must exercise <lb/>restraint in such matters: <lb/></body>

			<page>(8 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>31. On our part we may add that <lb/>sympathy or compassion does not <lb/>play any role in the matter of <lb/>directing or not directing re-<lb/>evaluation of an answer sheet. If an <lb/>error <lb/>is <lb/>committed <lb/>by <lb/>the <lb/>examination authority, the complete <lb/>body of candidates suffers. The <lb/>entire examination process does not <lb/>deserve to be derailed only because <lb/>some candidates are disappointed <lb/>or dissatisfied or perceive some <lb/>injustice having been caused to <lb/>them by an erroneous question or <lb/>an erroneous answer. All candidates <lb/>suffer equally, though some might <lb/>suffer more but that cannot be <lb/>helped since mathematical precision <lb/>is not always possible. This Court <lb/>has shown one way out of an <lb/>impasse exclude the suspect or <lb/>offending question. <lb/>32. It is rather unfortunate that <lb/>despite several decisions of this <lb/>Court, some of which have been <lb/>discussed <lb/>above, <lb/>there <lb/>is <lb/>interference by the courts in the <lb/>result of examinations. This places <lb/>the examination authorities in an <lb/>unenviable position where they are <lb/>under <lb/>scrutiny <lb/>and <lb/>not <lb/>the <lb/>candidates. Additionally, a massive <lb/>and <lb/>sometimes <lb/>prolonged <lb/>examination <lb/>exercise <lb/>concludes <lb/>with an air of uncertainty. While <lb/>there is no doubt that candidates <lb/>put in a tremendous effort in <lb/>preparing for an examination, it <lb/>must not be forgotten that even the <lb/>examination authorities put in <lb/>equally great efforts to successfully <lb/>conduct <lb/>an <lb/>examination. <lb/>The <lb/>enormity of the task might reveal <lb/>some lapse at a later stage, but the <lb/>court must consider the internal <lb/>checks and balances put in place by <lb/>the examination authorities before <lb/>interfering with the efforts put in by <lb/>the <lb/>candidates <lb/>who <lb/>have <lb/>successfully participated in the <lb/>examination and the examination <lb/>authorities. The present appeals are <lb/>a <lb/>classic <lb/>example <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>consequence of such interference <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">(9 of 59) <lb/></note>

			<page>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>where there is no finality to the <lb/>result of the examinations even <lb/>after a lapse of eight years. Apart <lb/>from the examination authorities <lb/>even the candidates are left <lb/>wondering about the certainty or <lb/>otherwise of the result of the <lb/>examination whether they have <lb/>passed or not; whether their result <lb/>will be approved or disapproved by <lb/>the court; whether they will get <lb/>admission in a college or university <lb/>or not; and whether they will get <lb/>recruited or not. This unsatisfactory <lb/>situation <lb/>does <lb/>not <lb/>work <lb/>to <lb/>anybody&apos;s advantage and such a <lb/>state of uncertainty results in <lb/>confusion being worse confounded. <lb/>The overall and larger impact of all <lb/>this is that public interest suffers. <lb/>12. The law is well settled that the onus is <lb/>on the candidate to not only demonstrate <lb/>that the key answer is incorrect but also <lb/>that it is a glaring mistake which is totally <lb/>apparent and no inferential process or <lb/>reasoning is required to show that the key <lb/>answer is wrong. The Constitutional Courts <lb/>must exercise great restraint in such <lb/>matters and should be reluctant to entertain <lb/>a plea challenging the correctness of the key <lb/>answers. In Kanpur University case (supra), <lb/>the Court recommended a system of:-(1) <lb/>moderation; (2) avoiding ambiguity in the <lb/>questions; (3) prompt decisions be taken to <lb/>exclude suspected questions and no marks <lb/>be assigned to such questions.&quot; <lb/>9. Having gone through the above judgment and some other <lb/>judgments of the Apex court, this Court is of the opinion that a <lb/>writ Court cannot become a super-expert or Appellate Authority <lb/>over the experts. In exercise of its power of judicial review, a writ <lb/>Court can only examine as to whether the question itself as <lb/>framed was wrongly framed and/or in a given case interfere if the <lb/>answer is so erroneous that no person having acquaintance with <lb/>the subject would endorse it. <lb/></body>

			<page>(10 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>10. During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the RPSC <lb/>placed for perusal of the Court, experts&apos; evaluation of answer key, <lb/>titled as &quot;Expert Validation of Answer Key&quot;. More often than not, <lb/>the Court found that the opinion of the experts justifies the name/ <lb/>nomenclature given to such evaluation -they try to vindicate or <lb/>validate the answer given by the Commission. In the considered <lb/>opinion of this Court, the experts while deciding the objections <lb/>should act dispassionately and independently. They should at <lb/>least give brief reasons for holding a particular view, while taking <lb/>support of relevant material. <lb/>As the ensuing discussion will <lb/>reveal, instead of quoting excerpts or reproducing relevant book/ <lb/>material, the experts have simply enclosed photocopies of the <lb/>book, even when it does not contain a direct answer. <lb/>11. True it is that a candidate cannot use the writ jurisdiction as <lb/>an appeal in disguise over the experts&apos; opinion. But taking cue <lb/>from the established principles of judicial review, this Court feels <lb/>that of late it has become imperative for the Courts to be satisfied <lb/>at least about the decision making process of the experts, if not <lb/>the outcome. The Court may or may not pronounce upon the <lb/>ultimate decision of the experts, but it can certainly examine as to <lb/>whether the experts have relied upon the relevant material or not; <lb/>Court can also see as to whether on the basis of the material so <lb/>relied by the experts, no other view was possible. The Court <lb/>needs to be satisfied that the experts have given brief reasons for <lb/>taking a particular view. In case, the Court finds that the material <lb/>relied and reasoning given by the experts is not acceptable to a <lb/>man of reasonable prudence, it will not keep its hands tied. <lb/></body>

			<page>(11 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>12. For the purpose of enabling the Court to have a proper judicial <lb/>review, it is expected from the expert committee to bear in mind <lb/>the following:-<lb/>(i) In case the answer to a question is direct and is <lb/>not dependent upon reasoning or analysis, the <lb/>experts may avoid giving reasons. In such cases, a <lb/>reference to relevant material is imperative. <lb/>(ii) In case where the answer to a particular <lb/>question is not direct -it is to be deduced or the <lb/>same is subservient to reasoning, the experts <lb/>should give brief reasons for holding such opinion, <lb/>while enclosing the authentic book/relevant <lb/>material, which they have relied upon. <lb/>(iii) The experts are supposed to rely upon <lb/>authentic material and direct evidence so far as <lb/>practicable instead of referring to the text books <lb/>prescribed for the schools/colleges. <lb/>(iv) If a question relates to work/report of some <lb/>Scientist, Economist, survey etc. they should <lb/>invariably refer to the original work, rather than <lb/>referring to the text books or some other author&apos;s <lb/>interpretation or reproduction of such work. <lb/>13. Hence, while abstaining from being an Appellate Authority <lb/>over the experts, this Court proceeds to pronounce upon the <lb/>arguments advanced, being guided by the principles laid down in <lb/>this regard and bearing in mind, what has been deduced in <lb/>preceding paragraphs (10 to 13). The questions are being taken <lb/>one after another:-<lb/>PAPER -I : <lb/>14. Q. 13 -The Royal cavalry of Shivaji was called-<lb/>(1) Bargir <lb/>(2) Risala <lb/></body>

			<body>(3) Siladar <lb/>(4) Dabeer <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (1) Bargir <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (1) Bargir <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted <lb/>15. Learned counsel for the petitioners claims that the correct <lb/>answer is &quot;Paga&quot;, which is not provided in the options. Hence, the <lb/>question is liable to be deleted. <lb/>16. In support of his contention aforesaid, Mr. Vishnoi, learned <lb/>counsel for the petitioner invited Court&apos;s attention towards a book <lb/>-&quot;Hkkjr dk jktuhfrd ,oa lka Ldfrd bfrgkl&quot;, published by Rajasthan Hindu <lb/>Granth Academy and submitted that as per the said book, there <lb/>were 45,000 ikxk (&quot;kkgh ?kq Mlokj). He contended that &quot;kkgh v&quot;o ls uk and <lb/>&quot;kkgh ?kq Mlokj are synonymous and as &quot;ikxk&quot; was not an option given <lb/>in the paper, the question No.13 was required to be deleted, while <lb/>asserting that &quot;Bargir&quot; is not the correct answer. <lb/>17. Mr. Tarun Joshi, per contra, invited Court&apos;s attention towards a <lb/>book known as e/;dkyhu Hkkjr edited by Mr. Harish Chandra and <lb/>submitted that as per the said book &quot;Bargir&quot; is the correct answer, <lb/>as has been given by the Commission. <lb/>18. It will not be out of place to reproduce, what has been relied <lb/>upon by Mr. Joshi, which reads thus:-<lb/>&quot;f&quot;kokth us viuh ,d LFkk;h ls uk cukbZ Fkh vkS j o&apos;kkZ dky <lb/>ds nkS jku ls fudks a dks ogkW a jgus dk LFkku Hkh miyC/k <lb/>djk;k tkrk jgk FkkA f&quot;kokth dh eR;q ds le; mudh <lb/>ls uk es a 30 ls 40 gtkj fu;fer vkS j LFkk;h :i ls <lb/>fu;q Dr ?kq Mlokj] ,d yk[k inkfr vkS j 1260 gkFkh Fks A <lb/>muds rks i[kkus ds la ca /k es a Bhd&amp;Bhd tkudkjh miyC/k <lb/>ugha gS fda rq bruk Kkr gS fd mUgks us lw jr vkS j vU; <lb/>LFkkuks a ij vkdz e.k djrs le; rks i[kkus dk mi;ks x fd;k <lb/>FkkA <lb/></body>

Upon comparison of the material relied upon by rival counsel, <lb/>it emerges that the petitioner has referred to book namely &quot;Hkkjr dk <lb/>jktuhfrd ,oa lka Ldfrd bfrgkl&quot;, published by Rajasthan Hindi Granth <lb/>Academy, which clearly contains a stipulation that there were forty <lb/>five thousand ikxk (&quot;kkgh ?kq Mlokj), as against this a perusal of above <lb/>part of the book relied upon by the Commission is not even <lb/>indicative of the answer to the question set by the examiner. <lb/>20. A reading of the above paragraph from the book, which has <lb/>been heavily relied upon by the Commission, shows that it does <lb/>not bring to fore as to what was the Royal Cavalry or &quot;kkgh ?kq Mlokj <lb/>called. Even going by the above excerpted part, what can be <lb/>inferred is that there were two types of soldiers riding horses : <lb/>(i) Bargirs who were provided horses by the State and (ii) Silhdars <lb/>who were supposed to arrange them at their own. It is not <lb/>suggestive of the name by which Royal Cavalry of Shivaji was <lb/>called. <lb/>21. This Court is not satisfied with the material placed by <lb/>the Commission in support of the stand that the Option (1) <lb/>is the correct answer to question No.13. The answer key <lb/>qua question No.13 is, therefore, set aside; the matter is <lb/>referred back to Expert Committee, to be constituted by the <lb/></body>

			<page>(14 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>Commission, which will go through relevant material, <lb/>including the book relied upon by the rival parties. <lb/>22. Q.22 When did Swami Vivekanand establish Ram Krishna <lb/>Math at Belur-<lb/>(1) 1909 <lb/>(2) 1881 <lb/>(3) 1897 <lb/>(4) 1901 <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (3) 1897 <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: Question was deleted <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (3) 1897 <lb/>23. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the answer <lb/>given by the RPSC in first answer key &quot;Option (3) 1897&quot;, is <lb/>correct, which fact is evident from the History book of Secondary <lb/>Education prescribed for Rajasthan State Open School. However, <lb/>the RPSC deleted the aforesaid question. <lb/>24. As per the expert opinion, none of the options given qua this <lb/>question were correct. Inviting Court&apos;s attention towards the <lb/>expert opinion, it was pointed out that establishment of <lb/>Ramkrishna Math was a continuous process and the same started <lb/>in April 1898, whereas in 1897 Ramkrishna Mission was <lb/>established. <lb/>25. Upon consideration of the material relied upon by the <lb/>petitioner, particularly page No.178 of the paper-book, what <lb/>transpires is that in 1897 Swami Vivekananda established <lb/>Ramkrishna Mission and constructed Belur Math. <lb/>26. The experts have noted that the process establishing &apos;Math&apos; <lb/>began in the year 1898. Though, the experts have made reference <lb/>of Biography of Swami Vivekananda (page No.1041) and <lb/></body>

The experts have also given the <lb/>information available on official website namely belurmath.org. <lb/>27. The decision of the experts, based on the information <lb/>available on official website of &apos;Math&apos; cannot be faulted with. What <lb/>has been relied upon by petitioner relates to Ramkrishna Mission <lb/>and not &apos;Math&apos;. Petitioners have failed to distinguish between <lb/>Ramkrishna Mission and Ramkrishna Math. <lb/>28. As an upshot of above discussion, this Court does not find any <lb/>error in the stand of the Commission. <lb/>29. The challenge to the answer key qua this question fails. <lb/>The Commission&apos;s decision to delete Question No.22 of <lb/>Paper-I is, therefore, affirmed. <lb/>30. Q.37-The moderate leader of the congress who served as a <lb/>member of Indian Public Service Commission during 1912-1915 <lb/>was -<lb/>(1) Gopal Krishna Gokhale <lb/>(2) Dada Bhai Noroji <lb/>(3) Surendra Nath Banerjee <lb/>(4) Firojshah Mehta <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (1) Gopal Krishna Gokhale <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (1) Gopal Krishna Gokhale <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted. <lb/>31. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (1) for the aforesaid question in both the <lb/>answer keys published by it, which is not correct because no <lb/>commission in the name of Indian Public Service Commission ever <lb/>existed more particularly during the aforesaid period. It was <lb/></body>

			<body>asserted that it was &quot;Royal Commission in the Public Services&quot;, <lb/>while relying upon a book of Political Science of Class-XIth. <lb/>Learned counsel contended that the RPSC ought to have deleted <lb/>this question. <lb/>32. Mr. Joshi invited Court&apos;s attention towards the photostat copy <lb/>of a notification dated 30.01.1922 and submitted that Gopal <lb/>Krishna Gokhle was a Member of &quot;Royal Commission on the Public <lb/>Services in India&quot;. <lb/>He invited Court&apos;s attention towards the <lb/>expert&apos;s opinion, who has relied upon a book known as &quot;vk/kq fud <lb/>Hkkjr&quot; written by Yashpal Grover to show that Gopal Krishna Gokhle <lb/>was member of Indian Public Service Commission. A reliance was <lb/>also placed upon Encyclopedia &quot;Britanica&quot;, which contains an <lb/>information about Gopal Krishna Gokhle and that Shri Gokhle was <lb/>Member of India Public Service Commission between 1912-15. <lb/>33. The essence of the question is clear -the paper setter wanted <lb/>to elicit name of moderate Congress Leader, who was a member of <lb/>India Public Service Commission. May be, the Indian Public <lb/>Service Commission had not come into existence during 1912-15 <lb/>and its name was &quot;Royal Commission in the Public Services&quot;, as <lb/>claimed by the petitioners. But then, this question should not <lb/>create confusion in the mind of the candidates, merely because of <lb/>wrong name. <lb/>No other person out of the available options <lb/>remained member of Royal Commission in the Public Services or <lb/>Indian Public Service Commission during the period 1912-15. <lb/>Going by the thrust of the question, this Court is satisfied that the <lb/>petitioners have created an uncalled for confusion about the <lb/>question under the cloak of so called error that too in the name of <lb/></body>

			<body>Public Service Commission, which is inconsequential having regard <lb/>to the tenor of the question. <lb/>34. This Court, hardly finds any substance in the challenge <lb/>to this question. Challenge fails. Option (1) i.e. Gopal <lb/>Krishna Gokhale, declared by the Commission is affirmed. <lb/>35. Q.65-In which of the following women -literacy rate (Census <lb/>2011) is lowest in the country? <lb/>(1) Rajasthan <lb/>(2) Bihar <lb/>(3) Uttar Pradesh <lb/>(4) Nagaland <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (1) Rajasthan <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (2) Bihar <lb/>Claim by the petitioner <lb/>: (1) Rajasthan <lb/>36. An argument was advanced by Mr. Inderjeet Yadav in relation <lb/>to question No.65, which deals with Women Literacy rate (Census <lb/>2011). A perusal of the pleadings of the petitioner shows that it <lb/>has not been pleaded as to how answer given by RPSC qua <lb/>question No.65 is wrong. <lb/>37. It is rather disturbing that it is only in prayer No.(ii) (Writ <lb/>Petition No.17294/2019), the petitioner has made a prayer that <lb/>question No.65 be deleted. The petitioner has placed Annex.23 <lb/>along with the memo of writ petition, but without making any <lb/>reference. Though, during the course of submission, learned <lb/>counsel had invited Court&apos;s attention towards Annex.23, but the <lb/>writ petition is absolutely silent about Annex.23. Not even a <lb/>whisper about Annex.23 is found in the entire memo of writ <lb/>petition, running into 15 pages. <lb/></body>

			<body>38. Be that as it may, relying upon photostat copies of the Text-<lb/>Book of Geography Class-XII, Mr. Yadav contended that correct <lb/>answer is Rajasthan with 52.70%. The experts have relied upon <lb/>census published by Government of India and Data Book. <lb/>39. The Court itself has surfed through the official website i.e. <lb/>census2011.co.in and found that Bihar has lowest Female literacy <lb/>rate (51.50%) and Rajasthan is just ahead with 52.12%, as per <lb/>the Census of 2011. <lb/>40. Petitioners&apos; challenge is based upon a book, which <lb/>cannot be given more weightage than the figures of census <lb/>itself. Challenge fails. Option (2) i.e. Bihar given by the <lb/>Commission, which is based upon the official website of <lb/>Census -2011 is affirmed. <lb/>41. Q.69-According to Tendulkar&apos;s Estimates (2009) what <lb/>percentage of Indian population is living below poverty line? <lb/>(1) 20.18% <lb/>(2) 25.20% <lb/>(3) 30.1% <lb/>(4) 37.2% <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (4) 37.2% <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (4) 37.2% <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted <lb/>42. Mr. Mahaveer Bishnoi, learned counsel for the petitioners <lb/>submitted that the RPSC has given option No. (4) for the aforesaid <lb/>question in both the answer keys published by it. According to the <lb/>petitioners, as per Tendulkar&apos;s Estimates (2009), total 29.8% of <lb/>Indian population was living below poverty line, which fact is <lb/>fortified from Economic Book of Class-XI, prescribed by the Board <lb/></body>

			<page>(19 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>of Secondary Education Rajasthan, Ajmer (Annex-18 and 19). <lb/>Since option of 29.8% was not given in the question paper, the <lb/>petitioners urged that this question is required to be deleted. <lb/>43. Mr. Kunal Vishnoi, learned counsel for another petitioner <lb/>invited Court&apos;s attention towards the press release of the <lb/>Government of India and submitted that as per such release, the <lb/>poverty estimates are 29.8%. <lb/>44. Mr. Jangid echoed the same voice while relying upon certain <lb/>books, such as book of economics published by Rajasthan Rajya <lb/>Pathya Pustak Mandal and the book of economics recognized by <lb/>National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). <lb/>45. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the respondent-Commission, on <lb/>the other hand, submitted that the petitioners have not properly <lb/>understood the question. He relied upon the expert&apos;s opinion in <lb/>this regard and submitted that experts have opined the correct <lb/>answer to be Option No.(4), i.e. 37.2%. <lb/>46. He navigated the Court through the material relied upon by <lb/>the experts, particularly poverty estimates 2011-12, published by <lb/>Government of India Planning Commission -2013, and submitted <lb/>that as per the poverty estimates given by the Planning <lb/>Commission, poverty ratio for such period was 37.2%. <lb/>47. Upon perusal of the material placed by the Commission, this <lb/>Court finds that percentage 37.2 has been shown as poverty ratio, <lb/>but that is against year 2004-05. A perusal of the documents <lb/>relied upon by Mr. Tarun Joshi shows that 37.2% has been shown <lb/>to be poverty ratio for year 2004-05. <lb/>48. The Court, not being a subject expert, cannot pronounce upon <lb/>correctness of the answer, yet, on the basis of material placed by <lb/></body>

			<page>(20 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>the Commission vis-à-vis the material placed by the petitioners, <lb/>can well ascertain whose stand is more logical. The Commission <lb/>has not been able to prove by any documentary evidence that as <lb/>per the Tendulkar&apos;s Estimate (2009), what is the percentage of <lb/>indian population, which is living below poverty line, let alone the <lb/>percentage (37.2) claimed by it. The petitioners have been able <lb/>to satisfy that the answer given by the RPSC i.e. 37.2% is not <lb/>beyond the pale of doubt. <lb/>49. During the Course of hearing, copy of the report dated <lb/>27.11.2009, forwarded by Suresh D. Tendulkar has been placed <lb/>for perusal of the Court. According to Annexure.A of the report, <lb/>final poverty lines and poverty head count ratio for 2004-05 of <lb/>India, has been shown to be 37.2%. <lb/>50. The question under consideration does not speak of estimates <lb/>for the year 2009-10, as a matter of fact, it required the <lb/>candidates to answer as to what is the percentage of persons <lb/>below poverty line as per Tendulkar&apos;s Report (2009). <lb/>51. A perusal of the Tendulkar&apos;s Report reveals that it contains <lb/>Annexure.B, which provides &quot;Poverty Estimates and Poverty Lines <lb/>for 1993-94&quot; as against Annexure.A, which contains a heading <lb/>&quot;Final Poverty Lines and Poverty Heading Count Ratio for 2004-<lb/>05&quot;. <lb/>52. This Court is not at all satisfied by the stand taken by the <lb/>Commission based on Annexure-A to the Report, as the same <lb/>gives out final poverty lines and poverty head count ratio for <lb/>2004-05; whereas the question was in relation to percentage of <lb/>Indian population living below poverty line as per Tendulkar&apos;s <lb/>Estimates (2009). <lb/></body>

			<page>(21 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>53. The question was very specific and the experts were required <lb/>to directly refer to the report of Tendulkar. It is a matter of <lb/>concern that the experts have not even referred to Tendulkar&apos;s <lb/>Report, which is evident from a look at the copy of the expert <lb/>validation of answer key, provided by the Commission for perusal <lb/>of the Court. It will be apt to reproduce what has been noted by <lb/>the Expert Committee while validating (literally) question No.69: <lb/>&quot;Question No.69 -(4) <lb/>Source -Press note of Poverty <lb/>Estimate 2011-12, Government of <lb/>India, Planning Commission 2013 <lb/>(copy attached). It is within syllabus <lb/>(proof attached).&quot; <lb/>54. Even going by the press note on poverty estimates relied <lb/>upon by the experts and placed for perusal of the Court, this court <lb/>finds that para No.9 shows otherwise. Relevant parts of para No.9 <lb/>is reproduced hereunder:-<lb/>9. xxx xxx xxx. It was 50.1% in rural <lb/>areas, 31.8% in urban areas and <lb/>45.3% for the country as a whole in <lb/>1993-94. In 2011-12, India had 270 <lb/>million persons below the Tendulkar <lb/>Poverty Line as compared to 407 <lb/>million in 2004-05, that is reduction of <lb/>137 million persons over the seven year <lb/>period. <lb/>55. In considered opinion of this Court, the experts were required <lb/>to look into Tendulkar&apos;s Report, which has been placed for perusal <lb/>by learned counsel Mr. Joshi. <lb/>56. That apart, the Court fails to comprehend as to why the <lb/>experts have picked up figure &apos;37.2&apos; given against 2004-05 in <lb/>Column No.3 Row No.2 of the Table and not &apos;21.9&apos; given in Column <lb/>No.3 Row No.3, against year 2011-12. Generally speaking, in the <lb/></body>

			<page>(22 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>year 2009, figures of 2004-05 cannot be said to be estimates, but <lb/>figures of 2011-12 can be estimates. <lb/>57. Be that as it may, having regard to the discrepancy <lb/>noticed, the question is referred to the Expert Committee to <lb/>be constituted by the Commission, which will give its <lb/>opinion making specific reference to Tendulkar&apos;s Report. <lb/>58. Q.80-When Rajasthan Govt. approved first forest policy? <lb/>(1) September 2011 <lb/>(2) August 2010 <lb/>(3) March 2011 <lb/>(4) February 2010 <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (4) February 2010 <lb/>Revised result <lb/>: (4) February 2010 <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted. <lb/>59. Learned counsel argued that topic of Forest and other related <lb/>topics are not provided in the syllabus of the examination. <lb/>60. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the respondent Commission <lb/>submitted that the topic is duly covered in the syllabus under the <lb/>subject &quot;Land Use&quot;. <lb/>61. This Court is satisfied with the stand of the Commission <lb/>that forest policy is a part of land use; the question is not <lb/>out of course. No interference is, thus, called for. <lb/>62. Q.96-Which one of the following statements about Rajasthan <lb/>is not correct? <lb/>(1) Its East-West extent is more than North-South extent. <lb/>(2) Its East-West extent is less than North -South extent. <lb/>(3) Its total land boundary is less 6000 km. <lb/>(4) Its latitudinal extent is more than 7 o latitudes. <lb/></body>

			<page>(23 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>Answer given by the RPSC : (2) Its East -West extent is less than <lb/>North -South extent. <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: Question was deleted <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (2) Its East -West extent is less than <lb/>North -South extent. <lb/>63. Learned counsel for the petitioners pointed out that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (2) for the aforesaid question at the first <lb/>instance, whereafter this question was deleted. Petitioners <lb/>contention has been that the correct answer is &quot;option No. (2)&quot; <lb/>and there was no reason to delete the question. In support of his <lb/>argument that correct answer is (2), he relied upon the book of <lb/>Geography of Rajasthan published by the Rajasthan Hindi Granth <lb/>Academy (Annex.20). <lb/>64. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent <lb/>Commission submitted that the experts have directed to delete <lb/>the question, as the word &quot;than&quot; is missing in English version. <lb/>65. Justifying the stand of the RPSC/experts, learned counsel <lb/>submitted that omission of expression &quot;than&quot; in option (3) has <lb/>resulted in vagueness in its meaning and thus, the question was <lb/>rightly deleted. <lb/>66. This Court is of the opinion that an option has to be <lb/>contextually understood in the backdrop of the corresponding <lb/>question. The question No.96 specifically asked that which of the <lb/>given options was not correct. Option (3) even without the use of <lb/>expression &quot;than&quot; was able to convey the meaning reasonably. <lb/>True it is, that a typographical error has crept in, but such <lb/>innocuous error did not warrant the question to be deleted. <lb/></body>

			<page>(24 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>67. Given the fact that Rajasthan&apos;s total perimeter or land <lb/>boundary is 5920 kms., a candidate appearing in the examination <lb/>(even without use of word &apos;than&apos;) would find that the statement <lb/>given in option No.3 was correct. If all the four options are <lb/>compared, one would easily discern that option (2) i.e. &apos;east-west <lb/>extent is less than north south extent&apos; was the only incorrect <lb/>statement and thus option No.2 was the correct answer. <lb/>68. In considered opinion of this Court, the RPSC has committed <lb/>error in deleting the question, merely because of omission of the <lb/>word &quot;than&quot; in option (3). Even if one does not look at the Hindi <lb/>version of the question, the import of the option can well be <lb/>gathered. <lb/>The omission at least does not alter the soul or <lb/>substance of the question. <lb/>69. As per this Court, inadvertent slips or typographical error, <lb/>which do not change the character or substance of the <lb/>question/answer, should not entail deletion of the question, as has <lb/>been done by the Commission in the instant case. <lb/>70. Petitioners&apos; challenge to the revised answer key, <lb/>therefore, succeeds. Deletion of question No.96 is, <lb/>therefore, set aside. <lb/>71. Q.101-The census year with lowest sex-ratio in Rajasthan <lb/>between year 1901 to 2011 is -<lb/>(1) 1901 <lb/>(2) 1921 <lb/>(3) 1991 <lb/>(4) 2011 <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (2) 1921 <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (2) 1921 <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted. <lb/></body>

			<page>(25 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>72. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (2) for the aforesaid question in both the <lb/>answer keys published by it. It is claimed that in Syllabus, only <lb/>Census of 2011 is mentioned, thus question was out of syllabus. It <lb/>was also argued that the question suggests the census year with <lb/>lowest sex ratio in Rajasthan between year 1901 to 2011, but in <lb/>the year 1921, the State of Rajasthan was not even formed, <lb/>hence, the question itself was wrong. Prayer was to delete this <lb/>question, pertaining to a subject, which was not covered by the <lb/>syllabus. <lb/>73. Responding to objection raised by the petitioner that this <lb/>question is out of syllabus as the syllabus only mentions Census-<lb/>2011, Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the respondent-Commission <lb/>submitted that the question No.101 does not relate to census; the <lb/>question is from a chapter relating to demographic characteristics. <lb/>Taking the Court through the syllabus, he submitted that &apos;sex <lb/>ratio&apos; is a part of demographic study. <lb/>74. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and going <lb/>through the syllabus, this Court is of the considered opinion <lb/>that sex ratio is a part of demographic characteristics. It <lb/>cannot be said that the same is out of syllabus. The <lb/>objection fails. Hence, option (2) i.e. 1921 given by the <lb/>Commission is affirmed. <lb/>75. Q.114-In Odisha and Andhra Pradesh shifting agriculture is <lb/>known as -<lb/>(1) Penda <lb/>(2) Podu <lb/></body>

			<page>(26 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>(3) Onam <lb/>(4) Jhoom <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (2) Podu <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (2) Podu <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted <lb/>76. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (2) for the aforesaid question in both the <lb/>answer keys published by it, but as per the authentic books and <lb/>proofs, more than one options are correct, thus, the question was <lb/>required to be deleted by the RPSC. <lb/>(Samkalin Bharat-2, <lb/>Geography Book of Class-X). <lb/>77. A perusal of the expert opinion placed by the Commission <lb/>reveals that objection relating to Question No.114 has been <lb/>rejected by the expert inter alia observing that the question is <lb/>within syllabus. <lb/>78. The objection regarding Question No.114, as raised by the <lb/>petitioners, does not relate to syllabus, but the same assails the <lb/>adjudication by the Commission on its merit, whereas the expert <lb/>committee of Commission seems to have decided the objection <lb/>only on the allegation that the same is out of syllabus. <lb/>79. Though Mr. Joshi tried to satisfy the Court that option No.2 is <lb/>the correct answer, while taking the Court through photo copies of <lb/>various books, however, since the expert committee itself has not <lb/>dealt with the objection in the manner raised by the petitioners, <lb/>this Court leaves it to be determined by the expert, instead of <lb/>deciding the challenge as an expert. <lb/></body>

			<page>(27 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>80. The matter is, therefore, referred to expert committee <lb/>to be constituted by the Commission, which will give the <lb/>correct answer to this question. <lb/>81. Q.115-Which one of the following crops in India is estimated <lb/>to have decreased production during 2017-18 over the year 2016-<lb/>17? <lb/>(1) Rice <lb/>(2) Cotton <lb/>(3) Wheat <lb/>(4) Sugarcane <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (3) Wheat <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (3) Wheat <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted <lb/>82. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (3) for the aforesaid question in both the <lb/>answer keys published by it. It was asserted that production of <lb/>none of the crops witnessed decrease in the relevant year as per <lb/>the estimates given by Agriculture, Cooperative and Farmer <lb/>Welfare Department, Government of India. <lb/>According to the <lb/>petitioners the options were wrong (source -report of year 2018-<lb/>19 issued by the Agriculture Department, Government of India, <lb/>Annex.22) hence, the question was to be deleted by the RPSC. <lb/>83. Joining the issue on this question, Mr. Joshi, while reading <lb/>question, pointed out that the question was about estimate and <lb/>not advanced estimates. He invited Court&apos;s attention towards <lb/>proof relied upon by the experts (as on 28.08.2018), more <lb/>particularly towards the last four columns (2016-17 &amp; 2017-18) <lb/>and submitted that the production of wheat, which was 98.51 <lb/></body>

			<page>(28 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>million tons as per final estimates of 2016-17, has decreased to <lb/>97.50 as per the estimates of 2017-18. <lb/>84. Mr. Joshi further relied upon a print-out/photostat copy of <lb/>some document (source whereof has not been given) and pointed <lb/>out that there was a reduction of production of wheat. It will not <lb/>be out of place to reproduce the part, which was relied upon by <lb/>Mr. Joshi. <lb/>&quot;5.-Production of wheat estimated at <lb/>97.11 million of tons is lower by 1.40 <lb/>million tons&quot; <lb/>85. Petitioners have placed on record annual report for year 2018-<lb/>19, published by Agricultural Cooperative and Farmers&apos; Welfare <lb/>Department, which shows that production of none of the crops has <lb/>decreased in the year 2017-18. As against this, the Commission <lb/>has placed on record figures of agricultural statistics published by <lb/>Directorate of Economics and Statistics Department of Agriculture. <lb/>86. A careful reading of the documents produced by the <lb/>Commission shows that the table provides fourth advanced <lb/>estimates of production of food-grains for 2017-18. <lb/>87. It will not be out of place to reproduce relevant part of the <lb/>document placed by the Commission, which reads thus:-<lb/>Crop <lb/>2016-17 <lb/>2017-18 <lb/>Wheat 4 th <lb/>Advanced <lb/>Estimates <lb/>Final <lb/>Estimates <lb/>Targets <lb/>4 th <lb/>Advanced <lb/>Estimates <lb/>98.38 <lb/>98.51 <lb/>97.50 <lb/>99.70 <lb/>88. Upon comparing the above figures, this Court is not in a <lb/>position to discern as to how the Commission claims that <lb/>production of wheat estimated to have decreased during 2017-18 <lb/>over the year 2016-17. <lb/></body>

			<page>(29 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>89. Faced with such situation, the Court tried to find answer in the <lb/>experts&apos; opinion for this question, but is surprised, if not shocked <lb/>to see the adjudication made by the experts. It is deemed <lb/>necessary to reproduce, what has been reported by the Experts <lb/>qua question No.115:-<lb/>&quot;115. Answer (3) -objection over-ruled. <lb/>(Proof attached)&quot; <lb/>90. It is to be noted that not only about question No.115, even <lb/>qua questions No.112 &amp; 114, the body of experts have given its <lb/>opinion rather verdict in the same cryptic manner. The experts <lb/>are supposed to give their opinion with reasoning and proofs. The <lb/>experts have decided the objection in less than one line, as if they <lb/>are solving the paper themselves. <lb/>Decision of objection <lb/>presupposes dealing with the objection with reasons. <lb/>91. Mr. Joshi has placed the above referred material given by the <lb/>experts as a proof. The proofs furnished by the Commission do not <lb/>give any direct answer to the question. The Experts were at least <lb/>required to dilate upon as to how option (3) is the correct answer <lb/>to question No.115. <lb/>92. Upon perusal of the proof submitted by the Commission to <lb/>show that the figures have reduced from 98.50% to 97.50%, this <lb/>Court finds that figure 98.51 is given under heading &quot;Final <lb/>Estimates for year 2016-17&quot; whereas 97.50% is given under <lb/>headings &quot;Targets for year 2017-18&quot;. <lb/>93. If that be so and figures mentioned in the Columns 17 and 18 <lb/>of the table are to be compared, this Court finds that even qua <lb/>rice, the figures have reduced from 109.70 to 108.50 and so is the <lb/>position, vis-à-vis sugar-cane, which has reduced from 3060.69 to <lb/></body>

			<page>(30 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>3550, if one compares the figures mentioned in column No.17 and <lb/>18 of the table. <lb/>94. The question is, therefore, referred to expert committee <lb/>to be constituted by the Commission. <lb/>95. Q.125-Which one of the following is not an area of <lb/>Mediterranean type of climate? <lb/>(1) Central California <lb/>(2) Northern New Zealand <lb/>(3) Central Chile <lb/>(4) Southern tip of Africa <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (2) Northern New Zealand <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (2) Northern New Zealand <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted <lb/>96. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (2) for the aforesaid question in both the <lb/>answer keys published by it. It was argued by the petitioners that <lb/>a candidate was required to point out which of the following is not <lb/>an area of Mediterranean type of climate, but all the places given <lb/>in the options witness Mediterranean climate, as is evident from <lb/>book of NCERT for Class-XI and book of Physical Geography <lb/>published by Rajasthan Hindi Granth Academy. According to the <lb/>petitioner, since all the options were correct, the question was <lb/>required to be deleted by the RPSC. <lb/>97. Responding to petitioners&apos; argument, Mr. Joshi relied upon <lb/>photo copy of book (Page No.531 of book), written by Mr. Savindra <lb/>Singh and submitted that Mediterranean regions include California, <lb/>South-Western tip of Africa, South Australia and South-west <lb/>Australia, <lb/>whereas <lb/>New <lb/>Zealand <lb/>does <lb/>not <lb/>experience <lb/>Mediterranean climate. <lb/></body>

			<page>(31 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>98. A perusal of the material placed by the petitioners shows that <lb/>one book, namely, Physical Geography, published by Dr.L.N. <lb/>Upadhyay, shows that south-west part of Australia and Northern <lb/>part of New Zealand experience Mediterranean climate. No other <lb/>book has been placed by the petitioners showing that New <lb/>Zealand experience Mediterranean climate. <lb/>99. In absence of any substantial or relevant material <lb/>evincing the stand of the expert to be erroneous, this Court <lb/>is inclined to go with the view of the experts. <lb/>The <lb/>challenge to question No.125, therefore, fails. Option (2) <lb/>i.e. Northern New Zealand given by the Commission is <lb/>affirmed. <lb/>100. Q.126 -Which vitamin helps in healing of wounds ? <lb/>(1) Vitamin A <lb/>(2) Vitamin B <lb/>(3) Vitamin C <lb/>(4) Vitamin D <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (4) Vitamin D <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (3) Vitamin C <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted <lb/>101. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (4) for the aforesaid question in the first <lb/>answer key, thereafter, changed to option No.(3) in the revised <lb/>answer key published by it. Petitioners claim that as per authentic <lb/>books and proofs, all the options are correct, thus, the question <lb/>deserves to be deleted. <lb/>102. In support of stand aforesaid, Mr. Jangid relied upon text-<lb/>book of Agricultural Science for Class XI, published by Board of <lb/></body>

			<page>(32 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>Secondary Education, Ajmer and submitted that Vitamin-A also <lb/>plays an important role in healing of the wound. <lb/>103. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-<lb/>Commission submitted that the experts have found option (3) -<lb/>Vitamin-C to be the correct option. He emphasised that in a <lb/>multiple-choice question, a candidate is required to give most <lb/>suitable option as the answer. Inviting Court&apos;s attention towards <lb/>various material, he submitted that it is the Vitamin-C, which is <lb/>primarily responsible for healing the wound. <lb/>104. Mr. Jangid has relied upon a book of Agriculture Science, <lb/>which shows relevance of Vitamin &apos;A&apos; in healing of the wound. <lb/>Book written by an author on Agriculture Science cannot be <lb/>treated to be a magnacarta on the use of Vitamins. <lb/>105. On the basis of material placed by the RPSC and based <lb/>on experts&apos; opinion, this Court holds that option (3), i.e. <lb/>Vitamin-C given by the RPSC is the most suitable answer. <lb/>The petitioners&apos; challenge to question No.126, therefore, <lb/>fails. <lb/>106. Q.127-Who invented penicillin? <lb/>(1) Stephenson <lb/>(2) Dunlop <lb/>(3) Kove <lb/>(4) Alexander Fleming <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (4) Alexander Fleming <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: Question was deleted <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (4) Alexander Fleming <lb/>107. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>had given option No. (4) for the aforesaid question in the first <lb/></body>

			<page>(33 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>answer key, but deleted this question in the revised answer key. <lb/>Learned counsel contended that though option No. (4) as given by <lb/>the RPSC in the first answer key was correct, as is evident from <lb/>Science Book of Class-VI, published by Rajasthan Rajya <lb/>Pathyapustak Mandal, Jaipur (Annex.25), yet the RPSC has <lb/>deleted this question for no valid reason. <lb/>108. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-<lb/>Commission submitted that though option (4), namely, Alexander <lb/>Fleming is the correct answer, but the experts have deleted the <lb/>question as it was not covered by syllabus. <lb/>109. Counsel for the petitioners argued that the Commission has <lb/>erred in deleting the question claiming it to be duly covered by <lb/>chapter &quot;Structure and Function of Cell and Biomolecules.&quot; Mr. <lb/>Kunal Vishnoi and Mr. Jangid, learned counsel appearing for <lb/>different petitioners, invited Court&apos;s attention towards the syllabus <lb/>and expanse of the subjects Structure and Functions of Cell and <lb/>Biomolecules to convince the Court that it is covered in the <lb/>syllabus. <lb/>110. In the considered opinion of this Court, if the examining body <lb/>itself finds that a particular question is out of syllabus, the <lb/>interference of the Court has to be minimum. <lb/>111. This Court is of the opinion that since the <lb/>RPSC/experts have found the question to be out of <lb/>syllabus, no interference is warranted. <lb/>Deletion of <lb/>Question No.127 by the Commission is, therefore, upheld. <lb/>112. Q.131 -Mirage is an example of -<lb/>(1) Refraction <lb/>(2) Total internal reflection <lb/>(3) Deflection <lb/></body>

			<page>(34 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>(4) Diffraction <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (2) Total internal reflection <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: Question was deleted <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (2) Total internal reflection <lb/>113. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (2) for the aforesaid question in the first <lb/>answer key but later deleted this question in revised answer key. <lb/>Petitioners&apos; stand is that the correct option is (2) &quot;Total internal <lb/>reflection&quot;, which is fortified from perusal of Physics Text book of <lb/>Class-XII (Annex.26). The question was wrongly deleted, was the <lb/>petitioners&apos; contention. <lb/>114. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel appearing for the Commission <lb/>submitted that the Commission has decided to delete the question <lb/>as two options, (1) and (2) are correct. <lb/>115. Inviting Court&apos;s attention towards the experts&apos; opinion, he <lb/>submitted that the experts have referred to material, which evince <lb/>that Mirage is an example of refraction so also total internal <lb/>reflection. <lb/>116. Mr. Jangid learned counsel for the petitioners, made an <lb/>ardent effort to satisfy the Court that if a student of Physics is <lb/>asked this question, he would definitely select option (2), i.e. total <lb/>internal reflection. He added that the experts are wrong in stating <lb/>that refraction is also a correct answer. According to Mr. Jangid, <lb/>Refraction is a phenomenon, which explains deviation of a ray, <lb/>whereas total internal reflection is the cause of illusion known as <lb/>mirage and option (2) is the only correct answer. <lb/>117. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after <lb/>carefully considering the question (Mirage is an example of), this <lb/>Court is of the opinion that total internal reflection is the more <lb/></body>

			<page>(35 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>correct answer. Had the question been Mirage is a result of, <lb/>perhaps option (1) &apos;refraction&apos; and (2) &apos;total internal reflection&apos;, <lb/>both would have been treated to be correct options, but when the <lb/>question is so specific, then a student is supposed to give the <lb/>most suitable answer, which in the present case is, total internal <lb/>reflection. <lb/>118. It will not be out of place to reproduce the opinion of the <lb/>experts, which reads thus:-<lb/>&quot;Options (1) and (2) are correct. Total internal <lb/>reflection is a special case of refraction. Aso <lb/>deflection is also involved in almost all <lb/>geometric phenomenon. Multiple options are <lb/>correct. Question No.141 may be deleted. <lb/>Reference: (1) Halliday Resnick Walker <lb/>Fundamentals of Physics (VI Edition, page <lb/>No.823) <lb/>(2) Class XII Fundamental Physics by Dr. K.L. <lb/>Goswami.&quot; <lb/>119. Neither the material referred by the experts nor does <lb/>the opinion of the experts show that which option is the <lb/>precise or more correct answer. The question is, thus, <lb/>referred to the expert committee to be constituted by the <lb/>RPSC. <lb/>120. Q.137-Ohm&apos;s law is not applicable on which of the following? <lb/>(1) AC circuit <lb/>(2) Conductor <lb/>(3) Semi conductor <lb/>(4) On conductors when there is change in temperature <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (3) Semi conductor <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: Question was deleted <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (3) Semi conductor <lb/>121. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (3) for the aforesaid question in the first <lb/></body>

			<page>(36 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>answer key but question was deleted in revised answer key <lb/>published by it. The petitioners claimed that Option No. (3) is <lb/>correct option because Ohm&apos;s law is not applicable on semi <lb/>conductor. According to the petitioner, this question was wrongly <lb/>deleted. <lb/>122. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the respondent-Commission <lb/>submitted that as per the experts both the options (3) and (4) <lb/>were correct, for which the experts opined to delete the question. <lb/>123. This Court does not find it to be a case warranting <lb/>interference in the face of the opinion of the experts. The <lb/>petitioner has not been able to show much less satisfy that <lb/>option (3) is the only correct answer. <lb/>Challenge to <lb/>question No.137, therefore, fails. Deletion of this question <lb/>by the Commission is upheld. <lb/>124. Q.139-The ore which is found in abundance in India is-<lb/>(1) Monazite <lb/>(2) Fluospar <lb/>(3) Bauxite <lb/>(4) Magnetite <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (1) Monazite <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: Question was deleted <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (3) Bauxite <lb/>125. It was argued by Mr. Kunal Vishnoi, learned counsel for the <lb/>petitioner that as per the report of Mining Department, issued in <lb/>2017-18, Bauxite is found in abundance and thus, option (3) is the <lb/>correct answer. <lb/>126. As against this, the Commission has found the question to be <lb/>incorrect. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the RPSC submitted that <lb/></body>

			<page>(37 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>expression &quot;abundance&quot; is a relative term and thus no specific <lb/>answer can be given to this question. <lb/>127. This Court approves the stand of the RPSC that the <lb/>question as framed itself was incorrect. Abundance is a <lb/>relative expression. Out of four options, it cannot be said <lb/>that which of these ores is not found in abundance. All the <lb/>ores mentioned in the options are found in large quantity in <lb/>India. No interference is, therefore, called for. Deletion of <lb/>this question by the Commission is affirmed. <lb/>PAPER -II <lb/>128. Q.35 -If x -2 is a factor of X3 + Kx2 -2x -24, then the <lb/>value of k is -<lb/>(1) 6 <lb/>(2) 5 <lb/>(3) 1 <lb/>(4) -2 <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (2) 5 <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: Question was deleted <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (2) 5 <lb/>129. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (2) for the aforesaid question in the first <lb/>answer key but thereafter deleted this question in the revised <lb/>answer key. Petitioners claimed that option No.(2) is the correct <lb/>answer, while solving the question given. Question was wrongly <lb/>deleted by the RPSC, has been the contention of learned counsel <lb/>for the petitioner. <lb/>130. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the respondent-Commission <lb/>submitted that the question was deleted as it was out of syllabus. <lb/>Inviting Court&apos;s attention towards the syllabus, he pointed out that <lb/></body>

			<page>(38 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>only &quot;Pair of linear equations in two variables and quadratic <lb/>equations&quot; were given in the syllabus of Mathematics; whereas <lb/>due to inadvertence, the paper setter has given a question, other <lb/>than the one related to quadratic equations. <lb/>131. As the question under dispute deals with the cubic value or <lb/>relates to X3, it cannot be said that it is a quadratic equation. The <lb/>Commission was right in deleting the question for following <lb/>reason:-<lb/>&quot;Equation is of degree 3 but in syllabus <lb/>only equation with highest degree 2 has <lb/>been provided.&quot; <lb/>132. Challenge to question No.35, therefore, fails. Deletion <lb/>of this question by the Commission is affirmed. <lb/>133. Q.57 -Which of the following audio-visual aid is most <lb/>effective according to the &apos;cone&apos; proposed by Edger Dale? <lb/>(1) Experiment <lb/>(2) Diagram <lb/>(3) Coloured Slide <lb/>(4) Motion picture <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (1) Experiment <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (1) Experiment <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (4) Motion Picture <lb/>134. Mr. Kunal Bishnoi, learned counsel for the petitioner <lb/>submitted that the RPSC has given option No. (1) for the aforesaid <lb/>question in both the answer keys published by it. Petitioner <lb/>claimed that option (4) &quot;Motion Picture&quot; is most effective audio-<lb/>visual aid, as is evident from the book of Education Technique <lb/>edited by S.K. Mangal and Uma Mangal (Annex.28). Option (1) <lb/></body>

			<page>(39 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;Experiment&quot; is not mentioned under Edger Dale&apos;s Cone, as such <lb/>RPSC has given incorrect answer. <lb/>135. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the respondent-Commission <lb/>invited Court&apos;s attention towards the material he has placed in <lb/>support of his stand and submitted that experts have opined thus <lb/>vis-à-vis question No.57:-<lb/>&quot;Question No.57-Answer 1. RPSC&apos;s answer -<lb/>Option (1), proof attached (Annex.6). f&quot;k{kk <lb/>rduhdh] ys [kd S.K. Mangal, pages Nos.38-39&quot; <lb/>136. True it is, that this Court is not expert to adjudicate upon the <lb/>correctness of the question. But, it can very conveniently be <lb/>concluded, as to whether the experts have relied upon correct <lb/>material or not. It can further be examined as to what can be <lb/>deduced from the material placed by the experts. <lb/>137. RPSC has placed a cone diagram, being Edger Dale&apos;s Cone of <lb/>Experience. According to the diagram and the details placed by <lb/>the RPSC itself, it can be deciphered that out of the options given, <lb/>&quot;Motion Picture&quot; is the most effective tool. <lb/>138. It is noteworthy that option (1), which has been held to be <lb/>correct option by the RPSC and experts viz. &quot;Experiment,&quot; is not <lb/>at all given in Edger Dale&apos;s Cone of Experience. Experiment may <lb/>be a form of real direct experience. <lb/>139. Material placed by RPSC, relied upon by the experts, <lb/>including the book of Dr. S.K. Mangal do not clearly show that <lb/>experiment is also a variant of real direct experience. Experts&apos; <lb/>opinion is not supported by reasoning. <lb/>140. The question is, therefore, referred to the Expert <lb/>Committee to be constituted by the RPSC with a direction <lb/>to give correct answer with brief explanation. <lb/></body>

			<page>(40 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>141. Q.77 -What is given in &apos;Gargi Puraskar&apos; to the students <lb/>passing tenth (10 th ) Board examination? <lb/>(1) A total sum of ₹ 6000 and a certificate <lb/>(2) A total sum of ₹ 10000 and a certificate <lb/>(3) A total sum of ₹ 25000 and a certificate <lb/>(4) A total sum of ₹ 5000 and a certificate <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (1) A total sum of ₹6000 and a <lb/>certificate <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: Question was deleted <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (1) A total sum of ₹6000 and a <lb/>certificate <lb/>142. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that though <lb/>the RPSC had given option No. (1) for the aforesaid question in <lb/>the first answer key, but however deleted this question in the <lb/>revised key. Petitioners claimed that option (1) as per the first <lb/>answer key is the correct answer, as per monthly Shivira Patrika <lb/>for the month of August, 2018 (Annex.31). RPSC has wrongly <lb/>deleted this question, has been their contention. <lb/>143. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-<lb/>Commission submitted that the question itself was wrong <lb/>inasmuch as Gargi Puraskar is given to a girl candidate, who <lb/>having passed X Board examination continues her studies of Class <lb/>XI and XII. <lb/>144. The Experts&apos; opinion suggests deletion of this question, which <lb/>reads thus:-<lb/>&quot;The question in itself is wrong. Hence it <lb/>may be deleted. The prize money is given <lb/>to girls when she continues to study in <lb/>Classes XI and XII.&quot; <lb/>145. In support of the stand of the Commission/the Expert <lb/>Committee, Mr. Joshi took the Court through relevant material <lb/></body>

			<page>(41 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>placed by him and submitted that Gargi Award is given to a female <lb/>candidate who having secured 75% or more marks in her Board <lb/>examination, pursues her future studies for Class XI and XII. He <lb/>added that it is only during such time, (for two years) she is given <lb/>the prize and submitted that the question No.77 was incomplete, <lb/>as the same did not contain the requisite stipulation, particularly <lb/>continuance of study for a period of two years. <lb/>146. In considered opinion of this Court, a perusal of the question <lb/>shows that the emphasis of the question is as to what is given in <lb/>Gargi Purarskar to the student passing Xth Board Examination; in <lb/>other words the examiner wanted to elicit the amount of award <lb/>given under Gargi Puraskar. The Commission&apos;s stand that the <lb/>expression &quot;Girl&quot; is absent in question No.77 and thus, the <lb/>question is incorrect, cannot be countenanced, more particularly <lb/>because the examiner has not asked as to &apos;who&apos; is given the Gargi <lb/>Purarskar. <lb/>The fact that the word &quot;Girl&quot; is absent in the <lb/>formulation of question hardly has any bearing on the <lb/>question/answer nor does its absence makes the question <lb/>incomplete or prone to confusion. The emphasis of the question is <lb/>on the quantum of amount of award, which is easily discernible <lb/>from other options given for the question. <lb/>147. Opinion of the experts instead of being on the correctness of <lb/>the answer, is on the framing of the question. As a matter of fact, <lb/>experts&apos; opinion is/was not required to examine the correctness of <lb/>the question. <lb/>148. This Court is of the firm view that the opinion of the experts <lb/>that question be deleted because the expression &quot;girl&quot; and further <lb/>stipulation &quot;she continues to study in class XI and XII&quot; were <lb/>absent, is untenable. Even in absence of these expressions, the <lb/></body>

			<page>(42 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>question which focuses on the quantum of award, is complete. <lb/>Thus, the answer originally given i.e. option (1) is the correct <lb/>answer. <lb/>149. As a result thereof, the action of the respondents in <lb/>deleting question No.77 is set aside. The first answer, i.e. <lb/>(1) is held to be correct answer. <lb/>150. Q.87 -Child Care Leave for mothers has been announced for <lb/>those mothers who have children upto the maximum age of -<lb/>(1) 12 years <lb/>(2) 14 years <lb/>(3) 16 years <lb/>(4) 18 years <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (4) 18 years <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: Question was deleted <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (4) 18 years <lb/>151. Mr. Mahaveer Bishnoi, learned counsel for the petitioners <lb/>submitted that the RPSC has given option No. (4) for the aforesaid <lb/>question in the first answer key but thereafter deleted this <lb/>question. Asserting that option No. (4) is the correct answer, as <lb/>per notification dated 22.05.2018, issued by the Finance <lb/>Department, Government of Rajasthan, learned counsel argued <lb/>that RPSC has erred in deleting this question. <lb/>152. It is noteworthy that while deleting the question, the RPSC <lb/>has opined thus:-<lb/>&quot;for <lb/>foHkkx <lb/>dh <lb/>vf/klw puk <lb/>la [;k <lb/>i-1(6) <lb/>F.D./Rules/2011 fnuka d 22-5-2018 ds }kjk Child <lb/>Care Leave dk iz ko/kku jktLFkku ls ok fu;e 1951 ds <lb/>fu;e 103C es lfEefyr fd;k x;k gS A bl fu;e es Child <lb/>dh ifjHkk&apos;kk fuEukuq lkj nh xbZ gS A <lb/>(a) a child below the age of eighteen years or <lb/></body>

According to the experts, the language of the question was <lb/>not correct, hence, the question deserved to be deleted, while <lb/>observing thus:-<lb/>&quot;Child dh ifjHkk&apos;kk es a below 18 years gh g S A vr% iz &quot;u <lb/>dh Hkk&apos;kk lgh ugha gks us ds dkj.k iz &quot;u dk fodYi xyr gS A&quot; <lb/>154. Explaining the stand of the experts, Mr. Joshi submitted that <lb/>the question contains the expression &quot;upto the maximum age of&quot;; <lb/>whereas Rule 103C of the Rules, published vide notification dated <lb/>22.05.2018 uses the expression &quot;Child below the age of 18 years&quot;. <lb/>155. In considered opinion of this Court, the experts clearly got <lb/>confused and misdirected. There is practically no difference <lb/>between the expression &quot;upto the maximum age&quot; and &quot;child below <lb/>the age of&quot;. <lb/>156. Though sub-rule (b) of Rule 103 has not been a reason to <lb/>delete, but it may be clarified that yet sub-rule (b) of Rule 103 is <lb/>applicable in exceptional cases, namely, &quot;a child having disability <lb/>of minimum 40%&quot;. Since the age of 22 years is an exception and <lb/>having regard to the fact that 22 years is not an option provided, <lb/>the answer earlier given by the RPSC (4) 18 years is held to be <lb/>correct answer. <lb/></body>

			<page>(44 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>157. The action of the respondents in deleting the question <lb/>is, therefore, clearly illegal. It is held that correct answer <lb/>is option No.(4). <lb/>158. Q.89 -Bills for Travelling allowance other than fixed or <lb/>permanent allowance shall be prepared and presented in system <lb/>Generated New form.

Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (1) for the aforesaid question in both the <lb/>answer keys, but as per the circular dated 04.08.2017 (Annex.33) <lb/>issued by the Finance Department, Government of Rajasthan, with <lb/>effect from 15.09.2017, the Bills for travelling allowance other <lb/>than fixed or permanent allowance are required to be prepared <lb/>and presented in system Generated New form. According to the <lb/>petitioners, since &apos;15.09.2017&apos; has not been given as an option, <lb/>question No.89 was required to be deleted. <lb/>160. Asserting that RPSC was right, Mr. Joshi relied upon Circular <lb/>dated 04.10.2016, while placing the same for perusal of the Court <lb/>and submitted that system generated new Form No.65 has been <lb/>made effective from 01.01.2017. <lb/>161. After considering the rival contentions and the Circular <lb/>dated 04.10.2016, this Court finds that the stand of the <lb/></body>

Petitioners claimed that <lb/>correct option is (4) as per the notification dated 21.02.2012 <lb/>issued by the Finance Department, Government of Rajasthan, <lb/>thus, the Commission has wrongly deleted this question. <lb/>164. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the respondent-Commission <lb/>submitted that there was a typing mistake in the question <lb/>inasmuch as, in place of word &quot;prior&quot;, the word &quot;period&quot; has been <lb/>printed, <lb/>which <lb/>conveys <lb/>no <lb/>meaning. <lb/>As <lb/>such, <lb/>the <lb/>Commission/Experts deleted the question. <lb/>165.

			<body>commission was justified in deleting the question. The <lb/>challenge to this question therefore, fails. Deletion of <lb/>question No.90 by the Commission is affirmed. <lb/>166. Q. 102: A child who is 10 years old and has never gone to <lb/>school before is eligible to be admitted in which class? <lb/>(1) One <lb/>(2) Three <lb/>(3) Four <lb/>(4) Five <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (4) Five <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (4) Five <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (3) Four <lb/>167. Learned Counsel for the petitioners submits that as per the <lb/>authentic books option No.(3) is correct. <lb/>168. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent-Commission, <lb/>inviting Court&apos;s attention towards Section 4 of the Right to <lb/>Education Act,2009, submitted that the child of six years of age is <lb/>required to be admitted in I Standard and thus, at the age of 10 <lb/>years, he is to be given admission in V Standard. <lb/>169. Mr. Jangid, learned counsel invited Court&apos;s attention towards <lb/>Section 4 of the Right to Education Act and read Question No.30 <lb/>and its answer. The same is being reproduced hereinbelow:-<lb/>Q. 30 What does &apos;age appropriate class&apos; mean? <lb/>It means giving admission in a class where the <lb/>child would normally be if she had joined school <lb/>from Class I at six years of age. So if a child is 11 <lb/>years old and has never been to school, she or he <lb/>will be admitted to Class V, but shall be given <lb/>special education to reach the level in a time frame <lb/>of three months to two years [Model Rule 3(1)]. <lb/></body>

			<body>170. Before going through the contents of above quoted <lb/>paragraph, this Court deems it necessary to record its displeasure <lb/>about the anxiety of the petitioners -they just rely upon and <lb/>insist upon the Court to blindly follow and base its judgment on an <lb/>opinion, source, authenticity and authority whereof is unknown. <lb/>The Courts of Law can be guided only by the statutory provisions <lb/>or binding precedents. Such random question -answer picked <lb/>from net or website are absolutely worthless before the Courts. <lb/>171. Be that as it may. Going by above para, Mr. Jangid argued <lb/>that as a 11 year old child is to be admitted in Class V, a 10 year <lb/>old is to be given admission in Class IV. This Court cannot, but <lb/>refrain from recording its concern about the wisdom of the author <lb/>-it is beyond common sense and fails simple mathematics. Even <lb/>going by this para, if a six year old child is to get admission in <lb/>Class I, then by simple mathematics a ten year old will go to Class <lb/>V (6-I, 7-II, 8-III, 9-IV, 10-V). The quoted paragraph, petitioners&apos; <lb/>argument and challenge to this question defies logic and simple <lb/>arithmetic. <lb/>172. The answer of the RPSC is correct. Challenge to <lb/>question No.102 fails. <lb/>173. Q.103: Who is the runner-up of Wimbledon Gentlemen&apos;s <lb/>singles&quot; <lb/>(1) Novak Djokovic <lb/>(2) Pete Sampras <lb/>(3) Roger Federer <lb/>(4) Kevin Anderson <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (4) Kevin Anderson <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: Question was deleted <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (4) Kevin Anderson <lb/></body>

			<body>174. Learned counsel for the petitioners claims that as per the <lb/>authentic books option No. 4 is correct answer, whereas RPSC has <lb/>deleted the question. <lb/>175. As against the contention raised by the petitioners, learned <lb/>counsel for RPSC invited Court&apos;s attention towards framing of the <lb/>question; he read the question No.103 and pointed out that year <lb/>2018 was omitted to be printed, therefore, going by the Note <lb/>No.10, the question was deleted. <lb/>176. A simple look at question No.103 goes to show that year <lb/>&apos;2018&apos; has not been mentioned, whereas in Hindi version, year <lb/>2018 has been mentioned. <lb/>177. In view of the apparent omission, RPSC was justified <lb/>in deleting the question -as the question became open <lb/>ended, in absence of year of championship. The challenge <lb/>to this question, therefore, fails. <lb/>178. Q. 118 -Which one of the following countries received $ 39 <lb/>Million for Maritime Security from the U.S.? <lb/>(1) Bangladesh <lb/>(2) India <lb/>(3) Pakistan <lb/>(4) Srilanka <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (4) Srilanka <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (4) Srilanka <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted <lb/>179. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (4) for the aforesaid question in both the <lb/>answer keys, but considering the fact that in Hindi version of <lb/>question paper, &quot;Maritice Security&quot; (eS jh VkbZ l) is mentioned in place <lb/>of &quot;Maritime Security&quot;, the question was required to be deleted. <lb/></body>

			<body>180. Inviting Court&apos;s attention towards Hindi Version vis-à-vis <lb/>English version, Mr. Joshi submitted that as per Note appended to <lb/>the question paper, English version was to be accepted. He added <lb/>that it is true that Hindi version, the word &quot;eS jh VkbZ l&quot; in place of <lb/>&quot;eS jh Vkbe&quot; has been printed, such inadvertent error was to be <lb/>omitted, as the English version of the question was correctly <lb/>typed. <lb/>181. A comparison of Hindi version and English version of <lb/>the question reveals that there is a typographical error in <lb/>Hindi version of question No.118, but as per Note 10 of the <lb/>question paper, English version is to be accepted. Since <lb/>English version of the question is correct, the petitioner&apos;s <lb/>contention that the question needs to be deleted, cannot be <lb/>accepted. Contention rejected. Option (4) i.e. Srilanka <lb/>given by the Commission is affirmed. <lb/>182. Q. 120: Consumer Protection Act was enforced in-<lb/>(1) 1984 <lb/>(2) 1982 <lb/>(3) 1986 <lb/>(4) 1989 <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (3) 1986 <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (3) 1986 <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted <lb/>183. Mr. Bhaleria, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that <lb/>as per the authentic books, the Act was enforced in 1987. As <lb/>correct answer is not given in the options, the question was <lb/>required to be deleted. <lb/>184. With respect to question No.120, the experts opined thus: <lb/></body>

			<page>(50 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;;?kfi iz &quot;u es iw Nk x;k vf/kfu;e 1986 es a ykxq <lb/>gw vk gS ] rFkkfi bl vf/kfu;e dks replace dj u;k <lb/>vf/kfu;e cukus dk fo/ks ;d fn-05-01-2018 dks <lb/>yks dlHkk es a iw u%LFkkfir fd;k x;k gS A rnũq lkj ;g <lb/>eq )k current affairs es a lekfgr gS A <lb/>vr,o OS ,oa AOW dh vkifRr;ka vLohdk;Z gS A&quot; <lb/>185. A perusal of the note quoted above suggests that the experts <lb/>have decided the objection treating the same to be out of <lb/>syllabus. The correctness of the answer has not been examined at <lb/>all. <lb/>186. Having regard to the arguments advanced by Mr. J.S. <lb/>Bhaleria, learned counsel in SBCWP No.16733/2019, (Ajay Bhadu <lb/>Vs. State), the Court proceeded to examine the correctness of the <lb/>question by itself. In the process of elucidating correct answer, <lb/>the Court asked Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the Commission to <lb/>give correct answer, while making relevant material (Book, <lb/>Notification etc.) available to him. <lb/>187. On reading of sub-section (2) of Section 1 of the Consumer <lb/>Protection Act, 1986 and the gazette notification No.SO-390(E) <lb/>dated 15.04.1987, Mr. Joshi submitted that it can be said with <lb/>certitude that the Act of 1986 came into force w.e.f. 15.04.1987. <lb/>188. &apos;1987&apos; has not at all been given as an option qua <lb/>question No.120; its options are thus, erroneous. Question <lb/>No.120, is, thus, liable to be deleted. Ordered accordingly. <lb/>189. Q. 122 -&apos;Agricultural shot&apos; is associated with-<lb/>(1) Hockey <lb/>(2) Cricket <lb/>(3) Baseball <lb/>(4) Chess <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (2) Cricket <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: (2) Cricket <lb/></body>

			<page>(51 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: To be deleted <lb/>190. Learned counsel for the petitioners informed that the RPSC <lb/>has given option No. (2) for the aforesaid question in both the <lb/>answer keys published by it. Petitioners contention is that the <lb/>question relates to vocabulary of sports and sports or sports <lb/>vocabulary is not given in the syllabus, hence, the question being <lb/>out of syllabus, deserves to be deleted. <lb/>191. Responding to petitioners&apos; argument that &quot;Agricultural Shot&quot; <lb/>is a term/vocabulary relating to sports is out of the syllabus, Mr. <lb/>Joshi submitted that the this question is from &apos;current events&apos;. <lb/>192. In this regard, he invited Court&apos;s attention towards the <lb/>experts&apos; opinion and submitted that &quot;Agricultural Shot&quot; is <lb/>commonly used expression in cricket and thus, it is covered in <lb/>current events. <lb/>193. Before adjudicating the dispute, this Court deems it <lb/>appropriate to first reproduce what experts have said about this <lb/>question:-<lb/>&quot;Agricultural shot fdz ds V ls la ca f/kr ,d yks d iz pfyr <lb/>&quot;kCn gS ] tks Hkkjr dh lgHkkfxrk okys eS pks a ds nkS jku ppkZ es a <lb/>vo&quot;; jgrk gS A vr% ;g ikB;dz e es a mYys f[r &apos;current <lb/>events&apos; es lekfgr gS A vr% OS dh vkifRr vLohdk;Z gS A&quot; <lb/>194. This Court is not at all convinced with the views of the <lb/>experts. Even if an expression is commonly used in the cricket <lb/>matches, it cannot be said that it is a part of a current event. <lb/>Current event is a one time incident, having happened in recent <lb/>past. The experts have not given any detail, as to when or during <lb/>which event, (which had happened currently), such shot was <lb/>played or came into prominence. True it is, that agricultural shot is <lb/>a shot known in cricket, but merely because it might have been <lb/></body>

			<page>(52 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>heard during recent cricket matches, it cannot be said that the <lb/>same is covered in current events. <lb/>195. Objection raised by the petitioners qua this question is <lb/>sustained. It is surprising to note that when it comes to <lb/>Penicillin, RPSC opines it to be out of syllabus, but with <lb/>respect to agricultural shot it says that it is included in <lb/>current events -without even mentioning that when such <lb/>shot was played recently. RPSC&apos;s stand that it is within <lb/>syllabus is rejected. Consequently, question No.122 is <lb/>ordered to be deleted. <lb/>196. Q. 125 -Recently Hima Das won a gold medal. The sports <lb/>event in which she won was-<lb/>(1) Asian Games-2018 <lb/>(2) World Atheletics Championship-2018 <lb/>(3) World Junior Atheletics Championship-2018 <lb/>(4) Commonwealth Games-2018. <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (3) World Junior Atheletics <lb/>Championship-2018 <lb/>Revised Result <lb/>: Deleted <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (3) World Junior Atheletics <lb/>Championship-2018 <lb/>197. Learned counsel for the petitioners argued that correct option <lb/>is option No.(3), as the participation in the Asian Games was as a <lb/>team and not individually. According to the petitioner the deletion <lb/>was improper. <lb/>198. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the Commission submitted that <lb/>Hima Das won gold medal in Asian Games-2018 so also in World <lb/>Junior Athletics Championship-2018. According to Commission, <lb/>since options Nos.1 and 3 both were correct, it was thought <lb/>appropriate to delete the question. <lb/></body>

			<page>(53 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>199. It is really a sorry state of affairs that RPSC has relied upon a <lb/>news item with the heading &quot;Asian Game Gold Medalist Hima Das <lb/>says that she did not expect to be nominated for the Arjuna Award <lb/>this year&quot; to establish that she won a Gold Medal in Asian Games. <lb/>The experts ought to have traced the news of her winning Gold <lb/>Medal itself or should have referred to the information lying in the <lb/>website. Experts are supposed to act and perform as experts -<lb/>they have been novice on most of the occasions. <lb/>200. In considered opinion of this Court, such news item cannot <lb/>be treated to be an evidence in support of the fact that Hima Das <lb/>is an Asian Games gold medalist. True it is, that Hima Das was <lb/>part of the team which won a Gold medal for India in Asian Games <lb/>2018 (Women&apos;s 4x400 meter relay race). <lb/>201. Upon surfing through the record, it is clear that so far Asian <lb/>Games-2018 is concerned, the telly shows that Hima Das was part <lb/>of two teams, which fetched Gold medals for India-she was a <lb/>member of mixed as well as women&apos;s team taking part in 4x400 <lb/>meter relay race. That way, she helped India win two Gold <lb/>medals. But since the question is specific -&apos;a gold medal&apos; and <lb/>also because a medal won by a team cannot be attributed to one <lb/>player alone, in considered opinion of this Court, option (3) -<lb/>&apos;World Junior Athletics&apos; is the correct answer as option No.(1) does <lb/>not fit-in qua the question asked. <lb/>202. Even if option No.1 is to be treated correct, then, more <lb/>correct answer is (3) -World Junior Athletics Championship-2018, <lb/>in which she begged Gold in 400 meter race. <lb/>203. As an upshot of the discussion foregoing, this Court is <lb/>of the opinion that option (3) is the most suitable option <lb/>and RPSC has erred in deleting the question. RPSC is <lb/></body>

			<page>(54 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>directed to revise the result while treating option No.(3) to <lb/>be correct answer. <lb/>204. Q. 126: Consider the following statements about &apos;Ayushman <lb/>Bharat Scheme&apos;-<lb/>(i) It is also known as National Health Protection Mission <lb/>(ii) The scheme provides the benefit cover of 2 lakh per family per <lb/>year <lb/>(iii) The scheme will launch on 25 September 2018 <lb/>Which of the above statements/statements are incorrect? <lb/>(1) only (i) <lb/>(2) only (ii) <lb/>(3) (ii) &amp; (iii) <lb/>(4) only (iii) <lb/>Answer given by the RPSC : (2) only (ii) <lb/>Revised answer key <lb/>: (2) only (ii) <lb/>Claim by the petitioners <lb/>: (3) (ii) &amp; (iii) <lb/>205. Learned counsel for the petitioners claims that correct option <lb/>is option No.(3). <lb/>206. Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the Commission submitted that <lb/>the date of examination was 02.09.2018, whereas the change in <lb/>the coverage amount was made on 18.09.2018, after the date of <lb/>examination. He argued that as on the date of examination, <lb/>option No.(2) given by the RPSC was correct. <lb/>207. The petitioners have relied upon the material/event, which <lb/>has come into being after the date of examination. <lb/>208. In considered opinion of this Court, the answer to a question <lb/>has to be examined as per the fact(s) prevailing on the date of <lb/>examination, i.e. 02.09.2018. This Court is satisfied with the <lb/>reasons given by the experts duly explained by Mr. Joshi. <lb/></body>

			<page>(55 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>209. Challenge to question No.126 fails; Option (2) i.e. only <lb/>(ii) given by the Commission is, therefore, affirmed. <lb/>210. It is to be noted that challenge to many questions has been <lb/>led by the petitioners, however, during the submissions, challenge <lb/>to many of the questions was dropped, the adjudication is, <lb/>therefore, confined to the questions, which were pressed before <lb/>the Court. <lb/>211. During the course of hearing, learned counsel appearing for <lb/>the Commission has said that not only the final result has been <lb/>declared, list of selected candidates has already been forwarded to <lb/>the State Government and thus, if any interference is made, the <lb/>same be confined to petitioners involved in the present writ <lb/>petitions. <lb/>212. Having dealt with the contentions of rival parties and <lb/>adjudicated upon the challenge raised to each of the questions, <lb/>this Court finds itself on the cross-road. Dwelling on the request <lb/>of the RPSC to confine the adjudication made herein qua the <lb/>petitioners only, this Court is of the firm view that the present <lb/>adjudication cannot be confined to the petitioners alone. <lb/>213. The reasons are not far to seek and the same are set out <lb/>hereinfra. <lb/>214. It is to be noted that out of 300 questions in all, 29 questions <lb/>were impugned in these writ petitions. Doubting the correctness <lb/>of 12 questions, this Court has modified the answer or has <lb/>referred the questions to the Expert Committee. As the instances <lb/>of errors/omissions are such large in number (4%), restricting the <lb/>adjudication to the petitioners would be giving undue advantage <lb/>to the candidates, who had given wrong answers. Hence, if the <lb/>result is to be revised, it is required to be reviewed/revised for all. <lb/></body>

			<page>(56 of 59) <lb/>[CW-15944/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>The candidates cannot be made to suffer on account of fault or <lb/>folly of the Paper Setter, Proof Reader, Printer, Experts and the <lb/>Commission itself. <lb/>215. In view of the aforesaid, these writ petitions are allowed; the <lb/>merit list and the select list (if any) is hereby quashed; the RPSC <lb/>is directed to recheck all the answer scripts in tendam with the <lb/>adjudication made qua each of the question under consideration. <lb/>216. For the sake of convenience, particulars of questions and <lb/>corresponding answers/directions, which need to be revisited have <lb/>been cataloged in the Schedule appended with the present <lb/>judgment. <lb/>The revision of result shall be subject to the <lb/>following :-<lb/>(i) <lb/>The Commission shall immediately constitute at least <lb/>two members Committee(s) of Experts for the questions, <lb/>which have been ordered to be referred to the Expert <lb/>Committee; <lb/>(ii) <lb/>Questions belonging to different subjects may be <lb/>referred to different Committees; <lb/>(iii) <lb/>The RPSC shall provide not only a copy of the judgment <lb/>instant but also copies of writ petition(s) to the members of <lb/>the Expert Committee so as to enable them to take into <lb/>account the challenge/contentions/arguments and material <lb/>relied upon by the petitioners; <lb/>(iv) <lb/>The Experts are expected to go through the <lb/>observations made by this Court while dealing with the <lb/>questions referred to it, more particularly what has been said <lb/>in para No.12 of the judgment instant; <lb/>(v) <lb/>The Expert Committee to submit its report qua the <lb/>questions referred latest by 15.04.2020; <lb/>(vi) <lb/>Assimilating the answers suggested by the Expert <lb/>Committee and the adjudication made in the present <lb/>judgment, the RPSC will recheck the answer scripts of all the <lb/>candidates by 30.04.2020; <lb/></body>

			<body>(vii) The revised result/select list shall be forwarded to the <lb/>State Government latest by 15.05.2020 . <lb/>217. While adjudicating the contentious questions, this Court finds <lb/>that out of 29 questions, six questions contained typographical <lb/>mistakes in the question papers, which have largely attributed to <lb/>revision of result and necessitated present litigation which was <lb/>otherwise avoidable. <lb/>A cost of Rs.1,00,000/-is, therefore, <lb/>imposed upon the Commission. The amount of cost be utilized in <lb/>the field of girls&apos; education. <lb/>218. The cost aforesaid be deposited in the form of Demand Draft <lb/>payable to Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority, attached with <lb/>the Rajasthan High Court, Jodhpur on or before 15 th April, 2020. <lb/>219. The Commission shall furnish a proof of such payment and <lb/>will be free to recover such cost from Printer(s)/Proof Reader(s) <lb/>concerned. <lb/>220. The matter be placed before the Registrar (Judicial) on <lb/>22.04.2020 for the purpose of ascertaining the factum of payment <lb/>of cost. In case, the amount of cost is not deposited, the matter <lb/>be laid before the Court on 27.04.2020 at 02.00 p.m. <lb/>221. Secretary, Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority, <lb/>Rajasthan at Jodhpur be intimated about the order instant. <lb/>222.
