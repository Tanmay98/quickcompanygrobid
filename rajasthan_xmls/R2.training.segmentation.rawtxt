HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AKIL KURESHI 

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAMESHWAR VYAS 

REPORTABLE 
Judgment 

05/01/2022 

By the Court: (Per Akil Kureshi, CJ): 

These appeals are filed by the Rajasthan Marudhara Gramin 

Bank to challenge the common judgment of the learned Single 

Judge dated 16.10.2020 passed in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 

7359/2019 and other connected petitions. The Special Appeal 

(Writ) No. 503/2020 is treated as the lead appeal. We would be 

referring to the documents on record in the said appeal. 

2. 
The writ petition was filed by the bank challenging an order 

dated 20.07.2020 passed by the Appellate Authority under the 

Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (hereinafter to be referred to as the 

'Act of 1972') partly confirming the order dated 28.03.2018 

passed by the Controlling Authority under the Act of 1972. The 

petitioner bank is a Gramin Bank operating in the State of 

Rajasthan. The respondent Kheem Singh Rathore was an officer of 

the bank. He retired on superannuation w.e.f. 30.09.2016. At the 

time of his retirement, the bank had paid him gratuity of 

Rs.10,30,319/-. He later on approached the Controlling Authority 

and disputed the amount of gratuity paid to him by the employer 


(54 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

bank. His grievance was that while calculating the gratuity, the 

bank had not taken into account the dearness allowance 

component of his pay. The bank opposed his application on the 

ground that the gratuity paid to him is as per the regulations 

framed by the bank. The Controlling Authority, by an order dated 

28.03.2018 allowed the application. The said authority was of the 

opinion that the dearness allowance component ought to have 

been taken into account while computing the last pay drawn for 

the purpose of payment of gratuity. He also held that for every 

completed year of service beyond 30 years, the applicant would 

receive an additional gratuity at the rate of salary for one and a 

half months. The bank had pointed out that for the purpose of 

computing gratuity, the regulations framed make a distinction 

between an officer and other employees. The Controlling Authority 

was of the opinion that any such distinction would be opposed to 

the equality clause under Article 14 of the Constitution. 

3. 
The bank challenged the said order of the Controlling 

Authority before the Appellate Authority. The Appellate Authority 

by an order dated 20.07.2020 confirmed the first portion of the 

order of the Controlling Authority, namely, that for the purpose of 

computing gratuity payable to the applicant concerned, dearness 

allowance should be taken into account. However, with respect to 

the second aspect of the matter, namely, additional weightage for 

service beyond 30 years, the Appellate Authority did not accept 

the view of the Controlling Authority and held that only half 

month's salary for completed year of service beyond 30 years 

would be payable. With this modification, the order of the 

Controlling Authority was confirmed. 


(55 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

4. 
The bank challenged the said orders before the High Court. 

The learned Single Judge by the impugned judgment dismissed 

the bank's petition. The learned Single Judge referred to the 

definition of the term 'wages' contained in Section 2(s) of the Act 

of 1972. The learned Single Judge also referred to and relied upon 

the decision of the learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh 

High Court in the case of All India Gramin Bank Pensioners 

Organization Unit Rewa Versus Madhyanchal Gramin Bank 

and another dated 06.09.2018, which was confirmed by the 

Division Bench. The learned Single Judge was of the opinion that 

as per the provisions of the regulations of the bank as well as the 

Act of 1972, the employee would receive gratuity under either of 

the statutes, whichever is higher. 

5. 
It appears that against the order of the Appellate Authority, 

which was in favour of the bank, by which the weightage for every 

completed year of service beyond 30 years was brought down to 

half month instead of one and a half month's salary, the applicants 

had not filed any writ petition. They had instead, in the replies to 

the petitions, raised this issue. The learned Single Judge examined 

this aspect also and confirmed the view of the Appellate Authority. 

Against the said judgment of the learned Single Judge, the bank 

has filed these appeals. 

6. 
Appearing for the bank, Mr. R.N Mathur, learned Senior 

Advocate took us through relevant provisions of the Act of 1972 

and the regulations framed by the bank under the Regional Rural 

Banks Act, 1976 (herein after to be referred to as the 'Act of 

1976') and raised the following contentions: 


(56 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

(i) 
Any employee or officer of the bank can claim benefit of 

gratuity payable under the regulations or under the Act of 

1972 but cannot take benefit under both sets of provisions. 

(ii) The language used in the regulations framed by the bank, is 

clear and permit no ambiguity. There is a clear distinction 

between an officer and an employee of the bank when it 

comes to computation of gratuity. 

(iii) The applicants had accepted the gratuity paid by the bank at 

the time of retirement. Long time thereafter, they filed 

applications before the Controlling Authority without filing 

applications for condonation of delay or independently also 

explaining delay caused in filing such applications. The 

Controlling Authority entertained their applications ignoring 

the delay. 

7. 
On the other hand, the learned counsel for the employees 

opposed the appeals on the following grounds: 

(i) The Act of 1972 as well as the regulations framed by the 

bank for payment of gratuity are beneficial welfare 

legislations. The Court should adopt liberal interpretation and 

give benefit to the employee to the extent possible. 

(ii) The regulations of the bank have been correctly interpreted 

by the authorities under the Act of 1972 and by the learned 

Single Judge which requires no interference. 

(iii) The scope of the appeal against an order passed by the 

learned Single Judge in exercise of writ jurisdiction is 

extremely narrow. 

(iv) As per the Act of 1972, the onus is on the bank to pay 

gratuity to a retiring employee at the correct rates. If there is 


(57 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

any lapse on the part of the bank, the employer cannot raise 

the ground of limitations. 

(v) They also argued that the Controlling Authority had correctly 

come to the conclusion that for every completed year of 

service beyond 30 years, additional amount at the rate of 

one and half month's salary would be payable. The Appellate 

Authority and the learned Single Judge erred in reversing this 

finding of the Controlling Authority. 

8. 
Both sides have referred to the decisions of various Courts 

taking different views. Before referring to these judgments, we 

may refer to the statutory provisions applicable. To provide for a 

scheme for the payment of gratuity to employees engaged in 

factories, mines, oil fields, plantations, ports, railway companies, 

shops and other establishments and for matters connected there 

with, the Act of 1972 was enacted. It applies to factories, mines, 

oil fields, plantations, ports etc and other shops and 

establishments. Clause (s) of Section 2 defines the term 'wages' 

as under: 
"(s) "wages" means all emoluments which are 
earned by an employee while on duty or on leave in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of his 
employments and which are paid or are payable to 
him in cash and includes dearness allowance but 
does not include any bonus, commission, house 
rent allowance, overtime wages and any other 
allowance." 

9. 
The liability for payment of gratuity flows from Section 4. 

Sub-section (1) of Section 4 provides that the gratuity shall be 

payable to employees on termination of his employment after he 

has rendered continuous service not less than five years (a) on his 

superannuation, or (b) on his retirement or resignation, or (c) on 

his death or disablement due to accident or disease. Sub-section 


(58 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

(3) of Section 4 provides that the amount of gratuity payable to 

an employee shall not exceed such amount as may be notified by 

the Central Government from time to time. It may be noted that 

at the relevant time when the concerned respondents in this group 

of appeals retired, the limit specified by the Central Government in 

terms of Sub-section (3) of Section 4 was Rs.10 lacs. Sub-section 

(5) of Section 4 provides that nothing in this Section shall effect 

the right of an employee to receive better terms of gratuity under 

any award or agreement or contract with the employer. 

10. Section 7 of the Act of 1972 pertains to determination of 

amount of gratuity. As per Sub-section (4) of section 7 any 

dispute regarding amount of gratuity payable to an employee 

would be determined by the Controlling Authority. In terms of 

Sub-section (7) of Section 7, a person aggrieved by the order 

passed by the Controlling Authority has a right to file appeal 

before the Appellate Authority. 

11. Section 14 of the Act of 1972 gives overriding effect by 

providing that the provisions of the Act or any Rule made 

thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent 

therewith contained in any enactment other than the said Act or in 

any instrument or contract having effect by virtue of any 

enactment other than the said Act. 

12. To provide for the incorporation, regulation and winding up of 

Regional Rural Banks with a view to developing the rural economy 

by providing for the purpose of development of agriculture, trade, 

commerce, industry and other productive activities in the rural 

areas, credit and other facilities particularly to the small and 

marginal farmers, agricultural labour artisans and small 

entrepreneurs and matters connected therewith, the Regional 


(59 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

Rural Banks Act, 1976 was enacted. Section 3 of the Act of 1976 

envisages establishment and incorporation of Regional Rural 

Banks. Appellant bank is one such bank incorporated in terms of 

Section 3. Section 8 pertains to management. As per Sub-section 

(1) of Section 8, the management and superintendence would 

vest in the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will be 

constituted as provided under Section 9. As per Sub-section (1) of 

Section 9, the Board of Directors would consist of, beside others, 

two directors to be nominated by the Central Government, one, 

who would be an officer of the Reserve Bank, one, who would be 

an officer of the National Bank and two Directors who are officers 

of the sponsor bank. 

13. Section 17 of the Act pertains to staff of Regional Rural Bank. 

As per Sub-section (1) of Section 17, the bank may appoint such 

number of officers and other employees as it may consider 

necessary or desirable for the efficient performance of its 

functions and may determine the terms and conditions of their 

appointment and services. 

14. Section 29 of the Act empowers the Central Government to 

frame rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act. Section 30 is 

the power for framing regulations. Under Sub-section (1) of 

Section 30, the Board of Directors of Regional Rural Bank would 

be authorized to frame regulations after consultation with the 

sponsor bank and the National Bank and with the previous 

sanction of the Central Government for the purpose of giving 

effect to the provisions of the Act. 

15. In exercise of powers under Section 30 of the Act of 1976, 

the bank has framed the Rajasthan Marudhara Gramin Bank 

(Officers and Employees) Service Regulations, 2010 (hereinafter 


(60 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

to be referred to as 'the said Regulations'). Regulation 2 contains 

definitions. We are concerned with the definitions of terms 

'emoluments', 'pay', 'salary', 'employee' and 'officer' which are 

defined as under: 

"(i) "Emoluments" means the aggregate of salary and 
allowance, if any; 
(j) "Employee" means an employee of the Bank as 
classified under clause (b) and (c) of sub-regulation 
(1) of regulation 3, and includes such employee 
whose services are lent to other organizations under 
regulation 75; 
(l) "Officer" means an officer of the Bank as classified 
under Clause (a) of sub-regulation (1) of regulation 3; 
(m) "Pay" means basic pay drawn per month by the 
officer or employee in a pay-scale including stagnation 
increments and any part of the emoluments which 
may specifically be classified as pay under these 
regulations. 
(o) "Salary" means aggregate of pay and dearness 
allowance." 

16. Chapter-II of the regulations pertains to classification of 

officers and employees, appointment, probation and termination 

of service. Regulation 3 contained in Chapter-II contains 

classification of officers and employees. The officers are classified 

in Clause (a) of Regulation 3 and the employees are divided in two 

classes of group (b) and group (c) employees as per clause (b) 

and (c) of Regulation 3. 

17. Chapter-VII of the Regulations contains miscellaneous 

provisions. Regulation 72 contained in the said chapter, being at 

the center of controversy, may be reproduced in entirety: 

"72. Gratuity -(1) An officer or employee shall be 
eligible for payment of gratuity either as per the 
provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (39 of 
1972) or as per sub-regulation (2), whichever is 
higher. 
(2) Every officer or employee shall be eligible for 
gratuity on,-
(a) retirement, 


(61 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

(b) death, 
(c) disablement rendering him unfit for further service 
as certified by a medical officer approved by the Bank, 
or 
(d) resignation after completing 10 years of continuous 
service, 
(e) termination of service in any other way except by 
way of punishment after completion of 10 years of 
service; 
Provided that in respect of an employee there shall be 
no forfeiture of gratuity for dismissal on account of 
misconduct except in cases where such misconduct 
causes financial loss to the bank and in that case to 
that extent only. 
(3) The amount of gratuity payable to an officer or 
employee shall be one months pay for every completed 
year of service or part thereof in excess of six months 
subject to a maximum of 15 month's pay: 
Provided further that in respect of an officer the 
gratuity is payable based on the last pay drawn: 
Provided also that in respect of an employee pay for 
the purposes of calculation of the gratuity shall be the 
average of the basic pay (100%), dearness allowance 
and special allowance and officiating allowance payable 
during the 12 months preceding death, disability, 
retirement, resignation or termination of service, as 
the case may be." 

18. An identical issue arose before the learned Single Judge of 

the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of All India Gramin 

Bank 
Pensioners 
Organization 
Unit 
Rewa 
Versus 

Madhyanchal Gramin Bank and another. By decision dated 

06.09.2018, the learned Single Judge held that the officers of the 

Gramin Bank would receive gratuity by including the dearness 

allowance for the purpose of determining last pay drawn. The 

learned Single Judge referred to the definition of terms 'pay', 

'emoluments' and 'salary' contained in the said Regulations and 

came to the conclusion that the dearness allowance is specifically 

classified and must form part of pay otherwise the expression 

would lead to absurdity which the Court would avoid. The decision 

of the learned Single Judge was challenged before the Division 

Bench. The appeal of the bank was dismissed by the judgment 


(62 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

dated 26.02.2019. We may record that the matter was carried out 

further in appeal before the Supreme Court and the SLP was 

dismissed on 07.05.2019. 

19. In the case of Chinmoy Majumder and others Versus 

Paschim Banga Gramin Bank and others (W.P 19538(W) of 

2018), the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in 

judgment dated 05.07.2019 followed the decision of Madhya 

Pradesh High Court in the case of Madhyanchal Gramin Bank 

(supra). However, subsequently the Division Bench of Calcutta 

High Court in an appeal filed by the bank, reversed the judgment 

of the learned Single Judge by judgment dated 04.02.2021. It was 

held that for the purpose of the Regulation 72, there is a clear 

distinction between officer and employee when it comes to 

calculation of gratuity. It was held that the fact that Act of 1972 

has over-riding effect, is of no relevance. 

20. In the case of Chattisgarh Rajya Gramin Bank Versus 

Meghraj Pathak and others, the learned Single Judge of 

Chattisgarh High Court in a judgment rendered on 31.08.2020 had 

ruled in favour of the officers. It was observed that since the 

dispute involved has already been thrashed out before the 

Controlling Authority, who had deliberately discussed the 

contentions of both the sides and has given an order which is 

affirmed by the Appellate Authority, the scope of interference in 

the judicial review was limited. This decision was carried out in 

appeal by the bank before the Division Bench. The Division Bench 

by judgment dated 28.01.2021 reversed the judgment of the 

learned Single Judge. This was on the basis of interpretation 

adopted by the Division Bench of various terms defined in the 

Regulations and the provisions contained in Regulation 72. 


(63 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

21. Learned Single Judge of Gauhati High Court in the case of 

Assam Gramin Vikash Bank and another Versus The Union 

of India and others has held the issue in favour of the 

employee. The decision was also confirmed by the Division Bench. 

22. To complete the narration, we may record that the learned 

Single Judge of Bombay High Court in the case of Vidarbha 

Konkan Gramin Bank Versus The Appellate Authority has 

held that for the purpose of computing gratuity under the 

Regulations for an officer only pay would be made the basis 

without including the dearness allowance. 

23. It can thus be seen that there is a clear divide between the 

judicial opinions across the country. We would have due regard to 

the different view points, analysis and interpretations adopted by 

different Courts in the process of taking our own view in the 

matter. A brief comparison of the computation provisions under 

the Act of 1972 and the regulations would show that under the Act 

of 1972, the gratuity is payable at the rate of 15 days of wages for 

every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six 

months. This however comes with the ceiling, as may be provided 

by the Central Government from time to time, which at the 

relevant time was Rs.10 lacs. As against this, in terms of 

Regulation 72(3), the gratuity would be payable at the rate of one 

month pay for every completed year of service or part thereof in 

excess of six months. This would be subject to maximum of 15 

months' pay. As per the proviso, for every completed year of 

service beyond 30 years, an additional amount at the rate of one 

half of month's pay would be paid. Significantly, there is no upper 

limit of gratuity that my be paid under Regulation 72. 


(64 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

24. The fact that despite framing of the said Regulations by the 

Bank, if the employee tends to receive higher gratuity under the 

Act of 1972, the same must be paid is beyond dispute. As noted, 

as per Sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the Act of 1972, nothing in 

the said Section would effect the right of an employee to receive 

better terms of gratuity under any award or agreement or contract 

with the employer. Section 14 of the Act as noted gives overriding 

effect to the Act over other enactments. Even Regulation 72(1) 

provids that an officer or employee shall be eligible for payment of 

gratuity either as per the provisions of the Act of 1972 or as per 

Sub-regulation (2) whichever is higher. Thus, it is beyond doubt 

that an employee must receive gratuity whichever is more 

beneficial either under the Act of 1972 or under the Regulations 

framed by the bank. However, this is not the same thing as to 

suggest that an employee can choose computation of gratuity 

under one statute and seek benefits of other provisions under 

another statute. As we have noticed, the scheme of gratuity 

under the Act of 1972 and under the regulations framed by the 

bank are different. For example, the Act of 1972 prescribes the 

ceiling beyond which the gratuity would not be paid irrespective of 

the computation. There is no such ceiling prescribed under the 

regulations. However, the regulations have other inherent 

limitations in computation of gratuity such as the gratuity 

computation would not exceed 15 months' salary upto 30 years of 

service, after which an additional benefit of half month's salary 

would be added to the payable gratuity. The employee, therefore, 

can claim gratuity either under the Act of 1972 or under the 

regulations framed by the bank, but cannot claim the benefit 

under both the statutes. Though, reference to no authorities is 


(65 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

needed for this purpose, as correctly pointed out by the counsel 

for the bank, this has been held by the Supreme Court in clear 

terms in the case of Beed District Central Cooperative Bank 

Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra [(2006) 8 SCC 514]. 

25. This discussion was necessary because one of the main 

arguments of the counsel for the officers is that the term 'wages' 

as defined under the Act of 1972 should be applied while 

computing the gratuity payable to the employees concerned. The 

definition of term "wages" under this Act includes dearness 

allowance. If the employees chose to receive gratuity under the 

Act of 1972 being more beneficial, we would have no hesitation in 

accepting this contention. However, when it comes to payment of 

gratuity, their desire is that the ceiling as has been prescribed by 

the Central Government should not be applied and for such 

purpose they would resort to the regulations framed by the bank 

and in particular regulation 72 in which as noted there is no ceiling 

prescribed for payment of gratuity. In our view, this would be 

wholly impermissible. An employee can either receive gratuity as 

calculated under the Act of 1972 and in which case he must 

submit to the maximum payment of Rs.10 lacs or can claim the 

benefit under the regulations and in which case the computation 

shall have to be made as provided therein. 

26. Despite this conclusion, if under the said Regulations, the 

officers are correct in contending that the dearness allowance 

must be included for the purpose of computation of gratuity, they 

may still succeed. We may, therefore, come to the interpretation 

of regulation 72 with the aid of different definitions noted above. 

27. Sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 72 provides that every 

officer or employee shall be eligible for gratuity on retirement, 


(66 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

death, disablement or resignation after completion of 10 years of 

continuous service or termination of service in any other way 

except by way of punishment but after completion of 10 years of 

service. Sub-regulation (3) is of considerable importance and 

provides that the amount of gratuity payable to an officer or an 

employee shall be one month's pay for every completed year of 

service or part thereof in excess of six months subject to a 

maximum 15 months' pay. First proviso to Sub-regulation (3) 

provides that where an officer or an employee has completed 

more than 30 years of service, he would be eligible to gratuity for 

an additional amount at the rate of half of a month's pay for each 

completed year of service beyond 30 years. Further proviso is of 

great importance and provides that in respect of an officer the 

gratuity is payable based on the last pay drawn. In the third 

proviso to the said regulation, it is provided that in respect of an 

employee pay for the purpose of calculation of gratuity would be 

the average basic pay, dearness allowance and special allowance 

and officiating allowance payable during the 12 months preceding 

death, disability, retirement, resignation or termination of service. 

28. The regulation 72, thus, at every stage makes a clear 

distinction between an officer and an employee for computation of 

gratuity. Sub-regulation (3) makes entirely different provisions for 

both classes of persons. When it comes to officers the gratuity is 

payable on the basis of last pay drawn. In comparison in case of 

an employee, the gratuity would be calculated on the basis of 

average basic pay, dearness allowance, special allowance and 

officiating allowance payable during 12 months preceding death, 

disablement, retirement etc. 


(67 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

29. With this distinction in mind, we may refer to the definitions 

of the relevant terms. As noted, the term 'employee' is defined in 

regulation 2(j) as to mean an employee of the Bank as classified 

under Clause (b) and (c) of regulation 3(1). The term 'officer' has 

been defined in regulation 2(l) as to mean an officer of bank as 

classified under Clause (a) of sub-regulation (1) of regulation 3. 

Thus, the regulations also make a clear distinction between the 

officers and employees. 

30. The term 'pay' is defined as the basic pay drawn per month 

by officer or employee in the pay scale including stagnation 

increments and any part of the emoluments which may specifically 

be classified as pay under the regulations. The term 'salary' 

means aggregate of pay and dearness allowance. The term 

'emoluments' means the aggregate of salary and allowances. 

These terms, thus, are specifically defined and carry different 

meanings. The term 'pay' is different from salary and dearness 

allowance is excluded for the purpose of the meaning of the term 

'pay'. This is clear from the very definition of term 'pay' which 

does not refer to dearness allowance and becomes further clear 

from the fact that the term 'salary' is defined as to mean 

aggregate of pay and dearness allowance. 

31. The further proviso to sub-regulation (3) of regulation 72 

when refers to the computation of gratuity for an officer to be 

based on last pay drawn, it necessarily excludes the dearness 

component. This is clear from the interpretation and interplay of 

the terms 'pay', 'salary' and 'emoluments' noted above and it is 

further clear when we compare the computation provision for 

gratuity payable to an employee as contained in the third proviso 

to the said sub-regulation. As noted, as per this proviso when it 


(68 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

comes to an employee (in contrast to an officer) the gratuity 

would be calculated on the basis of average basic pay including 

dearness allowance and special allowance and officiating allowance 

payable during 12 months preceding death, disability, retirement, 

resignation or termination of service. These regulations leave no 

manner of doubt that when it comes to computation of gratuity 

payable to an officer of the bank, the dearness allowance would 

not form part of the pay. Any other view would be doing violance 

to the plain language used in the statute. With respect, we are 

therefore unable to accept the view point expressed by the 

Madhya Pradesh High Court. Though, the decisions of the High 

Court were carried in appeal before the Supreme Court, mere 

dismissal of the SLP would not form a precedent which would bind 

the other High Courts. 

32. Before closing, we may record that the learned Single Judge 

in the impugned judgment had referred to a communication dated 

12.08.2016 from Baroda Rajasthan Kshetriya Gramin Bank. It 

appears that the copy of the said communication was placed 

before the Court by the respondents. Contents of the 

communication are reproduced in the judgment which states that 

as per the clarification issued by the NABARD the bank had 

decided to include the dearness allowance component for the 

purpose of computation of gratuity payable to officers also. The 

learned Single Judge was of the opinion that the said bank being 

the other Gramin Bank operating in the State, the said clarification 

had considerable relevance and the petitioner-Bank could not have 

discriminated the respondents for the purpose of payment of 

gratuity. 


(69 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

33. In our opinion, this aspect has many pitfalls. To begin with, 

this communication was placed before the learned Single without 

full fledged pleadings and attendant documents. The original 

clarification allegedly issued by the NABARD does not seem to 

have been placed on record. Under what circumstances the 

Baroda Rajasthan Kshetriya Gramin Bank had taken a decision to 

include dearness allowance is not clear. Further, the counsel for 

the appellant-bank has today placed before us a communication 

dated 10.04.2018 from the NABARD to the Baroda U.P. Gramin 

Bank in which the stand taken by the NABARD is entirely different. 

It is stated that the decision of the Baroda U.P. Gramin Bank to 

include dearness allowance for the purpose of calculation of 

gratuity for the officers is not in order and against their own 

service Regulations of 2010. A copy of this communication is 

taken on record. The communication relied upon by the learned 

Single Judge was an internal communication of the Bank and did 

not contain any clarification from NABARD. 
On the contrary, as 

noted, the stand of the NABARD which is emerging from the above 

noted communication dated 10.04.2018 is totally different. We 

are not basing our conclusions on any of these documents. We 

are conscious that even this communication dated 10.04.2018 and 

documents issued by the NABARD have not been fully examined. 

We have referred to this communication only for the purpose of 

indicating that our conclusions would be based on the rules, 

regulations and statutes applicable and not on the basis of the 

stand taken by the Baroda Gramin Bank. There Isi yet another 

aspect of the matter. We have referred to the provisions of the Act 

concerning constitution of the Board of Directors of a gramin bank. 

Board of directors would include nominees of NABARD, sponsor 


(70 of 70) 

[SAW-561/2020] 

bank and the government of India. Unless the Board of Directors 

of the present bank had taken a decision to include dearness 

allowance component for computation of last pay drawn, the same 

cannot be forced upon it, which in any case is opposed to the 

Regulations framed by the bank. 

34. Since we have held the central issue in favour of the Bank, it 

is not necessary to go into the question of delay at the hands of 

the officers in approaching the competent authority, which was 

ignored without filing the applications for condonation. We may, 

however, briefly observe that the Appellate Authority and the 

learned Single Judge were correct in reversing the decision of the 

Competent Authority in relation to its interpretation on additional 

benefit payable to a retiring officer having more than 30 years of 

service. Such benefit as per the correct interpretation of the 

regulation would be additional amount calculated at the rate of 

one half month's pay for every completed year of service beyond 

30 years. This is quite besides the question whether the officers 

without filing independent writ petitions challenging the order of 

the Appellate Authority, could have agitated this issue before the 

learned Single Judge by raising it in a reply. 

35. In the result, all the appeals are allowed. Resultantly, the 

judgment of the learned Single Judge and the orders passed by 

the Controlling Authority as well as the Appellate Authority are set 

aside. If the bank has deposited any amount before this court or 

the Authorities under the Act of 1972 pursuant to the impugned 

orders and judgment, the same shall be returned to the bank.
