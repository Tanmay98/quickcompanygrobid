			<p>Mr. S.P. Sharma,<lb/> Mr. Mukesh Singh Rajpurohit, ASG,<lb/> Mr. Narpat Singh,<lb/> Mr. Om Singh,<lb/> Mr. Prakash Choudhary<lb/> HON&apos;BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. AKIL KURESHI<lb/> HON&apos;BLE MR. JUSTICE RAMESHWAR VYAS<lb/> REPORTABLE<lb/> Judgment<lb/> 05/01/2022<lb/> By the Court: (Per Akil Kureshi, CJ):<lb/> These appeals are filed by the Rajasthan Marudhara Gramin<lb/> Bank to challenge the common judgment of the learned Single<lb/> Judge dated 16.10.2020 passed in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.<lb/></p>

			<p>7359/2019 and other connected petitions. The Special Appeal<lb/> (Writ) No. 503/2020 is treated as the lead appeal. We would be<lb/> referring to the documents on record in the said appeal.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> The writ petition was filed by the bank challenging an order<lb/> dated 20.07.2020 passed by the Appellate Authority under the<lb/> Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (hereinafter to be referred to as the<lb/> &apos;Act of 1972&apos;) partly confirming the order dated 28.03.2018<lb/> passed by the Controlling Authority under the Act of 1972. The<lb/> petitioner bank is a Gramin Bank operating in the State of<lb/> Rajasthan. The respondent Kheem Singh Rathore was an officer of<lb/> the bank. He retired on superannuation w.e.f. 30.09.2016. At the<lb/> time of his retirement, the bank had paid him gratuity of<lb/> Rs.10,30,319/-. He later on approached the Controlling Authority<lb/> and disputed the amount of gratuity paid to him by the employer<lb/> bank. His grievance was that while calculating the gratuity, the<lb/> bank had not taken into account the dearness allowance<lb/> component of his pay. The bank opposed his application on the<lb/> ground that the gratuity paid to him is as per the regulations<lb/> framed by the bank. The Controlling Authority, by an order dated<lb/> 28.03.2018 allowed the application. The said authority was of the<lb/> opinion that the dearness allowance component ought to have<lb/> been taken into account while computing the last pay drawn for<lb/> the purpose of payment of gratuity. He also held that for every<lb/> completed year of service beyond 30 years, the applicant would<lb/> receive an additional gratuity at the rate of salary for one and a<lb/> half months. The bank had pointed out that for the purpose of<lb/> computing gratuity, the regulations framed make a distinction<lb/> between an officer and other employees. The Controlling Authority<lb/> was of the opinion that any such distinction would be opposed to<lb/> the equality clause under Article 14 of the Constitution.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> The bank challenged the said order of the Controlling<lb/> Authority before the Appellate Authority. The Appellate Authority<lb/> by an order dated 20.07.2020 confirmed the first portion of the<lb/> order of the Controlling Authority, namely, that for the purpose of<lb/> computing gratuity payable to the applicant concerned, dearness<lb/> allowance should be taken into account. However, with respect to<lb/> the second aspect of the matter, namely, additional weightage for<lb/> service beyond 30 years, the Appellate Authority did not accept<lb/> the view of the Controlling Authority and held that only half<lb/> month&apos;s salary for completed year of service beyond 30 years<lb/> would be payable. With this modification, the order of the<lb/> Controlling Authority was confirmed.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.<lb/> The bank challenged the said orders before the High Court.<lb/> The learned Single Judge by the impugned judgment dismissed<lb/> the bank&apos;s petition. The learned Single Judge referred to the<lb/> definition of the term &apos;wages&apos; contained in Section 2(s) of the Act<lb/> of 1972. The learned Single Judge also referred to and relied upon<lb/> the decision of the learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh<lb/> High Court in the case of All India Gramin Bank Pensioners<lb/> Organization Unit Rewa Versus Madhyanchal Gramin Bank<lb/> and another dated 06.09.2018, which was confirmed by the<lb/> Division Bench. The learned Single Judge was of the opinion that<lb/> as per the provisions of the regulations of the bank as well as the<lb/> Act of 1972, the employee would receive gratuity under either of<lb/> the statutes, whichever is higher.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.<lb/> It appears that against the order of the Appellate Authority,<lb/> which was in favour of the bank, by which the weightage for every<lb/> completed year of service beyond 30 years was brought down to<lb/> half month instead of one and a half month&apos;s salary, the applicants<lb/> had not filed any writ petition. They had instead, in the replies to<lb/> the petitions, raised this issue. The learned Single Judge examined<lb/> this aspect also and confirmed the view of the Appellate Authority.<lb/> Against the said judgment of the learned Single Judge, the bank<lb/> has filed these appeals.<lb/></p>

			<p>6.<lb/> Appearing for the bank, Mr. R.N Mathur, learned Senior<lb/> Advocate took us through relevant provisions of the Act of 1972<lb/> and the regulations framed by the bank under the Regional Rural<lb/> Banks Act, 1976 (herein after to be referred to as the &apos;Act of<lb/> 1976&apos;) and raised the following contentions:<lb/></p>

			<p>(i)<lb/> Any employee or officer of the bank can claim benefit of<lb/> gratuity payable under the regulations or under the Act of<lb/> 1972 but cannot take benefit under both sets of provisions.<lb/></p>

			<p>(ii) The language used in the regulations framed by the bank, is<lb/> clear and permit no ambiguity. There is a clear distinction<lb/> between an officer and an employee of the bank when it<lb/> comes to computation of gratuity.<lb/></p>

			<p>(iii) The applicants had accepted the gratuity paid by the bank at<lb/> the time of retirement. Long time thereafter, they filed<lb/> applications before the Controlling Authority without filing<lb/> applications for condonation of delay or independently also<lb/> explaining delay caused in filing such applications. The<lb/> Controlling Authority entertained their applications ignoring<lb/> the delay.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> On the other hand, the learned counsel for the employees<lb/> opposed the appeals on the following grounds:<lb/></p>

			<p>(i) The Act of 1972 as well as the regulations framed by the<lb/> bank for payment of gratuity are beneficial welfare<lb/> legislations. The Court should adopt liberal interpretation and<lb/> give benefit to the employee to the extent possible.<lb/></p>

			<item>(ii) The regulations of the bank have been correctly interpreted<lb/> by the authorities under the Act of 1972 and by the learned<lb/> Single Judge which requires no interference.<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii) The scope of the appeal against an order passed by the<lb/> learned Single Judge in exercise of writ jurisdiction is<lb/> extremely narrow.<lb/></item>

			<item>(iv) As per the Act of 1972, the onus is on the bank to pay<lb/> gratuity to a retiring employee at the correct rates. If there is<lb/> any lapse on the part of the bank, the employer cannot raise<lb/> the ground of limitations.<lb/></item>

			<p>(v) They also argued that the Controlling Authority had correctly<lb/> come to the conclusion that for every completed year of<lb/> service beyond 30 years, additional amount at the rate of<lb/> one and half month&apos;s salary would be payable. The Appellate<lb/> Authority and the learned Single Judge erred in reversing this<lb/> finding of the Controlling Authority.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> Both sides have referred to the decisions of various Courts<lb/> taking different views. Before referring to these judgments, we<lb/> may refer to the statutory provisions applicable. To provide for a<lb/> scheme for the payment of gratuity to employees engaged in<lb/> factories, mines, oil fields, plantations, ports, railway companies,<lb/> shops and other establishments and for matters connected there<lb/> with, the Act of 1972 was enacted. It applies to factories, mines,<lb/> oil fields, plantations, ports etc and other shops and<lb/> establishments. Clause (s) of Section 2 defines the term &apos;wages&apos;<lb/> as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;(s) &quot;wages&quot; means all emoluments which are<lb/> earned by an employee while on duty or on leave in<lb/> accordance with the terms and conditions of his<lb/> employments and which are paid or are payable to<lb/> him in cash and includes dearness allowance but<lb/> does not include any bonus, commission, house<lb/> rent allowance, overtime wages and any other<lb/> allowance.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>9.<lb/> The liability for payment of gratuity flows from Section 4.<lb/> Sub-section (1) of Section 4 provides that the gratuity shall be<lb/> payable to employees on termination of his employment after he<lb/> has rendered continuous service not less than five years (a) on his<lb/> superannuation, or (b) on his retirement or resignation, or (c) on<lb/> his death or disablement due to accident or disease. Sub-section<lb/> (3) of Section 4 provides that the amount of gratuity payable to<lb/> an employee shall not exceed such amount as may be notified by<lb/> the Central Government from time to time. It may be noted that<lb/> at the relevant time when the concerned respondents in this group<lb/> of appeals retired, the limit specified by the Central Government in<lb/> terms of Sub-section (3) of Section 4 was Rs.10 lacs. Sub-section<lb/> (5) of Section 4 provides that nothing in this Section shall effect<lb/> the right of an employee to receive better terms of gratuity under<lb/> any award or agreement or contract with the employer.<lb/></p>

			<p>10. Section 7 of the Act of 1972 pertains to determination of<lb/> amount of gratuity. As per Sub-section (4) of section 7 any<lb/> dispute regarding amount of gratuity payable to an employee<lb/> would be determined by the Controlling Authority. In terms of<lb/> Sub-section (7) of Section 7, a person aggrieved by the order<lb/> passed by the Controlling Authority has a right to file appeal<lb/> before the Appellate Authority.<lb/></p>

			<p>11. Section 14 of the Act of 1972 gives overriding effect by<lb/> providing that the provisions of the Act or any Rule made<lb/> thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent<lb/> therewith contained in any enactment other than the said Act or in<lb/> any instrument or contract having effect by virtue of any<lb/> enactment other than the said Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>12. To provide for the incorporation, regulation and winding up of<lb/> Regional Rural Banks with a view to developing the rural economy<lb/> by providing for the purpose of development of agriculture, trade,<lb/> commerce, industry and other productive activities in the rural<lb/> areas, credit and other facilities particularly to the small and<lb/> marginal farmers, agricultural labour artisans and small<lb/> entrepreneurs and matters connected therewith, the Regional<lb/> Rural Banks Act, 1976 was enacted. Section 3 of the Act of 1976<lb/> envisages establishment and incorporation of Regional Rural<lb/> Banks. Appellant bank is one such bank incorporated in terms of<lb/> Section 3. Section 8 pertains to management. As per Sub-section<lb/> (1) of Section 8, the management and superintendence would<lb/> vest in the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will be<lb/> constituted as provided under Section 9. As per Sub-section (1) of<lb/> Section 9, the Board of Directors would consist of, beside others,<lb/> two directors to be nominated by the Central Government, one,<lb/> who would be an officer of the Reserve Bank, one, who would be<lb/> an officer of the National Bank and two Directors who are officers<lb/> of the sponsor bank.<lb/></p>

			<p>13. Section 17 of the Act pertains to staff of Regional Rural Bank.<lb/> As per Sub-section (1) of Section 17, the bank may appoint such<lb/> number of officers and other employees as it may consider<lb/> necessary or desirable for the efficient performance of its<lb/> functions and may determine the terms and conditions of their<lb/> appointment and services.<lb/></p>

			<p>14. Section 29 of the Act empowers the Central Government to<lb/> frame rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act. Section 30 is<lb/> the power for framing regulations. Under Sub-section (1) of<lb/> Section 30, the Board of Directors of Regional Rural Bank would<lb/> be authorized to frame regulations after consultation with the<lb/> sponsor bank and the National Bank and with the previous<lb/> sanction of the Central Government for the purpose of giving<lb/> effect to the provisions of the Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>15. In exercise of powers under Section 30 of the Act of 1976,<lb/> the bank has framed the Rajasthan Marudhara Gramin Bank<lb/> (Officers and Employees) Service Regulations, 2010 (hereinafter<lb/> to be referred to as &apos;the said Regulations&apos;). Regulation 2 contains<lb/> definitions. We are concerned with the definitions of terms<lb/> &apos;emoluments&apos;, &apos;pay&apos;, &apos;salary&apos;, &apos;employee&apos; and &apos;officer&apos; which are<lb/> defined as under:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;(i) &quot;Emoluments&quot; means the aggregate of salary and<lb/> allowance, if any;<lb/></item>

			<item>(j) &quot;Employee&quot; means an employee of the Bank as<lb/> classified under clause (b) and (c) of sub-regulation<lb/> (1) of regulation 3, and includes such employee<lb/> whose services are lent to other organizations under<lb/> regulation 75;<lb/></item>

			<item>(l) &quot;Officer&quot; means an officer of the Bank as classified<lb/> under Clause (a) of sub-regulation (1) of regulation 3;<lb/> (m) &quot;Pay&quot; means basic pay drawn per month by the<lb/> officer or employee in a pay-scale including stagnation<lb/> increments and any part of the emoluments which<lb/> may specifically be classified as pay under these<lb/> regulations.<lb/></item>

			<item>(o) &quot;Salary&quot; means aggregate of pay and dearness<lb/> allowance.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>16. Chapter-II of the regulations pertains to classification of<lb/> officers and employees, appointment, probation and termination<lb/> of service. Regulation 3 contained in Chapter-II contains<lb/> classification of officers and employees. The officers are classified<lb/> in Clause (a) of Regulation 3 and the employees are divided in two<lb/> classes of group (b) and group (c) employees as per clause (b)<lb/> and (c) of Regulation 3.<lb/></p>

			<p>17. Chapter-VII of the Regulations contains miscellaneous<lb/> provisions. Regulation 72 contained in the said chapter, being at<lb/> the center of controversy, may be reproduced in entirety:<lb/></p>

			<item>&quot;72. Gratuity -(1) An officer or employee shall be<lb/> eligible for payment of gratuity either as per the<lb/> provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (39 of<lb/> 1972) or as per sub-regulation (2), whichever is<lb/> higher.<lb/></item>

			<item>(2) Every officer or employee shall be eligible for<lb/> gratuity on,-<lb/></item>

			<item>(a) retirement,<lb/></item>

			<item>(b) death,<lb/> (c) disablement rendering him unfit for further service<lb/> as certified by a medical officer approved by the Bank,<lb/> or<lb/> (d) resignation after completing 10 years of continuous<lb/> service,<lb/> (e) termination of service in any other way except by<lb/> way of punishment after completion of 10 years of<lb/> service;<lb/> Provided that in respect of an employee there shall be<lb/> no forfeiture of gratuity for dismissal on account of<lb/> misconduct except in cases where such misconduct<lb/> causes financial loss to the bank and in that case to<lb/> that extent only.<lb/></item>

			<item>(3) The amount of gratuity payable to an officer or<lb/> employee shall be one months pay for every completed<lb/> year of service or part thereof in excess of six months<lb/> subject to a maximum of 15 month&apos;s pay:<lb/> Provided further that in respect of an officer the<lb/> gratuity is payable based on the last pay drawn:<lb/> Provided also that in respect of an employee pay for<lb/> the purposes of calculation of the gratuity shall be the<lb/> average of the basic pay (100%), dearness allowance<lb/> and special allowance and officiating allowance payable<lb/> during the 12 months preceding death, disability,<lb/> retirement, resignation or termination of service, as<lb/> the case may be.&quot;<lb/></item>

			<p>18. An identical issue arose before the learned Single Judge of<lb/> the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of All India Gramin<lb/> Bank<lb/> Pensioners<lb/> Organization<lb/> Unit<lb/> Rewa<lb/> Versus<lb/> Madhyanchal Gramin Bank and another. By decision dated<lb/> 06.09.2018, the learned Single Judge held that the officers of the<lb/> Gramin Bank would receive gratuity by including the dearness<lb/> allowance for the purpose of determining last pay drawn. The<lb/> learned Single Judge referred to the definition of terms &apos;pay&apos;,<lb/> &apos;emoluments&apos; and &apos;salary&apos; contained in the said Regulations and<lb/> came to the conclusion that the dearness allowance is specifically<lb/> classified and must form part of pay otherwise the expression<lb/> would lead to absurdity which the Court would avoid. The decision<lb/> of the learned Single Judge was challenged before the Division<lb/> Bench. The appeal of the bank was dismissed by the judgment<lb/> dated 26.02.2019. We may record that the matter was carried out<lb/> further in appeal before the Supreme Court and the SLP was<lb/> dismissed on 07.05.2019.<lb/></p>

			<p>19. In the case of Chinmoy Majumder and others Versus<lb/> Paschim Banga Gramin Bank and others (W.P 19538(W) of<lb/> 2018), the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in<lb/> judgment dated 05.07.2019 followed the decision of Madhya<lb/> Pradesh High Court in the case of Madhyanchal Gramin Bank<lb/> (supra). However, subsequently the Division Bench of Calcutta<lb/> High Court in an appeal filed by the bank, reversed the judgment<lb/> of the learned Single Judge by judgment dated 04.02.2021. It was<lb/> held that for the purpose of the Regulation 72, there is a clear<lb/> distinction between officer and employee when it comes to<lb/> calculation of gratuity. It was held that the fact that Act of 1972<lb/> has over-riding effect, is of no relevance.<lb/></p>

			<p>20. In the case of Chattisgarh Rajya Gramin Bank Versus<lb/> Meghraj Pathak and others, the learned Single Judge of<lb/> Chattisgarh High Court in a judgment rendered on 31.08.2020 had<lb/> ruled in favour of the officers. It was observed that since the<lb/> dispute involved has already been thrashed out before the<lb/> Controlling Authority, who had deliberately discussed the<lb/> contentions of both the sides and has given an order which is<lb/> affirmed by the Appellate Authority, the scope of interference in<lb/> the judicial review was limited. This decision was carried out in<lb/> appeal by the bank before the Division Bench. The Division Bench<lb/> by judgment dated 28.01.2021 reversed the judgment of the<lb/> learned Single Judge. This was on the basis of interpretation<lb/> adopted by the Division Bench of various terms defined in the<lb/> Regulations and the provisions contained in Regulation 72.<lb/></p>

			<p>21. Learned Single Judge of Gauhati High Court in the case of<lb/> Assam Gramin Vikash Bank and another Versus The Union<lb/> of India and others has held the issue in favour of the<lb/> employee. The decision was also confirmed by the Division Bench.<lb/></p>

			<p>22. To complete the narration, we may record that the learned<lb/> Single Judge of Bombay High Court in the case of Vidarbha<lb/> Konkan Gramin Bank Versus The Appellate Authority has<lb/> held that for the purpose of computing gratuity under the<lb/> Regulations for an officer only pay would be made the basis<lb/> without including the dearness allowance.<lb/></p>

			<p>23. It can thus be seen that there is a clear divide between the<lb/> judicial opinions across the country. We would have due regard to<lb/> the different view points, analysis and interpretations adopted by<lb/> different Courts in the process of taking our own view in the<lb/> matter. A brief comparison of the computation provisions under<lb/> the Act of 1972 and the regulations would show that under the Act<lb/> of 1972, the gratuity is payable at the rate of 15 days of wages for<lb/> every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six<lb/> months. This however comes with the ceiling, as may be provided<lb/> by the Central Government from time to time, which at the<lb/> relevant time was Rs.10 lacs. As against this, in terms of<lb/> Regulation 72(3), the gratuity would be payable at the rate of one<lb/> month pay for every completed year of service or part thereof in<lb/> excess of six months. This would be subject to maximum of 15<lb/> months&apos; pay. As per the proviso, for every completed year of<lb/> service beyond 30 years, an additional amount at the rate of one<lb/> half of month&apos;s pay would be paid. Significantly, there is no upper<lb/> limit of gratuity that my be paid under Regulation 72.<lb/></p>

			<p>24. The fact that despite framing of the said Regulations by the<lb/> Bank, if the employee tends to receive higher gratuity under the<lb/> Act of 1972, the same must be paid is beyond dispute. As noted,<lb/> as per Sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the Act of 1972, nothing in<lb/> the said Section would effect the right of an employee to receive<lb/> better terms of gratuity under any award or agreement or contract<lb/> with the employer. Section 14 of the Act as noted gives overriding<lb/> effect to the Act over other enactments. Even Regulation 72(1)<lb/> provids that an officer or employee shall be eligible for payment of<lb/> gratuity either as per the provisions of the Act of 1972 or as per<lb/> Sub-regulation (2) whichever is higher. Thus, it is beyond doubt<lb/> that an employee must receive gratuity whichever is more<lb/> beneficial either under the Act of 1972 or under the Regulations<lb/> framed by the bank. However, this is not the same thing as to<lb/> suggest that an employee can choose computation of gratuity<lb/> under one statute and seek benefits of other provisions under<lb/> another statute. As we have noticed, the scheme of gratuity<lb/> under the Act of 1972 and under the regulations framed by the<lb/> bank are different. For example, the Act of 1972 prescribes the<lb/> ceiling beyond which the gratuity would not be paid irrespective of<lb/> the computation. There is no such ceiling prescribed under the<lb/> regulations. However, the regulations have other inherent<lb/> limitations in computation of gratuity such as the gratuity<lb/> computation would not exceed 15 months&apos; salary upto 30 years of<lb/> service, after which an additional benefit of half month&apos;s salary<lb/> would be added to the payable gratuity. The employee, therefore,<lb/> can claim gratuity either under the Act of 1972 or under the<lb/> regulations framed by the bank, but cannot claim the benefit<lb/> under both the statutes. Though, reference to no authorities is<lb/> (65 of 70)<lb/> [SAW-561/2020]<lb/> needed for this purpose, as correctly pointed out by the counsel<lb/> for the bank, this has been held by the Supreme Court in clear<lb/> terms in the case of Beed District Central Cooperative Bank<lb/> Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra [(2006) 8 SCC 514].<lb/></p>

			<p>25. This discussion was necessary because one of the main<lb/> arguments of the counsel for the officers is that the term &apos;wages&apos;<lb/> as defined under the Act of 1972 should be applied while<lb/> computing the gratuity payable to the employees concerned. The<lb/> definition of term &quot;wages&quot; under this Act includes dearness<lb/> allowance. If the employees chose to receive gratuity under the<lb/> Act of 1972 being more beneficial, we would have no hesitation in<lb/> accepting this contention. However, when it comes to payment of<lb/> gratuity, their desire is that the ceiling as has been prescribed by<lb/> the Central Government should not be applied and for such<lb/> purpose they would resort to the regulations framed by the bank<lb/> and in particular regulation 72 in which as noted there is no ceiling<lb/> prescribed for payment of gratuity. In our view, this would be<lb/> wholly impermissible. An employee can either receive gratuity as<lb/> calculated under the Act of 1972 and in which case he must<lb/> submit to the maximum payment of Rs.10 lacs or can claim the<lb/> benefit under the regulations and in which case the computation<lb/> shall have to be made as provided therein.<lb/></p>

			<p>26. Despite this conclusion, if under the said Regulations, the<lb/> officers are correct in contending that the dearness allowance<lb/> must be included for the purpose of computation of gratuity, they<lb/> may still succeed. We may, therefore, come to the interpretation<lb/> of regulation 72 with the aid of different definitions noted above.<lb/></p>

			<p>27. Sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 72 provides that every<lb/> officer or employee shall be eligible for gratuity on retirement,<lb/> death, disablement or resignation after completion of 10 years of<lb/> continuous service or termination of service in any other way<lb/> except by way of punishment but after completion of 10 years of<lb/> service. Sub-regulation (3) is of considerable importance and<lb/> provides that the amount of gratuity payable to an officer or an<lb/> employee shall be one month&apos;s pay for every completed year of<lb/> service or part thereof in excess of six months subject to a<lb/> maximum 15 months&apos; pay. First proviso to Sub-regulation (3)<lb/> provides that where an officer or an employee has completed<lb/> more than 30 years of service, he would be eligible to gratuity for<lb/> an additional amount at the rate of half of a month&apos;s pay for each<lb/> completed year of service beyond 30 years. Further proviso is of<lb/> great importance and provides that in respect of an officer the<lb/> gratuity is payable based on the last pay drawn. In the third<lb/> proviso to the said regulation, it is provided that in respect of an<lb/> employee pay for the purpose of calculation of gratuity would be<lb/> the average basic pay, dearness allowance and special allowance<lb/> and officiating allowance payable during the 12 months preceding<lb/> death, disability, retirement, resignation or termination of service.<lb/></p>

			<p>28. The regulation 72, thus, at every stage makes a clear<lb/> distinction between an officer and an employee for computation of<lb/> gratuity. Sub-regulation (3) makes entirely different provisions for<lb/> both classes of persons. When it comes to officers the gratuity is<lb/> payable on the basis of last pay drawn. In comparison in case of<lb/> an employee, the gratuity would be calculated on the basis of<lb/> average basic pay, dearness allowance, special allowance and<lb/> officiating allowance payable during 12 months preceding death,<lb/> disablement, retirement etc.<lb/></p>

			<p>29. With this distinction in mind, we may refer to the definitions<lb/> of the relevant terms. As noted, the term &apos;employee&apos; is defined in<lb/> regulation 2(j) as to mean an employee of the Bank as classified<lb/> under Clause (b) and (c) of regulation 3(1). The term &apos;officer&apos; has<lb/> been defined in regulation 2(l) as to mean an officer of bank as<lb/> classified under Clause (a) of sub-regulation (1) of regulation 3.<lb/> Thus, the regulations also make a clear distinction between the<lb/> officers and employees.<lb/></p>

			<p>30. The term &apos;pay&apos; is defined as the basic pay drawn per month<lb/> by officer or employee in the pay scale including stagnation<lb/> increments and any part of the emoluments which may specifically<lb/> be classified as pay under the regulations. The term &apos;salary&apos;<lb/> means aggregate of pay and dearness allowance. The term<lb/> &apos;emoluments&apos; means the aggregate of salary and allowances.<lb/> These terms, thus, are specifically defined and carry different<lb/> meanings. The term &apos;pay&apos; is different from salary and dearness<lb/> allowance is excluded for the purpose of the meaning of the term<lb/> &apos;pay&apos;. This is clear from the very definition of term &apos;pay&apos; which<lb/> does not refer to dearness allowance and becomes further clear<lb/> from the fact that the term &apos;salary&apos; is defined as to mean<lb/> aggregate of pay and dearness allowance.<lb/></p>

			<p>31. The further proviso to sub-regulation (3) of regulation 72<lb/> when refers to the computation of gratuity for an officer to be<lb/> based on last pay drawn, it necessarily excludes the dearness<lb/> component. This is clear from the interpretation and interplay of<lb/> the terms &apos;pay&apos;, &apos;salary&apos; and &apos;emoluments&apos; noted above and it is<lb/> further clear when we compare the computation provision for<lb/> gratuity payable to an employee as contained in the third proviso<lb/> to the said sub-regulation. As noted, as per this proviso when it<lb/> comes to an employee (in contrast to an officer) the gratuity<lb/> would be calculated on the basis of average basic pay including<lb/> dearness allowance and special allowance and officiating allowance<lb/> payable during 12 months preceding death, disability, retirement,<lb/> resignation or termination of service. These regulations leave no<lb/> manner of doubt that when it comes to computation of gratuity<lb/> payable to an officer of the bank, the dearness allowance would<lb/> not form part of the pay. Any other view would be doing violance<lb/> to the plain language used in the statute. With respect, we are<lb/> therefore unable to accept the view point expressed by the<lb/> Madhya Pradesh High Court. Though, the decisions of the High<lb/> Court were carried in appeal before the Supreme Court, mere<lb/> dismissal of the SLP would not form a precedent which would bind<lb/> the other High Courts.<lb/></p>

			<p>32. Before closing, we may record that the learned Single Judge<lb/> in the impugned judgment had referred to a communication dated<lb/> 12.08.2016 from Baroda Rajasthan Kshetriya Gramin Bank. It<lb/> appears that the copy of the said communication was placed<lb/> before the Court by the respondents. Contents of the<lb/> communication are reproduced in the judgment which states that<lb/> as per the clarification issued by the NABARD the bank had<lb/> decided to include the dearness allowance component for the<lb/> purpose of computation of gratuity payable to officers also. The<lb/> learned Single Judge was of the opinion that the said bank being<lb/> the other Gramin Bank operating in the State, the said clarification<lb/> had considerable relevance and the petitioner-Bank could not have<lb/> discriminated the respondents for the purpose of payment of<lb/> gratuity.<lb/></p>

			<p>33. In our opinion, this aspect has many pitfalls. To begin with,<lb/> this communication was placed before the learned Single without<lb/> full fledged pleadings and attendant documents. The original<lb/> clarification allegedly issued by the NABARD does not seem to<lb/> have been placed on record. Under what circumstances the<lb/> Baroda Rajasthan Kshetriya Gramin Bank had taken a decision to<lb/> include dearness allowance is not clear. Further, the counsel for<lb/> the appellant-bank has today placed before us a communication<lb/> dated 10.04.2018 from the NABARD to the Baroda U.P. Gramin<lb/> Bank in which the stand taken by the NABARD is entirely different.<lb/> It is stated that the decision of the Baroda U.P. Gramin Bank to<lb/> include dearness allowance for the purpose of calculation of<lb/> gratuity for the officers is not in order and against their own<lb/> service Regulations of 2010. A copy of this communication is<lb/> taken on record. The communication relied upon by the learned<lb/> Single Judge was an internal communication of the Bank and did<lb/> not contain any clarification from NABARD.<lb/> On the contrary, as<lb/> noted, the stand of the NABARD which is emerging from the above<lb/> noted communication dated 10.04.2018 is totally different. We<lb/> are not basing our conclusions on any of these documents. We<lb/> are conscious that even this communication dated 10.04.2018 and<lb/> documents issued by the NABARD have not been fully examined.<lb/> We have referred to this communication only for the purpose of<lb/> indicating that our conclusions would be based on the rules,<lb/> regulations and statutes applicable and not on the basis of the<lb/> stand taken by the Baroda Gramin Bank. There Isi yet another<lb/> aspect of the matter. We have referred to the provisions of the Act<lb/> concerning constitution of the Board of Directors of a gramin bank.<lb/> Board of directors would include nominees of NABARD, sponsor<lb/> bank and the government of India. Unless the Board of Directors<lb/> of the present bank had taken a decision to include dearness<lb/> allowance component for computation of last pay drawn, the same<lb/> cannot be forced upon it, which in any case is opposed to the<lb/> Regulations framed by the bank.<lb/></p>

			<p>34. Since we have held the central issue in favour of the Bank, it<lb/> is not necessary to go into the question of delay at the hands of<lb/> the officers in approaching the competent authority, which was<lb/> ignored without filing the applications for condonation. We may,<lb/> however, briefly observe that the Appellate Authority and the<lb/> learned Single Judge were correct in reversing the decision of the<lb/> Competent Authority in relation to its interpretation on additional<lb/> benefit payable to a retiring officer having more than 30 years of<lb/> service. Such benefit as per the correct interpretation of the<lb/> regulation would be additional amount calculated at the rate of<lb/> one half month&apos;s pay for every completed year of service beyond<lb/> 30 years. This is quite besides the question whether the officers<lb/> without filing independent writ petitions challenging the order of<lb/> the Appellate Authority, could have agitated this issue before the<lb/> learned Single Judge by raising it in a reply.<lb/></p>

			<p>35. In the result, all the appeals are allowed. Resultantly, the<lb/> judgment of the learned Single Judge and the orders passed by<lb/> the Controlling Authority as well as the Appellate Authority are set<lb/> aside. If the bank has deposited any amount before this court or<lb/> the Authorities under the Act of 1972 pursuant to the impugned<lb/> orders and judgment, the same shall be returned to the bank.<lb/></p>
