Civil Writ <lb/>Petition No.6587/2021 filed by Mukesh Kumar Royal and others <lb/>and connected petitions call in question the vires of the <lb/>notification dated 28.06.2018 issued by the National Council for <lb/>Teacher Education (&apos;NCTE&apos;, for short), by which the B.Ed. degree <lb/>holders, subject to certain conditions, are made eligible for <lb/>appointment to the post of primary school teacher grade-III <lb/>(level-1) (classes-I to V), along with other qualifications already <lb/>prescribed under its notification dated 23.08.2010 as amended <lb/>from time to time. The writ petition No.2108/2021 filed by Sunita <lb/>and other connected petitions are filed by the B.Ed. degree <lb/>holders. They support the notification dated 28.06.2018 and have <lb/>challenged the advertisement issued by the Board of Secondary <lb/>Education, State of Rajasthan inviting applications for Rajasthan <lb/>Eligibility Entrance Test (&apos;REET&apos;, for short) (level-1) in which the <lb/>B.Ed. degree holders are excluded. <lb/>3. <lb/>In brief, the controversy revolves around the question <lb/>whether the NCTE had correctly and legally included B.Ed. as <lb/>essential qualification for eligibility for appointment to the post of <lb/></body>

			<body>primary school teacher (level-I). The petitioner Mukesh Kumar <lb/>Royal and others were qualified as per the unamended <lb/>notification. <lb/>They possess the basic educational qualification <lb/>(Higher Secondary Examination pass) and the certificate of <lb/>Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed.) pass. They argue that <lb/>B.Ed. course per se cannot be stated to be a higher qualification. <lb/>According to them even the Ministry of HRD and NCTE have <lb/>viewed the situation in this manner. It is, therefore, that while <lb/>including B.Ed. degree as one of the eligibility criteria, the <lb/>notification dated 28.06.2018 provides that such a candidate upon <lb/>appointment shall have to pass a bridge course of six months <lb/>within two years of the appointment. Counter petitioners Sunita <lb/>and others contend that this amendment is proper and legal and <lb/>the state government had no authority to ignore this additional <lb/>qualification prescribed by NCTE while declaring the REET. It is a <lb/>common ground that REET result is the source for appointment for <lb/>the primary teachers in the State. <lb/>4. <lb/>In order to appreciate the controversy, we may note in brief <lb/>the factual background as well as the statutory framework. Article <lb/>21A was inserted in the Constitution by Constitution (Eighty-sixth <lb/>Amendment) Act, 2002 with effect from 01.04.2010 which <lb/>provides that the State shall provide free and compulsory <lb/>education to all children of the age of 6 to 14 years in such <lb/>manner as the State may, by law, determine. Long before the <lb/>amendment of the Constitution and insertion of Article 21A, the <lb/>right to primary education was recognized as a fundamental right <lb/>being part of Article 21 by the Supreme court in the cases of <lb/>Mohini Jain vs. State of Karnataka [(1992) 3 SCC 666] and <lb/>in the case of Unni Krishnan J.P. vs. State of Andhra Pradesh <lb/></body>

			<page>(134 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>[(1993) 1 SCC 645]. With the insertion of Article 21A, this right <lb/>was recognized as an independent fundamental right in the <lb/>Constitution. To operationalise this valuable right, the Parliament <lb/>framed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education <lb/>Act, 2009 (&apos;RTE Act&apos;, for short). The term &apos;school&apos; has been <lb/>defined in Section 2(n) as to mean any recognized school <lb/>imparting elementary education and would include the schools <lb/>established, owned or controlled by the appropriate Government <lb/>or a local authority, schools receiving aid and even unaided <lb/>schools. Clause (g) of Section 8 of the RTE Act, pertaining to <lb/>duties of appropriate Government, requires that the appropriate <lb/>Government shall ensure good quality elementary education <lb/>conforming to the standards and norms specified in the Schedule. <lb/>Section 18 requires compulsory recognition of all schools. Section <lb/>19 of the RTE Act pertains to norms and standards for school. <lb/>Sub-section (1) of Section 19 provides that no school shall be <lb/>established or recognized under Section 18, unless it fulfills the <lb/>norms and standards specified in the Schedule. The Schedule lists <lb/>norms and standards for the schools imparting education for the <lb/>classes-I to V. There are different prescriptions for the number of <lb/>teachers for this section as compared to classes-VI to VIII. <lb/>5. <lb/>Section 23 of the RTE Act, which is of considerable <lb/>importance pertains to qualifications for appointment and terms <lb/>and conditions of service of teachers and reads as under: <lb/>&quot;23. Qualifications for appointment and terms and <lb/>conditions of service of teachers-<lb/>(1) Any person possessing such minimum qualifications, <lb/>as laid down by an academic authority, authorised by <lb/>the Central Government, by notification, shall be <lb/>eligible for appointment as a teacher. <lb/></body>

			<page>(135 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>(2) Where a State does not have adequate institutions <lb/>offering courses or training in teacher education, or <lb/>teachers possessing minimum qualifications as laid <lb/>down under sub-section (1) are not available in <lb/>sufficient numbers, the Central Government may, if it <lb/>deems necessary, by notification, relax the minimum <lb/>qualifications required for appointment as a teacher, for <lb/>such period, not exceeding five years, as may be <lb/>specified in that notification: <lb/>Provided <lb/>that <lb/>a <lb/>teacher <lb/>who, <lb/>at <lb/>the <lb/>commencement of this Act, does not possess minimum <lb/>qualifications as laid down under sub-section (1), shall <lb/>acquire such minimum qualifications within a period of <lb/>five years: <lb/>[Provided further that every teacher appointed or <lb/>in position as on the 31st March, 2015, who does not <lb/>possess minimum qualifications as laid down under sub-<lb/>section (1), shall acquire such minimum qualifications <lb/>within a period of four years from the date of <lb/>commencement of the Right of Children to Free and <lb/>Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act, 2017.] <lb/>(3) The salary and allowances payable to, and the <lb/>terms and conditions of service of, teachers shall be <lb/>such as may be prescribed.&quot; <lb/>6. <lb/>As per Sub-section (1) of Section 23, thus a person <lb/>possessing such minimum qualifications as laid down by an <lb/>academic authority authorised by the Central Government shall be <lb/>eligible for appointment as a teacher. Sub-section (2) of Section <lb/>23, empowers the Central Government to relax such minimum <lb/>qualifications under certain circumstances subject to conditions. <lb/>We would make a detailed reference to this Section at a later <lb/>stage. <lb/>7. <lb/>Chapter-V of the RTE Act pertains to curriculum and <lb/>completion of elementary education. Section 29 contained in the <lb/>said part pertains to curriculum and evaluation procedure, and it <lb/>reads as under: <lb/>&quot;29. Curriculum and evaluation procedure.-(1) <lb/>The curriculum and the evaluation procedure for <lb/>elementary education shall be laid down by an <lb/>academic authority to be specified by the appropriate <lb/>Government, by notification. <lb/></body>

			<page>(136 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>(2) The academic authority, while laying down the <lb/>curriculum and the evaluation procedure under <lb/>sub-section (1), shall take into consideration the <lb/>following, namely:-<lb/>(a) conformity with the values enshrined in the <lb/>Constitution; <lb/>(b) all round development of the child; <lb/>(c) building up child&apos;s knowledge, potentiality and <lb/>talent; <lb/>(d) development of physical and mental abilities to <lb/>the fullest extent; <lb/>(e) learning through activities, discovery and <lb/>exploration in a child friendly and child-centered <lb/>manner; <lb/>(f) medium of instructions shall, as far as <lb/>practicable, be in child&apos;s mother tongue; <lb/>(g) making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety <lb/>and helping the child to express views <lb/>freely; <lb/>(h) comprehensive and continuous evaluation of <lb/>child&apos;s understanding of knowledge and his or her <lb/>ability to apply the same.&quot; <lb/>8. <lb/>Last section to be noted from the RTE Act is Section 35 <lb/>contained in Chapter-VII of Miscellaneous provisions and reads <lb/>under: <lb/>&quot;35. Power to issue directions.-(1) The Central <lb/>Government may issue such guidelines to the <lb/>appropriate Government or, as the case may be, the <lb/>local authority, as it deems fit for the purposes of <lb/>implementation of the provisions of this Act. <lb/>(2) The appropriate Government may issue guidelines <lb/>and give such directions, as it deems fit, to the <lb/>local authority or the School Management Committee <lb/>regarding implementation of the provisions of this <lb/>Act. <lb/>(3) The local authority may issue guidelines and give <lb/>such directions, as it deems fit, to the School <lb/>Management Committee regarding implementation of <lb/>the provisions of this Act.&quot; <lb/>9. <lb/>Sub-section (1) of Section 35 of the RTE Act, as noted <lb/>above, empowers the Central Government to issue such guidelines <lb/>to appropriate Government or the local authority, as it deems fit <lb/>for the purpose of implementation of the provisions of the Act. <lb/>Under Sub-section (2) of Section 35, the appropriate Government <lb/></body>

			<page>(137 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>may issue guidelines and give directions, as it deems fit, to the <lb/>local authority or the school management committee regarding <lb/>implementation of the provisions of this Act. Under Sub-section <lb/>(3) of Section 35, the local authority may issue such guidelines <lb/>and directions as it deems fit to the school management <lb/>committee. <lb/>10. It is not in dispute that the Central Government has notified <lb/>the NCTE as the &apos;academic authority&apos; for the purposes of Sub-<lb/>section (1) of Section 23 as well as Sub-section (1) of Section 29 <lb/>of the RTE Act. In terms of Sub-section (1) of Section 23, thus, it <lb/>is the NCTE which has the authority to prescribe the minimum <lb/>eligibility qualifications for appointment as a teacher. Likewise, <lb/>the NCTE is authorised in terms of Sub-section (1) of Section 29 <lb/>to lay down the curriculum and evaluation procedure for <lb/>elementary education. It may be noted that the NCTE has been <lb/>constituted under the National Council for Teacher Education Act, <lb/>1993 (&apos;NCTE ACT&apos;, for short). In its original form, the preamble to <lb/>the NCTE Act provided that it was an Act to provide for <lb/>establishment of NCTE with a view to achieving planned and co-<lb/>ordinated development of the teacher education system <lb/>throughout the country, the regulations and proper maintenance <lb/>of norms and standards in the teacher education system and for <lb/>matters connected therewith. By Amendment Act 18 of 2011 with <lb/>effect from 01.06.2012 the words &quot;including qualifications of <lb/>school teachers&quot; were inserted in the preamble. <lb/>Similar <lb/>amendments were made in the Act and the applicability of the Act <lb/>as provided in Sub-section (4) of Section 1 of the NCTE Act, was <lb/>expanded to schools imparting pre-primary, primary, upper <lb/>primary education. The functions of the NCTE as contained in <lb/></body>

			<page>(138 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>Section 12 were expanded to include laying down of guidelines in <lb/>respect of minimum qualifications for a persons to be employed as <lb/>a teacher in recognized institutions. Section 12A was inserted <lb/>with effect from 01.06.2012, which provides that for the purpose <lb/>of maintaining standards of education in schools, the NCTE may, <lb/>by regulations, determine the qualifications of persons for being <lb/>recruited as teachers in any pre-primary, primary, upper primary, <lb/>secondary, senior secondary or intermediate school or college, by <lb/>whatever names called, established, run, aided or recognised by <lb/>the Central Government or a State Government or a local <lb/>authority or other authority. First proviso, while protecting the <lb/>existing teachers, was subject to further proviso, which provides <lb/>that the minimum qualifications of a teacher shall be acquired <lb/>within the period specified in the NCTE Act or under the RTE Act. <lb/>11. Section 29 of the NCTE Act pertains to directions by the <lb/>Central Government. Sub-section (1) of Section 29 provides that <lb/>the NCTE shall, in the discharge of its functions and duties under <lb/>this Act, be bound by such directions on questions of policy as the <lb/>Central Government may give in writing to it from time to time. <lb/>Sub-section (2) of Section 29 provides that the decision of the <lb/>Central Government as to whether a question is one of policy or <lb/>not shall be final. <lb/>12. Section 32 of the NCTE Act gives power to the NCTE to frame <lb/>regulations. As per Sub-section (1) of Section 32, the NCTE may, <lb/>by notification in the Official Gazette, make regulations not <lb/>inconsistent with the provisions of this Act and the rules made <lb/>thereunder, generally to carry out the provisions of this Act. Sub-<lb/>section (2) of Section 32 which provides that in particular, and <lb/>without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such <lb/></body>

			<page>(139 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>regulations may provide for all or any of the following matters, <lb/>namely those contained in various sub-clauses of the said Sub-<lb/>section, which was amended by insertion of Clause (dd) pertaining <lb/>to the minimum qualifications of teachers under Section 12A. <lb/>13. Section 33 of the NCTE Act requires the rules and regulations <lb/>framed by the NCTE to be laid before the Parliament, which reads <lb/>as under: <lb/>&quot;33. Rules and regulations to be laid before <lb/>Parliament.-Every rule and every regulation made <lb/>under this Act shall be laid, as soon as may be after it <lb/>is made, before each House of Parliament, while it <lb/>is in session, for a total period of thirty days which <lb/>may be comprised in one session or in two or more <lb/>successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of the <lb/>session immediately following the session or the <lb/>successive sessions aforesaid, both House agree in <lb/>making any modification in the rule or regulation, or <lb/>both House agree that the rule or regulation should <lb/>not be made, the rule or regulation shall thereafter <lb/>have effect only in such modified form or be of no <lb/>effect, as the case may be; so, however, that any such <lb/>modification or annulment shall be without prejudice <lb/>to the validity of anything previously done under <lb/>that rule or regulation.&quot; <lb/>14. The NCTE in exercise of powers under Sub-section (1) of <lb/>Section 23 of the RTE Act had issued a notification dated <lb/>23.08.2010 prescribing minimum qualifications for a person to be <lb/>eligible for appointment as teacher in classes-I to VIII in a school <lb/>referred to in Clause (n) of Section 2 of the RTE Act. Clause (1) of <lb/>this notification pertains to minimum qualifications. Sub-clause (i) <lb/>prescribed minimum qualifications classes-I to V. This recognized <lb/>persons with senior secondary or equivalent with diploma in <lb/>elementary education (which is, as noted, is called D.El.Ed.) by <lb/>whatever name called or senior secondary passed with prescribed <lb/>percentage and 4 years Bachelor of Elementary Education and 2 <lb/>year Diploma in Education as qualified for appointment provided <lb/></body>

			<page>(140 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>they possess Teacher Eligibility Test passed certificate as <lb/>conducted in accordance with the guidelines framed by the NCTE. <lb/>In contrast, for classes-VI to VIII, as per this notification a <lb/>candidate must possess degree in B.A. or B.Sc. with Diploma in <lb/>Elementary Education or such degree with minimum 50% marks <lb/>with one year B.Ed. course and such similar qualifications. <lb/>15. The notification dated 23.08.2010 was amended by the NCTE <lb/>vide notification dated 29.07.2011. Certain modifications were <lb/>made in the essential qualifications for appointment of a teacher <lb/>for classes-I to V as well as classes-VI to VIII. We are not directly <lb/>concerned with these changes brought about by the subsequent <lb/>notification dated 29.07.2011. The entire controversy revolves <lb/>around the notification dated 28.06.2018 issued by NCTE making <lb/>certain amendments in the earlier notification dated 23.08.2010, <lb/>as amended vide notification dated 29.07.2011. <lb/>Since this <lb/>notification is at the center of controversy, we may reproduce the <lb/>same in its entirety: <lb/>&quot;NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR TEACHER EDUCATION <lb/>NOTIFICATION <lb/>New Delhi, the 28 th June, 2018 <lb/>F. No. NCTE-Regl 012/16/2018-In exercise of <lb/>the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 23 <lb/>of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education <lb/>Act. 2009 (35 of 2009) and in pursuance of notification <lb/>number S.O. 750(E), dated the 31 st March, 2010 <lb/>issued by the Department of School Education and <lb/>Literacy, Ministry of Human Resource Development, <lb/>Government of India, the National Council for Teacher <lb/>Education (NCTE) hereby makes the following further <lb/>amendments to the notification number F.N. 61-<lb/>03/20/2010/NCTE/(N&amp;S), dated the 23 rd August, 2010 <lb/>published in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, Part <lb/>III, Section 4, dated the 25 th August, 2010, hereinafter <lb/>referred to as the said notification namely:-<lb/>(1) In the said notification, in para 1 in sub-para (i), <lb/>in clause (a) after the words and brackets &quot;Graduation <lb/>and two year Diploma in Elementary Education (by <lb/></body>

			<page>(141 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>whatever name known), the following shall be <lb/>inserted, namely:-<lb/>OR <lb/>&quot;Graduation with at least 50% marks and <lb/>Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.)&quot; <lb/>2. In the said notification in para 3, for sub-para(a), <lb/>the following sub-para shall be substituted namely:-<lb/>&quot;(a) who has acquired the qualification of <lb/>Bachelor of Education from any NCTE recognized <lb/>institution shall be considered for appointment <lb/>as a teacher in classes I to V provided the person <lb/>so appointed as a teacher shall mandatorily <lb/>undergo a six month Bridge Course in Elementary <lb/>Education recognized by the NCTE, within two <lb/>years of such appointment as primary teacher.&quot; <lb/>SANJAY AWASTHI, Member Secy.&quot; <lb/>(emphasis supplied by us) <lb/>16. The petitioners, who are opponents of this notification <lb/>particularly in the case of Mukesh Kumar Royal and others sought <lb/>information from the NCTE and Ministry of Human Resources <lb/>Development under the Right to Information Act, 2005 (&apos;RTI Act&apos;, <lb/>for short) as to the manner in which the decision to make <lb/>amendments in the eligibility criteria was arrived at by NCTE. <lb/>Through this process, they have brought on record certain <lb/>documents and information, which need to be noted. It appears <lb/>that on 30.05.2018 the Ministry of HRD had written to NCTE <lb/>requiring the NCTE to amend the eligibility criteria for primary <lb/>school teacher in classes-I to V as to include any person, who has <lb/>acquired qualification of B.Ed. from a recognized institute provided <lb/>the person so appointed shall compulsorily undergo a six month <lb/>bridge course, which may be recognized by NCTE and such course <lb/>would have to be completed within two years of appointment. This <lb/>communication is also being challenged by the petitioners. It <lb/>would be useful to take note of the contents thereof: <lb/>&quot;F.No. 11-15/2017-EE10-part(1) <lb/>Government of India <lb/>Ministry of School Education &amp; Liferary <lb/>Shahstri Bhawan, New Delhi, <lb/></body>

			<page>(142 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>Dated the 30 th May 2018 <lb/>To, <lb/>The Chairperson NCTE, <lb/>Haris Bhawan, <lb/>Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, <lb/>New Delhi-110002 <lb/>Dear Madam <lb/>Kindly refer to the letter of even no dated <lb/>12.04.2018 regarding request of Kendriya Vidayalaya <lb/>Sangathan for recruiting primary teachers with higher <lb/>qualification i.e. B.A./B.Sc. B.ed. Plus TET pass and <lb/>letter no. NCTE-REG1012/16/2018-IJS (Regulation)-HQ <lb/>dated 23.05.2018 received from NCTE regarding the <lb/>same. <lb/>2. <lb/>The above request has been considered in the <lb/>ministry, to order to safeguard the interest of the <lb/>students and ensure the quality of education, the <lb/>competent authority has decided to agree to the request <lb/>of KVS to recruit Primary Teacher with Higher <lb/>Qualification. The insufficient number of eligible D.EI.Ed. <lb/>candidates due to tow pass percentage of TET <lb/>examination has also become as issue for recruitment of <lb/>primary teacher. Further, with the roll out of four year <lb/>B.Ed. Integrated course from next academic year, the <lb/>existing D.EI.E.D./B.Ed. Course will be phased out is <lb/>due course of time. <lb/>3. <lb/>NCTE <lb/>vide <lb/>their <lb/>letter <lb/>No. <lb/>NCTE-<lb/>REG1012/16/2018-IJS <lb/>(Regulation)-HQ <lb/>dated <lb/>23.05.2018 stated that the MHRD may consider <lb/>implementing the directions in the detailed noting of <lb/>Hon&apos;ble Minister of Human Resource Development <lb/>Government of India. Further in view of the fact <lb/>presented by the commissioner, KV and since the NCTE <lb/>did not have any objection to permit KV schools to <lb/>recruit primary teachers with higher qualifications, then <lb/>there should be no objection to standing the to other <lb/>schools. Therefore considering the powers vested <lb/>in MHRD Under Section 29 of the NCTE Act 1993. <lb/>The NCTE regulation 25.08.2010 (determining of <lb/>teacher to be appointed at primary level class 1 st <lb/>to 5 th ) shall be amended to include that any <lb/>person who has acquired the qualification of <lb/>B./Ed. from any NCTE recognised course will also <lb/>be considered for appointment as a teacher in <lb/>classes 1 st to 5 th provided the person so appointed <lb/>as a teacher shall mandatory undergo a 6 month <lb/>bridge course, which is recognised by NCTE, <lb/>within two years of such appointment as primary <lb/>teacher. <lb/>4. <lb/>It is therefore requested that the draft qualification <lb/>to amend the NCTE regulation may please be submitted <lb/>to this Ministry. This may please be treated as most <lb/>urgent. <lb/></body>

			<body>With regards. <lb/>Yours sincerely <lb/>Sd/-<lb/>(Bashi Sharma) <lb/>Director (TE)&quot; <lb/>(emphasis supplied by us) <lb/>17. The petitioner Mukesh Kumar Royal had raised certain <lb/>queries under the RTI Act, which were replied on 23.03.2021, in <lb/>which it was provided that the bridge course had till then not been <lb/>designed, however, a committee had been constituted to develop <lb/>the norms and standards for six months bridge course and the <lb/>report was awaited. <lb/>18. Again through the means of RTI, the petitioners sought <lb/>further information regarding deliberations, which took place <lb/>before the impugned amendments were notified. Along with an <lb/>order dated 28.10.2020 the appellate authority under the RTI Act <lb/>provided certain internal documents, one of them was the minutes <lb/>of the meeting dated 09.04.2018 of the officials of MHRD, <lb/>according to which, the Kendriya Vidhyala Sangathan had <lb/>informed the Ministry that up to the year 2011-2012 candidates <lb/>having professional qualification of B.Ed. were also eligible for <lb/>appointment in K.V.S. schools. However, from the year 2012-<lb/>2013, in compliance with the guidelines of NCTE, K.V.S. did not <lb/>allow those candidates to be appointed. <lb/>It was noted that <lb/>sufficient number of candidates having the eligibility qualifications <lb/>were not available, which adversely affected the quality in <lb/>selection of teachers. <lb/>It was recorded that the competent <lb/>authority had given conditional approval to the K.V.S. to appoint <lb/>primary teachers with higher qualification of BA, B.Sc. or B.Ed, in <lb/>case sufficient number of D.El.Ed. candidates are not available. It <lb/>was, therefore, suggested that it would not be appropriate to <lb/></body>

			<page>(144 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>remove first condition and the K.V.S. can decide as it is an <lb/>autonomous body and competent to decide such matter. In short, <lb/>the suggestion was not to include the B.Sc., B.A. or B.Ed. teachers <lb/>in the eligibility criteria at par with other educational qualifications <lb/>but to allow K.V.S. to expand the zone of consideration by <lb/>including such qualifications, in case without inclusion of such <lb/>candidates, it was not possible to fill up the posts. Significantly, <lb/>these deliberations were with respect to K.V.S. schools alone. <lb/>When this note was placed before the Hon&apos;ble Minister of HRD, he <lb/>placed detailed note expressing his opinion as under: <lb/>&quot;There are DL.ED. colleges is few states. Therefore, <lb/>applications for primary teachers come from limited <lb/>states. B.Ed. is a post graduate degree. They are ready <lb/>to serve as Primary Teachers. So we get best more <lb/>equipped teachers. The issue <lb/>The issue therefore are two <lb/>1. When more educated teachers are available why <lb/>students should not get benefit of better qualified <lb/>teachers, therefore, we must allow B.Ed. teachers. <lb/>2. Second issue is pedagogical for primary teacher <lb/>which is available in DL.Ed. &amp; not in B.Ed. course. The <lb/>member has been found by teaching one specific model <lb/>through Swayam &amp; contact programmer also. Thus, it <lb/>is very clear that students have the right to have better <lb/>teachers B.Ed. are more equipped as it is graduate +, <lb/>while Dl.Ed. is 12+ <lb/>Finally Decision should be <lb/>1. Dl.Ed. will continue to the eligible to apply for <lb/>Primary teacher post. <lb/>2. Additionally, B.Ed. pass candidates will be also <lb/>eligible to apply. <lb/>3. When, Dl.Ed. candidates is selected they can start <lb/>teaching after formalities. <lb/>4. When B.Ed. candidate are selected, they will start <lb/>teaching but will have to complete pedagogical module <lb/>with in 2 years <lb/>5. Thus Dl.Ed. &amp; B.Ed. Candidates can apply for the job <lb/>of Primary teacher in KV. <lb/>Selected B.Ed. candidates will have to complete <lb/>pedagogical module in 2 years of appointment.&quot; <lb/>(145 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/>19. According to the Minister, thus B.Ed. should be recognized as <lb/>an additional qualification and not an alternative qualification for <lb/>appointment to primary school teachers. However, this opinion <lb/>also was confined to K.V.S. schools alone. <lb/>20. Shri R.D. Rastogi, learned Additional Solicitor General <lb/>appearing for the NCTE had placed before us further <lb/>correspondence, which took place between NCTE and MHRD in this <lb/>regard. These documents are taken on record. Perusal of <lb/>these would show that after the Minister put his <lb/>remarks on 11.04.2018, MHRD wrote to NCTE pointing out that <lb/>the Minister has directed the NCTE to amend the qualifications and <lb/>make B.Ed. also an eligibility for teaching primary level with a <lb/>proviso of passing the module within two years of joining the <lb/>service. We also note that in a meeting held on 28.05.2018 the <lb/>officials of MHRD and Minister concerned discussed and <lb/>deliberated the issues and decided to recognize B.Ed. degree <lb/>course as an additional eligibility criteria for appointment to the <lb/>post of primary school teachers in classes-I to V. The relevant <lb/>portion of the minutes of this meeting reads as under: <lb/>&quot;File was called for. <lb/>Kendriya Vidalaya Sangathan Vide letter No. F. <lb/>11054/3/KVS(HQ)/RPS dated 18.05.2016 requested <lb/>National Bank Council For Teacher Education to allow <lb/>KVS to recruit Primary Teachers with higher <lb/>qualification than prescribed by National Council for <lb/>Teacher Education i.e. graduation with 50% marks <lb/>and B.Ed. <lb/>2. <lb/>The matter was considered in this Ministry and <lb/>HRM has approved the proposal of KVS to recruit <lb/>primary teacher with higher qualification (i.e. <lb/>B.A./B.Sc., B.Ed.+TET). Further, HRM has also <lb/>directed that NCTE may amend the qualification and <lb/>make B.A./B.Sc., B.Ed. also eligible for teaching at <lb/>Primary level with provision of completing Pedagogical <lb/>module in 2 years of joining the service, these <lb/>directions were conveyed to NCTE on 12.04.2018, <lb/>however, the action is still pending at their part. <lb/></body>

			<body>3. <lb/>The matter was again discussed and deliberated <lb/>in detail in the meeting held today(28th May, 2018) <lb/>chaired by HRM and attended by Special Secretary, <lb/>Chairperson, NCTE, MS, NCTE, Joint Secretary (SE.I) <lb/>and KVS Commissioner. KVS Commissioner raised the <lb/>issues of insufficient number of candidates applying for <lb/>the post of Primary teachers and candidates applying <lb/>from few states rather than across the country. It was <lb/>informed by MS, NCTE that approximately 7.5 lakh <lb/>seat are available for D.El.Ed across the country out of <lb/>which 50% seats are filled. However, the TET pass <lb/>D.El.Ed. candidate would be much less as the result of <lb/>TET varies from 6% to 16%. This makes the <lb/>availability of eligible D.El.Ed. candidates much less <lb/>than the desired. HRM also pointed out the need for <lb/>better equipped teachers to ensure quality education <lb/>in schools. Recruitment of Teachers with higher <lb/>qualifications will ultimately be beneficial and in the <lb/>interest of the students. <lb/>4. <lb/>In addition to above, NCTE will roll out four year <lb/>B.Ed. integrated course from next academic year, <lb/>therefore, the prevalent D.El.Ed./B.Ed. etc will phase <lb/>out in time bound manner. Further, similar kind of <lb/>request has also been from the state of Uttrakhand. <lb/>5. <lb/>In view of the above discussions, HRM directed <lb/>NCTE to change its regulations, Directions are required <lb/>to be given under section 29 of the NCTE Act, 1993. <lb/>Section 29 of the NCTE Act is as follows: <lb/>(1) The Council shall in the discharge of its functions <lb/>and duties under this Act be bound by such directions <lb/>on questions of policy as the Central Government may <lb/>give in writing to it from time to time. <lb/>(2) The decision of the Central Government as to <lb/>whether a question is one of policy or not shall be <lb/>final. <lb/>6. <lb/>We may request NCTE to submit draft notification <lb/>to amend NCTE regulations at the earliest. The draft <lb/>letter is attached for approval please. Once the draft <lb/>notification is received, the same will be sent to <lb/>Legislative Department for vetting with the approval of <lb/>HRM. <lb/>Submitted.&quot; <lb/>21. This decision was summed up in a note dated 29.05.2018, <lb/>which reads as under: <lb/>&quot;Please place on file the latter from NCTE which was <lb/>handed over to the HRM by the MS, NCTE during the <lb/>meeting, the details of which have been referred to in <lb/>the draft reply. The meeting clearly took the decision <lb/>that in view of the facts presented by the <lb/>Commissioner, KV and since the NCTE did not have any <lb/>objection to permit KV schools to recruit primary <lb/></body>

			<page>(147 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>teachers with higher qualifications, then there should <lb/>be no objection to extending this to other schools, and <lb/>therefore, this Ministry could issue directions to the <lb/>NCTE under Section 29.&quot; <lb/>22. The State Government holds a belief that such amendment <lb/>was unconstitutional and could not have been thrust on the State. <lb/>Ignoring such amendment, the State Government issued an <lb/>advertisement dated 11 th January, 2021 inviting applications for <lb/>REET aspirants. This advertisement did not recognize B.Ed degree <lb/>holders as eligible for appearing in the test. In such scenario, the <lb/>petitioner Mukesh Kumar Royal and others, who are non-B.Ed. <lb/>degree holders have challenged the NCTE notification dated <lb/>28.06.2018 Out of caution, they have also challenged the <lb/>communication dated 30.05.2018 from MHRD to NCTE. The <lb/>petitioner Sunita and others have supported the amendment and <lb/>challenged the advertisement issued by the State Government <lb/>inviting applications for REET. The State Government has <lb/>supported the petitioners who have challenged the notification <lb/>dated 28.06.2018. <lb/>23. In such background, learned counsel appearing for the <lb/>challengers of the notification dated 28.06.2018 including learned <lb/>Advocate General appearing for the State Government have raised <lb/>the following contentions:-<lb/>(i) <lb/>B.Ed. qualification is not a higher qualification than D.El.Ed. <lb/>and therefore, cannot be automatically included as eligibility <lb/>criteria. <lb/>(ii) Under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act, the <lb/>authority for prescribing the qualifications for appointment <lb/>as primary teachers lies with the NCTE. The Ministry of HRD <lb/>had no authority to give any direction in this respect. <lb/></body>

			<page>(148 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>(iii) By virtue of the impugned notification, the candidates who <lb/>are ineligible for appointment are made eligible subject to <lb/>acquiring eligibility which is not permissible and in any case, <lb/>is opposed to the basic idea of the responsibility of the State <lb/>to provide quality primary education flowing from Article 21A <lb/>of the Constitution. <lb/>(iv) Even under the NCTE Act, MHRD has power only to give <lb/>directions in relation to the policy matters. The question of <lb/>prescribing eligibility criteria for appointment as teachers is <lb/>exclusively within the domain of NCTE and it is not a policy <lb/>matter in which the MHRD can have any say. <lb/>(v) In terms of Section 35 of the NCTE Act any regulations <lb/>framed by NCTE have to be placed before the Parliament for <lb/>its approval, which has not been done in the present case. <lb/>(vi) The eligibility criteria could not have been modified without <lb/>amending the notification dated 12.11.2014 in which such <lb/>minimum qualifications have been prescribed. <lb/>(vii) It was contended that the power to relax the minimum <lb/>qualifications were exercised without sufficient material <lb/>available on record justifying exercise of such powers. It was <lb/>argued that in the State of Rajasthan, there are large <lb/>number of D.El.Ed. Pass candidates who are qualified for <lb/>appointment as primary school teachers (classes I to V). <lb/>Without examination of such data, the B.Ed. degree holders <lb/>are made eligible. <lb/>(viii) It was contended that the entire exercise before the Ministry <lb/>of HRD was in relation to the request of the KVS to recognize <lb/>B.Ed. degree as an alternative qualification, the source to be <lb/>tapped when sufficient number of qualified candidates are <lb/></body>

			<page>(149 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>not available. This was also the view of the officials of MHRD. <lb/>The Minister alone over-ruled this suggestion and required <lb/>that B.Ed. may be recognized as additional qualification and <lb/>that such decision may be projected across all schools in the <lb/>country. <lb/>(ix) It was argued by the learned Advocate General that the <lb/>primary education is part of the Concurrent List in Schedule <lb/>VII to the Constitution and under Article 309, it is the power <lb/>of the State Government to make appointments to the posts <lb/>created under the State Government. The Union Government <lb/>while framing regulations contrary to the RTE Act and Rules <lb/>framed thereunder, had usurped the power of the State <lb/>Government to make appointment of qualified persons in the <lb/>posts created under the State Government. <lb/>24. On the other hand, the learned counsel for NCTE and the <lb/>petitioners, who have supported the NCTE notification dated <lb/>28.06.2018 have raised the following contentions:-<lb/>(i) The powers are exercised under Sub-section (1) of Section <lb/>23 and not under Sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the RTE <lb/>Act. It is therefore not necessary to examine the data in <lb/>different States. <lb/>(ii) The Ministry of HRD had the powers to give directions to the <lb/>NCTE in relation to the policy matters. Essentially the <lb/>educational qualification for appointment as primary teacher <lb/>is an important policy issue. <lb/>(iii) After due deliberations the MHRD formed a view that B.Ed. <lb/>degree should be recognized as an additional qualification <lb/>subject to passing the bridge course. <lb/></body>

			<page>(150 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>(iv) In policy matters, particularly in the area of technical fields <lb/>such as education, the Court would not substitute its wisdom <lb/>for that of the authorities duly empowered under the Statute <lb/>and aided by experts in the field. <lb/>(v) It was contended that the sufficiency of the materials before <lb/>the Ministry for forming final opinion is not subject to judicial <lb/>review. In any case, after full deliberations, the authority had <lb/>come to the conclusion that the B.Ed. degree should be <lb/>recognized as an additional qualification. It was pointed out <lb/>that such qualification was recognized till the year 2012. <lb/>(vi) It was contended that the earlier decisions of the Courts <lb/>holding that B.Ed. is not a higher qualification were rendered <lb/>in different background. If eventually the rule making <lb/>authority was of the opinion that a person holding B.Ed. <lb/>degree was just as qualified to impart education in primary <lb/>schools (classes-I to V), the Court would not over-rule such <lb/>matured decision arrived at after due deliberations. <lb/>(vii) It was contended that not placing the regulations before the <lb/>Parliament would not vitiate them since the provision under <lb/>Section 35 of the NCTE Act, merely requires such regulations <lb/>to be placed before the Parliament and does not attach any <lb/>adverse consequences if this procedural requirement is not <lb/>followed. <lb/>(viii)It was argued that the purpose of constituting NCTE was <lb/>principally for coordinated development of teacher education <lb/>system across the country and the dominant purpose for <lb/>constitution of NCTE was not for laying down qualifications <lb/>for school teachers. <lb/></body>

			<page>(151 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>25. Both sides have relied upon and referred to various <lb/>judgments, reference to which will be made at appropriate stages. <lb/>26. As noted above, the NCTE has been authorized by the <lb/>Central Government for the purposes of Sub-section (1) of Section <lb/>23 as well as Sub-section (1) of Section 29 of the RTE Act. Sub-<lb/>section (1) of Section 23 pertains to minimum qualifications that a <lb/>person must possess for eligibility for appointment as a teacher, <lb/>whereas Sub-section (1) of Section 29 pertains to curriculum and <lb/>evaluation procedure for elementary education to be laid down by <lb/>the academic authority. The issues of eligibility for appointment as <lb/>a teacher and the curriculum and evaluation procedure for <lb/>elementary education are closely connected and interlinked. It is <lb/>possibly for this reason, that in its wisdom, the Government of <lb/>India has recognized NCTE as an academic authority for both the <lb/>purposes. While exercising such powers, the NCTE evolves <lb/>important criteria and guidelines for setting the curriculum and <lb/>evaluation procedure for elementary education as well as <lb/>prescribing minimum qualification for appointment as a teacher. <lb/>27. Sub-section (1) of Section 23 thus authorizes NCTE as an <lb/>academic authority duly notified by the Central Government for <lb/>prescribing minimum qualifications for appointment as a teacher. <lb/>The power and authority thus exclusively vests in NCTE. Sub-<lb/>section (2) of Section 23 is a special provision under which the <lb/>Central Government retains its authority to relax the qualifications <lb/>for appointment as a teacher under certain circumstances. As per <lb/>this provision where a state does not have adequate institutions <lb/>offering courses or training in teacher education or teachers <lb/>possessing minimum qualifications as laid down under Sub-section <lb/>(1) are not available in sufficient numbers, the Central <lb/></body>

			<page>(152 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>Government may, if it deems necessary, relax the minimum <lb/>qualifications for appointment as a teacher for such period not <lb/>exceeding 5 years as may be specified in the notification. First <lb/>proviso of Sub-section (2) of Section 23 provides that a teacher <lb/>who at the commencement of the Act does not possess minimum <lb/>qualifications as laid down in Sub-section (1) shall acquire such <lb/>qualification within a period of 5 years. Further proviso to Sub-<lb/>section (2) provides that every teacher appointed or in position as <lb/>on 31.03.2015, who does not possess minimum qualifications as <lb/>laid down under Sub-section (1) shall acquire such minimum <lb/>qualification within a period of 4 years from the date of <lb/>commencement of RTE (Amendment) Act 2017. <lb/>28. Analysis of Sub-section (2) of Section 23 would thus show <lb/>that the Central Government has the power to relax the <lb/>qualifications laid down for appointment of the teacher where <lb/>adequate number of institutions offering courses or training in <lb/>teacher education or teachers possessing minimum qualifications <lb/>in a state are not available. Such powers are in the nature of <lb/>relaxation to the essential qualifications that may be prescribed <lb/>under Sub-section (1) of Section 23. In the main body of Sub-<lb/>section (2) and the first and second proviso thereto reference is to <lb/>the qualifications laid down under Sub-section (1). The emphasis <lb/>is on the person to be appointed as a teacher to possess the <lb/>qualification prescribed under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 which <lb/>can be relaxed subject to fulfillment of conditions as provided. <lb/>Thus, there is a clear distinction between the powers to be <lb/>exercised under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 which are vested in <lb/>the NCTE and those that can be exercised by the Central <lb/></body>

			<page>(153 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>Government under Sub-section (2) of Section 23 of relaxing the <lb/>standards laid down by NCTE under Sub-section (1) of Section 23. <lb/>29. With this clarity if we revert back to the materials on record, <lb/>it would emerge that the entire exercise has been undertaken <lb/>initially by the MHRD and thereafter by the NCTE as one under <lb/>Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act. In fact, the learned <lb/>Additional Solicitor General Shri Rastogi had repeatedly argued <lb/>before us that the powers are exercised by NCTE under Sub-<lb/>section (1) of Section 23 and not Sub-section (2) of Section 23. If <lb/>we proceed on such basis, immediate question of the authority of <lb/>the Central Government to mandate the NCTE to make a certain <lb/>change would arise. The RTE Act does not give power to the <lb/>Central Government to give any such directions to the NCTE. We <lb/>have reproduced Section 35 of the RTE Act which are in the nature <lb/>of powers of the Central Government and other authorities to <lb/>issue directions under Sub-section (1) of Section 35. The Central <lb/>Government has the power to issue guidelines to the appropriate <lb/>Government or the local authority for the purpose of <lb/>implementation of the provisions of the Act. Local authority has <lb/>been defined under clause (h) of Section 2 as to mean a Municipal <lb/>Corporation or Municipal Council or Zila Parishad or Nagar <lb/>Panchayat or Panchayat, by whatever names called and to include <lb/>such authority or body having administrative control over the <lb/>school or empowered by or under any law for the time being in <lb/>force to function as local authority. Thus, the power of the Central <lb/>Government to issue guidelines under Sub-section (1) of Section <lb/>35 of the RTE Act does not extend to the NCTE as an academic <lb/>authority notified under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE <lb/>Act. A reference of-course was made to Section 29 of the NCTE <lb/></body>

			<page>(154 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>Act for such purpose. Under Sub-section (1) of Section 29, the <lb/>NCTE shall in discharge of its functions and duties under the Act <lb/>be bound by such directions on questions of policy as the Central <lb/>Government may give in writing to it from time to time. However, <lb/>in our opinion, the Central Government cannot trace the source of <lb/>the power to give such directions to the NCTE in exercise of its <lb/>power under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act. The <lb/>primary source of the powers of the NCTE to frame regulations <lb/>prescribing the minimum qualifications for appointment of <lb/>teachers is in Sub-section (1) of Section 23. In exercise of such <lb/>powers, the NCTE is not to be guided or be bound by any directive <lb/>that the Central Government may issue. We do not find any such <lb/>powers retained by the Central Government under the RTE Act. In <lb/>plain terms therefore, the Ministry of HRD could not have <lb/>mandated the NCTE to make the amendments in question. It is <lb/>beyond dispute that the amendment is not the original work of <lb/>NCTE. In fact, the opinion of the NCTE was that B.Ed. may be <lb/>recognized as an alternative qualification for the purpose of KVS, <lb/>where adequate number of otherwise qualified candidates are in <lb/>short supply. Over-ruling such opinion of NCTE, the Ministry of <lb/>HRD mandated that B.Ed. may be recognized as an additional <lb/>qualification for all schools. This was clearly beyond the power of <lb/>the Central Government. <lb/>30. The RTE Act was enacted to provide for free and compulsory <lb/>education to all children of the age of 6 to 14 years. As noted, as <lb/>per Sub-section (1) of Section 23, a person possessing such <lb/>minimum qualifications, as laid down by the academic authority <lb/>authorised by the Central Government (i.e. NCTE) by notification <lb/>shall be eligible for appointment as a teacher. The primary source <lb/></body>

			<page>(155 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>of the authority of the NCTE to lay down such minimum <lb/>qualifications thus is Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act. <lb/>We are not oblivion to the fact that Section 12A was inserted in <lb/>NCTE Act with effect from 1.6.2012 which provides that for the <lb/>purpose of maintaining standards of education in schools, the <lb/>NCTE may, by regulations, determine the qualifications of persons <lb/>for being recruited as teachers in various levels of schools and <lb/>colleges. We may recall that the NCTE Act, as originally enacted, <lb/>was to provide for establishment of a National Council for Teacher <lb/>Education with a view to achieving planned and coordinate <lb/>development of the teacher education system and for regulation <lb/>and proper maintenance of norms and standards in the teacher <lb/>education system. The purpose of qualifications of school teachers <lb/>was inserted in the preamble only with effect from 1.6.2012. <lb/>Essentially this Section 12A of the NCTE Act is an eco of the <lb/>primary source of power of NCTE flowing from Section 23(1) of <lb/>the RTE Act to lay down minimum qualifications for eligibility for <lb/>appointment as a teacher. It is for this reason, therefore, in our <lb/>opinion, the power of the Central Government to give directions to <lb/>the NCTE under Section 29 of the NCTE Act cannot be utilized to <lb/>require NCTE to frame regulations concerning eligibility for <lb/>appointment as teacher under Section 23(1) of the RTE Act. <lb/>31. Even otherwise, we do not think that the powers of the <lb/>Central Government under Sub-section (1) of Section 29 of the <lb/>NCTE Act are wide enough to require the NCTE to frame <lb/>regulations for eligibility in a particular manner. As per Sub-<lb/>section (1) of Section 29, the NCTE shall in the discharge of its <lb/>functions and duties under the Act be bound by directions on <lb/>question of policy as the Central Government may give in writing <lb/></body>

			<page>(156 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>to it from time to time. The power of the Central Government to <lb/>issue directions to the NCTE and its binding effect are confined to <lb/>the question of policy. The legislature has advisedly limited the <lb/>powers of the Central Government to issue directions only on the <lb/>question of policy. <lb/>The powers thus are not plenary or all <lb/>pervasive but are restricted to the question of policy alone. Such <lb/>provision, therefore, has to be interpreted strictly. The legislature <lb/>has constituted the NCTE with specified duties, functions and <lb/>powers and which Council consists of various experts in the field. <lb/>The legislature has also while empowering the Central government <lb/>to give directions to the Council, advisedly restricted such powers <lb/>on the question of policy. <lb/>The directions of the Central <lb/>Government therefore cannot be for day to day functioning of the <lb/>NCTE or for purposes other than the policy matters. Framing of <lb/>regulations prescribing eligibility criteria or minimum qualifications <lb/>for appointment as primary teachers certainly cannot be seen as a <lb/>policy matter. <lb/>32. In the case of A. Manoharan and others vs. Union of <lb/>India and others [(2008) 3 SCC 641] while interpreting the <lb/>powers of the Central Government to give directions to the Major <lb/>Trust under Sub-section (1) of Section 111 of the Major Port Trusts <lb/>Act, 1963, which provided that the authority in discharge of its <lb/>functions under the Act be bound by such directions on questions <lb/>of policy as the Central Government may give in writing from time <lb/>to time, it was held and observed as under: <lb/>&quot;24. The power of the Central Government to issue <lb/>directions as contained in Section 111 of the 1963 Act <lb/>cannot be stretched to amend the Regulations. Power <lb/>must be exercised by the Central Government only in <lb/>regard to the administration of the Trust. Such a power <lb/>to issue direction must be construed strictly. (See <lb/></body>

			<page>(157 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport <lb/>Authority of India (1979) 3 SCC 489, Harjit Singh v. <lb/>State of Punjab (2007) 9 SCC 582, Ashoka Smokeless <lb/>Coal India (P) Ltd. v. Union of India (2007) 2 SCC 640 <lb/>and Poonam Verma v. DDA. (2007) 13 SCC 154)&quot; <lb/>33. We may also not be unduly perturbed by the finality attached <lb/>to the decision of the Central Government under Section 29(2) of <lb/>the NCTE Act on the question of what constitutes policy matter. <lb/>Any such decision is open to judicial review of the court under <lb/>Article 226 of the Constitution. Such judicial review being a basic <lb/>feature of the Constitution as held by the judgment of the <lb/>Supreme Court in the case of L. Chandra Kumar vs. Union of <lb/>India and other [(1997) 3 SCC 261] cannot be barred. <lb/>34. Though not so projected before us, if the Central <lb/>Government was exercising powers under Sub-section (2) of <lb/>Section 23, the same had to be upon fulfillment of conditions <lb/>precedent for exercise of such powers. As noted, it is open for the <lb/>Central Government to relax the qualifications prescribed under <lb/>Sub-section (1) of Section 23, if adequate institutions offering <lb/>courses or training in teacher education or teachers possessing <lb/>minimum qualifications in a state are not available in sufficient <lb/>numbers. Firstly, Sub-section (2) refers to such short fall arising in <lb/>a state meaning thereby such powers have to be exercised state-<lb/>wise. Secondly, the powers can be exercised only upon the Central <lb/>Government finding that in such a state adequate institutions <lb/>offering courses or training are not available or teachers <lb/>possessing minimum qualifications are not available in sufficient <lb/>numbers. Only if these conditions are satisfied, the power of <lb/>relaxing the minimum qualification prescribed under Sub-section <lb/></body>

			<page>(158 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>(1) of Section 23 can be exercised, not otherwise. In the present <lb/>case, no such exercise has been undertaken. The broad discussion <lb/>of number of vacancies and short fall in certain regions would not <lb/>satisfy the requirements for exercise of powers under Sub-section <lb/>(2) of Section 23. Further, as recorded above such powers were <lb/>state specific and had to be exercised in relation to a particular <lb/>state. Undoubtedly, within the state of Rajasthan no such exercise <lb/>has been carried out. <lb/>35. Learned counsel for the supporters of the impugned <lb/>notification have argued before us that the State Government or <lb/>the petitioners challenging the notification have not produced any <lb/>data to show that sufficient number of candidates other than <lb/>holding B.Ed. degree course were available. To our mind, this was <lb/>not the requirement for exercise of powers under Sub-section (2) <lb/>of Section 23. The requirement was establishing that the factors <lb/>necessary for exercising the powers existed and the required <lb/>collection of data as to the number of vacancies vis-a-vis number <lb/>of eligible candidates available without relaxing the minimum <lb/>qualifications was undertaken. Under the circumstances, it is not <lb/>necessary to go into the details of the statements made before us <lb/>either by the petitioners challenging the notification or the learned <lb/>Advocate General appearing for the State Government, who had <lb/>stated that in the REET conducted on 26.09.2021 for primary, <lb/>upper primary school teacher (level-1), 3,50,000 odd candidates <lb/>holding the qualifications of BSTC D.El.Ed. had participated against <lb/>18850 vacant posts. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">(159 of 166) <lb/></note>

			<page>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>36. Even going by the insertion of B.Ed. as a recognized <lb/>qualification, it is manifest that the B.Ed. per se is not sufficient <lb/>educational qualification. It is for this reason that the MHRD <lb/>desired and NCTE has introduced the requirement of passing of <lb/>the bridge course. It is only on passing of such bridge course that <lb/>the candidate would become eligible to hold the post of primary <lb/>school teacher (classes-I to V). This should not be misunderstood <lb/>as an in-service training after recruitment. This is a part and <lb/>parcel of the eligibility criteria prescribed in the Rules. <lb/>37. We may recall that the amended qualifications are that the <lb/>person may have a B.Ed. degree and may compete for the <lb/>appointment, however after appointment within a period of two <lb/>years, he must pass the bridge course of six months which will be <lb/>designed by the NCTE. In clear terms, the intention is to design a <lb/>course which will equip a candidate to impart education at the <lb/>primary school level (classes-I to V). This is an indirect admission <lb/>on the part of the authorities that minus such bridge course, a <lb/>B.Ed. degree holder is not qualified to hold the post of a primary <lb/>school teacher (classes-I to V). If upon fulfillment of conditions <lb/>required for exercising powers under Sub-section (2) of Section <lb/>23, the Central Government had relaxed the standards by <lb/>enabling a B.Ed. degree holder to secure appointment but to clear <lb/>the bridge course within the specified time, perhaps no challenge <lb/>would lie against exercise of such powers. However, even the <lb/>Union of India has not taken the stand that the powers are <lb/>exercised by the Central Government under Sub-section (2) of <lb/>Section 23 of the RTE Act. In any case, we have concluded that no <lb/>such powers could have been exercised without satisfying that the <lb/>conditions precedent for exercising such powers existed. <lb/></body>

			<page>(160 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>38. Since the MHRD as well as NCTE through the process of <lb/>framing the amendments and issuing the notification of <lb/>amendment have recognized that B.Ed. degree per se is not a <lb/>sufficient qualification for appointment as teacher in primary <lb/>school (classes-I to V), it is not necessary to dilate on the <lb/>question whether a B.Ed. degree is a higher qualification as <lb/>compared to D.El.Ed. or not. To borrow mathematical phraseology, <lb/>B.Ed. degree course does not form a super set of training of which <lb/>D.El.Ed. Diploma training forms a sub set. In other words, a B.Ed. <lb/>degree holder cannot argue that he has sufficient training to teach <lb/>not only higher standards but also the primary level standard I to <lb/>V and what is taught to a D.El.Ed. course is part and parcel of his <lb/>training. This was rejected by the Supreme Court in the cases of <lb/>P.M. Latha and others vs. State of Kerala and others [2003 <lb/>(3) SCC 541] and Yogesh Kumar and others vs. Government <lb/>of NTC, Delhi and others [2003 (3) SCC 548]. <lb/>39. In the case of P.M. Latha (supra), for recruitment to the post <lb/>of lower and upper primary school teachers in Government <lb/>schools, qualification prescribed was Trained Teachers Certificate <lb/>(&apos;TTC&apos;, for short) pass. Instead of selecting the TTC holders, B.Ed. <lb/>degree holders were selected on the basis that B.Ed. is higher <lb/>qualification than TTC. It was in this background held that there is <lb/>no force in the argument that B.Ed. qualification is higher <lb/>qualification than TTC. Similar view was expressed in the case of <lb/>Yogesh Kumar (supra). This is also a case where for the post of <lb/>assistant teachers in primary schools of Municipal Corporation, <lb/>qualifications prescribed were TTC holders. It was held that the <lb/>candidates holding B.Ed. degree cannot be considered eligible as <lb/>B.Ed. cannot be treated higher qualification than TTC. <lb/></body>

			<body>40. Learned Additional Solicitor General however painstakingly <lb/>argued that these judgments were rendered in vastly different <lb/>background and arose in a situation which no longer prevails. For <lb/>two reasons, we are not prepared to accept this contention in its <lb/>fullest form. Despite the above noted judgments of the Supreme <lb/>Court, if the rule making authority had after due deliberations <lb/>come to a conclusion that it is necessary to recognize B.Ed. <lb/>degree as one of the eligibility criteria for appointment, in exercise <lb/>of judicial review, out of due deference to the expertise of the <lb/>academic authority, we would perhaps have not interfered. <lb/>However, even the academic authority has not proceeded on the <lb/>basis that B.Ed. is a sufficient training for imparting education at <lb/>the lowest level of primary schools. It is therefore that the bridge <lb/>course, which literally would bridge the training gap has been <lb/>envisaged. <lb/>41. With these conclusions, we may deal with a few peripheral <lb/>issues and contentions. <lb/>42. Since we have held that the NCTE has exercised powers <lb/>under Sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act and also held <lb/>that in case the Central Government could not have given <lb/>directions to the NCTE for framing the regulations in a particular <lb/>manner for prescribing a particular eligibility criteria for <lb/>appointment of a teacher under Section 29 of the NCTE Act, it is <lb/>not necessary to examine the consequences of the regulations not <lb/>being placed for approval before the Parliament. <lb/>43. The learned counsel Shri Vigyan Shah was perhaps not <lb/>correct in contending that NCTE could not have amended the <lb/>eligibility criteria without amending the notification dated <lb/>12.11.2014. Under this notification, Clause (4) provides for <lb/></body>

			<page>(162 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>qualification for recruitment as provided in the schedule. The first <lb/>schedule pertains to minimum academic and professional <lb/>qualifications at different level of schools. Clause 3 contained in <lb/>the schedule pertains to primary and upper primary (Class I to <lb/>VIII) and the qualification prescribed are &quot;minimum qualifications <lb/>as laid down by National Council for Teacher Education vide its <lb/>notification dated 23.08.2010 as amended from time to time <lb/>issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Sub-section (1) <lb/>of Section 23 of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory <lb/>Education Act, 2009 (35 of 2009)&quot;. As per these Regulations thus, <lb/>the essential qualifications for appointment are those as <lb/>prescribed under the notification issued under Sub-section (1) of <lb/>Section 23 of the Act, namely, one dated 23.08.2010 as amended <lb/>from time to time. Thus, the moment the notification dated <lb/>23.08.2010 is amended by NCTE in exercise of powers under Sub-<lb/>section (1) of Section 23 automatically such change gets reflected <lb/>and embedded in the qualifications prescribed in the first schedule <lb/>of these regulations. Thereafter, therefore, there was no need to <lb/>amend this notification. All challenges in the preliminary <lb/>notification dated 23.08.2010 would automatically be recognized <lb/>for the purpose of the said schedule. <lb/>44. The debate has also taken place with respect to the stand of <lb/>the State Government. Firstly, with respect to the State <lb/>Government as a respondent challenging the notification of NCTE, <lb/>it was argued by the learned Additional Solicitor General that such <lb/>challenge without a counter petition being filed, was not <lb/>maintainable as per the High Court Rules. Second contentious <lb/>issue was the act of the State Government to ignore the NCTE <lb/></body>

			<page>(163 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>notification making amendment in the eligibility criteria and not <lb/>recognizing B.Ed. degree holders for the purpose of REET. <lb/>45. Since there are independent petitions and petitioners before <lb/>us who have challenged the notification of NCTE, it is not <lb/>necessary for us to examine whether the State Government on its <lb/>own as respondent could maintain its challenge without filing an <lb/>independent petition. However, with respect to the second ground, <lb/>we are of the opinion that the State Government could not have <lb/>ignored the notification while inviting applications for REET. Even if <lb/>the State Government was of the opinion that such notification <lb/>was unconstitutional or for any reason illegal, the same had to be <lb/>stayed or set aside by a competent court before it could be <lb/>ignored. <lb/>46. The contention of Shri Rastogi that the challengers to the <lb/>notification have no locus standi to bring the petition because the <lb/>amendment merely expands the zone of consideration, cannot be <lb/>accepted. Whether by mere expansion of zone of consideration the <lb/>challenge will succeed or not is a matter of a different context but <lb/>a person who is already eligible finds himself in a wider <lb/>competition on account of widening the zone of consideration for <lb/>appointment or promotion holds a belief that such amendment is <lb/>illegal he has every right to call in question. To reiterate the <lb/>question of locus standi of such a person and maintainability of his <lb/>or her petition stands on vastly different footing as compared to <lb/>the success or failure of such challenge to widening of the zone of <lb/>consideration for appointment or promotion. The judgments relied <lb/>upon in this context by Shri Rastogi in the cases of Government <lb/>of Andhra Pradesh vs. P. Dilip Kumar and others [1993 (2) <lb/>SCC 310] and Shyama Charan Dash and others vs. State of <lb/></body>

			<page>(164 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>Orissa and others [2003 (4) SCC 218] would fall in a latter <lb/>category. It is open for him to argue that when the only <lb/>consequence of the amendments in the regulations is expanding <lb/>the zone of consideration, the Court should not strike down the <lb/>amendment is entirely different from arguing that the persons <lb/>recognized as eligible as per the existing regulations cannot <lb/>question the amendment. <lb/>47. We concede to the suggestion of the learned Additional <lb/>Solicitor General that in policy matters and particularly in <lb/>specialized and highly technical fields such as education, the Court <lb/>always holds the opinion of the policy framers with highest <lb/>regards and would not substitute its wisdom for that of the <lb/>specialized body. The reference to the decisions of the Supreme <lb/>Court in the case of All India Council for Technical Education <lb/>vs. Surinder Kumar Dhawan and others [(2009) 11 SCC <lb/>726] and Zahoor Ahmad Rather and others vs. Sheikh <lb/>Imtiyaz Ahmad and others [(2019) 2 SCC 404] for such <lb/>purpose is noted. However, in the present case, we have not <lb/>questioned the wisdom of the rule making authority to make a <lb/>certain change in the eligibility criteria. What we have held is that <lb/>the same was done under the mandate of the Central Government <lb/>without such powers being vested. <lb/>48. The learned Advocate General is not quite accurate in <lb/>contending that by prescribing these qualifications there is affront <lb/>on the State&apos;s power to recruit persons on the posts under the <lb/>State Government. Quite apart, the power under Article 309 of the <lb/>Constitution to make recruitment by the State agencies, the <lb/>eligibility criteria for various posts can be prescribed under <lb/>respective statutes governing the terms and conditions of <lb/></body>

			<page>(165 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>education and such similar positions. Even under Sub-rule (3) of <lb/>Rule 266 of the Rajasthan Panchayat Raj Rules, 1996, the State <lb/>legislature has provided that the qualifications of the teachers <lb/>would be as prescribed by the NCTE. <lb/>49. We summarize our conclusions as thus: <lb/>(i) <lb/>The impugned notification dated 28.06.2018 is unlawful <lb/>because:-<lb/>(a) it is under the direction of the Central Government, <lb/>which power the Central Government under Sub-<lb/>section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act did not have; <lb/>and <lb/>(b) it is not in exercise of power of the Central Government <lb/>under Sub-section (2) of Section 23 of RTE Act relaxing <lb/>the eligibility criteria prescribed by the NCTE, nor there <lb/>has been any exercise for ascertaining existence of the <lb/>conditions precedent for exercising such power. <lb/>(ii) The petitioners have locus standi to challenge the notification <lb/>dated 28.06.2018. Merely because an additional qualification <lb/>is recognized as one of the eligibility criteria, the petitioners <lb/>cannot be prevented from challenging it. <lb/>(iii) Accepting a candidate with B.Ed. degree as eligible for <lb/>appointment and thereafter subjecting him to complete the <lb/>bridge course within two years of appointment is in the <lb/>nature of relaxing the existing eligibility criteria, which the <lb/>Central Government could have done only within Sub-section <lb/>(2) of Section 23 and subject to existence of circumstances <lb/>necessary for exercise of such power. <lb/>(iv) The State Government could not have ignored the <lb/>notification of NCTE dated 28.06.2018 while issuing <lb/></body>

			<page>(166 of 166) <lb/>[CW-1853/2021] <lb/></page>

			<body>advertisement for REET. However, when we have declared <lb/>that this notification is illegal and are in the process of <lb/>setting aside, the issue becomes one of academic value. <lb/>50. In the result, the impugned notification dated 28.06.2018 is <lb/>set aside. The latter dated 30 th May 2018 of the MHRD to NCTE <lb/>being in the nature of internal communication, does not give rise <lb/>to cause of action unless acted upon and therefore, it is not <lb/>necessary to separately set it aside. <lb/>51. The writ petitions being D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. <lb/>6587/2021 filed by Mukesh Kumar Royal and other similar <lb/>connected petitions are allowed. <lb/>52. The writ petitions being D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. <lb/>2108/2021 filed by Sunita and other similar connected petitions <lb/>are dismissed. <lb/>53. The interim orders granted earlier allowing the petitioners <lb/>holding B.Ed. degree to appear in the REET are vacated. The <lb/>candidature of those petitioners, who appeared in the REET under <lb/>the interim orders of this Court, shall not be processed further. <lb/>54. All applications stand disposed of accordingly. <lb/>(SUDESH BANSAL),J <lb/>(AKIL KURESHI),CJ <lb/>393to421,S/1,S/1to3-MohitTak/-</body>
