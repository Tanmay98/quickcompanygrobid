			1.
			<lb />
			The present leave to appeal has been filed by the State under Section
			<lb />
			378 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 being aggrieved by
			<lb />
			the judgment dated 23.05.2015 passed by the Sessions Judge in
			<lb />
			Sessions Case No. 234/13 by virtue of which the respondent Mahesh
			<lb />
			was acquitted for the offence punishable under Section 67-A of the
			<lb />
			Information Technology Act, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as &quot; IT
			<lb />
			Act&quot;).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			At the oral request of learned APP for the State, the respondent
			<lb />
			no.2/Bijender @ Vijender s/o Kirpal is deleted from the array of
			<lb />
			parties as no charge was framed against him under Section 67-A of
			<lb />
			the IT Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			In a nutshell, the case of the prosecution is that on 04.08.2013, the
			<lb />
			prosecutrix (PW1) came to the Police Station Fatehpur Beri and stated
			<lb />
			that she was married on 22.04.1996 and has two children out of the
			<lb />
			said marriage. She alleged that about fifteen days ago, at about 12
			<lb />
			noon, her devrani Sonwati, who had been living in front of her house,
			<lb />
			asked her to shift her fridge. When she went to the house of Sonwati
			<lb />
			and was shifting the fridge, Sonwati went out of the room and bolted
			<lb />
			door from outside. At this stage, the respondent Mahesh (brother-in-
			<lb />
			law of the prosecutrix), who was hiding in that room, revealed
			<lb />
			himself. He put a knife on the neck of the prosecutrix and asked her
			<lb />
			to remove her clothes. Thereafter, the respondent Mahesh committed
			<lb />
			sexual intercourse with her against her wishes. The respondent
			<lb />
			Mahesh also recorded the said incident in his mobile phone. It was
			<lb />
			further alleged by PW1 that the respondent Mahesh and Bijender
			<lb />
			threatened her to show the video to the public and also demanded Rs.
			<lb />
			30,000/-or Rs. 50,000/-from her. PW1 specifically alleged that
			<lb />
			Bijender sold the said video in the village for Rs. 300 and Rs. 500/-.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			On the complaint, a case was registered under Section
			<lb />
			376(D)/384/120-B/34 of the Indian Penal Code (in short &quot;IPC&quot;).
			<lb />
			Subsequently, the accused Sonwati and Mahesh were arrested and
			<lb />
			Bijender surrendered in Court. After completion of the investigation,
			<lb />
			charge sheet was filed. On 05.10.2013, charge under Section 384/34
			<lb />
			IPC was framed against the respondent Mahesh and Bijender; further
			<lb />
			charge under Section 376 (D) r/w Section 341/34 IPC and Section 67-
			<lb />
			A IT Act r/w Section 34 IPC was also framed against the respondent
			<lb />
			Mahesh and Sonwati. The statement of prosecutrix was recorded
			<lb />
			under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			To bring home the guilt of the respondents the prosecution had
			<lb />
			examined 13 witnesses in all. The statement of all the accused were
			<lb />
			recorded under section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure where
			<lb />
			they pleaded not guilty and denied all the incriminating evidence
			<lb />
			against them. No witness was produced by the respondents in their
			<lb />
			defence. Evaluating the evidence, the Trial Court acquitted all the
			<lb />
			accused persons, including the respondent Mahesh.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			Today, the State has approached this Court seeking leave to appeal
			<lb />
			from the order of acquittal in favour of respondent Mahesh, only
			<lb />
			under Section 67-A of the IT Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			Ms. Radhika Kolluru, learned APP for the State submits that the trial
			<lb />
			Court has erred in disbelieving the testimony of the prosecutrix/PW1
			<lb />
			to the extent that the respondent Mahesh had made a video and
			<lb />
			recorded the incident of rape. The counsel pointed out the cross-
			<lb />
			examination of PW1 wherein she categorically stated that the
			<lb />
			respondent Mahesh made a video holding his mobile in his right hand.
			<lb />
			To substantiate the argument with respect to Section 67-A IT Act, the
			<lb />
			counsel for the State has relied upon the testimonies of PW5 Ct.
			<lb />
			Pawan Kumar, PW6 Mahender Singh and PW7 Prasadi. The counsel
			<lb />
			for the State has further relied on the testimony of PW12 Santram
			<lb />
			(husband of the prosecutrix), who had categorically identified the
			<lb />
			voice of the respondent Mahesh in the said video.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			Learned counsel for the State further submits that the trial Court has
			<lb />
			failed to appreciate the testimony of PW13 SI Surekha (Investigating
			<lb />
			Officer) who had tendered the FSL report with respect to the video
			<lb />
			clip, which is Ex.PW13/A and unequivocally points towards the guilt
			<lb />
			of the respondent Mahesh and cannot be brushed aside.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			The counsel further submits that the trial Court has overlooked the
			<lb />
			testimonies relied by the prosecution and ignored the oral and
			<lb />
			documentary evidence which surfaced during the course of trial. The
			<lb />
			findings of the Trial Court run contrary to the factual matrix of the
			<lb />
			case and the Court has committed a grave error in acquitting the
			<lb />
			respondent Mahesh and has even failed to record the reasons for
			<lb />
			acquittal under Section 67-A of the IT Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			10. We have heard learned counsel for the State and have carefully
			<lb />
			examined the judgment of the Trial Court. We may profit with the
			<lb />
			findings of the Trial Court, the relevant portion of which reads as
			<lb />
			under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;16. The instant video was played before me. I found the
			<lb />
			prosecutrix behaving quite normal during the incident. No
			<lb />
			inference can be drawn from that video that she was under
			<lb />
			threat or she was forced to have such relations with the
			<lb />
			person. It appears to be a consented sex. The other person
			<lb />
			indulged in sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix is not
			<lb />
			visible in the video.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			17. It is noteworthy that the prosecutrix was quite old and
			<lb />
			matured. She would have reported the incident to her
			<lb />
			husband immediately after the incident. Rather testimony of
			<lb />
			PW 12 reveals that he came to know of the incident through
			<lb />
			someone. No plausible explanation came from the side of
			<lb />
			the prosecutrix as to why she kept quiet for about fifteen
			<lb />
			days when there was threat perception from the side of the
			<lb />
			accused persons.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			18. PW 12 has stated that one [sic: someone] of his native
			<lb />
			village had told him the incident and thereafter, he asked
			<lb />
			his nephew Mahender to procure the said video since he
			<lb />
			could not procure the same. He also gave his mobile to
			<lb />
			Mahender to get the said video transferred in it. Mahender
			<lb />
			then transferred the video in his mobile, from where he saw
			<lb />
			the obscene video. He stated that police had seized his
			<lb />
			mobile phone vide memo Rx. PW 12/A, PW 6 Mahender has
			<lb />
			stated that he came to know of video from Manoj, who
			<lb />
			showed him the clip and thereafter, he informed PW 12. In
			<lb />
			this case, the prosecution did not examine Manoj, who had
			<lb />
			first informed PW 6 of the video. PW 6 could not answer
			<lb />
			from where Manoj procured the video. The question now
			<lb />
			arises whether it was Mahender PW 6 who informed PW 12
			<lb />
			about the video or the factum of video had already come in
			<lb />
			the notice of PW 12. In the absence of examination of
			<lb />
			Manoj, it remained a mystery as to who or how the video
			<lb />
			was circulated in the village. PW 8 has stated that he never
			<lb />
			saw the video. On being cross examined by Ld. Addl. PP, he
			<lb />
			denied that accused Virender [sic: Bijender] had shown him
			<lb />
			the video and asked Rs. 100 from him to see the video. He
			<lb />
			totally turned hostile and did not support the case of
			<lb />
			prosecution in any manner.
			<lb />
			…
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			20. PW 12 has stated that the video contained the voice of
			<lb />
			Mahesh. In the instant case, prosecution did not collect the
			<lb />
			voice sample of accused Mahesh to match with the voice
			<lb />
			appearing in the audio video so it cannot be conclusively
			<lb />
			held that the audio video contains the voice of Mahesh. It is
			<lb />
			also to be noted that PW 13/ IO in her testimony has stated
			<lb />
			that the mobile phone recovered at the instance of accused
			<lb />
			Mahesh did not contain any obscene scene. The stand of the
			<lb />
			accused persons since beginning is that they have been
			<lb />
			falsely implicated in this case.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis Supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			11. The present petition seeking leave is limited to the acquittal of
			<lb />
			respondent Mahesh under Section 67-A of the IT Act. Section 67-A
			<lb />
			reads as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;67A. Punishment for publishing or transmitting of
			<lb />
			material containing sexually explicit act, etc., in electronic
			<lb />
			form.-Whoever publishes or transmits or causes to be
			<lb />
			published or transmitted in the electronic form any material
			<lb />
			which contains sexually explicit act or conduct shall be
			<lb />
			punished on first conviction with imprisonment of either
			<lb />
			description for a term which may extend to five years and
			<lb />
			with fine which may extend to ten lakh rupees and in the
			<lb />
			event of second or subsequent conviction with imprisonment
			<lb />
			of either description for a term which may extend to seven
			<lb />
			years and also with fine which may extend to ten lakh
			<lb />
			rupees.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis Supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			12. A bare reading of the provision would show that to bring home the
			<lb />
			guilt of an accused, the prosecution must prove that the accused had
			<lb />
			published or transmitted the material, containing sexually explicit act
			<lb />
			or conduct, or had caused the transmission of such material. As a
			<lb />
			logical consequence, the prosecution must prove that the accused had
			<lb />
			such material in his possession or control and he himself
			<lb />
			circulated/transmitted the same; or that the material was in the
			<lb />
			possession of some other person who circulated/transmitted at the
			<lb />
			instance of the accused. Unless either of the two is proved, the
			<lb />
			prosecution would have failed to discharge its burden.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			13. In view of the same, we proceed to analyse the case before us. There
			<lb />
			is no doubt to the fact that the video clip recovered from the mobile
			<lb />
			(Ex.P2) of Sant Ram (PW 12) (husband of the prosecutrix) contained
			<lb />
			sexually explicit material. What the prosecution could not prove
			<lb />
			before the Trial Court was that the video was transmitted by or at the
			<lb />
			instance of the respondent Mahesh.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			14. We proceed to analyse the testimonies of Ct.Pawan Kumar (PW 5),
			<lb />
			Mahender Singh (PW 6), Prasadi (PW 7), Sant Ram (PW 12), and SI
			<lb />
			Surekha (PW 13) as to the origin and circulation of the video clip
			<lb />
			(contained in CD-Ex. P3).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15. Ct.Pawan Kumar (PW 5) has testified that on 07.08.2013, he along
			<lb />
			with the IO and Ct.Hazari had recovered one white mobile phone (Ex.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			P1) from the house of the respondent Mahesh at his instance.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16. Mahender Singh (PW 6) has deposed that the he had seen the video
			<lb />
			while sitting with his friends on the mobile phone of one Manoj. He
			<lb />
			had seen the video for a minute or two and after identifying the
			<lb />
			prosecutrix immediately informed Sant Ram (PW 12); who got the
			<lb />
			video transferred on his mobile from the mobile of Manoj.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17. Prasadi (PW 7) in her statement has deposed that on 04.08.2013, she
			<lb />
			saw 3-4 children watching something on a mobile. She also watched
			<lb />
			the video and saw the prosecutrix having sex with someone. She,
			<lb />
			thereafter, immediately informed Sant Ram (PW 12). During her
			<lb />
			cross-examination, she stated that the mobile was of the son of one
			<lb />
			Parmal of the same mohalla.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18. Sant Ram (PW 12) (husband of the prosecutrix/PW1) deposed in his
			<lb />
			testimony that on 04.08.2013, he was told by a native of the village
			<lb />
			that he had seen the blue film of his wife on someone&quot;s mobile and it
			<lb />
			had already been circulated in the village. He immediately went to his
			<lb />
			house and inquired from his wife and then she narrated the complete
			<lb />
			incident which occurred 15 days ago. Thereafter, PW12 requested his
			<lb />
			nephew Mahender (PW6) to procure the said video and gave his
			<lb />
			mobile to him as he was unable to procure it himself. Then Mahender
			<lb />
			(PW 6) got the video transferred on the mobile (Ex. P2) of Sant Ram
			<lb />
			(PW 12). Thereafter, he immediately went to Police Station along
			<lb />
			with the prosecutrix and got the FIR registered. It was in evidence
			<lb />
			that the CD (Ex. P3) was played before PW12 in Court and he had
			<lb />
			identified her wife in the clip. PW 12 also identified the voice of the
			<lb />
			respondent Mahesh in the said video.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19. In his cross-examination, PW 12 further stated that his statement was
			<lb />
			recorded on 04.08.2013 wherein he told the police that he had given
			<lb />
			his mobile to his nephew to procure the said video. However, when he
			<lb />
			was confronted with his statement which is Ex.PW12/DA this fact
			<lb />
			was not so recorded. On the contrary, it was mentioned in the
			<lb />
			statement that his nephew had brought the said video and shown to
			<lb />
			him.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20. SI Surekha (PW 13) (IO of the case) has deposed that she collected
			<lb />
			the mobile (Ex. P2) of Sant Ram (husband of the prosecutrix) and
			<lb />
			recovered the mobile (Ex. P1) of respondent Mahesh from an almirah
			<lb />
			in his house. Both the mobiles (Ex. P1 and P2) were sent to the FSL,
			<lb />
			which has given its report (Ex. PW 13/D). The IO had also stated that
			<lb />
			she got a CD (Ex. P3) prepared of the video. Upon being cross-
			<lb />
			examined, she has deposed that the mobile of respondent Mahesh (Ex.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			P1) &quot;did not contain any obscene scenes.&quot; She further deposed as
			<lb />
			under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The scenes were deleted by the accused prior to seizing. I
			<lb />
			do not have scientific proof in this regard. What I have
			<lb />
			stated regarding deletion is the hearsay of the accused.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			21. The prosecutrix (PW1) deposed that respondent Mahesh while having
			<lb />
			sexual intercourse with her, had recorded the video on his mobile.
			<lb />
			She deposed that in the evening the respondent Mahesh demanded Rs.
			<lb />
			50,000/-and started blackmailing her that he would make the video
			<lb />
			public in the village. He then sold the video to the village people for
			<lb />
			Rs. 500 or so. She further deposed that the respondent Bijender (her
			<lb />
			dever) distributed the video in the village for Rs. 300 to Rs. 500,
			<lb />
			which also reached to her husband Sant Ram (PW 12) and then she
			<lb />
			told him about the entire incident.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			22. In the present criminal leave petition, the only allegation against the
			<lb />
			respondent Mahesh is merely that he was responsible for the recording
			<lb />
			and circulating the video clip in which the prosecutrix was found
			<lb />
			having intercourse with him. In this regard, we concur with the view
			<lb />
			taken by the Trial Court that the identity of the respondent Mahesh
			<lb />
			was not established in the video clip. This is as the face of the second
			<lb />
			person in the video clip is not visible; only Sant Ram (PW 12) has
			<lb />
			identified the voice in the video clip as that of respondent Mahesh; the
			<lb />
			voice sample of respondent Mahesh was not collected to match the
			<lb />
			voice in the video; and SI Surekha (PW 13) has in her testimony
			<lb />
			stated that the mobile of respondent Mahesh (Ex. P1) did not contain
			<lb />
			the obscene material. Consequently, the prosecution could not
			<lb />
			establish conclusively that the video was initially recorded and
			<lb />
			transmitted by respondent Mahesh.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			23. So far as the circulation of the said video clip is concerned, there is no
			<lb />
			evidence to link it with the respondent Mahesh. The prosecution has
			<lb />
			neither proved that the video clip, at any point of time, was
			<lb />
			transmitted by the respondent Mahesh or that the respondent Mahesh
			<lb />
			had caused its circulation. Sant Ram (PW 12) got the video clip
			<lb />
			through Mahender (PW 6), who inturn has deposed that he got the
			<lb />
			same from one Manoj. Now the link breaks, Manoj was not examined
			<lb />
			as a witness nor is anything on record to show how the video reached
			<lb />
			Manoj. Even the other chain of circulation is inconclusive as it ends
			<lb />
			at Prasadi (PW 7) seeing the video on the mobile of the son of one
			<lb />
			Parmal. Now again, neither the son of Parmal has been examined or
			<lb />
			the origin of the video known. The circulation of the video can be
			<lb />
			represented by the following diagram:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			24. Thus, the factum of circulation of the video either by or at the instance
			<lb />
			of the respondent Mahesh has not been established by the prosecution.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			25. In view of the aforegoing analysis and the testimonies discussed, we
			<lb />
			are of the considered opinion that the prosecution story with regard to
			<lb />
			involvement of the respondent Mahesh is doubtful and there was no
			<lb />
			evidence of the respondent Mahesh having transmitted or causing the
			<lb />
			transmission of the obscene video clip to anyone. Consequently, there
			<lb />
			are no grounds for proceeding against the respondent Mahesh with
			<lb />
			respect to the offence punishable under Section 67-A of the IT Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			26. We may also note that it is a cardinal principle in criminal
			<lb />
			jurisprudence that presumption of innocence of the accused is
			<lb />
			reinforced by an order of acquittal.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			27. In Tota Singh and Anr. v. State of Punjab, AIR 1987 SC 108:
			<lb />
			(1987) 2 SCC 529, the Supreme Court made the following
			<lb />
			observation:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;6. …The jurisdiction of the Appellate Court in dealing with
			<lb />
			an appeal against an order of acquittal is circumscribed by
			<lb />
			the limitation that no interference is to be made with the
			<lb />
			order of acquittal unless the approach made by the lower
			<lb />
			Court to the consideration of the evidence in the case is
			<lb />
			vitiated by some manifest illegality or the conclusion
			<lb />
			recorded by the Court below is such which could not have
			<lb />
			been possibly arrived at by any Court acting reasonably and
			<lb />
			judiciously and is, therefore, liable to be characterised as
			<lb />
			perverse. Where two views are possible on an appraisal of
			<lb />
			the evidence adduced in the case and the Court below has
			<lb />
			taken a view which is a plausible one, the Appellate Court
			<lb />
			cannot legally interfere with an order of acquittal even it is
			<lb />
			of the opinion that the view taken by the Court below on its
			<lb />
			consideration of the evidence is erroneous.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis Supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			28. In State of Rajasthan v. Raja Ram, (2003) 8 SCC 180: AIR 2003 SC
			<lb />
			3601 the Apex Court held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;7. There is no embargo on the appellate court reviewing
			<lb />
			the evidence upon which an order of acquittal is based.
			<lb />
			Generally, the order of acquittal shall not be interfered with
			<lb />
			because the presumption of innocence of the accused is
			<lb />
			further strengthened by acquittal. The golden thread which
			<lb />
			runs through the web of administration of justice in criminal
			<lb />
			cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence
			<lb />
			adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused
			<lb />
			and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable
			<lb />
			to the accused should be adopted. The paramount
			<lb />
			consideration of the court is to ensure that miscarriage of
			<lb />
			justice is prevented. A miscarriage of justice which may
			<lb />
			arise from acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the
			<lb />
			conviction of an innocent. In a case where admissible
			<lb />
			evidence is ignored, a duty is cast upon the appellate court
			<lb />
			to reappreciate the evidence in a case where the accused
			<lb />
			has been acquitted, for the purpose of ascertaining as to
			<lb />
			whether any of the accused committed any offence or not.
			<lb />
			(See Bhagwan Singh v. State of M.P. JT (2002) 3 SC 387)
			<lb />
			The principle to be followed by the appellate court
			<lb />
			considering the appeal against the judgment of acquittal is
			<lb />
			to interfere only when there are compelling and substantial
			<lb />
			reasons for doing so. If the impugned judgment is clearly
			<lb />
			unreasonable, it is a compelling reason for interference.
			<lb />
			These aspects were highlighted by this Court in Shivaji
			<lb />
			Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra 1973 SCC (Cri)
			<lb />
			1033, Ramesh Babulal Doshi v. State of Gujarat (1996) 9
			<lb />
			SCC 225 and Jaswant Singh v. State of Haryana JT (2000)
			<lb />
			4 SC 114.&quot;

		<p>
			29. A Division Bench of the Supreme Court in Chandrappa v. State of
			<lb />
			Karnataka, (2007) 4 SCC 415, the general principles regarding the
			<lb />
			power of the appellate court while dealing with an order of acquittal
			<lb />
			were summarized as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;42. From the above decisions, in our considered view, the
			<lb />
			following general principles regarding powers of the
			<lb />
			appellate court while dealing with an appeal against an
			<lb />
			order of acquittal emerge:
			<lb />
			(1) An appellate court has full power to review,
			<lb />
			reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which
			<lb />
			the order of acquittal is founded.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no
			<lb />
			limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such
			<lb />
			power and an appellate court on the evidence before
			<lb />
			it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of
			<lb />
			fact and of law.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(3) Various expressions, such as, &quot;substantial and
			<lb />
			compelling reasons&quot;, &quot;good and sufficient grounds&quot;,
			<lb />
			&quot;very
			<lb />
			strong
			<lb />
			circumstances&quot;,
			<lb />
			&quot;distorted

			conclusions&quot;, &quot;glaring mistakes&quot;, etc. are not
			<lb />
			intended to curtail extensive powers of an appellate
			<lb />
			court in an appeal against acquittal. Such
			<lb />
			phraseologies are more in the nature of &quot;flourishes
			<lb />
			of language&quot; to emphasise the reluctance of an
			<lb />
			appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to
			<lb />
			curtail the power of the court to review the evidence

			and to come to its own conclusion.

			(4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind
			<lb />
			that in case of acquittal, there is double presumption
			<lb />
			in favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of
			<lb />
			innocence is available to him under the fundamental
			<lb />
			principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person
			<lb />
			shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved
			<lb />
			guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the
			<lb />
			accused having secured his acquittal, the
			<lb />
			presumption of his innocence is further reinforced,
			<lb />
			reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the
			<lb />
			basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court
			<lb />
			should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded
			<lb />
			by the trial court.&quot;

			30. Accordingly, keeping in view the aforegoing principles of law, we
			<lb />
			find no illegality or infirmity in the judgment of the Trial Court
			<lb />
			warranting interference.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			31. Thus, the leave to appeal is dismissed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			32. Trial Court Record be returned.
