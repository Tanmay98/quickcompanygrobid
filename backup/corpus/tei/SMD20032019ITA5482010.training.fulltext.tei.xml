		<p>
			ORDER
			<lb />
			20.03.2019
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			1. This appeal by the Revenue under Section 260-A of the Income Tax Act, 1961
			<lb />
			(&apos;Act&apos;) is directed against the judgment dated 22 nd May 2009 of the Income Tax
			<lb />
			Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in ITA No. 5531/Del/2004 for the Assessment Year
			<lb />
			(AY) 2001-02.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2. While admitting this appeal on 13 th May 2010, this Court framed the following
			<lb />
			questions of law for consideration:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(a) Whether ITAT was correct in law in allowing compensation amounting
			<lb />
			to Rs.90,68,995/-paid by the assessee to its clients over for surrendering the
			<lb />
			allotment of space over and above the cost of shops/space as revenue
			<lb />
			expenditure?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) Whether ITAT was correct in law in ignoring the method of accounting
			<lb />
			consistently followed by the assessee by allowing the compensation as
			<lb />
			revenue expenditure when the similar compensation was capitalized by the
			<lb />
			assessee in work in progress in the earlier assessment years?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c) Whether ITAT was correct in law in deleting the addition of
			<lb />
			Rs.1,98,57,789/-and Rs.22,93,619/-paid by the assessee on account of
			<lb />
			interest and guarantee commission to the bank respectively as business
			<lb />
			expenditure when the loan raised from the bank was given by the assessee to
			<lb />
			its sister concerns without charging interest?
			<lb />
		</item>


		<item>
			(d) Whether ITAT was correct in law in allowing service charges of
			<lb />
			Rs.9,28,327/-as revenue expenditure despite the fact that the assessee was
			<lb />
			following completed contract method of accounting?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			3. The above questions stand answered today by this Court by a detailed common
			<lb />
			judgment in the present appeal and other connected appeals, in the affirmative i.e.
			<lb />
			in favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue. A copy of the said judgment is
			<lb />
			placed below.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4. The appeal is accordingly dismissed and the impugned order of the ITAT on the
			<lb />
			issues is affirmed.
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Dr. S. Muralidhar, J.:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			1. These are 11 appeals under Section 260-A of the Income Tax Act, 1961
			<lb />
			(&quot;Act&quot;) of which 1 is by the Assessee and 10 are by the Revenue. Apart from
			<lb />
			the facts being similar, the questions of law too are common to many of the
			<lb />
			appeals. They are accordingly disposed of by this common judgment.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Background facts
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			2. The Assessee is engaged to the business of construction and sale of
			<lb />
			commercial space. The Assessee developed the 17 storied building known as
			<lb />
			Dr. Gopal Das Bhawan in Connaught Place in New Delhi. The Assessee
			<lb />
			follows the Completed Contract Method (&quot;CCM&quot;) as compared to the
			<lb />
			Percentage Completion Method (&quot;PCM&quot;). The case of the Assessee is that
			<lb />
			since it follows the CCM, income is not recognised till the completion of the
			<lb />
			project. All receipts are treated as &quot;advance&quot; and all direct expenses are
			<lb />
			accounted for as &quot;capital work and progress.&quot; A reference is made to the
			<lb />
			Accounting Standard (&quot;AS&quot;) 7 issued by the Institute of Chartered
			<lb />
			Accountants of India (&quot;ICAI&quot;) initially in 1983 which was revised first in
			<lb />
			2002 and then in 2016. According to the Assessee, only on completion or
			<lb />
			substantial completion of the project, revenue is recognised.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Payment of compensation to flat/space buyers
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3. The Assessee states that the Gopal Das Bhawan Project was completed in
			<lb />
			the Financial Year (&quot;FY&quot;) 1994-95 relevant to Assessment Year (&quot;AY&quot;)
			<lb />
			1995-96. Some of the allottees of the flats refused to take them for
			<lb />
			completion since the New Delhi Municipal Council (&quot;NDMC&quot;) changed the
			<lb />
			usage of the Lower Ground Floor (&quot;LGF&quot;). The Assessee then started
			<lb />
			negotiating with the relevant flat buyers and persuaded them to surrender
			<lb />
			their ownership and allotment letters. The Assessee decided to repay the
			<lb />
			advance money received from these flat owners which worked out to
			<lb />
			Rs.32,08,271. The Assessee also decided to pay in addition compensation
			<lb />
			amounting to Rs.1,18,38,705 in lieu of surrender of their rights in the flat.
			<lb />
			This expenditure was claimed by the Assessee as &quot;revenue in nature&quot; and
			<lb />
			was charged to the Profit and Loss Account (&quot;P&amp;L Account&quot;).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Proceedings before the AO
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4. The Assessing Officer (&quot;AO&quot;) who picked up for scrutiny the Assessee&quot;s
			<lb />
			return for AY 1995-96 by an order-sheet entry dated 5 th December 1997
			<lb />
			required the Assessee to give the full details and addresses of the persons to
			<lb />
			whom the aforementioned compensation amounts were paid. The Assessee
			<lb />
			was asked to explain why the said amounts should not be disallowed as
			<lb />
			capital expenditure/loss as it had not been paid for business purposes.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5. By a reply dated 15 th December 1997 the Assessee contended that the
			<lb />
			space to be sold was in its stock and trade. The space allotted to various
			<lb />
			persons had been surrendered by them for various reasons. Such persons
			<lb />
			who surrendered had insisted that since they had invested money with the
			<lb />
			Assessee which had remained with the Assessee for a number of years, the
			<lb />
			Assessee should compensate them for the loss of the interest income on such
			<lb />
			investment. Considering that the space surrendered by such allottees would
			<lb />
			give the Assessee an opportunity to sell the same space at a higher rate, the
			<lb />
			Assessee considered it commercially prudent to pay them compensation in
			<lb />
			order to get the spaces surrendered. The Assessee&quot;s contention was that
			<lb />
			since such payment pertained to stock and trade, it cannot be considered as
			<lb />
			capital expenditure or capital loss.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Assessment order
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6. The AO negatived the above plea of the Assessee by holding that the
			<lb />
			Assessee had not paid any compensation to the allottees but had in fact
			<lb />
			&quot;repurchased these flats&quot; since the allottees had &quot;surrendered their rights in
			<lb />
			those flats.&quot; Consequently, it was held that the compensation paid to the flat
			<lb />
			owners could not be said to be business expenditure but rather was &quot;capital
			<lb />
			investment in purchase of stock and trade.&quot; It was, however, observed that
			<lb />
			the Assessee was free to include the cost of compensation in the cost of the
			<lb />
			flats so acquired and claim deduction of the amount at the time of sale as
			<lb />
			cost of purchase of the flats. It is observed that the Assessee had paid
			<lb />
			compensation amount &quot;once and for all to repurchase the property&quot; and this
			<lb />
			was &quot;in fact a sale consideration and cannot be allowed as business
			<lb />
			expenditure.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7. The AO further observed that enquiries had been made with some of flat
			<lb />
			owners to ascertain the treatment they had given to the said receipt of
			<lb />
			compensation in their books of accounts and income tax returns. All of them
			<lb />
			had shown the amount received from the Assessee as capital gains in their
			<lb />
			books of accounts as well as income tax returns after indexation of the cost
			<lb />
			of acquisition. This was an additional ground for the AO to reject the plea of
			<lb />
			the Assessee that the payment of compensation was business expenditure.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, the payment of compensation towards &quot;repurchase of the flat&quot;
			<lb />
			was disallowed by holding that it was &quot;a capital expenditure.&quot; The said
			<lb />
			amount was added back to the income of the Assessee.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Order of the CIT (A)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			8. In the appeal filed by the Assessee, the Commissioner of Income Tax
			<lb />
			Appeals [&quot;CIT (A)&quot;] by order dated 30 th October, 1998 came to the
			<lb />
			following conclusions:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(i) There was no dispute that the Assessee was engaged in the business of
			<lb />
			real estate and the space constructed by it constituted its stock and trade;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ii) The expenditure in relation to stock and trade would be of revenue
			<lb />
			nature whether incurred on purchase of stock and trade or compensation for
			<lb />
			retaining of stock and trade. Expenditure on stock and trade did not
			<lb />
			represent investment of capital nature;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(iii) The same transaction can be of capital nature in the hands of one person
			<lb />
			and of revenue nature in the hand of the other on account of the different
			<lb />
			nature of their business activities. Therefore, the AO&quot;s view that since the
			<lb />
			recipients of compensation i.e. the allottees had treated it in their hands as
			<lb />
			capital gains, they should be treated as capital expenditure in the hands of
			<lb />
			the Assessee, was not based on sound reasoning.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(iv) Expenditure on purchase of stock and trade is charged to the P&amp;L and
			<lb />
			trading account at the time of purchase, which cannot be deferred. The
			<lb />
			observation of the AO that the Appellant was free to claim the deduction as
			<lb />
			cost is paid at the time of their sale was not in conformity with the principles
			<lb />
			of accountancy.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			9. Accordingly the compensation paid to the allottees of the flats for their
			<lb />
			surrendering the rights therein was directed to be allowed as business
			<lb />
			expenditure of the Assessee, and the view of the AO was, therefore,
			<lb />
			reversed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Impugned order of the ITAT
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			10. The Revenue went in appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
			<lb />
			(&quot;ITAT&quot;) by way of ITA No.469/Del/99 for AY 1995-96. The ITAT took
			<lb />
			note of the plea of the Assessee before it that in case the Assessee had not
			<lb />
			taken back the space pursuant to the cancellation of booking, &quot;there was
			<lb />
			every likelihood of some bigger loss to be suffered since the discontinued
			<lb />
			parties/persons would cause all types of obstruction.&quot; The Assessee further
			<lb />
			contended that &quot;non-payment of compensation would have resulted in loss
			<lb />
			of reputation which the Assessee could not afford in its land of business.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			11. The ITAT raised certain queries and required the Assessee to place on
			<lb />
			record facts relating to the payment of &quot;compensation&quot;. The ITAT sought
			<lb />
			clarification whether
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;(i) Compensation was insisted upon by the parties/persons;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Whether legal opinion was sought before parting with the
			<lb />
			compensation; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) Whether payment of compensation was&apos; provided for in the
			<lb />
			agreement entered into at the time of the booking.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			12. Documents were then placed before the ITAT by the Assessee which it
			<lb />
			analysed. In the impugned order, the ITAT arrived at the following
			<lb />
			conclusions:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i) Although in the space buyer&quot;s agreement, the amount given for booking
			<lb />
			of the flat is to be refunded along with the interest in certain eventualities,
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			&quot;nothing over and above&quot; the said sum was payable and the term
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			&quot;compensation&quot; does not appear in either the letter of allotment or in the
			<lb />
			space buyer&quot;s agreement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ii) The compensation amount had no relationship whatsoever either with
			<lb />
			the area comprising a flat booked or with reference to the total amount paid
			<lb />
			to the Assessee. There was no material which could justify the &quot;quantum of
			<lb />
			payments stated to be the compensation to various persons.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(iii) The opinion given by a lawyer justifying the payment of compensation,
			<lb />
			stating that since it would ultimately enhance the value of the space which
			<lb />
			could then be sold at a higher price to another buyer, was &quot;a tailor-made
			<lb />
			opinion&quot;. The huge amounts paid by the Assessee as compensation, even
			<lb />
			when the agreement between the parties did not require it, was not justified
			<lb />
			event accounting for the cost of litigation that might ensue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(iv) The payment was for &quot;extraneous considerations&quot; and was not
			<lb />
			expenditure that was &quot;expedient to the Assessee&quot;s business.&quot; The
			<lb />
			compensation was not provided for an agreement between the parties and
			<lb />
			the expenditure towards compensation &quot;far outstripped any expenditure
			<lb />
			whether legal or otherwise, which the Assessee was supposed to incur in the
			<lb />
			eventuality of some of the persons opting out of the agreement to purchase
			<lb />
			flats.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			13. Consequently, the ITAT by its order dated 28 th February 2002 set aside
			<lb />
			the order of the CIT (A) and restored the order of the AO. The said order has
			<lb />
			been challenged by the Assessee by filing ITA No. 210 of 2003 which
			<lb />
			pertains to AY 1995-96. The solitary question of law framed by this Court
			<lb />
			while admitting this appeal on 12 th October 2004 was &quot;whether the
			<lb />
			conclusion recorded by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (&quot;ITAT&quot;) that the
			<lb />
			compensation of Rs.11838705 was paid for &quot;extraneous consideration&quot; is not
			<lb />
			perverse and contrary to the record?&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			14. In the appeal for AY 1997-98, the ITAT while dealing with the above
			<lb />
			question, disagreed with its own view taken in AY 1995-96 and accepted the
			<lb />
			plea of the Assessee that the said payment of compensation was in the nature
			<lb />
			of revenue expenditure. The ITAT was of the same view in the appeals for
			<lb />
			AYs 1996-97, 1999-2000, 2001-02, 2008-09, 2009-10. This explains why
			<lb />
			the appeals for all the remaining years, apart from AY 1995-96 on this
			<lb />
			aspect are by the Revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. M.S. Syali, learned Senior
			<lb />
			Counsel appearing for the Assessee and Ms. Vibhooti Malhotra, learned
			<lb />
			counsel for the Revenue.
			<lb />
			Analysis and reasons
			<lb />
			16. A fact which has not been addressed by either the AO or the ITAT is that
			<lb />
			the Assessee follows the CCM and not the PCM. AS 7 which was originally
			<lb />
			issued by the ICAI in December 1983 was first revised in 2002. The revised
			<lb />
			AS 7 came into effect in respect of &quot;all contracts entered into during the
			<lb />
			accounting period commencing on or after 1 st April 2003.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17. Therefore, as far as the case in hand is concerned, since there is no
			<lb />
			dispute that the Gopal Das Bhawan Project was completed in FY 1994-95, it
			<lb />
			is AS 7, pre-revised, which would apply. AS 7 as issued in December 1983
			<lb />
			is titled &quot;Accounting for Construction Contracts&quot;. Para 7.1 acknowledges
			<lb />
			the two methods of accounting that are commonly followed: the CCM and
			<lb />
			the PCM. Para 7.3 states that under the CCM,
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;revenue is recognised only when the contract is completed or
			<lb />
			substantially completed; that is, when only minor work is
			<lb />
			expected other than warranty obligation. Costs and progress
			<lb />
			payments received are accumulated during the course of the
			<lb />
			contract but revenue is not recognised until the contract activity
			<lb />
			is substantially completed.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			18. Para 8 of AS 7 talks of &quot;Costs to be Accumulated for Construction
			<lb />
			Contracts&quot;. Para 8.1 states that
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Costs attributable to a contract are identified with reference to
			<lb />
			the period that commences with the securing of the contract and
			<lb />
			closes when the contract is completed.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			19. Under para 8.4, the costs incurred by a contractor are stated to be divided
			<lb />
			into
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;i. Costs that relate directly to a specific contract;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			ii. Costs that can be attributed to the contract activity in general
			<lb />
			and can be allocated to specific contracts;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			iii. Costs that relate to the activities of the contractor generally,
			<lb />
			or that relate to contract activity but cannot be related to
			<lb />
			specific contracts.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			20. Para 8.7 of AS 7 elaborates what 8.4 (iii) talks of, viz., examples of costs
			<lb />
			that relate to the activities of the contractor generally, or that relate to
			<lb />
			contract activity but cannot be related to specific contracts. These include:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;i. general administration and selling costs;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			ii. finance costs;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			iii. research and development costs;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			iv. depreciation of plant and equipment that cannot be allocated
			<lb />
			to a particular contract.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			21. The pros and cons of the CCM are discussed in para 10. Para 11.2 of AS
			<lb />
			7 states that when a contractor uses a particular method of accounting for a
			<lb />
			contract, &quot;then in respect of all other contracts that meet similar criteria, the
			<lb />
			same method is used.&quot; Para 11.3 states that the methods of accounting used
			<lb />
			by the contractor and the criteria adopted in selecting the method represents
			<lb />
			&quot;an accounting policy.&quot; If the contractor changes from PCM to CCM or vice
			<lb />
			versa, there has to be a disclosure to the effect of the change and its amount.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			22. It must be added here that as far as the present cases are concerned, in all
			<lb />
			the AYs in question, the Assessee has followed a consistent accounting
			<lb />
			policy by following the CCM. The Revenue has never disputed that the
			<lb />
			Assessee follows the CCM and, therefore, what logically flows from the
			<lb />
			adoption of such accounting policy by the Assessee cannot be overlooked by
			<lb />
			the Revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			23. One of the basic principles of accountancy is that an expenditure
			<lb />
			incurred in relation to stock and trade would be of revenue nature. There can
			<lb />
			be no doubt that the unsold flats that had been surrendered to the Assessee
			<lb />
			were part of its stock and trade. The AO himself noted that the Assessee had
			<lb />
			booked the flats to various persons after receiving periodical amounts as
			<lb />
			advance. They were termed as &quot;prospective buyers.&quot; It was also noted that
			<lb />
			after completion of construction, the flats had been &quot;allotted to these persons
			<lb />
			and possession had also been handed over to them.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			24. There is merit in the contention of the Assessee that it had not
			<lb />
			&quot;repurchased the flats from the buyers.&quot; The stage of parting with
			<lb />
			title/ownership in relation to commercial space allotted to the buyers had not
			<lb />
			been reached. The AO himself noted that &quot;since the Assessee has not sold
			<lb />
			the space which has been surrendered by the buyers/allottees, therefore, the
			<lb />
			compensation paid in lieu of surrender of rights in flats/space shown in work
			<lb />
			and progress in balance-sheet will enhance the value of work and progress.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			25. It was contended by Ms. Malhotra that even if the compensation paid for
			<lb />
			the surrender of the flats is not treated as capital expenditure, it should form
			<lb />
			part of the valuation of stock. In reply, Mr. Syali pointed out that the
			<lb />
			Assessee has explained that the reason for payment of compensation was
			<lb />
			that the LGF initially was approved by NDMC as &quot;airconditioned space&quot;
			<lb />
			and, therefore, while booking that space, prospective buyers proceeded on
			<lb />
			the basis that it would be for commercial use. However, in terms of the
			<lb />
			completion certificate issued by the NDMC, the LGF was sanctioned as
			<lb />
			&quot;storage.&quot; It was for this reason that the buyers lost interest. The Assessee
			<lb />
			then decided to return the advance received and also compensate the buyers
			<lb />
			since the buyers&quot; funds had remained with the Assessee for some time. The
			<lb />
			Assessee had sought to explain that this compensation corresponded to the
			<lb />
			increase in the resale value.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			26. There is merit in the contention of the Assessee, based on AS 2 that
			<lb />
			compensation paid subsequent to the completion of the project is an
			<lb />
			&quot;extraordinary item.&quot; It was not &quot;cost&quot; of completion of the project and,
			<lb />
			therefore, such compensation could not be added to the value of the stock
			<lb />
			and trade of the Assessee. AS 2 governs valuation of inventories. &quot;Cost&quot;
			<lb />
			comprises all of the costs of purchase, cost of completion and other costs
			<lb />
			incurred &quot;in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.&quot;
			<lb />
			That which is not relevant to bringing the stock to its present condition or
			<lb />
			location cannot be a part of its value.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			27. Under AS 2, not everything that relates to stock can be added to its
			<lb />
			value. The following have to be &quot;excluded from cost&quot; and &quot;recognized as
			<lb />
			expense&quot;:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;(a) abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labour, or other
			<lb />
			production costs;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) storage costs, unless those costs are necessary in the
			<lb />
			production process prior to a further production stage;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c) administrative overheads that do not contribute to bringing
			<lb />
			the inventories to their present location and condition; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(d) selling and distribution costs.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			28. There is, therefore, merit in the contention of the Assessee that the
			<lb />
			compensation paid to the flat buyers upon surrender of the respective
			<lb />
			allotted commercial spaces cannot be added to the value of &quot;stock and trade.&quot;
			<lb />
			In the considered view of the Court, the view expressed by the CIT (A)
			<lb />
			merits acceptance. The conclusion of the ITAT that the payment was made
			<lb />
			for &quot;extraneous consideration&quot; appears to be based on surmises and
			<lb />
			conjectures.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			29. The mere fact that the space buyer&quot;s agreement or the allotment letter
			<lb />
			did not mandate payment of compensation would not come in the way of the
			<lb />
			Assessee treating such payment as &quot;revenue expenditure.&quot; In Shahzada
			<lb />
			Nand &amp; Sons v. CIT, Patiala (1977) 108 ITR 358 (SC) it was held that the
			<lb />
			requirement of &quot;commercial expediency&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;must be judged not in the light of the 19th century laissez faire
			<lb />
			doctrine which regarded man as an economic being concerned
			<lb />
			only to protect and advance his self-interest but in the context
			<lb />
			of current socio-economic thinking which places the general
			<lb />
			interest of the community above the personal interest of the
			<lb />
			individual and believes that a business or undertaking is the
			<lb />
			product of the combined efforts of the employer and the
			<lb />
			employees and where there is sufficiently large profit, after
			<lb />
			providing for the salary or remuneration of the employer and
			<lb />
			the employees and other prior charges such as interest on
			<lb />
			capital, depreciation, reserves, etc., a part of it should in all
			<lb />
			fairness go to the employees.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			30. In the said case the Supreme Court was considering whether payment for
			<lb />
			the extra services rendered by an employee could be allowed as business
			<lb />
			expenditure. It was held that for the purposes of allowing commercial pay to
			<lb />
			an employee as expenditure under Section 36 (1) (ii) of the Act, it had to
			<lb />
			necessarily be paid pursuant to a contractual obligation. The mere fact that
			<lb />
			the commission was paid &quot;ex gratia&quot; would not necessarily mean it is
			<lb />
			unreasonable. It was observed &quot;even where the nature of the work as remain
			<lb />
			the same, commercial expediency may require payment of commission to an
			<lb />
			employee.&quot; The payment was allowed as business expenditure.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			31. In Commissioner of Income Tax, U.P. v. Nainital Bank Ltd. (1966) 62
			<lb />
			ITR 638 (SC) the Assessee bank had settled the claims of those who had
			<lb />
			pledged their jewellery with the Bank which was stolen by dacoits. The
			<lb />
			question was whether such payments could be allowed as business
			<lb />
			expenditure under Section 10(2)(xv) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922? It
			<lb />
			was acknowledged that
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;In choosing to compensate its constituents for the loss of their
			<lb />
			jewellery and maintain its business connections and goodwill,
			<lb />
			the bank laid out expenditure for the purpose of its business.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			32. It was further explained that
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The sole question is whether the bank in incurring the
			<lb />
			expenditure acted in the interest of and for the purpose of its
			<lb />
			business. The bank is carrying on banking business and
			<lb />
			advances loans on the security of jewellery. The credit of a
			<lb />
			banking business is very sensitive: it largely thrives upon the
			<lb />
			confidence which its constituents have in its management. To
			<lb />
			maintain that confidence the management has often to make
			<lb />
			concessions and thereby to preserve the goodwill of the
			<lb />
			business and its relations with the clientele. The bank could
			<lb />
			have, if so advised, taken its stand strictly on its legal
			<lb />
			obligations, and could have recovered the amounts due by the
			<lb />
			constituents at the same time denying liability to make any
			<lb />
			compensation for the loss of jewellery pledged with it. But such
			<lb />
			a stand might very well have ruined its business, especially in
			<lb />
			the rural areas in which it operated. The bank had evidently two
			<lb />
			courses open: to enforce its rights strictly according to law, and
			<lb />
			thereby to lose the goodwill it had built up among the
			<lb />
			constituents, or to compensate the constituents for loss of their
			<lb />
			jewellery, and maintain its business connections and goodwill.
			<lb />
			In choosing the second alternative, in our judgment, the bank
			<lb />
			laid out expenditure for the purpose of its business. Paying to
			<lb />
			the constituents the price of the jewellery stolen in a robbery or
			<lb />
			a burglary was therefore expenditure for the purpose of the
			<lb />
			business. There can be no doubt that the expenditure was
			<lb />
			wholly and exclusively in the interest of the business. The
			<lb />
			expenditure was laid out for no other purpose.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			33. Applying the law explained by the Supreme Court in the above decisions
			<lb />
			to the case in hand, the plausible conclusion is that the compensation paid by
			<lb />
			the Assessee to the allottees of the commercial spaces for the surrender of
			<lb />
			their rights therein cannot be said to be disallowable on the ground of such
			<lb />
			payment having been made for &quot;extraneous considerations.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			34. In Kanga and Palkhivala&quot;s Commentary on the Income Tax Law
			<lb />
			Volume 1, the distinction between the expressions &quot;for the purpose of
			<lb />
			earning profits&quot; and &quot;for purpose of the business&quot; was brought out as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;11. Wholly and Exclusively for the Purposes of the Business.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) Purpose of Business-Before the corresponding section in
			<lb />
			the 1922 Act was amended in 1939, allowance was given in
			<lb />
			respect of any non-capital expenditure &quot;incurred solely for the
			<lb />
			purpose of earning such profits or gains.&quot; Under the present
			<lb />
			law, the expenditure should be laid out &quot;wholly and exclusively
			<lb />
			for the purposes of the business.&quot; The two expressions are not
			<lb />
			synonymous; the latter is wider than the former. Expenditure
			<lb />
			may be for the purpose of the business although it may not be
			<lb />
			incurred for the purpose of earning the profits of the business.
			<lb />
			This is established by the decision of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. CIT 63 ITR 207. The expression &quot;for
			<lb />
			the purposes of business&quot; is wider than the expression &quot;for the
			<lb />
			purpose of earning income.&quot; The former would include within
			<lb />
			its scope expenditure incurred on grounds of commercial
			<lb />
			expediency.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			35. In the present case, the Assessee has a plausible explanation for making
			<lb />
			such payment of compensation to protect its &quot;business interests.&quot; While it is
			<lb />
			true that there was no &quot;contractual obligation&quot; to make the payment, it is
			<lb />
			plain that the Assessee was also looking to build its own reputation in the
			<lb />
			real estate market.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			36. Further the mere fact that the recipients treated the said payment as
			<lb />
			&quot;capital gains&quot; in their hands in their returns would not be relevant in
			<lb />
			deciding the issue whether the payment by the Assessee should be treated as
			<lb />
			&quot;business expenditure.&quot; As explained by the Madras High Court in CIT v.
			<lb />
			Sarda Binding Works 102 ITR 187 (Mad), it is the point of view of the
			<lb />
			payer which is relevant.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			37. The decision in CIT v. Mangal Tirth Estates Ltd. 303 ITR 366 (Mad)
			<lb />
			was a case where the Assessee therein had also followed the CCM. It was
			<lb />
			engaged in the business of construction and sale of a multi-storeyed office
			<lb />
			cum shopping complex. The Assessee had under the development agreement
			<lb />
			agreed to provide air conditioning to the shops and to also allot car park
			<lb />
			space. The Assessee claimed deduction on advertisement, sales promotion,
			<lb />
			legal charges and claimed losses in its return. The AO rejected the claim on
			<lb />
			the ground that only a portion of the expenditure related to the space already
			<lb />
			constructed could be allowed. It was held that since the Assessee had
			<lb />
			maintained the system of accounts on mercantile basis by adopting CCM,
			<lb />
			the revenue expenditure &quot;normally, must be allowed in its entirety in the
			<lb />
			year in which it was incurred. The Assessee was held entitled to deduction
			<lb />
			of the entire legal and advertisement expenses in the year in which it was
			<lb />
			incurred.&quot; On a similar analogy, in the present case, the payment of
			<lb />
			compensation is to be allowed in full in the year of payment of such
			<lb />
			compensation.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			38. The result of the above discussion is that the Court holds that the
			<lb />
			payment made by the Assessee to the allottees of the flats for their
			<lb />
			surrendering the rights therein should be allowed as business expenditure of
			<lb />
			the Assessee.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			39. This Court accordingly answers the question of law framed in ITA 210
			<lb />
			of 2003 the affirmative i.e. in favour of the Assessee and against the
			<lb />
			Revenue by holding that the conclusion recorded by the ITAT that the
			<lb />
			compensation of Rs.11838705 was paid by the Assessee for &quot;extraneous
			<lb />
			consideration&quot; is perverse and contrary to the record.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			40. ITA 210 of 2003 filed by the Assessee is accordingly allowed.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, the appeals of the Revenue vis-à-vis the said issue would fail.
			<lb />
			However, the Court proposes to pass separate orders in each of the appeals.
			<lb />
			Is rental income business income or income from house property?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			41. The next issue that arises is whether rental income earned by the
			<lb />
			Assessee from its stock and trade should be treated as income from house
			<lb />
			property (IHP), as claimed by the Assessee, or as business income?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			42. The question arose even in AY 1995-96 where the AO by order dated
			<lb />
			27 th March 1998 assessed the said rental income as &quot;income from business.&quot;
			<lb />
			During AY 1995-96 the Assessee had shown a sum of Rs.2,09,40,492 as a
			<lb />
			rental income from the flat/space given on rent to various parties. These
			<lb />
			spaces/flats were part of the stock and trade and the rental income was
			<lb />
			claimed as income from house property. The Assessee also claimed
			<lb />
			deduction of 1/5 th of the repairs amounting to Rs. 41,29,837 under Section
			<lb />
			24 of the Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			43. During the assessment proceedings, in its reply dated 15 th December
			<lb />
			1997 to the query raised by the AO, the Assessee pointed out that there is
			<lb />
			nothing in law which prohibited the leasing out of stock and trade. It relied
			<lb />
			on the decision in CIT v. Chagan Das and Company 54 ITR 17 where the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court held that where a person buys and sells property, the income
			<lb />
			from that activity should be assessed as business income whereas the rental
			<lb />
			income from such property is assessed as income from house property.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			44. For AY 1995-96, the CIT (A) in the order dated 30 th October 1998
			<lb />
			agreed with the Assessee and held that as the Assessee was the owner of the
			<lb />
			property which had been let out otherwise than in the course of business of
			<lb />
			letting and subletting, the rental income had to be assessed as IHP. It was
			<lb />
			noted that
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The appellant had entered into an agreement with the co-
			<lb />
			owners of the leasehold land for construction of the property at
			<lb />
			the cost of the appellant. On completion of the building, the co-
			<lb />
			owners were entitled to the specific share and the balance space
			<lb />
			belonged to the appellant which it was free to assign or sell or
			<lb />
			otherwise transfer to any person, firm, company or association.
			<lb />
			There is therefore no doubt that the• appellant had acquired the
			<lb />
			ownership of its share of the space.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			45. The ITAT in its order dated 28 th February 2002 for AY 1995-96 was of
			<lb />
			the view that on this aspect, no interference was warranted with the order of
			<lb />
			the CIT(A) whereby rental income was taxed under the head IHP. The
			<lb />
			Revenue file ITA 69 of 2003 in this Court which was dismissed by an order
			<lb />
			dated 8 th January 2004. The said order became final.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			46. The ITAT appears to have been consistent in this view. For AY 1997-98,
			<lb />
			the ITAT again held in favour of the Assessee on this issue. The Revenue
			<lb />
			then filed ITA No.772 of 2005 in this Court. However, by an order dated
			<lb />
			10 th October 2007, this Court declined to interfere on the ground that the
			<lb />
			Revenue&quot;s appeal ITA No.69 of 2003 for AY 1995-96 had been dismissed
			<lb />
			by this Court by an order dated 8 th January 2004. This Court noted that the
			<lb />
			Revenue accepted that decision and did not challenge it any further.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, the Court declined to frame any substantial question of law on
			<lb />
			this issue. The said order dated 10 th October 2007 on this aspect does not
			<lb />
			appear to have been challenged further by the Revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			47. The resultant position as far as AYs 1995-96 and 1997-98 are concerned
			<lb />
			is that the Revenue has accepted the finding of the ITAT as affirmed by this
			<lb />
			Court.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			48. For AY 1996-97, the ITAT decided the issue following its decision for
			<lb />
			AY 1997-98 which, as already noticed, attained finality. However, the
			<lb />
			Revenue chose to challenge the ITAT&quot;s finding on the issue for AY 1996-97
			<lb />
			by filing ITA 2078 of 2010. This Court while admitting the said appeal on
			<lb />
			3 rd January 2011 framed a question of law, viz., whether the rental income is
			<lb />
			to be assessed as IHP or as business income?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			49. The Court finds that barring this one year i.e. AY 1996-97, in all the
			<lb />
			other AYs, the consistent view of the ITAT that rental income is to be
			<lb />
			assessed as IHP and not business income has been accepted by the Revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			50. Ms. Malhotra was unable to point out why only for AY 1996-97 a
			<lb />
			different view should be taken. Both Ms. Malhotra for the Revenue and Mr.
			<lb />
			Syali for the Assessee have placed reliance on the decision of this Court in
			<lb />
			Ansal Housing Finance Company Ltd. (2013) 354 ITR 180 (Del) as
			<lb />
			supporting their respective cases. A careful perusal of the said judgment
			<lb />
			shows that the point in fact is answered in favour of the Assessee and not
			<lb />
			against it.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			51.1 Ms. Malhotra sought to rely on the decision in Chennai Properties and
			<lb />
			Investments Ltd. v. CIT (2015) 373 ITR 673 (SC) as supporting the case of
			<lb />
			the Revenue. However, this Court is not able to agree with the above
			<lb />
			submission. In the said case, the object of the Appellant Assessee company
			<lb />
			was to acquire and let out properties in the city. The rental income received
			<lb />
			therefrom was shown as income from business in the return filed by the
			<lb />
			Assessee.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			51.2 The AO, however, held that since the income was received from the
			<lb />
			letting out of properties, it was in the nature of rental income, and
			<lb />
			accordingly taxed the same accordingly under that head. The CIT(A)
			<lb />
			allowed the appeal of the Assessee by holding that income was from
			<lb />
			business and directed that it should be treated and taxed as such. The ITAT
			<lb />
			resultantly confirmed the order.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			51.3 The High Court allowed the appeal of the Revenue by holding that the
			<lb />
			income derived by letting out of properties would not be income from
			<lb />
			business but instead could only be assessed as income from house property.
			<lb />
			The Supreme Court in a further appeal by the Assessee observed that the
			<lb />
			main object of the Assessee company was to acquire and hold properties and
			<lb />
			let out the same and that in the return filed, the entire income which was
			<lb />
			assessed therein was from letting out of such properties. It was further
			<lb />
			observed that &quot;letting out of properties is in fact the business of the
			<lb />
			Assessee.&quot; Applying the judgment in Karanpura Development Co. Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal 44 ITR 362 (SC), the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court held that the Assessee had rightly disclosed the income under the head
			<lb />
			&quot;Income from Business&quot; and restored the decision of the ITAT.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			51.4 The said decision is distinguishable on fact in its application to the case
			<lb />
			on hand. Here the question is confined to the letting of properties forming
			<lb />
			part of the Assessee&quot;s stock in trade. Barring AY 1996-97, for all other AYs
			<lb />
			the consistent view taken by the ITAT, as has been affirmed by this Court
			<lb />
			and accepted by the Revenue is that it should be treated as IHP.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			52. The rule of consistency as explained by the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Parashuram Pottery Works Ltd. v. Income Tax Officer, [1977] 106 ITR 1
			<lb />
			(SC) and Radhasoami Satsang Saomi Bagh v. Commissioner of Income
			<lb />
			Tax, [1992] 193 ITR 321 (SC) was reiterated by it in CIT v. Excel
			<lb />
			Industries Ltd. (2014) 13 SCC 459 in the following manner:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			31. It appears from the record that in several assessment
			<lb />
			years, the Revenue accepted the order of the Tribunal in
			<lb />
			favour of the assessee and did not pursue the matter any
			<lb />
			further but in respect of some assessment years the matter
			<lb />
			was taken up in appeal before the Bombay High Court
			<lb />
			but without any success. That being so, the Revenue
			<lb />
			cannot be allowed to flip-flop on the issue and it ought let
			<lb />
			the matter rest rather than spend the tax payers&quot; money in
			<lb />
			pursuing litigation for the sake of it.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			53. Following the rule of consistency as explained in the above decisions,
			<lb />
			this Court declines to entertain the plea of the Revenue which appears to be
			<lb />
			confined to AY 1996-97, with none of the earlier or subsequent AYs being
			<lb />
			challenged by the Revenue. Accordingly, the issue is decided in favour of
			<lb />
			the Assessee and against the Revenue by answering the question in the
			<lb />
			affirmative and holding that the rental income of the Assessee from the
			<lb />
			properties forming part of its stock-in-trade would be IHP and not business
			<lb />
			income. ITA 2078 of 2010 being the appeal of the Revenue for AY 1996-97
			<lb />
			is accordingly dismissed.
			<lb />
			Brokerage and Commission
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			54. The next major issue concerns the expenditure on brokerage and
			<lb />
			commission. The issue arose in AY 1995-96 when the Assessee debited
			<lb />
			Rs.1,45,25,708 to the P&amp;L account as brokerage and commission towards
			<lb />
			service rendered by brokers for sale of flats and leasing out commercial
			<lb />
			spaces/flats.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			55. According to the AO, the amount so paid appeared to be extraordinary.
			<lb />
			The Assessee&quot;s plea was that the brokers were demanding higher amounts as
			<lb />
			they were not being compensated with income which may accrue to the
			<lb />
			owners in future because of the interest free element of the huge amount
			<lb />
			comprising security deposit, advance rent etc. Further the payments had
			<lb />
			been made through account payee checks purely on commercial
			<lb />
			consideration.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			56. The AO, however, did not agree and disallowed Rs.41,84,947 as being
			<lb />
			in excess and unreasonable and valued back for the income of Assessee. In
			<lb />
			appeal, the CIT(A) reversed the AO on the ground that it is not for the AO to
			<lb />
			determine the reasonableness or otherwise of the expenditure. In the further
			<lb />
			appeal by the Revenue for AY 1995-96, the ITAT in its order dated 28 th
			<lb />
			February 2002 agreed with the stand of the CIT(A).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			57. For AY 1995-96, the Revenue filed ITA No.69 of 2003 in this Court
			<lb />
			raising a question on this issue but it was not admitted by this Court by the
			<lb />
			order dated 8 th January 2004. Likewise, for AY 1997-98, when the ITAT
			<lb />
			followed its earlier order the Revenue filed ITA 772 of 2005. This Court did
			<lb />
			not frame any question on this issue following its earlier order dated 8 th
			<lb />
			January 2004 in ITA 69 of 2003.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			58. Again, only for AY 1996-97, the Revenue&quot;s appeal ITA 2078 of 2010 on
			<lb />
			this issue was admitted by this Court by its order dated 3 rd January 2011.
			<lb />
			The Assessee has pointed out that for all the subsequent years i.e. AY 1999-
			<lb />
			2000, 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04 the appeals of the Revenue on this
			<lb />
			question i.e. ITA Nos. 581 of 2010, 548 of 2010, 742 of 2008 and 400 of
			<lb />
			2009 did not even raise this issue. In other words, for all of the above years
			<lb />
			except AY 1996-97, the Revenue accepted the case of the Assessee.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			59. Following the rule of consistency, this Court finds no merit in the
			<lb />
			contention of the Revenue and this question is accordingly answered in
			<lb />
			favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue. ITA 2078 of 2010 filed by
			<lb />
			the Revenue on this aspect is accordingly dismissed.
			<lb />
			Expenditure on foreign travel
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			60. The next issue arising in the ITA 2078 of 2010 for AY 1996-97 concerns
			<lb />
			expenditure on foreign travel. During AY 1996-97, the Assessee incurred
			<lb />
			Rs.15,82,083 on foreign travel of its employees. This was to promote the
			<lb />
			sale and leasing out of the Assessee&quot;s commercial space and as a result of
			<lb />
			the said visits, space was leased to Bank of Korea and the Korea
			<lb />
			Development Bank. The AO disallowed the expenditure holding that it
			<lb />
			could not be allowed as expenditure against income from house property.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			61. The CIT(A) reversed this finding of the AO holding that the lease of
			<lb />
			space is a part of the Assessee&quot;s business and such expenditure incurred on
			<lb />
			the lease is a part of the business and such expenditure and exploitation of
			<lb />
			the stock in trade is admissible as business expenditure.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			62. The ITAT reversed the ruling of the CIT (A) and upheld the decision of
			<lb />
			the AO to the extent disallowing 50% of the foreign travel expenditure.
			<lb />
			This issue is similar to the issue of brokerage and commission which was
			<lb />
			held allowable and accepted by the Revenue for all of the AYs in question
			<lb />
			except for AY 1996-97. Again, following the rule of consistency, this Court
			<lb />
			answers this issue in favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue.
			<lb />
			Interest and guarantee commission
			<lb />
			63. The next issue is the treatment of the amount paid by the Assessee on
			<lb />
			account of interest and guarantee commission. The AO sought to add this
			<lb />
			amount for AY 1996-97 to the Assessee&quot;s income on the ground that the
			<lb />
			loan raised from the Bank by the Assessee was given to its sister concern
			<lb />
			without charging interest. The ITAT, however, deleted the addition.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			64. The facts in brief for AY 1997-98 were that the interest amount of
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			Rs.32225676 comprised the following
			<lb />
			 &quot;Rs.1,07,91,828/-on CC limit, paid to IndusInd Bank
			<lb />
			Ltd.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			 Rs.2,14,33,848/-on loan of Rs.9 Cr. taken from Citi
			<lb />
			Bank.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			65. The AO disallowed the interest paid to IndusInd Bank on the ground that
			<lb />
			the interest was required to be capitalized under the head of &quot;capital work
			<lb />
			and progress.&quot; In fact in AYs 1992-93, 1993-94 and 1994-95, the Assessee
			<lb />
			itself had capitalised interest in the capital work and progress. The cash
			<lb />
			credit limit available to the Assessee was used by it to give a loan to its
			<lb />
			sister concerns for purchasing land in Gurgaon.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			66. As regards the payment of interest to Citi Bank, the Assessee explained
			<lb />
			that it had provided interest free finance to associate companies for purchase
			<lb />
			of 105 acres of land. As against the interest burden of Rs.2 crores per year,
			<lb />
			the Assessee would receive Rs.1.05 crore in 5 instalments.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			67. According to the AO, given that the aggregate interest burden was Rs.10
			<lb />
			crores up to 31 st March in the relevant year, the Assessee would get only 1
			<lb />
			lac per acre, the interest was not incurred for the purposes of the Assessee&quot;s
			<lb />
			own business but to benefit associate companies. The case of the Assessee
			<lb />
			was that as long as the conditions of Sections 36 (1) (iii) of the Act are met,
			<lb />
			deduction of interest cannot be denied merely because the Assessee was a
			<lb />
			cash rich company having enough resources of its own.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			68. It is pointed out that in the earlier years Gopal Das Bhawan was still
			<lb />
			under construction and the interest was capitalised only up to the stage of
			<lb />
			completion of the project under &quot;capital work and progress.&quot; The interest on
			<lb />
			the CC limit for the subsequent period, after completion of project, was
			<lb />
			rightly claimed and allowed as a revenue expense.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			69. It is explained by the Assessee that the CC limit was not in respect of the
			<lb />
			Ardee City Project which had been taken up only in 1995 by entering into an
			<lb />
			Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the associate companies. It is
			<lb />
			explained that on account of the land ceiling laws in Haryana, more than 20
			<lb />
			acres of agricultural land could not be purchased by one entity. To set up a
			<lb />
			colony, a developer had to have a number of associate companies to acquire
			<lb />
			contiguous land of 100 acres and this led to entering into the MoU with the
			<lb />
			associate companies on 17 th March 2005. Clause 2 of the MoU provided that
			<lb />
			the Assessee would arrange the funds for purchase of the lands. Clause 11
			<lb />
			provided for payment of service charge for providing interest free finance.
			<lb />
			Since the Assessee was not eligible to seek licence to develop by itself a
			<lb />
			housing project without acquiring 100 acres of contiguous land interest, free
			<lb />
			advances were given to the associate companies for the purposes of
			<lb />
			Assessee&quot;s business.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			70. The Assessee&quot;s case appears to be supported by the decisions in SA
			<lb />
			Builders v. CIT (2007) 288 ITR 1 (SC) which has been followed in Hero
			<lb />
			Cycles v. CIT (2015) 379 ITR 347. The ratio of the decision of the Bombay
			<lb />
			High Court in CIT v. Lokhandwala Constructions Industries Ltd. (2003)
			<lb />
			260 ITR 579 (Bom) was rightly relied upon by the ITAT to allow the plea of
			<lb />
			the Assessee and treat the said interest payments as revenue expenditure. As
			<lb />
			explained in CIT v. Bombay Samachar Ltd. (1969) 74 ITR 723 (Bom) and
			<lb />
			this Court in Regal Theatre v. CIT (1997) 225 ITR 205 (Del) and CIT v.
			<lb />
			Gautam Motors (2011) 334 ITR 326 (Del) merely because the Assessee was
			<lb />
			a cash rich company, the payment of interest cannot be disallowed as
			<lb />
			business expenditure.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			71. Further as rightly pointed out, AS 2 would apply in terms of which, with
			<lb />
			the Assessee following the CCM, the expenditure incurred subsequent to the
			<lb />
			completion of the project cannot be attributed to work and had to be allowed
			<lb />
			only as revenue expenditure. Consequently, the question is answered in the
			<lb />
			affirmative in favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue.
			<lb />
			Withdrawal of credit of TDS
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			72. The next issue to be considered is whether the Assessee was liable to
			<lb />
			deduct tax at source (TDS) on the rent received from tenants of properties of
			<lb />
			which the Assessee was not the owner. This issue arises in two AYs i.e.
			<lb />
			1995-96 (ITA 611 of 2005) and 1996-97 (ITA 609 of 2005).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			73. The Assessee let out space in Gopal Das Bhawan for which during AY
			<lb />
			1995-96 the tenants paid rent by deducting TDS. A sum of Rs. 24,65,761 of
			<lb />
			such TDS was claimed by the Assessee as credit. Since the property had
			<lb />
			already been sold, the rent received by the Assessee from the tenants was
			<lb />
			passed on to the respective owners and this was to the tune of
			<lb />
			Rs.1,07,20,754. Besides passing on this rent, the Assessee also deposited
			<lb />
			Rs.25,04,368 as tax on behalf of the owners and TDS certificates were
			<lb />
			issued to such owners.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			74. By virtue of the exercise of power under Section 154, the AO withdrew
			<lb />
			the credit of TDS in the sum of Rs.24,65,761 on the basis that the Assessee
			<lb />
			was not the owner of the property and further that the rent on which tax was
			<lb />
			deducted was not shown as income.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			75. The CIT (A) reversed the finding of the AO taking into account the fact
			<lb />
			that the Assessee had also deposited tax of Rs.25,04,368. Tax on the rent
			<lb />
			had been paid twice: first by the tenants and then by the Assessee.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, it was held that credit of TDS could not be denied to the
			<lb />
			Assessee only because there was no corresponding income. It was held that
			<lb />
			Section 199 cannot be applied to deny credit of TDS. The ITAT upheld the
			<lb />
			order of the CIT (A) on the ground that the issue was a debatable one and
			<lb />
			fell outside the purview of Section 154.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			76. For AY 1996-97, the credit of TDS was Rs. 52,92,346 and the tax
			<lb />
			deposited by the Assessee on behalf of the flat buyers was Rs. 32,81,197.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			77. The Court on considering the submissions of the parties is of the view
			<lb />
			that the AO also did not dispute the fact that the Assessee passed on the rent
			<lb />
			collected to the respective owners. The TDS deducted at the time of such
			<lb />
			passing on of rental income was also deposited by the Assessee. Further, the
			<lb />
			owners did disclose the rental income in their returns. Thus on the one hand,
			<lb />
			there was credit of TDS and on the other hand there was debit of tax paid on
			<lb />
			behalf of the owners.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			78. The Court is of the view that there was no occasion to invoke Section
			<lb />
			154 of the Act, since the issue was a debatable one. The decisions of the CIT
			<lb />
			(A) as affirmed by the ITAT take a plausible view and deserve to be upheld.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			79. For the aforementioned reasons, the Court is of the view that the plea of
			<lb />
			the Assessee should succeed. Accordingly, the question is answered in
			<lb />
			favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Interest under Section 201 (1A)
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			80. The next question is about charging of interest under Section 201(1A).
			<lb />
			The view that while passing on the rents collected to the respective owners
			<lb />
			the Assessee should have deducted TDS. Further, that interest thereon under
			<lb />
			Section 201 (1A) of the Act was also liable to be paid.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			81. While the AO levied interest, the CIT (A) following the order in AY
			<lb />
			1995-96 where it held that the Assessee was not liable to deduct TDS in
			<lb />
			respect of rent received on behalf of others, cancelled the interest. The ITAT
			<lb />
			agreed with the CIT (A).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			82. Under Section 194-I of the Act, the liability to deduct TDS is on the
			<lb />
			tenant paying the rent. The amount passed on to the owners by the Assessee
			<lb />
			was not its capacity as tenant. It is further pointed out that for AY 1998-99
			<lb />
			the Revenue accepted the order of the CIT (A) by not filing any further
			<lb />
			appeal. This issue is also, therefore, accordingly answered in favour of the
			<lb />
			Assessee and against the Revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			83. The issue is answered in the negative i.e. in favour of the Assessee and
			<lb />
			against the Revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Advertisement expenses
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			84. The next issue concerns deduction of advertisement expenses. The claim
			<lb />
			of advertisement and publicity expenses in respect of the Ardee City Project
			<lb />
			was disallowed by the AO for AY 1997-98 on the ground that the Assessee
			<lb />
			was following the CCM and the expenditure should have been debited to
			<lb />
			capital work in progress. The CIT (A) referred to AS 2 issued by the ICAI
			<lb />
			and held that since finance and selling costs are usually excluded from the
			<lb />
			accumulative contract cost, the advertisement expenses was not required to
			<lb />
			be capitalised, even if it was project specific. The ITATT concurred with th
			<lb />
			CIT (A).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			85. The issue is covered by the decision in CIT v. Mangal Tirth Estates Ltd.
			<lb />
			(supra) where in para 41 it was held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;41. The expenses amortized in the accounts consisted of legal
			<lb />
			expenses advertisement expenses and sales promotion
			<lb />
			expenses. As far as legal expenses are concerned the kind of the
			<lb />
			legal expenses incurred demanding the amortization is not
			<lb />
			clearly spelt out. On the expenditure on sales promotion and
			<lb />
			advertisement, given the nature of business of the assessee
			<lb />
			being one of construction and promotion of shopping complex,
			<lb />
			even going by the completed contract method, it is difficult to
			<lb />
			say that it is a one-time affair. Admittedly, the assessee has
			<lb />
			completed one phase of the project. The construction is of the
			<lb />
			whole complex. As such, taking note of the nature of business,
			<lb />
			it is not possible to say that the expenditure incurred for sales
			<lb />
			promotion and advertisement would have relevance to one
			<lb />
			portion alone. In the circumstances, it is difficult to apportion a
			<lb />
			part of this expenditure as relatable to the completed phase
			<lb />
			alone and to carry the balance to future years for adjustment.
			<lb />
			The facts peculiar to the facts of an assessment with reference
			<lb />
			to the maintenance of accounts cannot be ignored. Hence,
			<lb />
			keeping in mind the nature of business and the relevancy of
			<lb />
			expenditure and the character of the same, we uphold the order
			<lb />
			of the Tribunal in so far as legal expenses and advertisement are
			<lb />
			concerned. In the circumstances, we hold that the assessee is
			<lb />
			entitled to have the deduction of the expenditure on
			<lb />
			advertisement and legal expenses in full in the year in which it
			<lb />
			was incurred. On the question of sales promotion charges, the
			<lb />
			Tribunal remanded the matter back to the Assessing Officer to
			<lb />
			consider the claim to the extent law permitted. Taking note of
			<lb />
			the overall facts and the nature of business, we confirm the
			<lb />
			order of the Tribunal on this expenditure.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			86. Further in AYs 1995-96 and 1996-97 a similar expenditure was allowed
			<lb />
			and no question was framed by this Court. The Assessee being in the real
			<lb />
			estate business cannot carry on its business without publicity. The
			<lb />
			expenditure was necessary for the promotion of the business. The question is
			<lb />
			accordingly answered in favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Service charges
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			87. The question whether service charges are allowable as revenue
			<lb />
			expenditure arises for AYs 2001-02 and 2003-04.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			88. The Assessee is admittedly following the CCM. Service charges were
			<lb />
			incurred after the completion of the project and would not be part of the
			<lb />
			capital work in progress. Having been incurred at a stage subsequent to the
			<lb />
			completion of the project it had to be shown as revenue expenditure and was
			<lb />
			rightly allowed as such by the ITAT. This question is also therefore
			<lb />
			answered in favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Scope of Section 154
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			89. The last issue concerns the scope of Section 154 and whether the ITAT
			<lb />
			was right in holding that it could not be invoked by the Revenue in the facts
			<lb />
			and circumstance of the present case.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			90. As rightly pointed out by the Assessee, the issue concerning TDS credit
			<lb />
			was a debatable issue. The question has been admitted only for two years i.e.
			<lb />
			AYs 1995-96 and 1996-97. With the issue indeed being a debatable one the
			<lb />
			ITAT rightly held that there was no occasion for invoking of Section 154 of
			<lb />
			the Act. This view is a plausible one and in view of the settled legal position
			<lb />
			does not call for any interference.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			91. Consequently, this issue is also answered in favour of the Assessee and
			<lb />
			against the Revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Conclusion
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			92. In view of the above discussion:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(i) The questions framed in each of the appeals stand answered in favour of
			<lb />
			the Assessee and against the Revenue;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(ii) ITA 210 of 2003 by the Assessee is allowed and the remaining appeals
			<lb />
			of the Revenue are dismissed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			93. Separate consequential orders will be passed in each of the appeals
			<lb />
			accordingly.
