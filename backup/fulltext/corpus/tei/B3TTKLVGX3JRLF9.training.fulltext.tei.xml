			2.
			<lb />
			Present appeals arise out of a judgment dated 24.11.2014 and order on
			<lb />
			sentence dated 26.11.2014 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge in
			<lb />
			Sessions Case No. 54/10, by virtue of which the appellant Vikas @
			<lb />
			Lala has been convicted under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code
			<lb />
			and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of
			<lb />
			Rs. 20,000/-and in default of the payment of fine to further undergo
			<lb />
			simple imprisonment for two months. The Trial court acquitted the

			other three accused persons for the offences under Sections
			<lb />
			302/323/34 of the Indian Penal Code.

			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;On 21.10.2009 at about 10 pm, Sh. Rakesh Gupta, and
			<lb />
			his son Sunny @ Sanjay Gupta left their house to see
			<lb />
			Ganesh, another vegetable seller. When both of them
			<lb />
			reached in front of H. NO. T-313/16, Baljeet Nagar they
			<lb />
			saw Lala @ Vikas (accused) coming from the side of Lal
			<lb />
			Mandir towards his house. While so coming, he
			<lb />
			intentionally hit Sh. Rakesh Gupta, the latter objected to
			<lb />
			it. Lala @ Vikas accused then slapped Sh. Rakesh Gupta.
			<lb />
			At that time, Smt. Krishna came out of the house and
			<lb />
			grappled with Sh. Rakesh Gupta. When Sunny stepped
			<lb />
			ahead to save his father, Smt. Krishna (accused) and her
			<lb />
			two sons co-accused Rajesh and Naresh @ Tatu started
			<lb />
			grappling with Rakesh Gupta. In the meanwhile, Smt.
			<lb />
			Krishna went to her house and returned with a thick
			<lb />
			danda and started beating Sh. Rakesh Gupta.
			<lb />
			Sunny tried to snatch the danda away, but Rajesh
			<lb />
			(accused) took over danda from his mother and started
			<lb />
			beating Sunny. In the meanwhile Naresh @ Tatu, Vikas
			<lb />
			@ Lala and Smt. Krishna accused started pushing and
			<lb />
			dragging Sh. Rakesh Gupta towards H. No. T-313/14,
			<lb />
			Baljeet Nagar. Sunny tried to save his father. He saw
			<lb />
			Naresh @ Tatu, Rajesh and Smt. Krishna had caught
			<lb />
			hold of his father and Vikas @ Lala dealt a chura blow in
			<lb />
			the chest of his father. As a result, Sh. Rakesh Gupta fell
			<lb />
			in front of T-313/14, Baljeet Nagar in injured condition.
			<lb />
			Sunny rushed to his house to inform his mother but
			<lb />
			accused persons chased him. From near from their
			<lb />
			house, accused persons hurled glass bottle at Sunny. He
			<lb />
			reached his house and told his mother and sister Kuneeta
			<lb />
			about the occurrence. All three then reached the spot and
			<lb />
			found Rakesh Gupta lying there in injured condition.
			<lb />
			Someone informed police by dialing no. 100 that Rakesh
			<lb />
			Gupta was removed from the spot to Janki Dass hospital
			<lb />
			in a rickshaw who declared him brought dead.&quot;

		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			After completion of the investigation, charge sheet for the offence
			<lb />
			under Sections 302/323/34 of the Indian Penal Code was filed. All the
			<lb />
			accused entered the plea of not guilty and claimed trial. The
			<lb />
			prosecution relied on the testimonies of 20 witnesses, besides the
			<lb />
			exhibits produced during the trial. The trial court, after considering the
			<lb />
			same, convicted appellant Vikas @ Lala for an offence under Section
			<lb />
			302 of the Indian Penal Code and acquitted the accused Smt. Krishna
			<lb />
			Devi, Naresh @ Tatu and Rajesh for the reason that the prosecution
			<lb />
			failed to connect them with the crime. The statement under Section
			<lb />
			313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was recorded wherein the
			<lb />
			accused persons denied all the incriminating circumstances appearing
			<lb />
			in evidence against them and claimed to be falsely implicated.
			<lb />
			Arguments raised by the counsel for the Appellant Vikas @ Lala in
			<lb />
			Crl. A. 298/2015
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			Ms. Saahila Lamba, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
			<lb />
			appellant submits that the impugned judgment is based on conjectures
			<lb />
			and surmises and the trial Court has erred in reaching a conclusion of
			<lb />
			guilt against the appellant Vikas @ Lala.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			Ms. Lamba vehemently argued that the testimony on record is so
			<lb />
			interwoven that if it fails in convicting the other accused persons, the
			<lb />
			same testimony could not be used in convicting the appellant Vikas @
			<lb />
			Lala. Counsel further submits that there are material inconsistencies
			<lb />
			and improvements in the testimonies of the material witnesses which
			<lb />
			renders the entire case of the prosecution unreliable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			The counsel for the appellant submits that the case of the prosecution
			<lb />
			is contradictory which does not inspire confidence and the conviction
			<lb />
			cannot be sustained on the basis of a false and concocted story.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			It is further contended by the counsel for the appellant that there was
			<lb />
			no premeditation and the alleged incident happened in the heat of
			<lb />
			passion upon a sudden quarrel. The counsel further contended that the
			<lb />
			alleged incident happened in a spur of moment and since there was no
			<lb />
			intention to kill the deceased and there being a single blow on the
			<lb />
			chest of the deceased, the offence is not made out under
			<lb />
			Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code but it falls under Section 304
			<lb />
			Part II of the Indian Penal Code.
			<lb />
			Arguments raised by learned Counsel for the State in Crl. A. No.
			<lb />
			939/2015
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			With respect to the appeal filed by the State against the order of
			<lb />
			acquittal with regard to accused Smt. Krishna, Rajesh and Naresh @
			<lb />
			Tatu, Ms. Tiwari, learned counsel for the State submits that the entire
			<lb />
			evidence led by the prosecution has not been appreciated by the trial
			<lb />
			court in the correct perspective and the Trial Court has erred in
			<lb />
			overlooking the testimonies of the material witnesses and the
			<lb />
			impugned judgment dated 24.11.2014 acquitting the three accused
			<lb />
			Smt. Krishna, Rajesh and Naresh @ Tatu/respondents is perverse.
			<lb />
			The counsel further submits that there are no major contradictions and
			<lb />
			improvements in the deposition of the witnesses warranting acquittal
			<lb />
			of respondents herein and such improvements cannot be treated as an
			<lb />
			attempt to falsely implicate the respondents. Counsel for the State
			<lb />
			submits that the minor contradictions in the testimonies, if
			<lb />
			any, are not material in nature so as to rule out its evidentiary value
			<lb />
			completely. To substantiate her arguments, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			State has placed reliance upon Ashok Kumar Vs. State of Haryana
			<lb />
			reported in (2010) 12 SCC 350, Shivlal &amp; Ors. Vs. State of
			<lb />
			Chhatisgarh reported in (2011) 9 SCC 561, Kuria &amp; Anr Vs. State of
			<lb />
			Rajasthan reported in 2012 XI AD SC 376 and Leela ram Vs. State of
			<lb />
			Haryana reported in (1999) 9 SCC 525.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			10. Learned counsel for the State contends that the trial court convicted
			<lb />
			the appellant Vikas @ Lala on the basis of the same set of testimonies
			<lb />
			on which the other accused persons were acquitted. The counsel for
			<lb />
			the State further submits that the trial court has erred in acquitting the
			<lb />
			respondents by assuming that there is a tendency to falsely implicate
			<lb />
			other members of the family by the victim. It is further contended that
			<lb />
			the trial court has committed a grave error in law in passing the
			<lb />
			impugned judgment, which according to her is based on erroneous
			<lb />
			understanding of law.
			<lb />
			Arguments raised by learned counsel for the respondents Smt.
			<lb />
			Krishna, Rajesh and Naresh @ Tatu in Crl. A. 939/2015
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			11. Supporting the impugned judgment, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			respondents Smt. Krishna, Rajesh and Naresh @ Tatu submitted that
			<lb />
			the instant case does not warrant any interference by this Court. It is
			<lb />
			also contended that the witnesses have made substantial improvements
			<lb />
			in their testimonies before the Court and there are material
			<lb />
			contradictions in their statements which belies the case of the
			<lb />
			prosecution.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			12. The counsel further submitted that the substantial part of the
			<lb />
			prosecution story has been disbelieved by the trial court. In an appeal
			<lb />
			against the order of acquittal, this Court should be slow in disturbing
			<lb />
			the order of acquittal with respect to the respondents herein. Counsel
			<lb />
			submitted that the evidence on record clearly establishes the innocence
			<lb />
			of the respondents and hence, the appeal deserves to be dismissed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			13. We have heard the learned counsel for both the parties and considered
			<lb />
			their rival submissions and perused the impugned judgment as well as
			<lb />
			the material available on record.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			14. Undoubtedly the instant case of the prosecution rests on the testimony
			<lb />
			of the sole eye-witness PW20 Sunny @ Sanjay Gupta (complainant).
			<lb />
			It would be necessary to examine his testimony in the light of the well
			<lb />
			settled principle that the statement of the sole eye-witness may be
			<lb />
			relied upon provided that it does not leave any doubt in the mind of
			<lb />
			the court and the same is corroborated by other evidence produced by
			<lb />
			the prosecution in relation to the commission of crime.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15. In his complaint Ex.PW10/A, PW20 Sh. Sunny @ Sanjay Gupta (son
			<lb />
			of the deceased) stated that he used to sell vegetables along with his
			<lb />
			father and all the male accused persons used to come to his gali in
			<lb />
			drunken condition and speak filthy language and also used to whistle
			<lb />
			on seeing his sister (PW18); that on the fateful day at about 10:00 p.m.
			<lb />
			when he along with his father was going to see one Ganesh and
			<lb />
			reached house No. T-313/16, Baljeet Nagar, appellant Vikas @ Lala
			<lb />
			was coming from the opposite direction and intentionally struck his
			<lb />
			father on which his father asked him to walk properly; that appellant
			<lb />
			Vikas @ Lala slapped his father and in between accused Krishna
			<lb />
			followed by accused Rajesh and Naresh @ Tatu came out of their
			<lb />
			house and started fighting with his father; that accused Krishna took
			<lb />
			out one Danda from her house and started beating his father; that he
			<lb />
			tried to save his father on which accused Rajesh took the Danda from
			<lb />
			accused Krishna Devi and started beating him; that accused Naresh @
			<lb />
			Tatu, Vikas @ Lala and Krishna dragged his father towards H. No.
			<lb />
			313/14, Baljeet Nagar; that Naresh @ Tatu, Rajesh and Krishna Devi
			<lb />
			caught hold of his father and appellant Vikas @ Lala stabbed his
			<lb />
			father on his chest; that he ran towards his house and accused persons
			<lb />
			chased him and threw glass bottles on him; that he returned to the spot
			<lb />
			along with his mother and sister and saw his father in an injured
			<lb />
			condition and removed him to Janki Dass Hospital, Pandav Nagar on a
			<lb />
			rickshaw cart where the doctor declared him &quot;Brought Dead&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16. The complainant stepped into the witness box as PW20 Sh. Sunny @
			<lb />
			Sanjay Gupta and deposed as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;On 21.10.2009, at about 10.00 p.m., I was present at
			<lb />
			my house i.e. T-315/4A, Baljit Nagar, near Balmiki
			<lb />
			Mandir, Delhi. My father Sh. Rakesh Gupta was also
			<lb />
			present at the house. After taking dinner, I and my father
			<lb />
			left the house to see Ganesh, who used to help in our
			<lb />
			business i.e. sale of tomatoes on rehri. We were going
			<lb />
			towards Lal Mandir within the area of Baljit Nagar.
			<lb />
			When I and my father reached the street where H.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			No.313/18, i.e. of the accused persons is situated. We
			<lb />
			saw Vikas @ Lala accused coming from the opposite
			<lb />
			side. Vikas @ Lala hit my father with his shoulder. My
			<lb />
			father asked Lala to walk carefully. Thereupon, Vikas @
			<lb />
			Lala slapped my father. Then, Smt. Krishna Devi,
			<lb />
			accused came out of the house and slapped my father.
			<lb />
			Then Rajesh accused came out of the house. He was
			<lb />
			armed with a danda. Rajesh hit my father and me with
			<lb />
			the danda. Then Naresh @ Tatoo accused came out of
			<lb />
			the house and started beating me and my father. Smt.
			<lb />
			Krishna then pushed me as a result whereof I fell down.
			<lb />
			She, her son Tatoo @ Naresh and Rajesh accused then
			<lb />
			pulled my father and dragged him upto H.No.T-313/16.
			<lb />
			Smt. Krishna Devi, accused then caught hold of my
			<lb />
			father by his neck from behind whereas Rajesh caught
			<lb />
			right hand of my father and Tatoo @ Naresh, accused
			<lb />
			caught the left hand of my father. Lala accused then
			<lb />
			attacked my father from the front side with a knife on his
			<lb />
			chest. I got perplexed and started running towards with
			<lb />
			my house. At that time, all accused hurled glass bottles
			<lb />
			at me from behind, while I was running towards my
			<lb />
			house. On reaching my house, I told my mother and
			<lb />
			sister Kunita that the accused persons had killed my
			<lb />
			father. Thereafter, I, my mother and my sister rushed to
			<lb />
			the spot.
			<lb />
			On reaching my house, I told my mother and sister
			<lb />
			Kunita that the accused persons had killed my father.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, I, my mother and my sister rushed to the
			<lb />
			spot. We saw Smt. Krishna Devi accused pushing her
			<lb />
			sons, co-accused, inside her house. On seeing my
			<lb />
			mother, Smt. Krishna Devi remarked that they had put
			<lb />
			an end to the daily trouble. We then saw that my father
			<lb />
			was lying unconscious. My mother then proclaimed that
			<lb />
			she would get the accused persons arrested in case
			<lb />
			something happened to my father. We then saw all the
			<lb />
			accused persons running away from their house. Rajesh
			<lb />
			and Lala @ Vikas were seen running towards Lal
			<lb />
			Mandir, whereas Krishna Devi and Tatoo @ Naresh
			<lb />
			were seen running towards Balmiki Mandir.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			17. PW4 Smt. Tara Gupta (wife of the deceased) deposed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;After about 05 minutes my son Sanjay came running to
			<lb />
			the house and told me that Naresh, Vikas, Rajesh and
			<lb />
			Krishna has stabbed my husband Rakesh with Churri in
			<lb />
			the gali in which their house is situated. On hearing this,
			<lb />
			I rushed out to the spot and my son Sanjay and daughter
			<lb />
			Kunita also came along with me. When I reached in the
			<lb />
			gali, I saw Krishna and her three sons Naresh, Vikas and
			<lb />
			Rajesh were standing outside their house. &quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			18. PW18 Kunita (daughter of the deceased) deposed on the same lines as
			<lb />
			that of PW4.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19. Before deciding these appeals it would be appropriate to analize the
			<lb />
			settled position of law through catena of cases that will guide us in
			<lb />
			disposing the present appeals.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			20. In Prithipal Singh etc. Vs. State of Punjab and Anr. etc. reported in
			<lb />
			(2012) 1 SCC 10, the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;This Court has consistently held that as a general rule
			<lb />
			the Court can and may act on the testimony of a
			<lb />
			single witness provided he is wholly reliable. There is no
			<lb />
			legal impediment in convicting a person on the sole
			<lb />
			testimony of a single witness. That is the logic of
			<lb />
			Section 134 of the Evidence Act. But if there are doubts
			<lb />
			about the testimony, the court will insist on
			<lb />
			corroboration. In fact, it is not the number or the
			<lb />
			quantity, but the quality that is material. The time-
			<lb />
			honoured principle is that evidence has to be weighed
			<lb />
			and not counted. The test is whether the evidence has a
			<lb />
			ring of truth, is cogent, credible and trustworthy or
			<lb />
			otherwise. The legal system has laid emphasis on value,
			<lb />
			weight and quality of evidence, rather than on quantity,
			<lb />
			multiplicity or plurality of witnesses. It is, therefore, open
			<lb />
			to a competent court to fully and completely rely on a
			<lb />
			solitary witness and record conviction. Conversely, it
			<lb />
			may acquit the accused in spite of testimony of
			<lb />
			several witnesses if it is not satisfied about the quality of
			<lb />
			evidence.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			21. In Waman v. State of Maharashtra : (2011) 7 SCC 295, the Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Apex Court observed as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;35. It is clear that not all the contradictions have to be
			<lb />
			thrown out from consideration but only those which go to
			<lb />
			the root of the matter are to be avoided or ignored. In the
			<lb />
			case on hand, as observed earlier, merely on the basis of
			<lb />
			minor contradictions about the use and nature of
			<lb />
			weapons and injuries, their statements cannot be ignored
			<lb />
			in toto.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			22. In State of Uttar Pradesh v. Krishna Master : (2010) 12 SCC 324,
			<lb />
			the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court held that :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;15. Before appreciating evidence of the witnesses
			<lb />
			examined in the case, it would be instructive to refer to
			<lb />
			the criteria for appreciation of oral evidence. While
			<lb />
			appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach
			<lb />
			must be whether the evidence of the witness read as a
			<lb />
			whole appears to have a ring of truth. Once that
			<lb />
			impression is found, it is undoubtedly necessary for the
			<lb />
			court to scrutinise the evidence more particularly
			<lb />
			keeping in view the deficiencies, drawbacks and
			<lb />
			infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and
			<lb />
			evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general
			<lb />
			tenor of the evidence and whether the earlier evaluation
			<lb />
			of the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of
			<lb />
			belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not
			<lb />
			touching the core of the case, hyper technical approach
			<lb />
			by taking sentences torn out of context here or there from
			<lb />
			the evidence, attaching importance to some technical
			<lb />
			error committed by the investigating officer not
			<lb />
			going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily
			<lb />
			permit rejection of the evidence as a whole.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			16. If the court before whom the witness gives
			<lb />
			evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about
			<lb />
			the general tenor of the evidence given by the witness, the
			<lb />
			appellate court which had not this benefit will
			<lb />
			have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence
			<lb />
			by the trial court and unless the reasons are weighty and
			<lb />
			formidable, it would not be proper for the appellate
			<lb />
			court to reject the evidence on the ground of variations
			<lb />
			or
			<lb />
			infirmities
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			matter
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			trivial
			<lb />
			details. Minor omissions in the police statements are
			<lb />
			never considered to be fatal. The statements given by the
			<lb />
			witnesses before the police are meant to be brief
			<lb />
			statements and could not take place of evidence in the
			<lb />
			court. Small/Trivial omissions would not justify a finding
			<lb />
			by court that the witnesses concerned are liars. The
			<lb />
			prosecution evidence may suffer from inconsistencies
			<lb />
			here and discrepancies there, but that is a shortcoming
			<lb />
			from which no criminal case is free. The main thing to be
			<lb />
			seen is whether those inconsistencies go to the root of the
			<lb />
			matter or pertain to insignificant aspects thereof. In the
			<lb />
			former case, the defence may be justified in seeking
			<lb />
			advantage of incongruities obtaining in the evidence. In
			<lb />
			the latter, however, no such benefit may be
			<lb />
			available to it.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			17. In the deposition of witnesses, there are always
			<lb />
			normal discrepancies, howsoever honest and truthful
			<lb />
			they may be. These discrepancies are due to normal
			<lb />
			errors of observation, normal errors of memory
			<lb />
			due to lapse of time, due to mental disposition, shock and
			<lb />
			horror at the time of occurrence and threat to the life. It
			<lb />
			is not unoften that improvements in earlier version are
			<lb />
			made at the trial in order to give a boost to the
			<lb />
			prosecution case, albeit foolishly. Therefore, it is the duty
			<lb />
			of the court to separate falsehood from the truth. In
			<lb />
			sifting the evidence, the court has to attempt to separate
			<lb />
			the chaff from the grains in every case and this attempt
			<lb />
			cannot be abandoned on the ground that the case is
			<lb />
			baffling unless the evidence is really so confusing or
			<lb />
			conflicting that the process cannot reasonably be carried
			<lb />
			out. In the light of these principles, this Court will
			<lb />
			have to determine whether the evidence of eyewitnesses
			<lb />
			examined in this case proves the prosecution case.&quot;
			<lb />

		<p>
			23. In Dinesh Kumar v. State of Rajasthan reported in (2008) 8 SCC
			<lb />
			270, the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court has held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;12. In law, testimony of an injured witness is given
			<lb />
			importance. When the eye witnesses are stated to be
			<lb />
			interested and inimically disposed towards the accused,
			<lb />
			it has to be noted that it would not be proper to conclude
			<lb />
			that they would shield the real culprit and rope in
			<lb />
			innocent persons. The truth or otherwise of the evidence
			<lb />
			has to be weighed pragmatically. The court would be
			<lb />
			required to analyse the evidence of related witnesses and
			<lb />
			those witnesses who are inimically disposed towards the
			<lb />
			accused. But if after careful analysis and scrutiny of their
			<lb />
			evidence, the version given by the witnesses appears to
			<lb />
			be clear, cogent and credible, there is no reason to
			<lb />
			discard the same. Conviction can be made on the basis of
			<lb />
			such evidence.&quot;
			<lb />

			24. In Raj Kumar Singh @ Raju @ Batya Vs. State of Rajasthan
			<lb />
			reported in (2013) 5 SCC 722, wherein the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			para 38 held as under :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;38. xxxxxxx It is a settled legal proposition that, while
			<lb />
			appreciating the evidence of a witness, minor
			<lb />
			discrepancies on trivial matters, which do not affect the
			<lb />
			core of the case of the prosecution, must not prompt the
			<lb />
			Court to reject the evidence thus provided, in its entirety.
			<lb />
			The irrelevant details which do not in any way corrode
			<lb />
			the credibility of a witness, cannot be labeled as
			<lb />
			omissions or contradictions. Therefore, the courts must
			<lb />
			be cautious and very particular, in their exercise of
			<lb />
			appreciating evidence. The approach to be adopted is, if
			<lb />
			the evidence of a witness is read in its entirety, and the
			<lb />
			same appears to have in it, a ring of truth, then it may
			<lb />
			become necessary for the Court to scrutinize the evidence
			<lb />
			more particularly, keeping in mind the deficiencies,
			<lb />
			drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the said
			<lb />
			evidence as a whole, and evaluate them
			<lb />
			separately, to determine whether the same are completely
			<lb />
			against the nature of the evidence provided by the
			<lb />
			witnesses, and whether the validity of such evidence is
			<lb />
			shaken by virtue of such evaluation, rendering it
			<lb />
			unworthy of belief. &quot;Exaggerations per se do not render
			<lb />
			the evidence brittle. But it can be one of the
			<lb />
			factors to test the credibility of the prosecution version,
			<lb />
			when the entire evidence is put in a crucible for being
			<lb />
			tested on the touchstone of credibility&quot;. It is in fact, the
			<lb />
			entirety of the situation which must be taken into
			<lb />
			consideration. While appreciating the evidence, the
			<lb />
			Court must not attach undue importance to minor
			<lb />
			discrepancies, rather must consider the broad spectrum
			<lb />
			of the prosecution version. The discrepancies may be
			<lb />
			due to normal errors of perception or observation or
			<lb />
			due to lapse of memory or due to faulty or stereotype
			<lb />
			investigation. After exercising such care and caution,
			<lb />
			and sifting through the evidence to separate truth from
			<lb />
			untruth, embellishments and improvements, the Court
			<lb />
			must determine whether the residuary evidence is
			<lb />
			sufficient to convict the accused.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			25. Keeping in view the above settled law, we are of the view that
			<lb />
			the improvements/contradictions as pointed out by learned counsel for
			<lb />
			the accused persons, are minor contradictions and does not render the
			<lb />
			evidence of PW20 Sh. Sunny @ Sanjay Gupta unbelievable.

			26. PW7 Dr. B. N. Mishra conducted the post mortem of the deceased on
			<lb />
			07.07.2009 and deposed in his testimony as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;On external examination of the body following injuries
			<lb />
			were found:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			1. One incised stab wound on the chest at the level
			<lb />
			of mid sternal line at 3 rd and 4 th inter-costal space
			<lb />
			with having size of 2.8 cm x 1.8 cm x deep to chest
			<lb />
			cavity with representing spindle in shape and
			<lb />
			regular margins. The injury located 8.5 cm from
			<lb />
			right nipple and 13.5 cm from left nipple with
			<lb />
			adjacent to sternum and passively oozing of blood
			<lb />
			from the wound. The track of wound directed
			<lb />
			obliquely left wards and backwards.
			<lb />
			2. One incised wound of size of 1.5 cm x 0.5 cm x
			<lb />
			0.5 cm present on the left lower eyelid with sharp
			<lb />
			regular margins.
			<lb />
			On internal examination, the chest wall on right side
			<lb />
			pierced as mentioned in external injury No. 1. On section
			<lb />
			of thorasic cavity the middle lobe of right lung found
			<lb />
			lacerated of size 2.5 cm x 1.5 cm x 1 cm with collection of
			<lb />
			liquid and clotted blood of approximately 1500 ml
			<lb />
			present in right thorasic cavity.
			<lb />
			All injuries were ante mortem in nature and of same in
			<lb />
			duration of alleged history.
			<lb />
			xxx
			<lb />
			After examination of the weapon of offence I opined that
			<lb />
			the injuries No. 1 &amp; 2 mentioned in the post mortem
			<lb />
			report Ex. PW-7/B were consistent to be inflicted by the
			<lb />
			knife produced.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			27. Perusal of the post mortem report reveals that the cause of death was
			<lb />
			haemorrhagic shock subsequent to laceration of lung caused by stab
			<lb />
			wound by sharp pointed weapon like knife. The stab was sufficient to
			<lb />
			cause death in the ordinary course of nature and manner of death was
			<lb />
			homicidal.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			28. The next question for consideration is whether the evidence brought
			<lb />
			on record by the prosecution establishes the guilt against the appellant
			<lb />
			Vikas @ Lala a case of &quot;murder&quot; or in the alternative a case of
			<lb />
			&quot;culpable homicide not amounting to murder&quot;?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			29. Both the said offences involve killing of a person. &quot;Murder&quot; is an
			<lb />
			aggravated form of &quot;culpable homicide&quot;. Section 299 of the Indian
			<lb />
			Penal Code defines the offence of culpable homicide and Section 300
			<lb />
			deals with murder. Section 299 explains &quot;culpable homicide&quot; and sets
			<lb />
			out the circumstances when culpable homicide amounts to murder and
			<lb />
			when it does not amount to murder. As per Section 300, existence of
			<lb />
			one of the four conditions, enumerated therein, which basically reflect
			<lb />
			four mental attitudes, turns &quot;culpable homicide&quot; into &quot;murder&quot;, while
			<lb />
			the three exceptions therein again reduce the offence of &quot;murder&quot; to
			<lb />
			&quot;culpable homicide not amounting to murder&quot;. The distinction
			<lb />
			between &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;culpable homicide not amounting to murder&quot;
			<lb />
			is very thin and in fact has always been a vexed question. Therefore,
			<lb />
			the question posed has to be examined carefully in the light of the
			<lb />
			broad principles laid down in the judicial pronouncements.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			30. In Jagtar Singh v. State of Punjab reported in 1983 (2) SCC 342, in a
			<lb />
			trivial quarrel the appellant wielded a weapon like a knife and landed
			<lb />
			a blow on the chest of the deceased. The Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court
			<lb />
			observed that the quarrel had taken place on the spur of the moment.
			<lb />
			There was exchange of abuses. At that time, the appellant gave a blow
			<lb />
			with a knife which landed on the chest of the deceased and therefore,
			<lb />
			it was permissible to draw an inference that the appellant could be
			<lb />
			imputed with a knowledge that he was likely to cause an injury which
			<lb />
			was likely to cause death but since there was no premeditation, no
			<lb />
			intention could be imputed to him to cause death. The Apex Court,
			<lb />
			therefore, convicted the appellant under Section 304 Part II of the
			<lb />
			Indian Penal Code instead of Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code
			<lb />
			and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five years.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			31. In Hem Raj v. The State (Delhi Administration) reported in 1990
			<lb />
			(Supp.) SCC 291, the appellant and the deceased had suddenly
			<lb />
			grappled with each other and the entire occurrence was over within a
			<lb />
			minute. During the course of the sudden quarrel, the appellant dealt a
			<lb />
			single stab which unfortunately landed on the chest of the deceased
			<lb />
			resulting in his death. The Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court observed that as
			<lb />
			the totality of the established facts and circumstances show that the
			<lb />
			occurrence had happened most unexpectedly, in a sudden quarrel and
			<lb />
			without premeditation during the course of which the appellant caused
			<lb />
			a solitary injury to the deceased, he could not be imputed with the
			<lb />
			intention to cause death of the deceased, though knowledge that he
			<lb />
			was likely to cause an injury which is likely to cause death could be
			<lb />
			imputed to him. The Apex Court, therefore, set aside the conviction
			<lb />
			under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and convicted the
			<lb />
			appellant under Section 304 Part II of the Indian Penal Code and
			<lb />
			sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			32. In Sukhbir Singh v. State of Haryana: (2002) 1 SCR 1152, wherein
			<lb />
			two fatal blows were inflicted by the appellant therein by a bhala on
			<lb />
			the upper right portion of chest of the deceased, the Hon&apos;ble Apex
			<lb />
			Court opined:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;19. The High Court has also found that the occurrence
			<lb />
			had taken place upon a sudden quarrel but as the
			<lb />
			appellant was found to have acted in a cruel and unusual
			<lb />
			manner, he was not given, the benefit of such exception.
			<lb />
			For holding him to have acted in a cruel and unusual
			<lb />
			manner, the High Court relied upon the number of
			<lb />
			injuries and their location on the body of the deceased. In
			<lb />
			the absence of the existence of common object, the
			<lb />
			appellant cannot be held responsible for the other
			<lb />
			injuries caused to the person of the deceased. He is
			<lb />
			proved to have inflicted two blows on the person of the
			<lb />
			deceased which were sufficient in the ordinary course of
			<lb />
			nature to cause his death. The infliction of the injuries
			<lb />
			and their nature proves the intention of the appellant
			<lb />
			but causing of such two injuries cannot be termed to be
			<lb />
			either in a cruel or unusual manner. All fatal injuries
			<lb />
			resulting in death cannot be termed as cruel or unusual
			<lb />
			for the purposes of not availing the benefit of Exception
			<lb />
			4 of Section 300 IPC. After the injuries were inflicted
			<lb />
			and the injured had fallen down, the appellant is not
			<lb />
			shown to have inflicted any other injury upon his
			<lb />
			person when he was in a helpless position. It is proved
			<lb />
			that in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel
			<lb />
			followed by a fight, the accused who was armed with
			<lb />
			bhala caused injuries at random and thus did not act in
			<lb />
			a cruel or unusual manner.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			33. However, upon anxious consideration of the matter we are persuaded
			<lb />
			to accept the alternative limb of submission advanced by the learned
			<lb />
			counsel for the appellant Vikas that the present case would fall within
			<lb />
			the ambit of Section 304 Part II of the Indian Penal Code.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			34. It is contended by the learned counsel for the appellant Vikas @ Lala
			<lb />
			that even if the testimony of PW20 is believed to be true, the case falls
			<lb />
			within the exception of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code as it is
			<lb />
			the case of a single blow by the appellant Vikas @ Lala and the
			<lb />
			incident happened at the spur of the moment because of a minor
			<lb />
			dispute. There was no enmity between the appellant and the deceased.
			<lb />
			He had no motive whatsoever to cause his death. It was no t a pre-
			<lb />
			meditated act with a view to cause death of the deceased. The
			<lb />
			appellant acted in the heat of passion during a sudden quarrel without
			<lb />
			having taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual
			<lb />
			manner.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			35. While deciding the present appeals the aforestated principles culled
			<lb />
			out by the Apex Court are to be kept in view. In the aforesaid factual
			<lb />
			matrix, it is clear that there was no pre-meditation and no malice to
			<lb />
			kill the deceased can be attributed to the appellant. The meeting was a
			<lb />
			chance meeting when the deceased and his son walked down the lane
			<lb />
			in which the house of the appellant was located. The altercation was
			<lb />
			sudden. The appellant could not have thought to meet the deceased at
			<lb />
			around 10 pm in the night. Therefore, intention to kill the deceased
			<lb />
			cannot be proved. In the backdrop of these mitigating factors, the
			<lb />
			appellant Vikas cannot be convicted for having committed the murder
			<lb />
			of the deceased.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			36. Resultantly, we partly allow the Criminal Appeal 298 of 2015
			<lb />
			preferred by the appellant Vikas @ Lala to the extent that instead of
			<lb />
			Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code the appellant Vikas @ Lala shall
			<lb />
			stand convicted for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to
			<lb />
			murder punishable under Section 304 Part II of the Indian Penal Code
			<lb />
			and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years. The
			<lb />
			fine imposed upon the appellant Vikas @ Lala and the default
			<lb />
			sentence awarded to him shall remain unaltered. Accordingly, the
			<lb />
			order of conviction and sentence are modified in the above terms.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			37. So far as the Criminal Appeal 939 of 2015 preferred by the State is
			<lb />
			concerned, the evidence on record is not sufficient to clearly establish
			<lb />
			the specific role of the respondents in commission of the alleged
			<lb />
			crime. There was nothing to prove that the respondents participated in
			<lb />
			the alleged crime. Furthermore, the medical evidence does not bear
			<lb />
			out the story that the respondents had attacked the deceased or his son
			<lb />
			PW20. Having considered the evidence on record in depth, we are of
			<lb />
			the considered opinion that the substratum of the prosecution story has
			<lb />
			not been proved. To hold them guilty for the stabbing of the deceased
			<lb />
			with the aid of Section 34 would not be proper and there is nothing
			<lb />
			perverse about the trial court&apos;s order so far as their acquittal is
			<lb />
			concerned. Accordingly, the appeal filed by the State is dismissed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			38. Trial court Record be returned.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			39. Copy of this decision be sent to the Superintendent-Central Jail, Tihar
			<lb />
			for updating the jail record.
