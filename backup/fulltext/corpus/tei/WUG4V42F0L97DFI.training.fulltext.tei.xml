			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s approaching the concerned passport office for surrender of
			<lb />
			the identity card and makes an application for issuance of the
			<lb />
			passport, the application would be processed in accordance with law
			<lb />
			and a passport would be issued provided the petitioner satisfies the
			<lb />
			requirement of the Passport Act, 1967 read with Passport Manuals

			2016 and the Rules framed thereunder.

			of four weeks, subject to petitioner&apos;s satisfying the terms and
