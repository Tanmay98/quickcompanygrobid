				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				4  Written statement was filed by defendant no.2. It was denied that the
				<lb />
				defendant is falsely claiming to be the owner of the land in question.
				<lb />
				Submission was that pursuant to an exchange deed dated 13.9.1954 (duly
				<lb />
				registered) the said area of 146 sq. yards was given to M/s Birla Textiles Ltd.
				<lb />
				who had become the owner of the land in question. Pursuant to an order of
				<lb />
				amalgamation between defendant nos.1 and 2, defendant no.2 ( M/s
				<lb />
				Texmaco Ltd.) had acquired all rights and titles of the land in question and
				<lb />
				had become the owner of the land in question. Having acquired the same
				<lb />
				from M/s Birla Textiles Ltd., defendant no.2 is now the owner of the land in
				<lb />
				question. In consideration of the exchange deed a sum of Rs.8411/-had
				<lb />
				been given by the defendants to the MCD; the MCD having transferred all its
				<lb />
				rights in this land to defendant no.1 and now defendant no.2 has since
				<lb />
				acquired ownership and title in the suit land. It was denied that the land in
				<lb />
				question belongs to defendant no.5; it was offered as a play ground. In this
				<lb />
				written statement it was further stated that in the year 1984 certain
				<lb />
				proceedings under Section 145 of the Cr.P.C. were got initiated inter se the
				<lb />
				parties and late Raghuvar Singh and his sons unsuccessfully tried to grab this
				<lb />
				land. The SDM on 27.12.2001 appointed the SHO Police Station Roop
				<lb />
				Nagar as custodian of the land in question. The order of the SDM was
				<lb />
				challenged before the Court of Sesions Judge. On 08.9.2005 the Sessions
				<lb />
				Judge had granted possession of the land in question to the defendant no.2.
				<lb />
				The matter reached the High Court in Criminal Revision Petition
				<lb />
				No.4732/2005. The High Court on 04.01.2013 dismissed this petition thus
				<lb />
				endorsing the order of the Sessions Judge and holding that possession be
				<lb />
				retained by defendant no.2. The possession letter indicating that possession
				<lb />
				of the suit land is with defendant no.2 is dated 22.4.2013. The fact that the
				<lb />
				possession of the suit land is with defendant no.2 is also an admitted fact.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				5  Seprate written statement was also filed by defendant nos.5 and 6 i.e.
				<lb />
				the Municipal Corpopration of Delhi. Their stand was that in terms of the
				<lb />
				exchange deed dated 13.9.1954 this suit land measnring 146 sq. yards was
				<lb />
				exchanged with defendant no.1 and the MCD had handed over the title and
				<lb />
				possession of the suit land to defendant no.1(now with defendant no.2).
				<lb />
				Further submission in the written statement of the MCD being that defendant
				<lb />
				nos.1 to 3 always being in possession of the suit land and their possession
				<lb />
				has been endorsed by the judgment of the High Court in Criminal Revision
				<lb />
				Petition No.4732/2005 in its judgment dated 04.01.2013. In para 10 of the
				<lb />
				written statement, the Department further states that the plaintiff has filed
				<lb />
				documents which are not registered. It is stated that the documents relied
				<lb />
				upon by the plaintiff do not relate to the suit property and the erstwhile MCD
				<lb />
				(now North Delhi Municipal Corporation) on a re-examination of the matter
				<lb />
				qua ownership of the suit property has found that the erstwhile Municipal
				<lb />
				Committee had in fact exchanged the suit land with defendant no.1 by virtue
				<lb />
				of an exchange deed dated 13.9.1954; plaintiff is not in possession of the suit
				<lb />
				premises; plaintiff is misreading the documents and trying to mislead the
				<lb />
				Court by relying upon only an extract of an Immovable Property Register.
				<lb />
				In paras 11 and 12 of the written statement, on the identity of the suit
				<lb />
				property it was stated that the plaintiff is taking undue advantage of the fact
				<lb />
				that a portion of the suit land without any proper dimensions or the area
				<lb />
				having been mentioned and only by placing a copy of the extract of the
				<lb />
				Immovable Property Register has attempted to show that it is a municipal
				<lb />
				land.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				6  In view of the aforenoted pleadings, an application under Order XII
				<lb />
				Rule 6 of the Code came to be filed by defendant nos.1 and 2. Their
				<lb />
				contention was that there were clearcut admissions made in the pleadings
				<lb />
				which entitles the suit to be disposed of straightway; the exchange deed
				<lb />
				dated 13.9.1954 being a registered document clearly show that the suit land
				<lb />
				had been exchanged between defendant no.1 and the MCD; the possession of
				<lb />
				the suit land has been endorsed by the orders passed by the SDM under
				<lb />
				Section 145 of the Cr.P.C. which has been affirmed by the High Court on
				<lb />
				04.01.2013. The prayer made in the petition no longer survives. The
				<lb />
				judgment/decree on the admissions of the parties should straightway follow.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7  Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon 2015 II
				<lb />
				AD (Delhi) 159Razia Begum (Smt) Vs. Delhi Development Authority &amp; Ors.
				<lb />
				,211(2014) DLT 149 (Division Bench) Keshav Chander Thakur and Anr. Vs.
				<lb />
				Krishan Chandedr &amp; Ors., 2011 (3) RCR (Civil) 932 Ramrameshwari Devi
				<lb />
				and Ors. Vs. Nirmala Devi and Ors. and 223 (2015) DLT 132 Seema Thakur
				<lb />
				Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				8  Needless to state that these arguments have been refuted.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9  An application under Order XII Rule 6 of the Code which is a shortcut
				<lb />
				in the trial entitles either the plaintiff or the defendant to obtain a decree on
				<lb />
				admissions provided that the admissions are clearcut, unambiguous and
				<lb />
				transparent. If there is a cloud over any issue a decree under Order XII Rule
				<lb />
				6 of the Code cannot be granted. This is the thumb rule for an application
				<lb />
				under Order XII Rule 6 of the Code to be decided.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				10  Noting the pleadings of the parties, this Court is of the view that the
				<lb />
				impugned order does not suffer from any infirmity. The plaint discloses that
				<lb />
				the exchange deed dated 13.9.1954 purported to have entered into between
				<lb />
				the defendant no.1 and defendant no.5 does not identify the land correctly.
				<lb />
				The site plan annexed with the plaint has been perused. Admittedly no
				<lb />
				counter plan has been filed by the defendants. This site plan of the plaintiff
				<lb />
				reflects the wrestling ground in the triangular portion. The southern, eastern
				<lb />
				and western sides are bounded by roads. On the northern side there is an
				<lb />
				MC Girls School. The total area has been depicted as 2932.4 sq. feet. The
				<lb />
				submission of the learned counsel for plaintiff is that that identity of the suit
				<lb />
				land as given in the site plan does not conform with the land mentioned in
				<lb />
				the exchange deed dated 13.9.1954. A perusal of the exchange deed shows
				<lb />
				that this is an exchange made between the Municipal Committee of Delhi
				<lb />
				and M/s Birla Cotton Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. Municipal
				<lb />
				Committee of Delhi has been described as the first part. His ownership has
				<lb />
				been depicted in the first schedule. A perusal of the first schedule shows that
				<lb />
				the land which belongs to the Municipal Committee of Delhi at point &quot;K&quot;
				<lb />
				(subject matter of exchange) is 146 sq. yards which on the northen side is
				<lb />
				bounded by M/s Birla Mills Ltd. and on the southern side there is a
				<lb />
				municipal road; on the eastern side also there is a municipal road; on the
				<lb />
				western side there is a land of M/s Birls Mills Ltd. Contention of the
				<lb />
				plaintiff being that the identity of the suit property is not clear and the land
				<lb />
				which is the subject matter of exchange deed (dated 13.9.1954) is in fact not
				<lb />
				the land for which the present suit has been filed is noted. Further
				<lb />
				submission that the proceedings under Section 145 of the Cr.P.C. are also
				<lb />
				indicative only of a possession and not of title i.e. the settled position at law;
				<lb />
				the possession qua the proceedings under Section 145 of the Cr.P.C. are also
				<lb />
				on a limited aspect and for a temporary purpose. This stand is also noted.
				<lb />
				The additional submission of the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the
				<lb />
				inter se admissions made by defendant nos.1 and 2 and defendant nos.5 and
				<lb />
				6 are collusive and require trial is additinally noted.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				11	This Court is thus of the view that first and foremost the identify of the
				<lb />
				suit property has to be decided and this can only be done after the parties are
				<lb />
				relegated to a trial and after giving them opportunity to lead evidence to
				<lb />
				establish whether the suit land for which the present suit has been filed is in
				<lb />
				fact the same land which forms a part of the exchange deed dated 13.9.1954.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				12	The judgments relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner have
				<lb />
				no bearing to the factul matrix of the instant case. Their ratios are wholly
				<lb />
				inapplicable. The first three judgments (supra) relate to the law of limitation
				<lb />
				which is not an objection taken in present case. The last judgment is also on
				<lb />
				the ground of delay in initiating proceedings. None of them are applicable to
				<lb />
				the present scenario.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				13
				<lb />
				The impugned order in this background dismissing the application
				<lb />
				under Order XII Rule 6 of the Code suffers from no infirmity. There are no
				<lb />
				clearcut admissions. Petiton is without any merit. It is dismissed with costs
				<lb />
				quantified at Rs.10,000/-.
