	JUDGMENT<lb/>
</head>

 <p>
 This is a judgment in the main suit i.e., C.S.No.641 of 2012, which is a<lb/>
 typical partition suit. To be noted A.No.4348 of 2016, is a final decree<lb/>
 application made under Order XXXIV Rule 5(3) of &apos;The Code of Civil<lb/>
 Procedure, 1908&apos; [&apos;CPC&apos; for brevity].<lb/>
</p>


<p>2. There is only one item of suit property situate at Door No.1, Plot<lb/>
 No.548, 4 th Trust Link Street, Mandavelipakkam being a residential/house<lb/>
 property wherein superstructure stands on land admeasuring 4800 sq.ft<lb/>
 thereabouts [2 grounds or thereabouts] (hereinafter land and superstructure<lb/>
 together shall be referred to as &apos;suit property&apos;).<lb/>
</p>

<p>3. In the instant suit, originally, there was a lone plaintiff and a sole<lb/>
 defendant. To be noted, pending suit plaintiff E.Sathyavathamma died and<lb/>
 her legal heirs were brought on record vide order dated 29.06.2015 in<lb/>
 A.Nos.3667 to 3669 of 2015 as plaintiffs 2 to 6.<lb/>
</p>

<p>4. Case file reveals that defendant has already been set exparte by<lb/>
 Hon&apos;ble Predecessor Judge on 24.02.2014.<lb/>
</p>

<p>5. Being a typical partition suit, a preliminary judgment/decree came to<lb/>
 be passed by Hon&apos;ble Predecessor Judge on 28.04.2016, which reads as<lb/>
 follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>6. The preliminary judgment/decree captures facts comprehensively<lb/>
 and therefore, it is not necessary to dilate on the same again.<lb/>
</p>

<p>7. Post preliminary decree, third plaintiff E.Anil Kumar Reddy<lb/>
 deposed as PW-1 on 13.02.2020 and the Engineer&apos;s report together with<lb/>
 photographs, a compact disk (CD) containing photographs of suit property<lb/>
 appended with a plan dated 20.06.2019 and the Advocate Commissioner&apos;s<lb/>
 report were marked as Exs.C1 and C2 respectively.<lb/>
</p>

<p>8. A perusal of evidence of PW-1, which obviously remains<lb/>
 unchallenged as the sole defendant has been set exparte reveals that it is<lb/>
 cogent, coherent and it compliments the pleadings. A perusal of Exs.C1 and<lb/>
 C2 reveal that the suit property is such that the superstructure is dilapidated.<lb/>
 This Court is informed by Mr.Srikrishna Bhagavat, learned counsel<lb/>
 appearing on behalf of the counsel on record for plaintiffs that the suit<lb/>
 property is dilapidated.<lb/>
</p>

<p>9. A further perusal of Ex.C2-Commissioner&apos;s report reveals that the<lb/>
 suit property is not capable of division into metes and bounds qua shares of<lb/>
 parties to the lis. Therefore, it has become imperative that a final decree<lb/>
 directing sale of suit property in public auction with a further direction to<lb/>
 share the proceeds proportionately (as in preliminary judgment/decree)<lb/>
 between plaintiffs and the defendant has to be passed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>10. To be noted, preliminary judgment/decree [scanned and<lb/>
 reproduced supra] came to be passed after plaint documents were marked as<lb/>
 Exs.P1 to P8. To be noted, a list of witnesses and exhibits is set out in the<lb/>
 last page of preliminary judgment/decree [scanned and reproduced supra].<lb/>
</p>

<p>11. For appreciating the suit property, this Court deems it appropriate<lb/>
 to scan and reproduce one of the photographs i.e., photo No.1 forming part<lb/>
 of Ex.C1. That photo is:<lb/>
</p>


<p>12. The aforesaid photograph, which is part of Ex.C1, makes it clear<lb/>
 that the suit property is an independent house. Land area as mentioned<lb/>
 above is two grounds or thereabouts and considering the number of shares,<lb/>
 there is no difficulty in accepting Commissioner&apos;s report-Ex.C2 that it is not<lb/>
 capable of division into metes and bounds.<lb/>
</p>

<p>13. Before passing a final decree, this Court deems it appropriate to<lb/>
 appoint Mr.D.Sampath Kumar, Advocate at 320 New Law Chambers, 2 nd<lb/>
 Floor, High Court, Chennai-104 Mobile: 63801 03849, 63811 27941 as<lb/>
 Advocate Commissioner for bringing suit property to sale by public auction.<lb/>
 Plaintiffs shall pay initial remuneration of Rs.50,000/-(Rupees Fifty<lb/>
 Thousand only) to the Advocate Commissioner besides meeting/defraying<lb/>
 his out of pocket expenses. It is made clear that all the plaintiffs as well as<lb/>
 the sole defendant [notwithstanding defendant having been set exparte in<lb/>
 instant suit] can participate in the public auction, make their bid and they<lb/>
 would be entitled to purchase the suit property subject of course to they<lb/>
 being able to match the highest price when the hammer goes down.<lb/>
</p>


<p>14. As the suit property has been held to be incapable of division into<lb/>
 metes and bounds, suit is decreed directing sale of suit property through<lb/>
 public auction by aforementioned Advocate Commissioner with a further<lb/>
 direction to distribute the sale proceeds to the parties to the suit proportionate<lb/>
 to their shares as concluded in the preliminary decree.<lb/>
</p>

<p>15. With regard to other limbs of the suit prayer viz., sub paragraphs b)<lb/>
 and c) the same are decreed as prayed for and the appointment of Advocate<lb/>
 Commissioner for public auction and sale has been made inter alia under the<lb/>
 residuary limb of prayer.<lb/>
</p>

<p>16. Suit is decreed with costs on aforesaid terms. Consequently,<lb/>
 connected application is closed.<lb/>
