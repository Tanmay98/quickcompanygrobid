COMMON JUDGMENT 

R.SUDHAKAR,J. 

The appellant/consortium, having met its waterloo before 

the learned Single Judge, has filed these appeals challenging 

the order dated 7.4.2015 passed in W.P.Nos.26762 and 27529 

of 2014. 

A THUMBNAIL SKETCH OF THE FACTS 

2.1. The first respondent vide tender notification dated 

6.5.2013 floated a tender for setting up of two units of 660 

2 | P a g e 


MW Ennore SEZ Supercritical Thermal Power Project at Ash 

Dyke of NCTPS. In all, four bidders, including the appellant 

and third respondent (BHEL), participated. The two other 

bidders who participated in the tender were disqualified as 

they failed to meet the Bid Qualification Requirements. The 

appellant is a Consortium of Trishe Energy Infrastructure 

Services Private Limited, a company registered under the 

provisions of the Indian Companies Act, and Central Southern 

China Electric Power Design Institute (CSEPDI), a power 

engineering, survey and design, and general engineering 

contracting company. 

2.2. The bids of appellant and the third respondent were 

taken up for consideration by respondents 1 and 2. Prior to 

the opening of the price bids, the appellant and the third 

respondent submitted Supplementary Price Bids on 5.2.2014. 

The price bids were opened on 5.2.2014 by the second 

respondent in the presence of the representatives of the 

appellant and the third respondent. 

3 | P a g e 


2.3. Thereafter, as the tender process was hanging fire, 

the appellant sent its representations dated 16.6.2014, 

17.6.2014, 1.7.2014 and 8.7.2014 to the first respondent, 

highlighting various aspects of the bid and the relevance of 

Clause 29.0(viii) of the Instructions to Bidders which deals with 

rejection of bids of the tender whose past performance/vendor 

rating is not satisfactory, more particularly, the poor track 

record and past performance of the third respondent, and also 

pointing out the wrong and improper calculations made 

contrary to financial statements submitted by the appellant. 

2.4. As the first respondent did not pay heed to the 

request made by the appellant, it filed W.P.No.19247 of 2014 

seeking issuance of a writ of Mandamus to direct respondents 

1 and 2 to consider the appellant's representations dated 

16.6.2014, 17.6.2014, 1.7.2014 and 8.7.2014, and take 

necessary action on the same in accordance with the tender 

terms and the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Transparency in 

Tenders Act, 1998 (for brevity, "the TTIT Act"). 

4 | P a g e 


2.5. When the said writ petition was taken up for hearing, 

the learned Advocate General appearing for the first 

respondent undertook that post-bid representations submitted 

by the appellant will be duly considered while finalizing the 

tenders and appropriate orders will be passed in accordance 

with the tender specifications, TTIT Act and the Tamil Nadu 

Transparency in Tenders Rules, 2000 (for brevity, "the TTIT 

Rules") Rules framed thereunder. Recording the said 

undertaking, the learned Single Judge, by order dated 

31.7.2014 made in M.P.No.1 of 2014 in W.P.No.19247 of 2014, 

directed respondents 1 and 2 to consider and pass orders on 

the representations of the appellant herein after affording 

them an opportunity of personal hearing and till such orders 

are passed, it held that the tender should not be finalized. 

2.6. Calling into question the order dated 31.7.2014 

made in M.P.No.1 of 2014 in W.P.No.19247 of 2014, 

respondents 1 and 2 filed W.A.No.1065 of 2014. A Division 

Bench of this Court, by judgment dated 19.8.2014, disposed of 

the writ appeal and writ petition by modifying the order of the 

5 | P a g e 


learned Single Judge only to the extent of holding that the 

rules did not contemplate personal hearing to the person who 

is objecting. The appellant was permitted to submit additional 

particulars/documents raising all its objections and the first 

respondent was directed to pass an order and communicate 

the same to the appellant and the third respondent. It is the 

specific plea of the appellant that the Division Bench did not 

modify the order of the learned Single Judge holding that till 

the first respondent passed an order on the representation, 

finalization of the bid/tender could not be done. 

2.7. Pursuant to the direction issued by the Division 

Bench, the appellant sent its representation on 25.8.2014 

along with necessary documents. However, the first respon-

dent vide its communication dated 27.9.2014 (alleged to be 

received by the appellant on 29.9.2014), rejected the repre-

sentation made by the appellant. Challenging the same, the 

appellant filed W.P.No.26762 of 2014 seeking a writ of 

Certiorarified Mandamus calling for the records of the first 

respondent culminating in the impugned communication 

6 | P a g e 


bearing 

Lr.No.CE/P/SE/M/P/EE-10/E/P/F.2x660MW 
Ennore 

SEZ/D.58/2014 dated 27.9.2014, quash the same and forbear 

the first and second respondents from in any manner taking 

any steps to proceed with the tender with the third respondent 

in respect of SPEC.No.CE/C/P&E/EE/ E/OT No.3/2013-14 

issued by the first and second respondents for the 2 x 660 MW 

Ennore SEZ Supercritical Thermal Power Project at Ash Dyke of 

NCTPS in accordance with the provisions of Clause 29(viii) of 

the Tender Document read with the provisions of the Tamil 

Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998 and the Tamil Nadu 

Transparency in Tenders Rules, 2000. 

2.8. At the time of hearing of W.P.No.26762 of 2014, the 

learned Advocate General produced a copy of the letter dated 

27.9.2014 awarding the contract to the third respondent 

(BHEL). Based on the acceptance letter of the third respon-

dent dated 27.9.2014, which makes reference to price negotia-

tion meetings held by the first respondent with the third re-

spondent on 5.6.2014, 13.6.2014 and 27.6.2014, and the ex-

change of correspondence dated 26.6.2014, 30.6.2014 and 

7 | P a g e 


2.7.2014, the appellant sent a letter dated 1.10.2014 to the 

first respondent highlighting the arbitrariness, anomalies and 

inconsistencies in its reasoning and the mala fide intent in the 

matter of evaluating the bid submitted by the appellant. How-

ever, the Chief Engineer (Projects), TANGEDCO, by letter dated 

10.10.2014, informed the appellant that the subject tender has 

been finalised and awarded to the third respondent. Assailing 

the letter dated 27.9.2014 awarding the contract to the third 

respondent and the subsequent communication dated 

10.10.2014, the appellant filed W.P.No.27529 of 2014 seeking 

a writ of Certiorarified Mandamus calling for the records of the 

fourth 
respondent's 
impugned 
proceedings 
bearing 

Lr.No.CE/P/SE/M/P/EE-10/E/P/F.2x660MW Ennore SEZ/STPP/ 

D.60, dated 27.9.2014 awarding to the 3rd respondent the 

tender bearing SPEC.No.CE/C/P&E/EE/E/OT No.3/2013-14 

issued in respect of the 2x660 MW Ennore SEZ Supercritical 

Thermal Power Project at Ash Dyke of NCTPS invited by the 1st 

and 2nd respondents culminating in its Lr.No.CE/P/SE/M/P/EE-

10/E/F.Ennore SEZ/D.64/14 dated 10.10.2014, quash the 

same and direct the 1st, 2nd and 4th respondents to 

8 | P a g e 


determine the award of the tender strictly in terms of the 

Tender/Bid document bearing SPEC.No.CE/C/P&E/EE/E/OT 

No.3/2013-14 taking into account the petitioner's bid and the 

comparative merits of the petitioner and the 3rd respondent. 

2.9. It is the case of the appellant that after culmination 

of hearing before the learned Single Judge, certain files were 

handed over to the learned Single Judge, without furnishing 

them a copy of it, and the learned Single Judge, by order 

dated 7.4.2015, dismissed the writ petitions primarily based on 

the current/note files containing a purported Consultant Report 

dated 30.5.2014, holding that the conduct of process of 

evaluation of the tenders, does not appear to be arbitrary, 

capricious or unfair; and that the price bids of the appellant as 

well as the third respondent had been evaluated as per the 

parameters indicated in the tender notification, by an 

independent consultant, who himself was selected through a 

tender floated earlier. The reasoning of the learned Single 

Judge truly hinges on the Consultant's report to the effect that 

the third respondent is identified as L1 and hence, appellant 

9 | P a g e 


has no role after L1 has been identified. 

2.10. Assailing the said common order passed by the 

learned Single Judge, the present appeals are filed. 

CONTENTIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 

3. Mr.Sriram Panchu, learned Senior Counsel appearing 

on behalf of the appellant and Mr.N.L.Rajah, learned Counsel 

for the appellant, pleaded for setting aside the order of the 

learned Single Judge and to direct the first respondent to 

evaluate the two bids on the basis of the bids submitted, the 

representations and letter clarifying the issue, based on 

comparative merits. Their contentions on varied issues are 

recorded in the succeeding paragraphs issue-wise. 

(A) VIOLATION OF THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS: 

4.1. The proceedings dated 27.9.2014 awarding the 

tender to the third respondent, and the proceedings dated 

10 | P a g e 


10.10.2014 intimating the appellant that tender has been 

awarded to the third respondent are cryptic and bereft of 

reasons. That apart, there is no comparative analysis of the 

tenders submitted and, therefore, the same runs counter to 

the provisions of Section 10 of the TTIT Act, 1998, Rule 30 of 

the TTIT Rules, 2000 and Section 4(1)(d) of the RTI Act, 2005. 

4.2. In the said impugned communications, the end 

result has only been communicated without reasons and the 

same is contrary to Section 10(6) of the TTIT Act, 1998 which 

mandates that "If the Tender Accepting Authority proposes to 

accept the tender as per the provisions of this section, he shall 

pass orders accepting the tender together with reasons for 

such acceptance", 
and the same also runs counter to the 

procedure contemplated under Section 4(1)(d) of the Right to 

Information Act (for brevity, "the RTI Act") which states that 

every public authority shall provide reasons for its 

administrative or quasi judicial decisions to affected persons. It 

is pleaded that the lack of reasoning in the impugned 

proceedings is evidence of the fact that the pith and substance 

11 | P a g e 


of TTIT Act and TTIT Rules have been violated and there is 

something more to it than meets the eye. 

4.3. The object behind Section 10(7) of the TTIT Act is to 

inform the public as to why one tenderer was chosen over the 

others, however till date no iota of evidence is produced to 

show that the Tender Accepting Authority has intimated the 

information regarding the name and address of the tenderer 

whose tender has been accepted along with the reasons for 

rejection of other tenders to the Tender Bulletin Officer. Even 

though the learned Advocate General pleaded before the 

learned Single Judge that the tender evaluation report has 

been sent to the Tender Bulletin Officer as contemplated under 

Rule 30(3) of the TTIT Rules, no material has been placed 

before the Court in support of the said stand. 

4.4. Referring to paragraph (35) of the order of the 

learned Single Judge, which reads as under: 

"First of all, what is contemplated under Section 

10(6) is only an obligation to record reasons for 

accepting the tender of one. Once these reasons 

12 | P a g e 


are communicated to the losers, Section 10(6) 

would stand satisfied. Secondly, victors neither 

need reasons nor would be interested in 

knowing the reasons. For them, victory is 

sufficient. Thirdly, Section 10(6) speaks only of 

an obligation to record reasons for acceptance of 

tender and does not speak of any obligation to 

communicate the reasons . ", 

it is contended that the said observations are self-

contradictory, as in the first reasoning the learned Single Judge 

has observed that once reasons are communicated to the 

losers, Section 10(6) of the TTIT Act would stand satisfied and 

subsequently, it is observed that there is only an obligation on 

the authorities to record reasons for acceptance of the tender 

but there is no such obligation to communicate the reasons. 

4.5. Dissecting the communication dated 27.9.2014, it is 

pleaded that the said communication does not contain: (a) the 

comparative analysis; (b) particulars as to who are L1 and L2; 

(c) that the third respondent (BHEL) is the lowest bidder; and 

(d) that the offer of BHEL is accepted or the offer of the 

appellant is rejected. Therefore, it is not an order with reasons 

13 | P a g e 


in compliance of the provisions of the TTIT Act and RTI Act. 

4.6. A statute should not be construed as a theorem of 

Euclid, but must be construed as to the purpose which lies 

behind the statute. The rules of purposive construction have 

to be resorted to which would require the construction of the 

Act in such a manner so as to see that the object of the Act is 

fulfilled. In other words, if the process in which they have to 

express the result is regulated by a statute, it has to be done 

that way and when the authority has not complied with the 

same, the Court is empowered to interfere and direct the 

authorities to follow the procedure prescribed by law. 

4.7. To fortify the said plea of violation of the statutory 

provisions, attention of this Court was specifically invited to 

Sections 10(6) and 10(7) of the TTIT Act to plead that the 

same contemplate that reasons should be stated. In support 

of this plea, reliance is placed on the decision of the Delhi High 

Court in Indian Oil Corporation ltd. v. SPS Engineering Ltd., 

2006 (88) DRJ 93 (DB), wherein it is held as under: 

14 | P a g e 


"27. In this connection, it may be mentioned that 

earlier there were only two rules of natural 

justice viz: 

(i) Giving opportunity of hearing (audi 

alteram partem) 

(ii) the rule against bias. 

28. However, in recent times a third rule of 

natural justice has been developed by courts 

all over the world, namely, the requirement to 

give reasons in the order affecting rights or 

liabilities. 

29. The above decision has been followed in a series 

of decisions of the Supreme Court subsequently, the 

latest one being State of Orissa v. Dhaniram Lohar 

(2004) 5 SCC 58: (AIR 2004 SC 1794) wherein the 

Supreme Court observed (vide paras 7 and 8): 

'Reason 
is 
the 
heartbeat 
of 
every 

conclusion, and without the same it 

becomes lifeless. 

Even in respect of administrative orders 

Lord 
Denning 
M.R. 
In 
Breen 
v. 

Amalgamated Engg. Union, (1971) 1 All ER 

1148 : (1971) 2 QB 175 : (1971) 2 WLR 

742 (CA) observed: "The giving of reasons 

is one of the fundamental of good 

administration." In Alexander Machinery 

(Dudley) Ltd. v. Crabtree, 1974 ICR 120 

(NIRC) it was observed: "Failure to give 

15 | P a g e 


reasons amounts to denial of justice." 

"Reasons are live-links between the 

mind of the decision-taker to the 

controversy 
in 
question 
and 
the 

decision or conclusion arrived at." 

Reasons substitute subjectivity by 

objectivity. The emphasis on recording 

reasons is that if the decision reveals 

the "inscrutable face of the sphinx", it 

can, by its silence, render it virtually 

impossible for the courts to perform 

their appellate function or exercise the 

power of judicial review in adjudging 

the validity of the decision. Right to 

reason is an indispensable part of a 

sound judicial system; reasons at least 

sufficient to indicate an application of 

mind to the matter before Court. 

Another rationale is that the affected 

party can know why the decision has 

gone against him. One of the salutary 

requirements of natural justice is 

spelling out reasons for the order 

made; in other words, a speaking-out. 

The inscrutable face of the sphinx' is 

ordinarily incongruous with a judicial or 

quasi-judicial performance.' 

.... 

16 | P a g e 


32. It is well settled that the impugned order cannot 

be supplemented by additional material either in the 

form of an affidavit or otherwise vide Mohinder 

Singh v. Chief Election Commissioner, AIR 1978 SC 

851; State Govt, Houseless Harijan Employees 

Association v. State of Karnataka, (2001) 1 SCC 610 

(Para 49): (AIR 2001 SC 437, Para 48); Pavanendra 

Naraian Verma v.SGPGI of Medical Science, (2002) 1 

SCC 520: (AIR 2002 SC 23) (Para 34): Union of 

India v. GTC Industries (2003) 5 SCC 106 (Para 13): 

(AIR 2003 SC 1383), etc. In our opinion, reasons 

must be contained in the order under challenge, and 

mere existence of reasons in the show-cause notice, 

or any material referred to in the show-cause notice, 

is not sufficient. In our opinion, the authority 

concerned must, at least in brief, deal in the 

impugned order with the explanation given in 

the reply to the show-cause notice. This in our 

opinion is even more necessary where a 

personal hearing is not being given. The 

authority 
concerned 
must 
discuss 
the 

explanation given in the reply, and give its 

reasons for holding that the explanation is not 

satisfactory. In the present case all that has 

not been done." 

(emphasis supplied) 

17 | P a g e 


(B) ARBITRARINESS: 

5.1. It is pleaded that the department cannot adopt two 

yardsticks in the process of awarding tender and when the 

process of granting tender is based on indecisiveness and 

vagueness, the Court can correct the error in decision making 

process. To buttress the said argument, reliance was placed on 

a decision rendered by one of us (R.Sudhakar,J.) in SAP 

Industries v. Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, 2010 SCC Online 

Mad 4138, more particularly, paragraph 17(xviii) and (xix), 

which reads as under: 

"17. .... (xviii) Assuming for a moment that the 

price quoted by the SSI Unit of other State is the 

price which is to be taken for consideration, 

necessarily the petitioners should be given the 

benefit of Rule 29(f) read with the Government's 

clarification issued by the Principal Secretary to 

Government, 
Micro, 
Small 
and 
Medium 

Enterprises(F) Department in Lr. No. 561/2009-3 

dated 5.5.2009 For denying the benefit to the 

petitioners, the Department on one hand relies upon 

the price quoted by the new entrant, and in the 

same breath the Department relies upon the price 

quoted by the SSI Unit of other State, but refuses to 

extend the benefit that has to flow from Rule 29(f) 

and the Government clarification in letter dated 

18 | P a g e 


5.5.2009 This is a contradiction in terms. Therefore, 

the two letters impugned in the writ petition cannot 

form the basis of finalizing the tender. The 

Department has to therefore, necessarily 

follow the provision of Section 10 of the Tamil 

Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998 and 

Rule 29 of the Tamil Nadu Transparency in 

Tenders Rule, 2000 and first evaluate the 

lowest price on comparison of the tenderers 

and thereafter give the price preference in 

terms of Rule 29(f) of the Rule and the 

Government's clarification issued by the Principal 

Secretary to Government, Micro, Small and Medium 

Enterprises(F) Department in Lr. No. 561/2009-3 

dated 5.5.2009 if the price of SSI Unit of other State 

is taken as the lowest evaluated price which is the 

case on hand. 

(xix) The second respondent cannot adopt two 

yardsticks in the process of awarding the 

tender. Since the entire process of granting the 

tender is based on indecisiveness and 

vagueness, this Court has to step in to correct 

the 
error 
in 
decision making 
process. 

Irrelevant factors, like negotiated price, are 

stated in the impugned letters and that leads 

to confusion. The Department is adopting two 

variables to deny the benefit to the petitioners 

which cannot be justified. Hence, this Court has 

19 | P a g e 


no hesitation to hold that both the letters impugned 

in the writ petition No.4423 of 2010 are liable to set 

aside and are set aside." 

(emphasis supplied) 

5.2. Reliance was placed on a decision of the Punjab and 

Haryana High Court in S.C.T.Limited and another v. Punjab 

State Electricity Board and others, AIR 2006 P&H 44, to 

contend that the courts can interfere with the award of 

contract if it is arbitrary or discriminatory or mala fide or it has 

no nexus with the object it seeks to achieve. The relevant 

portion of the said decision reads as under: 

"17. In Tata Cellular v. Union of India, (1994) 6 SCC 

651, the Apex Court restated the law in the realm of 

public contracts and policies that impact upon 

commercial or economic matters, after reviewing its 

previous decisions on the scope of judicial review. 

One of the principles, out-lining the powers and 

duties of the State of its instrumentalities, was 

stated thus: 

"The Government must have freedom of 

contract. In other words, a fair play in the 

joints is a necessary concomitant for an 

administrative body functioning in an 

20 | P a g e 


administrative 

sphere 
or 
quasi-

administrative sphere. However, the 

decision must not only be tested by the 

application of Wednesbury principle of 

reasonbleness (including its other facts 

pointed out above) but must be free 

from arbitrariness not affected by bias 

or actuated by mala fides." 

18. As to what precisely is "Wednesbury 

unreasonableness" or irrationality was discussed in 

great detail in the same judgment and it would be 

apposite to extract a quotation from R. v. Tower 

Hamlets London Borough Council, (1988) 1 All 

England Reports 961: 

"The Court is entitled to investigate the 

action of the local authority with a view 

to seeing whether or not they have 

taken into account matters which they 

ought not to have taken into account, 

or conversely, have refused to take into 

account or neglected to take into 

account matter which they ought to 

take into account. Once that question is 

answered in favour of the local authority, it 

may still be possible to say that, although 

the local authority had kept within the four 

corners of the matters which they ought to 

consider, they have nevertheless come to a 

21 | P a g e 


conclusion 

so 
unreasonable 
that 
no 

reasonable authority could ever have come 

to it. In such a case, again, I think the Court 

can interfere……." 

19. In cases involving award of tenders, the Apex 

Court as well as the High Courts have been 

consistently following the principles culled out in 

Tata Cellular's case (supra). These principles can, 

briefly, be summarised as follows: 

(a) The Courts can interfere when the policy or 

the award of contract is arbitrary or 

discriminatory of mala fide or it has no nexus 

with the object it seeks to achieve (see: 

Monarch 
Infrastructure 
(P) 
Ltd. 
v. 

Commissioner, 
Lilhasnagar 
Municipal 

Corporation, (2000) 5 SCC 287 and Directorate 

of Education v.Edu Comp Datamatics Ltd., 2004 

(2) RCR (Civil) 486 (SC) : (2004) 4 SCC 19). 

(b) The power of judicial review has to be used 

to interdict State agencies' policies or actions 

in the realm of award of contracts with great 

care and circumspection and not merely 

because according to the Courts, the policy or 

measure is incorrect, (see M.P. Oil Extraction 

v. State of M.P., (1997) 7 SCC 592 and Air 

India Ltd. v. Cochin International Airport Ltd., 

2000 (2) RCR (Civil) 670 (SC) : (2000) 2 SCC 

617). In Cochin International Airport Ltd.'s 

case (supra), it was also emphasised that 

22 | P a g e 


judicial intervention would be warranted only 

when the overwhelming public interest so 

requires." 

(emphasis supplied) 

5.3. It is pleaded that as per the specific direction of the 

Division Bench dated 19.8.2014 in W.A.No.1065 of 2014, 

which is as under: 

"13. On a perusal of the statutory provisions, we find 

that the rule nowhere contemplates affording of 

personal hearing to the person who is objecting. 

Hence, the 1 st respondent cannot demand personal 

hearing, as a matter of right. However, it is made 

clear that if any clarification is required regarding 

the documents submitted by the 1 st respondent to 

the appellants to consider its objections, the same 

shall be called for from the 1 st respondent and if 

such clarification is sought, the same shall be 

communicated to the 2 nd respondent also and after 

considering the clarification to be given by the 

1 st respondent, the 1 st appellant shall pass an 

order as directed by the learned Single Judge. 

It is also made clear that if an opportunity of 

personal hearing is afforded to the 1 st respond, if it is 

required to be afforded, after considering the 

clarification given by the 1 st respondent, the same 

shall be extended to the 2 nd respondent also." 

23 | P a g e 


the appellant was always ready and willing to give further 

particulars other than what was submitted, but the TANGEDCO 

did not call for particulars despite the specific direction of the 

Division Bench to seek clarifications from the appellant if so 

advised, as was done with BHEL and the same would 

tantamount to discriminatory treatment, violating the doctrine 

of level playing field. In this regard, reliance was placed on a 

decision of the Supreme Court in Reliance Energy Limited and 

another v. Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation 

Limited and others, 2007 (4) RAJ 139 (SC), wherein it was 

observed as under: 

"36. We find merit in this civil appeal. Standards 

applied by courts in judicial review must be justified 

by constitutional principles which govern the proper 

exercise of public power in a democracy. Article 14 

of the Constitution embodies the principle of "non-

discrimination". However, it is not a free-standing 

provision. It has to be read in conjunction with rights 

conferred by other articles like Article 21 of the 

Constitution. The said Article 21 refers to "right to 

life". 

It includes "opportunity". In our view, as held in the 

latest judgment of the Constitution Bench of nine 

Judges in I.R. Coelho v. State of T.N. [(2007) 2 SCC 

24 | P a g e 


1], Articles 21/14 are the heart of the chapter on 

fundamental rights. They cover various aspects of 

life. "Level playing field" is an important 

concept while construing Article 19(1)(g) of 

the Constitution. It is this doctrine which is 

invoked by REL/HDEC in the present case. When 

Article 19(1)(g) confers fundamental right to carry 

on business to a company, it is entitled to invoke the 

said doctrine of "level playing field". We may clarify 

that this doctrine is, however, subject to public 

interest. In the world of globalisation, competition 

is an important factor to be kept in mind. The 

doctrine of "level playing field" is an important 

doctrine which is embodied in Article 19(1)(g) of the 

Constitution. This is because the said doctrine 

provides space within which equally placed 

competitors are allowed to bid so as to subserve the 

larger public interest. "Globalisation", in essence, is 

liberalisation of trade. Today India has dismantled 

licence raj. The economic reforms introduced after 

1992 have brought in the concept of "globalisation". 

Decisions or acts which result in unequal and 

discriminatory treatment, would violate the doctrine 

of "level playing field" embodied in Article 19(1)(g). 

Time has come, therefore, to say that Article 14 

which refers to the principle of "equality" should not 

be read as a stand alone item but it should be read 

in conjunction with Article 21 which embodies 

several aspects of life. There is one more aspect 

25 | P a g e 


which needs to be mentioned in the matter of 

implementation of the aforestated doctrine of "level 

playing field". According to Lord Goldsmith, 

commitment to the "rule of law" is the heart of 

parliamentary democracy. One of the important 

elements of the "rule of law" is legal certainty. 

Article 14 applies to government policies and if the 

policy or act of the Government, even in contractual 

matters, fails to satisfy the test of "reasonableness", 

then such an act or decision would be 

unconstitutional. 

.... 

38. When tenders are invited, the terms and 

conditions must indicate with legal certainty, 

norms and benchmarks. This "legal certainty" 

is an important aspect of the rule of law. If 

there is vagueness or subjectivity in the said 

norms 
it 
may 
result 
in 
unequal 
and 

discriminatory treatment. It may violate 

doctrine of "level playing field". 

39. In Reliance Airport Developers (P) Ltd. v. 

Airports Authority of India, [(2006) 10 SCC 1] the 

Division Bench of this Court has held that in matters 

of judicial review the basic test is to see whether 

there is any infirmity in the decision-making process 

and not in the decision itself. This means that the 

26 | P a g e 


decision-maker must understand correctly the law 

that regulates his decision-making power and he 

must give effect to it otherwise it may result in 

illegality. The principle of "judicial review" 

cannot be denied even in contractual matters 

or matters in which the Government exercises 

its contractual powers, but judicial review is 

intended to prevent arbitrariness and it must 

be exercised in larger public interest. 

Expression of different views and opinions in 

exercise of contractual powers may be there, 

however, such difference of opinion must be 

based on specified norms. Those norms may be 

legal norms or accounting norms. As long as the 

norms are clear and properly understood by the 

decision-maker 
and the 
bidders 
and other 

stakeholders, uncertainty and thereby breach of the 

rule of law will not arise. The grounds upon which 

administrative action is subjected to control by 

judicial review are classifiable broadly under 

three heads, namely, illegality, irrationality 

and procedural impropriety. In the said judgment 

it has been held that all errors of law are 

jurisdictional errors. One of the important principles 

laid down in the aforesaid judgment is that 

whenever a norm/benchmark is prescribed in the 

tender process in order to provide certainty that 

norm/standard should be clear. As stated above 

"certainty" is an important aspect of the rule of law. 

27 | P a g e 


In Reliance Airport Developers[(2006) 10 SCC 1] the 

scoring system formed part of the evaluation 

process. The object of that system was to provide 

identification of factors, allocation of marks of each 

of the said factors and giving of marks at different 

stages. Objectivity was thus provided." 

(emphasis supplied) 

5.4. The learned Single Judge while passing orders in the 

earlier writ petition in W.P.No.19247 of 2014, and subsequently 

the Division Bench while disposing of W.P.No.19247 of 2014 

and W.A.No.1065 of 2014 gave opportunity to the appellant to 

send representation and additional particulars/documents. 

Accordingly, representation was sent highlighting the issues 

that require to be considered and in spite of it, the order 

passed by the TANGEDCO is bereft of reasons. Highlighting 

the plea that reasons have to be reflected in the impugned 

order, reliance is placed on a decision of this Court in Hasbi 

Traders v. The Chief Engineer (Distribution), TNEB, (Judgment 

dated 18.11.2008 made in W.A.No.2059 of 2004), wherein it is 

held as under: 

"4. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board is a public 

authority and even in contractual matters, it 

28 | P a g e 


cannot have an unfettered discretion and in 

contracts having commercial element even 

though some extra discretion is to be conceded 

in such authority, it is bound to follow the 

norms recognised by courts while dealing with 

public property. This requirement is necessary 

to avoid unreasonable and arbitrary decisions 

being taken by public authorities whose 

actions are amenable to judicial review. Clause 

5(b) of the tender specification empowers the Tamil 

Nadu Electricity Board to reject any or all the 

tenders without assigning any reasons there of 

whatsoever. Even though such discretion is given to 

the authorities, whether it could be exercised in an 

arbitrary manner is a question to be further 

considered. In R.D.Shetty v. International Airport 

Authority of India, (1979) 3 SCC 489 as well as in 

Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi, (1981) 1 SCC 

722, the Supreme Court has held that an 

instrumentality of the State should act within 

the ambit of Rule of Law and would not be 

allowed to conduct itself arbitrarily and in its 

dealings with the public would be liable to 

judicial review. 

5. In fact the very same question as to whether this 

Court would be justified in interfering with such 

orders of rejection of tender without any reason 

came up for consideration before the Supreme Court 

29 | P a g e 


in M/s Star Enterprises and others v. City and 

Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra 

Ltd.and others, (1990) 3 SCC 280 and in paragraph-

9, the Supreme Court has held as follows:-

"The question which still remains to be 

answered is as to whether when the highest 

offer in response to an invitation is rejected, 

would not the public authority be required to 

provide reasons for such action? Mr.Dwivedi 

has not asked us to look for a reasoned 

decision but has submitted that it is in the 

interest of the public authority itself, the 

State and everyone in the society at large 

that reasons for State action are placed on 

record and are even communicated to the 

persons from whom the offers came so that 

the dealings remain above board; the 

interest of the public authority is adequately 

protected and a citizen knows where he 

stands with reference to his offer." 

In the very same judgment, as to the power of 

judicial review of administrative action, the Supreme 

Court has held as follows:-

"In recent times, judicial review of 

administrative 
action 
has 
become 

expansive and is becoming wider day 

by day. The traditional limitations have 

been vanishing and the sphere of 

judicial scrutiny is being expanded. 

30 | P a g e 


State activity too is becoming fast 

pervasive. As the State has descended 

into the commercial field and giant 

public sector undertakings have grown 

up, the stake of the public exchequer is 

also large justifying larger social audit, 

judicial control and review by opening 

of the public gaze; these necessitate 

recording of reasons for executive 

actions including cases of rejection of 

highest offers. That very often involves 

large stakes and availability of reasons 

for actions on the record assures 

credibility to the action; disciplines 

public conduct and improves the 

culture of accountability. Looking for 

reasons in support of such action 

provides 
an 
opportunity 
for 
an 

objective review in appropriate cases 

both by the administrative superior and 

by the judicial process." 

6. Mr.P.Srinivas, learned counsel appearing for the 

Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, however, would submit 

that though the order dated 21.2.2004 had not 

assigned any reason for not accepting the tender, 

pursuant to the notice issued by the very same 

appellant dated 28.2.2004, a reply was sent to him 

on 5.3.2004 stating that the tenders have not been 

31 | P a g e 


approved by the tender committee as the market 

rate was higher than the rate offered by the 

tenderers. 
Hence 
the 
appellant 
had 
been 

communicated with the reasons which would satisfy 

the act of the authority as to its fairness. We are not 

inclined to accept the said submission as the order 

impugned before this Court should be judged with 

reference to the contents of the order. The Tamil 

Nadu Electricity Board is not entitled to withdraw its 

case later on after the orders were passed. That 

apart, by a subsequent order dated 5.3.2004, 

though the respondent-Board had taken the stand 

that the tender of the appellant was not accepted as 

the same was not approved by the tender committee 

as the market rate was higher than the rate offered 

by the tenderers, in the counter affidavit it takes 

entirely a new stand for not accepting the tender of 

the appellant. In paragraph-4 of the counter 

affidavit, it is stated that contrary to clause 6(e) of 

the tender specification in quoting separate amount 

for four lots, namely, lot nos.5, 9, 13 & 14, the 

appellant had quoted a lumpsum of Rs.22,10,000/-

for all the four lots, which is in violation of the 

tender specification. From the above two different 

stand taken by the respondent-Board, it appears to 

us that even the respondents were not confident of 

the reasons for which the tender of the appellant 

was not accepted and the same was communicated 

by the letter dated 21.2.2004. Further the counter 

32 | P a g e 


affidavit cannot supplement the reasons as held by 

the Supreme Court in Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief 

Election Commissioner, AIR 1978 SC 851. In 

paragraph-8 of the said judgment, the Supreme 

Court has observed that "the validity of an order 

must be judged by the reasons so mentioned 

and the order cannot be supplemented by 

fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or 

otherwise." 

Hence the reliance placed by Mr.P.Srinivas, learned 

counsel for the respondent-Board that the reasons 

for the rejection were communicated to the 

appellant subsequently cannot cure the defect in 

respect of the violation of Article 14 of the 

Constitution of India." 

(emphasis supplied) 

5.5. In any event, it is pleaded that while awarding 

tenders, the comparative merits of bidders, i.e., past 

performance and vendor rating, have to be assessed and 

guidelines should be framed. In support of such plea, reliance 

is placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in Manohar Lal 

Sharma v. The Principal Secretary and Others, 2014 (9) SCALE 

693, wherein it is held as under: 

33 | P a g e 


"132 Significantly, the guidelines framed and applied 

by the Screening Committee for the period from 

14.07.1993 (1st meeting) to 19.8.2003 (21st 

meeting) are conspicuously silent about inter se 

priority between the applicants for the same block. 

In the 18th meeting, the Screening Committee 

considered the issue of determining inter se merit of 

applicants for the same block as well as certain other 

issues for bringing in transparency. The Screening 

Committee felt that guidelines for determining inter 

se priority among claims for block between public 

sector and private sector for captive use and 

between public sector for non-captive use and 

private sector for captive use need to be evolved. 

However, no guidelines for determining inter se 

priority of applicants for the same block was 

evolved. The guidelines also do not contain any 

objective criterion for determining the merits 

of applicants and lack in healthy competition 

and equitable treatment. In the first counter 

affidavit filed by the Central Government, it is 

admitted that from the 1st meeting (held on 

14.07.1993) to the 21st Meeting (held on 

19.08.2003), the guidelines did not deal with the 

subject of determining inter se priority between 

applicants. 

..... 

151. The entire exercise of allocation through 

Screening Committee route thus appears to suffer 

34 | P a g e 


from the vice of arbitrariness and not following any 

objective criteria in determining as to who is to be 

selected or who is not to be selected. There is no 

evaluation of merit and no inter se comparison of 

the applicants. No chart of evaluation was prepared. 

The determination of the Screening Committee is 

apparently subjective as the minutes of the 

Screening Committee meetings do not show that 

selection was made after proper assessment. The 

project preparedness, track record etc., of the 

applicant company were not objectively kept in 

view. Until the amendment was brought in Section 

3(3) of the CMN Act w.e.f. 09.06.1993, the Central 

Government alone was permitted to mine coal 

through its companies with the limited exception of 

private companies engaged in the production of iron 

and steel. By virtue of the bar contained in Section 

3(3) of the CMN Act, between 1976 and 1993, no 

private company (other than the company engaged 

in the production of iron and steel) could have 

carried out coal mining operations in India. Section 

3(3) of the CMN Act, which was amended on 

09.06.1993 permitted private sector entry in coal 

mining operations for captive use. The power for 

grant of captive coal block is governed by Section 

3(3)(a) of the CMN Act, according to which, only two 

kind of entities, namely, (a) Central Government or 

undertakings/corporations owned by the Central 

Government; or (b) companies having end-use 

35 | P a g e 


plants in iron and steel, power, washing of coal or 

cement can carry out coal mining operations. The 

expression "engaged in" in Section 3(3)(a)(iii) 

means that the company that was applying for the 

coal block must have set up an iron and steel plant, 

power plant or cement plant and be engaged in the 

production of steel, power or cement. The 

prospective engagement by a private company in 

the production of steel, power or cement would not 

entitle such private company to carry out coal 

mining operation. Most of the companies, which 

have been allocated coal blocks, were not engaged 

in the production of steel, power or cement at the 

time of allocation nor in the applications made by 

them any disclosure was made whether or not the 

power, steel or cement plant was operational. They 

only stated that they proposed to set up such plants. 

Thus, the requirement of end-use project was not 

met at the time of allocation. 

.... 

154. To sum up, the entire allocation of coal block as 

per recommendations made by the Screening 

Committee from 14.07.1993 in 36 meetings and the 

allocation through the Government dispensation 

route suffers from the vice of arbitrariness and legal 

flaws. The Screening Committee has never been 

consistent, it has not been transparent, there is no 

proper application of mind, it has acted on no 

material in many cases, relevant factors have 

36 | P a g e 


seldom been its guiding factors, there was no 

transparency and guidelines have seldom guided it. 

On many occasions, guidelines have been honoured 

more in their breach. There was no objective 

criteria, nay, no criteria for evaluation of 

comparative merits. The approach had been ad-hoc 

and casual. There was no fair and transparent 

procedure, all resulting in unfair distribution of the 

national wealth. Common good and public interest 

have, thus, suffered heavily. Hence, the allocation of 

coal blocks based on the recommendations made in 

all the 36 meetings of the Screening Committee is 

illegal." 

(emphasis supplied) 

Placing strong reliance on the above said decision, it is pleaded 

that the procedure adopted must be fair and transparent; 

there should be guidelines; there should be objective criteria 

for evaluation of comparative merits; and application of mind. 

5.6. On the issue as to how vendor rating should be 

assessed, reliance is placed on the decision of the Delhi High 

Court in Telephone Cables Ltd. v. Bharat Sanchar Nigam 

Limited and Others, (2004) 112 DLT 112 (DB), wherein it 

is held as under: 

37 | P a g e 


"4. Thus, this petition is to be decided on the simple 

issue as to whether it was permissible for the BSNL, 

under the Tender Conditions, to alter the Delivery 

Rating of the tenderers after the date of opening of 

the tender, i.e 22.5.2001 and, if so, to what extent? 

In order to arrive at an answer, it would be 

necessary to refer to certain clauses of the Special 

Conditions of Contract pertaining to the tender in 

question. We need to note Clauses 13(i), 13(ii), 

Clauses 19, 19.3.8 and Clause 22(d). The aforesaid 

clauses are set out hereinbelow: 

"13(i). The purchaser intends to limit the 

number of bidders selected for ordering against 

this tender to 2/3rd of the participating and 

eligible bidders in each group (eligible as per 

Clause 2 of Section II of the Bid Documents). 

The bidders for placement of order will be 

selected from the list of technically and 

commercially responsive bidders arranged in 

decreasing order of the Vendor Rating starting 

from the highest. Any fraction below 0.5 in the 

number of vendors, as computed above shall be 

ignored and the same equal and above 0.5 will 

be rounded off to the next higher integer. 

13(ii). The bidder with the highest Vendor 

Rating (V-I bidder) will be considered for about 

30% of his tendered quantity. The balance 

quantity will be distributed amongst the 

38 | P a g e 


remaining selected bidders in each group in 

direct ratio of their Vendor Rating." 

"19. All the vendors will be rated as per the 

following Vendor Rating formula. 

VENDOR RATING (VR)=0.6 PR + 0.3 DR + 0.1 

QR 

Vendor PR=Price Rating. 

DR=Delivery Rating 

QR=Quality Rating." 

"19.3.8 If the delay is caused due to 

Departmental 
reasons 
as 
certified 
by 

Competent 
Authority 
or 
Force 
Majeure 

Conditions, it will not be taken into account in 

computing delays in supply." 

"22. Clarifications on VRS: 

xxx 

xxx 

(d) Any modification obtained by supplier on his 

request made after the date of NIT which are in 

the nature of affecting the existing DR will not 

be taken into account. 

xxx" 

In the light of the said decision, it is submitted that the 

provisions of TTIT Act as well as the guidelines issued by the 

Central Vigilance Commission should be followed in letter and 

39 | P a g e 


spirit, more so in cases of this nature, where the value of work 

involved is high and technical. In the case on hand, Clause 

29.0 (viii) -Rejection of Bids states that the tender shall be 

rejected 
if 
it 
is 
from 
the 
tenderer 
whose 
past 

performance/vendor rating is not satisfactory, but there is no 

formulae or guidelines formulated in this regard. This has lead 

to arbitrariness in the tendering process, particularly 

evaluation. 

5.7. It is submitted that the partners of the appellant 

consortium are world renowned companies and they have done 

many projects worldwide. In support of the said plea, End-

User Certificates were also produced. 

5.8. Inviting our attention to paragraph (51) of the order 

passed by the learned Single Judge, wherein it is recorded as 

under: 

"51. I have carefully considered the above 

submissions. It is true that in the previous writ 

petition, the first respondent took a stand that 

the process of evaluation was still on. But it is 

seen from the current files that the Consultant 

40 | P a g e 


appointed 

by 
TANGEDCO 
had 
already 

submitted a report on 30.5.2014. As per this 

report titled "Price Evaluation Report", the 

third respondent was identified as L1. ......... " 

it is contended that the Consultant's Report is erroneously 

treated by the learned Single Judge as evaluation of L1 in 

terms of Section 10(1) and 10(2) of the TTIT Act. According 

to the provisions of the TTIT Act, the Consultant is not 

empowered to complete the evaluation and he can at the best 

make recommendation. However, in the case on hand, since 

opportunity was given to the third respondent to reduce 

interest after the Consultant's Report, it is quite obvious that 

the Consultant is treated as tender accepting authority, 

whereas the first respondent took a stand before the Court in 

the preceding paragraphs that the process of evaluation was 

still on, which shows that the tender evaluation process is 

vitiated by non observance of the TTIT Act and TTIT Rules. 

Besides, the whole exercise is illegal and arbitrary and suffers 

from procedural impropriety. 

41 | P a g e 


5.9. With regard to the report of the Consultant, who has 

loaded on the appellant an upfront fee of Rs.801.18 Crores and 

only Rs.8.925 Crores for the third respondent, it is pleaded 

that out of the said sum of Rs.801.18 Crores, there is no 

dispute about the management fee and guarantee fee, which 

amounts to Rs.489.136 Crores. 
The Commitment fee of 

Rs.156.184 Crores, besides the Interest During Construction 

(IDC) on Financial Charges to the tune of Rs.127.613 Crores, 

as included by the Consultant is perverse and unreasonable. 

This has been deliberately misstated to load the cost on the 

appellant's bid and tilt the balance in favour of the third 

respondent. In support of the said pleading, they have filed a 

brief memo on financials, which we extract as such: 

"B. The Consultant has loaded on the Appellant 
an upfront fee (including interest) of Rs.801.18 
Crores (See page 1298, Vol.III). The said figure 
of Rs.801.18 Crores consists of the following 
components: 

a. 
Guarantee Fee 
: 
Rs.371.743 Crores 
b. 
Management Fee 
: 
Rs.117.393 Crores 
c. 
Commitment Fee 
: 
Rs.156.184 Crores 
(the above three components are termed as Financial 
Charges) 
d. 
Interest for 36 months on 
financial charges 

: 
Rs.127.613 Crores 

e. 
Moratorium interest (from : 
Rs.28.247 Crores 

42 | P a g e 


36 th to 42 nd month) on 
financial charges 
Rs.801.180 Crores 

(Consultant had evaluated the bid of the 
Appellant at 9207.264 Crores.) 

If Commitment Fee and Interest on Management 
Fee and Guarantee Fee are excluded and 
accordingly the Moratorium Interest reduced to 
17.875 Crores, the Consultant could have only 
loaded Rs.489.136 Crores. 

C. The Repayment Schedule submitted by the 
Appellant for repayment (Principal and Interest) 
by TANGEDCO on the loan is at page 616, Vol I 
(See Clause 14.10, page 48, Vol I). The relevant 
figures are: 

Net Loan Amount 
: 
Rs.10012.9286/-
which comprises of 
a. 
Loan amount (85% of Total 
EPC Cost of 9709.3822 
Crores) 

: 
Rs.8252.9748/-

b. 
Interest 
During 
Construction for 36 months 
on the loan amount 

: 
Rs.896.2032/-

c. 
Guarantee Fee 
: 
Rs.392.0163/-
d. 
Management Fee 
: 
Rs.123.7946/-
e. 
Moratorium period interest 
for 36 th to 42 nd month 

: 
Rs.347.9396/-

Total 
: 
Rs.10012.9286/-

The Net Loan Amount does not include 
Commitment Fee or Interest on Management 
and Guarantee Fee during the construction 
period of 36 months. 

43 | P a g e 


A sum of Rs.5025.3628 Crores is the total 
Interest payable on the above loan amount 
calculated at 7.2% (mentioned at page 616, 
Vol.I). 

The total of the Principal (Rs.10012.928 Crores) 
and 
Interest 
(Rs.5025.3628 
Crores) 
is 
Rs.15038.2914 Crores. 

On this basis, the EQI (Equated Quarterly 
Installments) payable every quarter for 12 years 
is Rs.313.2977 Crores. 

(This figure would come down as the Repayment 
Schedule was submitted by the Appellant for 
9709.3822 Crores while the Consultant had 
evaluated the bid of the Appellant at 9207.264 
Crores (after disallowing Rs.508 Crores)). 

D. If the Appellant's offer of reduction in interest 
rate from 7.2% p.a. to 6.2% p.a. had been 
accepted, TANGEDCO would have saved over 
Rs.1300 Crores on Total Cost of Ownership 
(TCO) 
basis 
(See 
Representation 
dated 
16.6.2014 at page 628). 

Actual savings would have been Rs.1562.512 
Crores as per the comparative chart submitted 
by the Appellant at page 1220, Vol.III. 

This has not been disputed by any of the 
Respondents." 

5.10. With regard to the observation of the learned Single 

Judge that the appellant in effect wants the Court to work out 

44 | P a g e 


the financial aspects of the tender, it is pleaded that the 

appellant never sought for working out the financial aspects 

and what has been prayed for is to see whether the relevant 

factors have been properly considered and applied and eschew 

irrelevant factors. 

5.11. Qua the binding effect of the report of the 

Comptroller and Auditor General which was produced by the 

Appellant questioning the virtues of BHEL, reliance was placed 

on the decision of the Supreme Court in Arun Kumar Agrawal 

v. Union of India and others, (2013) 7 SCC 1, wherein it was 

held as under: 

"67. The question that is germane for consideration 
in this case is whether this Court can grant reliefs by 
merely placing reliance on the CAG's Report. The 
CAG's Report is always subject to parliamentary 
debates and it is possible that PAC can accept the 
ministry's objection to the CAG Report or reject the 
report of the CAG. The CAG, indisputably is an 
independent constitutional functionary, however, it is 
for Parliament to decide whether after receiving the 
report i.e. PAC to make its comments on the CAG's 
Report. 

68. We may, however, point out that since the 
report is from a constitutional functionary, it 
commands respect and cannot be brushed 
aside as such, but it is equally important to 
examine the comments what respective 

45 | P a g e 


Ministries have to offer on the CAG's Report. 
The Ministry can always point out, if there is 
any mistake in the CAG's report or the CAG has 
inappropriately appreciated the various issues. 
For instance, we cannot as such accept the CAG 
report in the instance case." 

(emphasis supplied) 

It is pleaded that since the report is from a Constitutional 

Functionary, it cannot be brushed aside as such. 

5.12. In effect, it is pleaded that non-consideration of all 

the above vital factors fortifies their plea of arbitrariness in the 

tender process. 

(C) RATE OF INTEREST AND PUBLIC INTEREST 
(NON CONSIDERATION) 

6.1. It is the specific plea of the appellant that even 

though they originally offered interest at 7.2% per annum and 

subsequently, on 5.6.2014, offered to reduce the same to 

6.2% per annum, the respondents 1 and 2, without assigning 

any reasons, accepted the tender of the third respondent, who 

agreed for interest reduction from 12.25% to 12.15% later 

46 | P a g e 


on, i.e., 27.6.2014. It is pleaded that on this score alone, the 

first respondent would have been benefited with a savings of 

over Rs.1300 Crores had he accepted the offer made by the 

appellant. This reduction of interest is in larger public interest. 

6.2. In support of the plea that the decision taken by the 

respondents must be free from arbitrariness and favouritism 

and must be in public interest, reliance is placed on a decision 

of a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in B.Himmatlal 

Agrawal and another v. Western Coalfields Limited and Others, 

2006 SCC Online Bom 887, wherein it is held as under: 

"27. It is no doubt true that right to choose a 
bidder as per conditions and procedure 
stipulated in the tender document is of the 
Authority/Tender Committee and the Court 
does not sit in appeal on the decision taken by 
the Authority in this regard. Nevertheless such 
decision must be free from arbitrariness and 
favouritism, must be in the public interest and 
must be taken by the Tender Committee after 
proper application of mind. The decision taken by 
the Tender Committee, in view of mandatory 
condition 3.5(b), therefore, must demonstrate that 
the Tender Committee has applied its mind to the 
contingencies mentioned in the said condition and on 
the basis thereof, has considered performance of 
work executed by the bidder on the earlier occasion 
and it must show that it is only thereafter the Tender 
Committee 
has 
concluded 
the 
issue 
of 
disqualification. If the decision of the Tender 
Committee is silent on these aspects, such decision, 

47 | P a g e 


in our view, undoubtedly would be arbitrary, unjust 
and no amount of explanation given in the affidavit 
filed on behalf of the Authority can legitimise such 
decision, which does not show proper application of 
mind by the Tender Committee as required in view 
of essential conditions of tender. It is the decision, 
which must show that same is taken by the Tender 
Committee after proper application of mind and such 
inference cannot be drawn on the basis of 
explanation or justification given by the Authority in 
the affidavits filed in the Court." 

(emphasis supplied) 

6.2. It is contended that even for awarding the contract 

in favour of the third respondent-BHEL, the respondents must 

be satisfied that it is in public interest. In support of the said 

plea, reliance was placed on the decision in Bharat Biotech 

International Ltd. v. Directorate of Medical Education and 

Research and others, 2010 SCC OnLine Bom 1845, wherein, a 

Division Bench of the Bombay High Court held as under: 

"17. There is merit in the submission that the 
entire tendering process has suffered from a clear 
case of arbitrariness. Tenders were specifically 
invited with reference to the Government Resolution 
dated 27 March, 2000. A public body when it invites 
tenders is duty bound to comply with the terms of 
the tender and by the norms of fairness that Article 
14 of the Constitution embodies. When the Tender 
Approval Committee holds that a bidder is 
disqualified, it is totally arbitrary then to proceed to 
award contract to that very bidder on the ground 
that other bidders have not matched the commercial 

48 | P a g e 


bid of a disqualified bidder. Once a bid is disqualified, 
the bid in its entirety has to be kept aside and no 
part of that bid can be utilized for evaluating the 
merits of the other bidders. Once a bid is 
disqualified, it is impossible to conceive how a 
contract can be awarded to that very party on the 
basis that the commercial bid quoted by it is the 
lowest and the other bidders have not matched the 
bid. The question of comparing commercial bids 
arises between bidders similarly circumstanced, that 
is to say, between bidders who meet the 
requirement of technical eligibility. Bidders who meet 
eligibility requirements are not equal to bidders who 
are disqualified and do not stand on the same basis 
as bidders who are eligible. To equate them is to 
treat unequals equally: something that is forbidden 
by Article 14 of the Constitution. As a matter of fact, 
the committee, as we have already noted, has not 
even come to the conclusion that the decision to 
disqualify the second respondent was erroneous or 
that the second respondent was not a defaulter. 

18. In W.B. State Electricity Board v. Patel 
Engineering Co. Ltd., (2001) 2 SCC 451 the 
Supreme Court applied the principles, and observed 
as follows: 

'The contract is, therefore, awarded 
normally to the lowest tenderer which 
is in public interest. The principle of 
awarding contract to the lowest 
tenderer applies when all things are 
equal. It is equally in public interest to 
adhere to the rules and conditions 
subject to which bids are invited. 
Merely because a bid is the lowest the 
requirements of compliance with the 
rules 
and 
conditions 
cannot 
be 
ignored.'" 

(emphasis supplied) 

6.3. With regard to the power of the Court to interfere in 

tender or contractual matter, reliance was placed on a decision 

49 | P a g e 


of the Supreme Court in Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa, 

(2007) 14 SCC 517, wherein it is held as under: 

"24. Therefore, a court before interfering in tender 
or contractual matters, in exercise of power of 
judicial review, should pose to itself the following 
questions: 

(i) Whether the process adopted or decision 
made by the authority is mala fide or intended 
to favour someone; or whether the process 
adopted or decision made is so arbitrary and 
irrational that the court can say: "the decision 
is such that no responsible authority acting 
reasonably and in accordance with relevant 
law could have reached"? and 

(ii) Whether the public interest is affected? 

If the answers to the above questions are in 
the negative, then there should be no 
interference under Article 226." 

(emphasis supplied) 

In the case on hand, it is contended that when lack of public 

interest has been paraded, the learned Single Judge has 

rejected the same. 

(D) FILE NOTINGS: 

7. With regard to the value of file notings and jottings, on 

which heavy reliance was placed by the learned Single Judge, 

it is pleaded that such file notings and jottings are not a final 

50 | P a g e 


decision and they are merely expressions of opinion of the 

individual and what the Court should consider is the validity of 

the ultimate order passed, that is under challenge. In the case 

on hand, the Consultant's Report is the opinion of an individual 

and nothing transcribes into an actionable order. 
To 

substantiate the said plea, reliance is placed on the decision of 

the Supreme Court in Shanti Sports Club v. Union of India, 

(2009) 15 SCC 705, wherein it is held as under: 

"41. The issue deserves to be considered from 
another angle. All executive actions of the 
Government of India and the Government of a State 
are required to be taken in the name of the 
President or the Governor of the State concerned, as 
the case may be [Articles 77(1) and 166(1)]. Orders 
and other instruments made and executed in the 
name of the President or the Governor of a State, as 
the case may be, are required to be authenticated in 
such manner as may be specified in rules to be 
made by the President or the Governor, as the case 
may be [Articles 77(2) and 166(2)]. Article 77(3) 
lays down that: 

"77. (3) The President shall make rules for 
the more convenient transaction of the 
business of the Government of India, and 
for the allocation among Ministers of the 
said business." 
Likewise, Article 166(3) lays down that: 
166. (3) The Governor shall make rules for 
the more convenient transaction of the 
business of the Government of the State, 
and for the allocation among Ministers of the 
said business insofar as it is not business 
with respect to which the Governor is by or 

51 | P a g e 


under this Constitution required to act in his 
discretion." 

42. This means that unless an order is expressed in 
the name of the President or the Governor and is 
authenticated in the manner prescribed by the rules, 
the same cannot be treated as an order on behalf of 
the Government. 

43. A noting recorded in the file is merely a noting 
simpliciter and nothing more. It merely represents 
expression of opinion by the particular individual. By 
no stretch of imagination, such noting can be 
treated as a decision of the Government. Even if the 
competent authority records its opinion in the file on 
the merits of the matter under consideration, the 
same cannot be termed as a decision of the 
Government unless it is sanctified and acted upon by 
issuing an order in accordance with Articles 77(1) 
and (2) or Articles 166(1) and (2). The noting in the 
file or even a decision gets culminated into an order 
affecting right of the parties only when it is 
expressed in the name of the President or the 
Governor, as the case may be, and authenticated in 
the manner provided in Article 77(2) or Article 
166(2). A noting or even a decision recorded in the 
file can always be reviewed/reversed/overruled or 
overturned and the court cannot take cognizance of 
the earlier noting or decision for exercise of the 
power of judicial review. 

44. In State of Punjab v. Sodhi Sukhdev Singh [AIR 
1961 SC 493] this Court considered the question 
whether a provisional decision taken by the Council 
of Ministers to reinstate an employee could be made 
the basis for filing an action for issue of a mandamus 
for reinstatement and held: (AIR p. 512, para 42) 

"42. … We are unable to understand this 
argument. Even if the Council of Ministers 
had provisionally decided to reinstate the 

52 | P a g e 


respondent that would not prevent the 
Council from reconsidering the matter and 
coming to a contrary conclusion later on, 
until a final decision is reached by them and 
is communicated to the Rajpramukh in the 
form of advice and acted upon by him by 
issuing an order in that behalf to the 
respondent." 

45. A somewhat similar question was considered by 
the Constitution Bench in Bachhittar Singh v. State 
of Punjab [AIR 1963 SC 395 : 1962 Supp (3) SCR 
713] in the backdrop of the argument that once the 
Revenue Minister of PEPSU had recorded a note in the 
file that the punishment imposed on the respondent 
be reduced from dismissal to that of reversion, the 
same could not be changed/reviewed/overruled by 
the Chief Minister. This Court proceeded on the 
assumption that the note recorded by the Revenue 
Minister of PEPSU in the file was an order, referred to 
the provisions of Article 166 of the Constitution and 
held: (AIR p. 398, paras 9-11) 

"9. … Merely writing something on the 
file does not amount to an order. 
Before something amounts to an order 
of the State Government two things are 
necessary. The order has to be expressed 
in the name of the Governor as required by 
clause (1) of Article 166 and then it has to 
be communicated. As already indicated, no 
formal order modifying the decision of the 
Revenue Secretary was ever made. Until 
such an order is drawn up the State 
Government cannot, in our opinion, be 
regarded as bound by what was stated in 
the file. As along as the matter rested with 
him the Revenue Minister could well score 
out his remarks or minutes on the file and 
write fresh ones. 
10. The business of State is a complicated 
one and has necessarily to be conducted 
through the agency of a large number of 
officials and authorities. The Constitution, 

53 | P a g e 


therefore, requires and so did the Rules of 
Business framed by the Rajpramukh of PEPSU 
provide, that the action must be taken by 
the authority concerned in the name of the 
Rajpramukh. It is not till this formality is 
observed that the action can be regarded as 
that of the State or here, by the 
Rajpramukh. We may further observe that, 
constitutionally speaking, the Minister is no 
more than an adviser and that the Head of 
the State, the Governor or Rajpramukh (till 
the abolition of that office by the 
amendment of the Constitution in 1956), is 
to act with the aid and advice of his Council 
of Ministers. Therefore, until such advice is 
accepted by the Governor whatever the 
Minister or the Council of Ministers may say 
in regard to a particular matter does not 
become the action of the State until the 
advice of the Council of Ministers is accepted 
or deemed to be accepted by the Head of 
the State. Indeed, it is possible that after 
expressing one opinion about a particular 
matter at a particular stage a Minister or the 
Council of Ministers may express quite a 
different opinion, one which may be 
completely opposed to the earlier opinion. 
Which of them can be regarded as the 
'order' of the State Government? Therefore, 
to make the opinion amount to a decision of 
the Government it must be communicated 
to the person concerned. In this connection 
we may quote the following from the 
judgment of this Court in State of Punjab v. 
Sodhi Sukhdev Singh [AIR 1961 SC 493] : 
(AIR p. 512, para 42) 
'42. … Mr Gopal Singh attempted to 
argue that before the final order was 
passed the Council of Ministers had 
decided to accept the respondent's 
representation and to reinstate him, 
and that, according to him, the 
respondent seeks to prove by calling 

54 | P a g e 


the two original orders. We are unable 
to understand this argument. Even if 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
had 
provisionally decided to reinstate the 
respondent that would not prevent the 
Council from reconsidering the matter 
and coming to a contrary conclusion 
later on, until a final decision is 
reached by them and is communicated 
to the Rajpramukh in the form of 
advice and acted upon by him by 
issuing an order in that behalf to the 
respondent.' 

Thus it is of the essence that the order has 
to be communicated to the person who 
would be affected by that order before the 
State and that person can be bound by that 
order. For, until the order is communicated 
to the person affected by it, it would be 
open to the Council of Ministers to consider 
the matter over and over again and, 
therefore, till its communication the order 
cannot be regarded as anything more than 
provisional in character. 

11. We are, therefore, of the opinion that 
the remarks or the order of the Revenue 
Minister, PEPSU are of no avail to the 
appellant." 

(emphasis added) 

(E) ALTERNATIVE REMEDY: 

8. With regard to the plea of the respondents that the 

appellant has not availed the alternative remedy available 

55 | P a g e 


under Section 11 of the TTIT Act and has directly knocked the 

doors of this Court, it is submitted that the appeal against the 

order passed by respondents 1 and 2 lies to the Government 

and since the Secretary to Government, Energy Department 

will be the signatory to the said decision, the appeal will go 

only from Caesar to Caesar. It was also pleaded that even 

assuming, there is an appellate forum, it is not functioning as 

on date and, therefore, there is no question of alternative 

remedy. In this regard, reliance is placed on a decision of a 

learned Single Judge of this Court in Consolidated Construction 

Consortium Ltd. v. Tidel Park Coimbatore Ltd. And others, 

2009-5-LW-858, wherein it is held as under: 

"20. Therefore, even from the object of the Act, the 

TTIT Act was enacted to prevent executive 

interference and also to prevent recurrence of 

irregularities by the procuring entity. It presupposes 

that the Appeal that is contemplated under Section 

11 of the TTIT Act can be filed by the tenderer 

aggrieved by the order passed by the tender 

accepting authority favouring one tenderer. It 

impliedly means that any internecine dispute 

between various tenderers can be referred to the 

Government by way of an appeal and the 

Government can decide the matter as it being the 

56 | P a g e 


controlling authority of all the schedule mentioned 

organizations. The appellate authority has not been 

clothed with any power of recording evidence nor 

any power of civil court has been entrusted to the 

Government when deciding an appeal. 

21. In the present case, the dispute is between the 

plaintiff and the first defendant company and it being 

Government company, the Government cannot 

decide such a dispute. Justice must not only be 

done, but must be seen to be done. If allowed it can 

be an appeal from caesar to caesar and law never 

permits such a power for a Government, functioning 

under a written Constitution. If the intention of the 

TTIT Act is only to provide an appellate forum for 

resolving disputes between various tenderers, who 

had stake their claims, then the present dispute may 

not come within its ambit." 

(emphasis supplied) 

However, it is fairly conceded that since the learned Single 

Judge went into the merits of the issue and the respondents 

have not filed any appeal, this issue is not seriously canvassed 

by them. 

(F) ALLEGATION OF GAINING INSIDE INFORMATION: 

57 | P a g e 


9. With regard to the observation of the learned Single 

Judge that the appellant gained inside information and only 

thereafter made representations, it is contended that both the 

appellant and the third respondent were visiting the 

TANGEDCO office regularly and were discussing the formula as 

to how evaluation should be done and that does not mean that 

the appellant had gained inside information. In this regard, he 

placed reliance on a decision of a learned Single Judge of this 

Court in M.Ramalingam v. N.Thangavelu, 1997-2-LW-35, 

wherein it is held as under: 

"14. In 'Estoppel by Representation' -by Spencer 

Bower and Turner-3rd Edition (First Indian Reprint 

1994), in Chapter XII, at page 285, regarding 

'Encouragement or Acquiescence', the learned 

authors have, after elaborating the case-law, 

considered as to what is meant by 'acquiescence', as 

understood in law. The relevant portion reads thus: 

-

"Regarded in the light of "acquiescence", the 

essential elements of the form of estoppel 

under consideration have been precisely and 

lucidly stated by the Court of Appeal, in a 

memorable judgment, as follows:-

"If a person having a right, and seeing 

another person about to commit, or in 

58 | P a g e 


the course of committing, an act 

infringing upon that right, stands by in 

such a manner as really to induce the 

person committing the act, and who 

might otherwise have abstained from 

it, to believe that he assents to its 

being committed, he cannot afterwards 

be heard to complain of the Act. This, 

as Lord Cottenham said in the case 

already cited, is the proper sense of the 

term 'acquiescence' and in that sense it 

may be defined as acquiescence under 

such circumstances as that assent may 

be reasonably inferred from it, and is 

no more than an instance of the law of 

estoppel by words or conduct". 

A good, though rather diffuse, statement of the rule, 

in terms of "encouragement", rather than of 

"acquiescence", is to be found in one of the 

judgments pronounced by Lord Eldon, L.C: 

"this Court will not permit a man knowingly, 

though but passively, to encourage another to 

lay out money under an erroneous impression 

of title; and the circumstance of looking on is in 

many cases as strong as using terms of 

encouragement; 
a 
lessor 
knowing 
and 

permitting those acts which the lessee would 

not have done, and the other must conceive he 

would not have done, but upon an expectation 

59 | P a g e 


that the lessor would not throw an objection in 

the way of his enjoyment. Still, it must be put 

upon the party to prove that case by strong and 

cogent evidence; leaving no reasonable doubt 

that 
he 
acted 
upon 
that 
sort 
of 

encouragement… In order to give a person a 

larger interest in the property than he derives 

under the instrument making his title, it must 

be shown that with the knowledge of the person 

under whom he claims, he conceived he had 

that larger interest, and was putting himself to 

a 
considerable 
expense, 
un-reasonable 

compared with the smaller interest; and which 

the other party observed, and must have 

supposed incurred under the idea that he 

intended to give that larger interest, or to 

refrain from disturbing the other in the 

enjoyment". 

Without using either the term "acquiescence" or the 

term "encouragement". Loard Cran Worth L.C stated 

the necessary conditions of the kind of estoppel now 

under consideration in the following terms. 

"If a stranger begins to build on my land, 

supposing it to be his own, and I, perceiving his 

mistake, abstain from setting him right, and, 

leave him to persevere in his error, a court of 

equity will not allow me afterwards to assert my 

title to the land on which he had expended 

money on the supposition that the land was his 

60 | P a g e 


own. It considers that, when I saw the mistake 

into which he had fallen, it was my duty to be 

active and to stage my adverse title; and that it 

would be dishonest in me to remain wholly 

impassive on such an occasion, in order 

afterwards to profit by the mistake which I 

might have prevented. But it will be observed 

that, to raise such an equity, two things are 

required, first, that the person expending his 

money supposes himself to be building on his 

own land; and, secondly, that the real owner at 

the time of the expenditure knows that the land 

belongs to him and not to the person expending 

the money in the belief that he is the owner. For 

if a stranger builds on my land, knowing it to be 

mine, there is no principle of equity which 

would prevent my claiming the land with the 

benefit of all the expenditure made on it. There 

would be nothing in my conduct, active or 

passive, making it inequitable in me to assert 

my legal rights. It follows are a corollary from 

these rules, or, perhaps, it would be more 

accurate to say that it forms part of them, that 

if my tenant builds on land which he holds 

under me, he does not thereby, in the absence 

of special circumstances, acquire any right to 

prevent me taking possession of the lands and 

buildings when the tenancy has determined. He 

knew the extent of his interest, and it was his 

61 | P a g e 


folly to expend money upon a title which he 

knew he would or might soon come to an end." 

Finally, in a passage which is always referred to in 

this connection, and which, like the first of those 

already cited, is not limited to encroachments on 

land, but is framed with the utmost generality. Sir 

Edward Fry deduced from the previous authorities in 

his judgment in Willmott v. Barber, the following 

condensed statement of the requisites of a good 

case of acquiescence or encouragement. In the first 

place, the plaintiff -in the case before him, the 

person said to have been "encouraged" happened to 

be the plaintiff -must have made a mistake as to 

his legal rights. Secondly, the plaintiff must have 

expended some money, or must have done some 

act… on the faith of his mistaken belief. Thirdly, the 

defendant, the possessor of the legal right, must 

know of the existence of his own right which is 

inconsistent with the right claimed by the plaintiff. If 

he does not know of it, he is in the same position as 

the plaintiff. Fourthly, the defendant, the possessor 

of the legal right, must know of the plaintiff's 

mistaken belief of his rights. If he does not, there is 

nothing to call upon him to assert his own rights. 

Lastly, the defendant, the possessor of the legal 

right, must have encouraged the plaintiff in his 

expenditure of money or in the other acts which he 

62 | P a g e 


has done, either directly or by abstaining from 

asserting his legal rights." 

CONTENTIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF TANGEDCO 

10. Per contra, Mr.A.L.Somayaji, learned Advocate 

General appearing on behalf of TANGEDCO, pleaded for 

dismissal of the writ appeals and his submissions are recorded 

under various heads in paragraphs hereunder. 

(A) SCOPE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW: 

11.1. At the outset, the learned Advocate General, while 

emphasizing the scope of judicial review in contractual 

matters, relied on the following decisions of the Supreme Court 

and other High Courts: 

(a) Maa Binda Express Carrier and another v. North-East 

Frontier Railway and others, (2014) 3 SCC 760, wherein the 

Supreme Court held as under: 

"8. The scope of judicial review in matters relating to 

award of contract by the State and its 

63 | P a g e 


instrumentalities is settled by a long line of decisions 

of this Court. While these decisions clearly recognize 

that power exercised by the Government and its 

instrumentalities in regard to allotment of contract is 

subject to judicial review at the instance of an 

aggrieved party, submission of a tender in response 

to a notice inviting such tenders is no more than 

making an offer which the State or its agencies are 

under no obligation to accept. The bidders 

participating in the tender process cannot, therefore, 

insist that their tenders should be accepted simply 

because a given tender is the highest or lowest 

depending upon whether the contract is for sale of 

public property or for execution of works on behalf 

of the Government. All that participating bidders are 

entitled to is a fair, equal and non-discriminatory 

treatment in the matter of evaluation of their 

tenders. It is also fairly well-settled that award of a 

contract is essentially a commercial transaction 

which must be determined on the basis of 

consideration that are relevant to such commercial 

decision. This implies that terms subject to which 

tenders are invited are not open to the judicial 

scrutiny unless it is found that the same have been 

tailor made to benefit any particular tenderer or 

class of tenderers. So also the authority inviting 

tenders can enter into negotiations or grant 

relaxation for bona fide and cogent reasons provided 

64 | P a g e 


such relaxation is permissible under the terms 

governing the tender process. 

9. Suffice it to say that in the matter of award of 

contracts the Government and its agencies have to 

act reasonably and fairly at all points of time. To 

that extent the tenderer has an enforceable right in 

the Court who is competent to examine whether the 

aggrieved party has been treated unfairly or 

discriminated against to the detriment of public 

interest. (See: Meerut Development Authority v. 

Association of Management Studies and Anr. etc. 

(2009) 6 SCC 171 and Air India Ltd. v. Cochin 

International Airport Ltd. (2000) 1 SCR 505). 

10. The scope of judicial review in contractual 

matters was further examined by this Court in Tata 

Cellular v. Union of India, (1994) 6 SCC 651, 

Raunaq International Ltd.'s case (supra) and in 

Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa and Ors. (2007) 

14 SCC 517 besides several other decisions to which 

we need not refer. In Michigan Rubber (India) Ltd. v. 

State of Karnataka and Ors., (2012) 8 SCC 216, the 

legal position on the subject was summed up after a 

comprehensive review and principles of law 

applicable to the process for judicial review identified 

in the following words: 

"19. From the above decisions, the following 
principles emerge: 

65 | P a g e 


(a) the basic requirement of Article 14 is 
fairness in action by the State, and non-
arbitrariness in essence and substance is the 
heartbeat of fair play. These actions are 
amenable to the judicial review only to the 
extent that the State must act validly for a 
discernible reason and not whimsically for 
any ulterior purpose. If the State acts within 
the bounds of reasonableness, it would be 
legitimate to take into consideration the 
national priorities; 

(b) fixation of a value of the tender is 
entirely within the purview of the executive 
and courts hardly have any role to play in 
this process except for striking down such 
action of the executive as is proved to be 
arbitrary 
or 
unreasonable. 
If 
the 
Government acts in conformity with certain 
healthy standards and norms such as 
awarding of contracts by inviting tenders, in 
those circumstances, the interference by 
Courts is very limited; 

(c) In the matter of formulating conditions 
of a tender document and awarding a 
contract, greater latitude is required to be 
conceded to the State authorities unless the 
action of tendering authority is found to be 
malicious and a misuse of its statutory 
powers, interference by Courts is not 
warranted; 

(d) Certain preconditions or qualifications for 
tenders have to be laid down to ensure that 
the contractor has the capacity and the 
resources to successfully execute the work; 
and 

(e) If the State or its instrumentalities act 
reasonably, fairly and in public interest in 
awarding contract, here again, interference 
by Court is very restrictive since no person 

66 | P a g e 


can claim fundamental right to carry on 
business with the Government. 

20. Therefore, a Court before interfering in 
tender or contractual matters, in exercise of 
power of judicial review, should pose to 
itself the following questions: 

(i) Whether the process adopted or decision 
made by the authority is mala fide or 
intended to favour someone; or whether the 
process adopted or decision made is so 
arbitrary and irrational that the court can 
say: "the decision is such that no 
responsible authority acting reasonably and 
in accordance with relevant law could have 
reached"; and (ii) Whether the public 
interest is affected. If the answers to the 
above questions are in negative, then there 
should be no interference under Article 
226."

(b) Ratnagiri Gas and Power Private Limited v. RDS Projects 

Limited and others, (2013) 1 SCC 524, wherein the Supreme 

Court held as under: 

"38. We need hardly point out that in cases where 

the decision making process is multi-layered, 

officers associated with the process are free and 

indeed expected to take views on various issues 

according to their individual perceptions. They may 

in doing so at time strike discordant notes, but that 

is but natural and indeed welcome for it is only by 

independent deliberation, that all possible facets of 

an issue are unfolded and addressed and a decision 

67 | P a g e 


that is most appropriate under the circumstances 

shaped. If every step in the decision making 

process is viewed with suspicion the integrity 

of the entire process shall be jeopardized. 

Officers taking views in the decision making 

process will feel handicapped in expressing 

their opinions freely and frankly for fear of 

being seen to be doing so for mala fides 

reasons which would in turn affect public 

interest. Nothing in the instant case was done 

without a reasonable or probable cause which is the 

very essence of the doctrine of malice in law vitiating 

administrative actions. We have, therefore, no 

hesitation in holding that the findings recorded by 

the High Court to the effect that the process of 

annulment of the tender process or the rejection of 

the tender submitted by RDS was vitiated by mala 

fides is unsustainable and is hereby set aside.... " 

(emphasis supplied) 

and submitted that in the case on hand also the decision-

making process is multi-layered. 

(c) Tejas Constructions and Infrastructure Private Limited v. 

Municipal Council, Sendhwa and another, (2012) 6 SCC 464, 

wherein the Supreme Court held as under: 

68 | P a g e 


"19. It is also noteworthy that in the matter of 

evaluation of the bids and determination of the 

eligibility of the bidders Municipal Council had the 

advantage of the aid & advice of an empanelled 

consultant, a technical hand, who could well 

appreciate the significance of the tender condition 

regarding the bidder executing the single integrated 

water supply scheme and fulfilling that condition of 

tender by reference to the work undertaken by 

them. We, therefore, see no reason to interfere with 

the view taken by the High Court of the allotment of 

work made in favour of respondent No.2. 

20. We may while parting point out that out of a 

total of Rs.19.5 crores representing the estimated 

value of the contract, respondent No.2 is certified to 

have already executed work worth Rs.11.50 crores 

and received a sum of Rs.8.79 crores towards the 

said work. More importantly the work in question 

relates to a drinking water supply scheme for the 

residents of a scarcity stricken municipality. The 

project is sponsored with the Central Government 

assistance under its urban infrastructure scheme for 

small and middle towns. The completion target of 

the scheme is September 2012. Any interference 

with the award of the contract at this stage is bound 

to delay the execution of the work and put the 

inhabitants of the municipal area to further 

hardship. 

… 

69 | P a g e 


33. Interference with the on-going work is, 

therefore, not conducive to public interest which can 

be served only if the scheme is completed as 

expeditiously as possible giving relief to the thirsting 

residents of Sendhwa. This is particularly so when 

the allotment of work in favour of respondent No.2 

does not involve any extra cost in comparison to the 

cost that may be incurred if the contract was allotted 

to the appellant-company." 

(emphasis supplied) 

(d) Siemons Public Communication Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India, 

AIR 2009 SC 1204, wherein the Supreme Court held as under: 

"33. As was noted in the case of Asia Foundation & 

Construction Ltd. (supra) though the principle of 

judicial review cannot be denied so far as exercise of 

contractual powers of government bodies are 

concerned, but it is intended to prevent arbitrariness 

or favouritism and it is exercised in the larger public 

interest or if it is brought to the notice of the Court 

that in the matter of award of a contract power has 

been exercised for any collateral purpose. 

34. On examining the facts and circumstances of the 

present case, we are of the view that none of the 

criteria has been satisfied justifying Court's 

interference in the grant of contract in favour of the 

appellants. When the power of judicial review is 

invoked in the matters relating to tenders or award 

70 | P a g e 


of contracts, certain special features have to be 

considered. A contract is a commercial transaction 

and evaluating tenders and awarding contracts are 

essentially commercial functions. In such cases 

principles of equity and natural justice stay at a 

distance. If the decision relating to award of 

contracts is bonafide and is in public interest, Courts 

will not exercise the power of judicial review and 

interfere even if it is accepted for the sake of 

argument that there is a procedural lacuna."

(e) Reliance Airport Developers (P) Ltd. v. Airports Authority of 

India and others, (2006) 10 SCC 1, wherein the Supreme 

Court held as under: 

"84. In the ultimate, the question would be whether 

in the process of selection the Government had 

adopted transparent and fair process. 

.... 

89. The extent of judicial review in a case of this 

nature where the texture cannot be matched with 

one relating to award of contract, the observations 

of this Court in Raunaq International Ltd. v. I.V.R. 

Construction Ltd. and Ors. (1999 (1) SCC 492) are 

relevant. It was observed as follows: 

'13. Hence before entertaining a writ 

petition and passing any interim orders in 

such petitions, the court must carefully 

71 | P a g e 


weigh conflicting public interests. Only when 

it comes to a conclusion that there is an 

overwhelming public interest in entertaining 

the petition, the court should intervene.' 

... 

91. In the Queens Bench decision in R. v. 

Department of Constitutional Affairs (2006 All ER 

(D) 101) it was inter-alia held as follows: 

'It is not every wandering from the precise 

paths of best practice that lends fuel to a 

claim for judicial review.'" 

(emphasis supplied) 

(f) Johnson and Johnson Ltd. v. State of J & K and others, AIR 

2010 Jammu and Kashmir 113, wherein a Division Bench of 

the Jammu and Kashmir High Court held as under: 

"6. In the writ petition, it was contended that 

Suturing materials, manufactured and sold by the 

writ petitioner-respondent, have no complaint as 

regards their quality but, surprisingly, the tender 

submitted by writ petitioner-respondent has not 

been accepted and, instead, tender submitted by 

appellant has been accepted, although, the price 

offered by respondent-writ petitioner was almost 

40% lower than the price offered by appellant. 

... 

72 | P a g e 


21. The materials discussed above, would indicate 

that it is not a case of absence of any material. All 

those materials suggested that the quality of 

materials to be supplied by appellant is without any 

defect and the said reputation has been maintained 

by appellant for a considerable period of time. On 

the other hand, there is a view that materials of 

other suppliers, including those of writ petitioner 

-respondent, used by them do not have such 

unblemished record. In other words, the materials 

on record depicted that whereas materials to be 

supplied by appellant are doubt free, but materials 

to be supplied by petitioner-respondent and other 

tenderers are with some ting of doubt. The Tender 

Committee, at that stage, could do many a things. 

One of them could be sending the samples of 

materials to be supplied by different tenderers to a 

laboratory, as has been directed by the judgment 

and order under appeal, but only after specifying 

standard. They could take assistance of Indian 

Standard Institution. They could also approach many 

other bodies in India and abroad. But before a 

Judicial Review Court, the question is not what they 

could do, but what they did. It is possible that they 

could devise a mean for the purpose of making it 

absolutely doubt free that the quality of materials to 

be supplied by appellant is better than the quality of 

the materials to be supplied by respondent writ 

petitioner. It is also possible that by taking recourse 

73 | P a g e 


to such device they could bring on record factors 

which would show that they have done a stupendous 

work. However, they have not done so. The decision 

taken by them is based on the aforementioned 

materials. A Judicial Review Court could pronounce 

that what they have done could not be done, for, 

there was no material to support what they have 

done. For that purpose, it was necessary for the 

Judicial Review Court to say that none of the 

opinions contained in the recommendation as well as 

those 
six 
letters hold good. The 
original 

recommendation may be ignored, some of those 

letters may also be ignored but can all of them be 

ignored? If all of them cannot be ignored, then the 

conclusion would be that there was some material, 

on the basis of which the decision as was taken 

could be taken. If the logical conclusion is that the 

decision on the materials, as were placed before the 

Purchase Committee, is one of the plausible 

decisions, but may not be the perfect or best 

decision, a Judicial Review Court may not touch the 

decision." 

(emphasis supplied) 

11.2. Relying on the above said decisions, it is submitted 

by the learned Advocate General that the contract is a 

commercial transaction and it is not open to judicial scrutiny 

74 | P a g e 


and any interference would only delay the execution of the 

work. 

(B) COMPLIANCE OF STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS 

12.1. Referring to the provisions of the TTIT Act, he 

submitted that the Tender Accepting Authority is bound to 

accept the lowest tender in terms of Section 10(2) of the TTIT 

Act. Only with the lowest bidder, negotiation can be held in 

terms of Section 10(3) of the TTIT Act. Before accepting the 

bid in terms of Section 10(6) of the TTIT Act, Section 12 of the 

TTIT Act empowers the Tender Accepting Authority to negotiate 

with the lowest tenderer and reject the tender with reasons. 

12.2. Expatiating the above said plea, it is submitted 

that the Techno-Commercial Bid was opened on 26.7.2013. 

The Board Level Tender Committee (for brevity, "the BLTC"), in 

its 129 th Meeting held on 18.11.2013, accepted the Bid 

Qualification Requirements (BQR) of the appellant and the 

75 | P a g e 


third respondent and rejected the other two bids. In the 140 th 

meeting convened on 27.1.2014, the BLTC approved opening 

of price bids of the appellant and the third respondent. The 

44 th Board Meeting held on 30.1.2014 granted approval for 

opening of the price bids of BHEL and the appellant as per the 

recommendation of the BLTC. In the said meeting, it was also 

resolved to negotiate with the evaluated L1 bidder after 

evaluation of their price-cum-financial offer. This is stated to 

be in due compliance of Section 10(1) of the TTIT Act. 

Thereafter, price bids were opened on 5.2.2014. It is stated 

that Supplementary Price Bids submitted by the appellant and 

the third respondent on 5.2.2014 were also considered. 

Thereafter, the Consultant gave his recommendation on 

30.5.2014. On 2.6.2014, BLTC granted approval for conducting 

negotiation with the third respondent. After some intervening 

proceedings, in the 51 st Board Meeting dated 26.9.2014, the 

Board resolved to accept the tender of the third respondent 

and this is stated to be in compliance of Section 10(6) of the 

TTIT Act. It is submitted by the learned Advocate General that 

under Section 10(2) of the TTIT Act, the lowest tenderer is 

76 | P a g e 


identified and it is only formal acceptance, based on which 

negotiation is done with the lowest tenderer as contemplated 

under Sections 10(3) and 12 of the TTIT Act. In the order 

under Section 10(6) of the TTIT Act, the reasons for such 

acceptance are stated. 
Thereafter, by proceedings dated 

27.9.2014, the reasons for not accepting the appellant's 

representations were set out in detail and communicated to 

the appellant. 

12.3. In the case on hand, there is no violation of 

statutory provisions as alleged by the appellant and, therefore, 

the order passed by the learned Single Judge does not warrant 

interference. 

(C) VIOLATION OF INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS BY 
THE APPELLANT 

13.1. Highlighting Clause 7.3 of the Instructions to 

Bidders which states that the owner is not bound to give any 

reason for the rejection of the bid, it is contended that the 

77 | P a g e 


appellant having accepted the tender conditions is not bound 

to seek reasons for rejection of the bid. 

13.2. Inviting attention to Clause 25.4 of the Instructions 

to Bidders which states that while the bids are under 

consideration, bidders and/or their representatives or other 

interested parties are advised to refrain from contacting by any 

means, the purchaser and/or his employees/representatives on 

matters related to the bids under consideration, it is pleaded 

that despite such specific clause in the Instructions to Bidders, 

the appellant had sent representations on 30.5.2014, 

5.6.2014, 16.6.2014, 17.6.2014, 1.7.2014 and 8.7.2014 to 

exert pressure on TANGEDCO. 

13.3. That apart, Clause 25.5 of the Instructions to 

Bidders states that any effort by a bidder to influence the 

owner in the owner's bid evaluation, bid comparison or 

contract award decision may result in the rejection of the 

bidder's bid. However, the appellant sent representation on 

16.6.2014 giving comparative statement of evaluation of the 

78 | P a g e 


bids of BHEL and the appellant; alleging poor track record of 

the third respondent, and also stating about the wrong 

evaluation done by the TANGEDCO. This is in clear violation of 

Clause 25.5 of the Instructions to Bidders. In effect, it is 

pleaded that the representations sent by the appellant are in 

gross violation of Clause 25 of the Instructions to bidders. 

13.4. It is submitted that Rule 27 of the TTIT Rules 

mandates that the process of tender evaluation to be 

confidential until the award of the contract is notified. The 

appellant could not have knowledge of what has been 

considered and there is no scope for them to know about it. 

Moreover, as per Rule 27(iii) of the TTIT Rules, the tenderers 

shall not make any attempt to establish unsolicited and 

unauthorised contact with the Tender Accepting Authority, 

Tender Inviting Authority or Tender Scrutiny Committee and, 

therefore, the representations made by the appellant are 

meant to exert pressure on the Tender Accepting Authority. It 

is pleaded that this aspect should be considered in the light of 

the fact that there are only two qualified bidders. 

79 | P a g e 


(D) PUBLICATION IN TENDER BULLETIN: 

14.1. It is contended that as per Rule 30(3) of the TTIT 

Rules, there is no requirement that the tender evaluation 

report should be sent to the Tender Bulletin Officer. All that is 

contemplated to be sent to the Tender Bulletin Officer is a 

statement of evaluation of tenders with a comparative 

statement of tenders received and decision therein for 

publication in the Tender Bulletin. 
The learned Advocate 

General submitted that publication has been effected in the 

Tender Bulletin on 9.10.2014 complying with Section 10(7) of 

the TTIT Act and Rule 30(3) of the TTIT Rules. The copy of the 

tender bulletin was filed for the first time before this Court. 

14.2. Be that as it may, taking support from the 

judgment of the learned Single Judge, more particularly, 

paragraph 37, it is pleaded that even if the procedure 

contemplated under Section 10(7) of the TTIT Act read with 

Rule 30(3) of the TTIT Rules is not complied with, it will not 

80 | P a g e 


vitiate the tender process, as post finalization of tender only 

the said provisions come into play. 

(E) SECTION 4(1)(D) OF THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION 
ACT: 

15.1. The obligation under Section 4(1)(d) of the Right to 

Information Act is only to furnish information and not reasons. 

What is "information" is mentioned in Section 2(f) of the RTI 

Act. This information will not include the reasons for the 

decision. Even for getting information under Section 4(1)(d) of 

the RTI Act, he has to make a request under Section 6 of the 

RTI Act. 
It is submitted that, in any event, this provision will 

apply only for administrative or quasi-judicial decisions and not 

to contractual matters. Moreover, seeking reasons for a 

decision is not information within the meaning of Section 

4(1)(d) of the RTI Act. In any event, Section 4(1) of the RTI 

81 | P a g e 


Act is only a guideline. In support of the said submission, 

reliance was placed on a decision of the Bombay High Court in 

Dr.Celsa Pinto v. Goa State Information Commission and 

Another, AIR 2008 Bombay 120, wherein it is held as under: 

"8. As regards the requisition Nos. 2 & 3 by which 

the petitioner was called upon to give information as 

to why the post of Curator was not filled up by 

promotion and why the Librarian from the 

Engineering College was not considered for 

promotion, the petitioner had initially answered by 

stating that the information was N.A.(Not Available). 

Thereafter, she had clarified by stating that it means 

I don't know. The Commission has initially observed 

in para. No. 13 that it does not see anything wrong 

in the petitioner's reply that she does not know the 

information because P.I.O. cannot manufacture the 

information. However, in para. No. 14, the 

Commission has observed that the petitioner has not 

supplied a correct information because she corrected 

information on points No. 2 & 3. It can be recalled 

that the petitioner corrected the information by 

explaining that Not Available meant she does not 

know. It is not possible to accept the reasoning of 

the Commission. There is no substance in the 

observation that merely because the petitioner 

initially said Not Available and later on corrected her 

statement and said she does not know and the 

82 | P a g e 


petitioner provided incomplete and incorrect 

information. In the first place, the Commission ought 

to have noticed that the Act confers on the citizen 

the right to information. Information has been 

defined by Section 2(f) as follows. 

'Section 2(f) -Information means any 
material in any form, including records, 
documents,memos 
e-mails, 
opinions, 
advices, press releases, circulars, orders, 
logbooks, 
contracts, 
reports, 
papers, 
samples, models, data material held in any 
electronic form and information relating to 
any private body which can be accessed by 
a public authority under any other law for 
the time being in force;' 

The definition cannot include within its fold answers 

to the question why which would be the same thing 

as asking the reason for a justification for a 

particular thing. The Public Information Authorities 

cannot expect to communicate to the citizen the 

reason why a certain thing was done or not done in 

the sense of a justification because the citizen 

makes a requisition about information. Justifications 

are matter within the domain of adjudicating 

authorities and cannot properly be classified as 

information." 

(emphasis supplied) 

15.2. That apart, he also placed reliance on a decision of 

a Division Bench of this Court in M.Vasudevan v. The Chief 

83 | P a g e 


Executive Officer, CMDA, Chennai and others, AIR 2006 

Madras 45, wherein it is held as under: 

"4. Mr.R.Krishnamurthy, learned senior counsel 
appearing for the appellant submitted that no 
reasons have been given in the order rejecting the 
petitioner's tender. He relied on section 12 of the 
Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998 and 
has contended that reasons must be given for 
rejecting the tender. 

5. We do not accept this contention. An order 
rejecting tender is not a quasi judicial order nor is it 
even an administrative order which affects rights 
and liabilities. Hence neither reasons have to be 
given in the said order nor opportunity of hearing 
has to be given before passing the said order." 

15.3. It is submitted that the provisions of the TTIT Act 

cannot be interpreted in the light of the RTI Act, as TTIT Act is 

a special enactment dealing with tenders. In this regard, 

reliance was placed on Sections 19 and 20 of the Act, more 

particularly Section 20 of the Act, which states that the 

provisions of the Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything 

inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time 

being in force, which also includes the subsequent enactments. 

84 | P a g e 


15.4. That apart, Rule 7(1) of the TTIT Rules states that 

the tender bulletin shall contain only information of the notice 

inviting tenders and the orders accepting a tender and does 

not in itself create a legal right or liability. Therefore, even a 

successful bidder cannot claim any right. 

15.5. The Division Bench in the earlier round of litigation 

(dated 19.8.2014 in W.A.No.1065 of 2014) has directed the 

TANGEDCO to communicate the reasons and the same have 

been duly communicated in compliance of the said order, even 

though reasons need not be given in terms of the decision of 

the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in 

M.Vasudevan case, referred supra. 

15.6. In any event, the impugned communication dated 

27.9.2014 of the first respondent deals with as to how each 

item of evaluation is done. They refer to some materials and if 

those materials are sufficient for consideration by the 

TANGEDCO, then it cannot be said that all other aspects have 

not been considered. He submitted that adequacy of material 

85 | P a g e 


will not affect the decision and in this regard, he placed 

reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in Michigan 

Rubber (India) Limited v. State of Karnataka, (2012) 8 SCC 

216, wherein after referring to Jagdish Mandal case and Tejas 

Constructions and Infrastructure Private Limited v. Municipal 

Council, Sendhwa and another, (2012) 6 SCC 464, it was held 

as under: 

"23. From the above decisions, the following 

principles emerge: 

(a) the basic requirement of Article 14 is fairness in 

action by the State, and non-arbitrariness in essence 

and substance is the heartbeat of fair play. These 

actions are amenable to the judicial review only to 

the extent that the State must act validly for a 

discernible reason and not whimsically for any 

ulterior purpose. If the State acts within the bounds 

of reasonableness, it would be legitimate to take into 

consideration the national priorities; 

(b) fixation of a value of the tender is entirely within 

the purview of the executive and courts hardly have 

any role to play in this process except for striking 

down such action of the executive as is proved to be 

arbitrary or unreasonable. If the Government acts in 

conformity with certain healthy standards and norms 

such as awarding of contracts by inviting tenders, in 

86 | P a g e 


those circumstances, the interference by Courts is 

very limited; 

(c) In the matter of formulating conditions of a 

tender document and awarding a contract, greater 

latitude is required to be conceded to the State 

authorities unless the action of tendering authority is 

found to be malicious and a misuse of its statutory 

powers, interference by Courts is not warranted; 

(d) Certain preconditions or qualifications for tenders 

have to be laid down to ensure that the contractor 

has the capacity and the resources to successfully 

execute the work; and 

(e) If the State or its instrumentalities act 

reasonably, fairly and in public interest in awarding 

contract, here again, interference by Court is very 

restrictive since no person can claim fundamental 

right to carry on business with the Government." 

(emphasis supplied) 

15.7. Repudiating the contention of the appellant that the 

impugned order does not contain comparative evaluation; the 

Tender Bulletin did not contain comparative evaluation nor 

placed any material with reference to comparative evaluation, 

it is submitted that the said plea is hypertechnical and on that 

ground the tender process cannot be interfered with. There 

87 | P a g e 


are materials before the authority to show that decision has 

been taken after proper application of mind and the same does 

not vitiate the tender process. 

15.8. There cannot be any two different opinions on the 

question that this project is of great public interest because, it 

is for a power starved State. That apart, just because two 

views are possible commercially, it cannot be a ground for 

judicial review. 

(F) RATE OF INTEREST: 

16.1. Rule 14(5) of the TTIT Rules states that "The 

tender documents shall clearly indicate whether any variations 

in the commercial terms prescribed in the documents will be 

permitted and if so to what extent such variations would be 

considered." In the case on hand, Clause 25.4 of the 

Instructions to Bidders does not permit to change the 

substance of the bids, after the bids have been opened. 

However, the appellant claims that they have offered lower 

rate of interest. The original interest rate offered is not in 

88 | P a g e 


accordance with tender terms. As per Clause 14.0(d)(5), the 

rate of interest the bidder should quote should be fixed, 

whereas the appellant has not specified the fixed rate of 

interest. However, in the term sheet submitted on behalf of 

the appellant, it is stated that "Both rates are estimated based 

on current market conditions. The final pricing is subject to 

the lender's final discretion, and may be adjusted in the 

future." This quote of variant rate of interest is against the 

Tender conditions and, therefore, it cannot be considered. 

However, it is not disputed that before opening of the bid, 

namely on 5.2.2014, the appellant has produced a letter from 

its bankers dated 13.1.2014, agreeing for fixed rate of interest 

(hedged) till the entire tenor of loan. 

16.2. On the question of reduction of interest, it is 

submitted that as per Rule 23 of the TTIT Rules, changes and 

alternations are not permitted after opening of the tender. In 

this case, there is a material change because this interest 

forms part of substance of the bid, in terms of Clause 12.0, 

which states that the price bid shall include all taxes and duties 

89 | P a g e 


and interest and finance charges, commitment fees, etc. 

during IDC period. Therefore, according to the learned 

Advocate General, any change in the rate of interest would be 

material change affecting the substance of the bid. That part, 

Clause 25.4 of the Instructions to Bidders does not permit the 

bidders to change the substance of the bids, after the bids are 

opened. 

16.3. In the case on hand, the price bid was opened on 

5.2.2014 and supplementary bid was submitted by the 

appellant and third respondent on the said date. The offer of 

the appellant for reducing the rate of interest from 7.2% to 

6.2% was given on 5.6.2014. The Consultant's report is dated 

30.5.2014. As per the terms of Rule 23 of the TTIT Rules, one 

cannot alter the price bid after it is opened and the substance 

of the bid cannot be altered in terms of Clause 25.4 of the 

Instructions to Bidders. 

16.4. In response to the plea of the appellant that Clause 

25.3 of Instructions to Bidders enables the respondents to 

90 | P a g e 


relax or waive any of the conditions of the specification in the 

best interests of the TANGEDCO, the learned Advocate General 

submitted that the appellant cannot claim such relaxation as a 

matter of right. The TANGEDCO reduced the rate of interest 

for third respondent on 27.6.2014 in exercise of the power 

under Section 10(3) of the TTIT Act, which permits 

negotiation. Even if Clause 25.3 of the Instructions to Bidders 

permits relaxation of the conditions in the best interests of the 

TANGEDCO, in view of Rule 23 of the TTIT Rules, no alterations 

can be permitted after tender opening. 

(G) COMMITMENT FEE: 

17.1. Anent Commitment Fee, in the term sheet it is 

stated that "The accrued commitment fee (1% per annum) is 

payable on the last day of each successive interest period 

which ends during the availability period, on the last day of the 

availability period and, if cancelled in full, on the cancelled 

amount of the relevant Lender's Commitment at the time the 

cancellation is effective." According to the learned Advocate 

91 | P a g e 


General, the Commitment Fee is part of Financing Charges 

specified in Clause 14.0 (d)(6) and the appellant cannot 

contend that the same should be excluded for the purpose of 

bid evaluation. He submitted that payment of commitment fee 

is contingent, but the TANGEDCO decided to include it and 

such terms have been accepted by the appellant and now the 

appellant cannot resile from such commitment. It is within the 

exclusive prerogative of the employer to include commitment 

fee in the price. When the terms of tender are clear that 

commitment fee cannot be excluded, the appellant cannot 

quote in contra terms. 

17.2. As per Clause 14.0 (d)(1) of the Instructions to 

bidders, the loan amount should include "at least 75% of the 

Total EPC Cost + 100% of Interest during construction and 

Financing Cost". Therefore, interest on the entire loan amount 

from the date of signing has to be reckoned separately based 

on the drawal. 
The failure on the part of the appellant to 

include commitment fee in the repayment schedule found at 

Page 616 of Volume I, while including the same in the break-

92 | P a g e 


up of financial charges found at Page 615 of Volume I is 

nothing but an error of calculation and cannot be interpreted to 

his advantage. In support of the said plea, the Repayment 

Schedule found at page 616 of Volume I is extracted as such: 

93 | P a g e 


94 | P a g e 


95 | P a g e 


(H) INTEREST ON MANAGEMENT FEE AND GUARANTEE 
FEE CANNOT BE EXCLUDED: 

18.1. The lender in his letter dated 21.10.2013 had 

clearly confirmed that all fees, including management fees, 

commitment fees and legal fees, insurance premium, etc., will 

form part of debt-financing. The appellant is not disputing the 

liability for payment of interest on financial charges, but wants 

such interest to be reckoned only for the moratorium period 

which begins after the completion of the project. 
It is 

submitted that all the above charges fall due during the period 

of construction and, therefore, the plea of the appellant not to 

include interest on these amounts during the construction 

period is totally flawed. Therefore, there is no perversity or 

arbitrariness in the decision taken as per the terms of the 

tender; as per the banking practice and as per the term sheet 

given by the lender. 

18.2. The learned Advocate General submitted that 

overwhelming public interest should be the consideration even 

in cases where a legal point has been made out. In support of 

96 | P a g e 


this plea, he relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in 

Master Marine Services (P) Ltd. v. Metcalfe & Hodgkinson (P) 

Ltd. and another, (2005) 6 SCC 139, wherein it is held as 

under: 

"15. The law relating to award of contract by State 

and public sector corporations was reviewed in Air 

India Ltd. v. Cochin International Airport Ltd. 2000 

(2) SCC 617 and it was held that the award of a 

contract, whether by a private party or by a State, is 

essentially a commercial transaction. It can choose 

its own method to arrive at a decision and it is free 

to grant any relaxation for bona fide reasons, if the 

tender conditions permit such a relaxation. It was 

further held that the State, its corporations, 

instrumentalities and agencies have the public duty 

to be fair to all concerned. Even when some defect 

is found in the decision making process, the Court 

must exercise its discretionary powers under Article 

226 with great caution and should exercise it only in 

furtherance of public interest and not merely on the 

making out of a legal point. The Court should always 

keep the larger public interest in mind in order to 

decide whether its intervention is called for or not. 

Only when it comes to a conclusion that 

overwhelming public interest requires interference, 

the Court should interfere." 

(emphasis supplied) 

97 | P a g e 


The only public interest the appellant is arguing is that there is 

a difference in the interest rates and if that is reckoned, the 

appellant would be the lowest bidder. In fact, the interest rate 

quoted by the appellant is variant and vague and not fixed as 

contemplated under the Instructions to bidders. 

(I) APPOINTMENT OF CONSULTANT: 

19. In the case on hand, Consultant was appointed 

pursuant to the Board Resolution dated 28.1.2012. He 

participated in all pre-bid and post-bid meetings and the 

minutes are signed by all the parties and the consultant and, 

therefore, the appellant was very much aware of the 

appointment of the consultant and the role played by him and 

cannot plead ignorance. 

(J) VENDOR RATING & PAST PERFORMANCE: 

20.1. Vendor rating is not defined in the terms of 

conditions. But there is a reference to such term in Clause 

29(viii). There is no statute which defines vendor rating or 

prescribes the method for vendor rating. Therefore, assessing 

98 | P a g e 


the vendor rating and past performance is within the subjective 

satisfaction of the employer or the purchaser. 

20.2. The appellant relied on the following circumstances 

to show that the vendor rating and past performance of BHEL 

is not satisfactory: 

(i)The letter from the Hon'ble Chief Minister dated 

26.11.2013 addressed to the Hon'ble Prime Minister of 

India; 

(ii)The Counter Affidavit filed by Tamil Nadu Electricity 

Board in W.P.(MD) No.3730 of 2012 before the Madurai 

Bench of the Madras High Court; 

(iii)The report of Comptroller and Auditor General of India, 

New Delhi dated 17.2.2014; 

(iv)Order of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, 

New Delhi, dated 19.6.2014; and 

(v)various newspaper reports and the contents of the 

TANGEDCO website. 

20.3. In response to the above, the learned Advocate 

General submitted that the letter of the Hon'ble Chief Minister 

has referred to the fact that many Central Generating Stations 

99 | P a g e 


have been shut down at the same time and there is no specific 

reference to BHEL. 

20.4. With regard to North Chennai Thermal Power 

Station Stage-II, Unit-I, it is submitted that the said power 

station is in operation now. The reason for the delay is an 

accident to generator stator. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board 

filed a counter affidavit in W.P.(MD) No.3730 of 2012 before 

the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court stating that 

penalty towards delay in completion of the project is 

attributable to BHEL and the same will be recovered from 

them. It is submitted that it cannot be the sole criterion for 

deciding the past performance of the vendor. 

20.5. With regard to the report of the Comptroller and 

Auditor General, it is stated that it is not for this Court to look 

into it and draw any inference. In support of the said plea, 

reliance was placed on a decision of the Delhi High Court in 

Sarvesh Bisaria v. Union of India (Order dated 3.12.2014 

100 | P a g e 


made in W.P.(C) No.8502 of 2014), wherein it is held as 

under: 

"20. The role of CAG Reports thus, is to enable the 

legislature to oversee that functioning of the 

Government and it is for the legislature to take 

action on the basis of CAG Reports or to direct the 

Government to take action on the basis thereof and 

till the legislature has not so directed, this Court 

cannot direct any action to be taken on the basis of 

the CAG Reports. The Supreme Court, in Centre for 

Environment & Food Security Vs. Union of India 

(2011) 5 SCC 668, concerned with directions sought 

for proper implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi 

National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, 

ordered investigation by CBI in reference to the CAG 

Report, only after satisfying itself that the CAG 

Report had been accepted by the Government and 

the Government itself had directed follow up action 

in terms thereof. The petitioner herein however 

wants us to issue a mandamus, for the CAG Reports, 

even before they are placed before the Parliament / 

Legislature and before the Parliament / Legislature 

has accepted or rejected the same, to become the 

basis of investigation by CVC and / or Lokpal / 

Lokayukta. The same is clearly not permitted under 

the Constitutional scheme." 

(emphasis supplied) 

101 | P a g e 


It is submitted that only when the report is placed before the 

Assembly and accepted, action can be taken based on such 

report. 

20.6. He also placed reliance on a decision of this Court 

in C.Selvaraj v. State of Tamil Nadu, (Order dated 21.8.2014 

made in W.P.No.34038 of 2014), wherein it was held as under: 

"16. Learned Advocate General has also referred to 

the unreported judgment of the Division Bench of 

Delhi High Court decided on 03.12.2014 in W.P. (C) 

No.8502 of 2014 (Sarvesh Bisaria vs. Union of India 

and others), which in turn has referred to certain 

earlier judicial pronouncements in respect of the 

major controversy raised in the present petition. The 

Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in CWP 

No.1716/2000 (B.L.Wadhera vs. Union of India) 

decided on 16.05.2001 raised the issue of follow-up 

action on the reports of the CAG pointing out 

irregularities or illegalities. A preliminary objection 

was raised regarding the subject matter as the same 

was within the specific domain of the Parliament. 

The Court opined that the validity of any proceedings 

in the Parliament cannot be called into question in 

the Court and held that once it was found that the 

Legislature had the power and privilege, it must be 

left to the House itself to determine whether there in 

102 | P a g e 


fact has been any breach of privilege, while taking 

support from the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court in Pandit M.S.M.Sharma vs. Dr.Shreekrishna 

Sinha (AIR 1960 SC 1186). 

17. It is enunciated that once the CAG Report is laid 

before the Assembly, it is dealt with by the Rules 

and Procedures of the Assembly. The role of CAG 

report is to enable the Legislature to oversee that 

functioning of the Government and it is for the 

Legislature to take action on the basis of CAG 

Reports or to direct the Government to take action 

on the basis thereof. 

18. On the conspectus of the legal position 

enunciated aforesaid and the averments made in the 

petition, it is quite obvious from the cryptic petition 

that there only allegations of misappropriation and 

mis-utilisation of thousands of crores! It, thus, 

appear that the past history of disputes between the 

petitioner and its employer, the second respondent, 

11 has coloured the thinking of the petitioner to 

make allegations largely on the press reporting or 

averment in other petitions, other than the aspect of 

minority view, of the third respondent/Commission, 

which is stated to be the subject matter of challenge 

in appeal proceedings. 

103 | P a g e 


19. The substratum of the submissions of the 
learned counsel for the petitioner really arose over 
the aspects emanating from the report of the CAG, 
the procedure for which has been explained 
aforesaid. We are faced with the position where in 
terms of the procedure, the COPU is stated to be still 
examining the matter, and no finality has been 
achieved as yet. Only on submission of the COPU 
report, the same being placed before the Legislative 
Assembly, would the occasion arise for final view to 
emerge in terms of Rule 217(1) and even the 
reports of COPU are to be treated as confidential 
until presented to the Assembly. Thus, what is the 
confidential material disclosed to us was to satisfy 
our conscience and cannot be relied upon or that 
material required to be produced and filed before the 
Court." 

(emphasis supplied) 

The report of CAG on BHEL will be examined and considered by 

the Public Undertakings Committee and it is not for this Court 

to pass any order based on such reports. 

20.7. Moreover, the reference made by the appellant to 

the order of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, 

New Delhi, dated 19.6.2014; and various newspaper reports 

and the contents of the TANGEDCO website is of no 

104 | P a g e 


consequence, as the project referred to in the order of the 

CERC is in operation as on date, and with regard to newspaper 

reports, it is stated that TANGEDCO cannot act on media 

reports and has to act only based on acceptable documents 

furnished by the bidders. 

20.8. With regard to the past performance of the 

appellant, it is submitted by the learned Advocate General that 

most of the projects undertaken by them are sub-critical 

projects. That apart, the work involved in BTG (Boiler Turbine 

Generator) is only 40% of the total work involved in 

supercritical project. 
The scheduled completion period in 

respect of one of the projects undertaken by the members of 

the appellant consortium was delayed for years, and in yet 

another project the name of the appellant consortium is not 

found. 

(K) ALTERNATIVE REMEDY: 

21. The writ petition is not maintainable because of the 

alternative remedy of appeal available under Section 11 of the 

105 | P a g e 


TTIT Act. All the issues now raised by the appellant have to be 

gone into by the Appellate Authority both factually and legally. 

There is a statute and there is a statutory appeal. With regard 

to the plea of the appellant that the appeal would be from 

Caesar to Caesar, the learned Advocate General submitted that 

in terms of Rules 9 and 12 of the Tamil Nadu Government 

Business Rules the appeal has to be decided by the Hon'ble 

Minister and the signing authority is the Secretary to the 

Government of the department concerned and, therefore, the 

appeal if filed would be decided on its own individual merits. 

The writ petitions are liable to be rejected on the plea of 

alternative remedy. 

(L) FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE APPELLANT: 

22. With regard to the financial status of the appellant, 

the Chief Engineer/Projects, TANGEDCO has filed an affidavit 

dated 25.8.2015 stating that proceedings have been initiated 

under Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and 

Security Interest Act, 2002 against Trishe Renewable Energy 

Services Limited, to which proceedings the appellant stood as 

106 | P a g e 


guarantor and, therefore, it is submitted that all is not well 

with the financial status of the appellant and it is pleaded that 

this subsequent event should also be considered by the Court 

to assess the conduct of the appellant. 

CONTENTIONS RAISED ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD 
RESPONDENT 

23.1. Mr.Krishna Srinivas, learned counsel appearing for 

the third respondent contended that the appellant lacks the 

basic credibility to make any allegation against the third 

respondent. The Consortium Agreement itself was born on 

11.5.2013, after the Notice Inviting Tender was issued on 

6.5.2013. Trishe, the local company, was incorporated on 

31.10.2011 and there is no material produced to justify their 

competence in the field of energy. The entire focus is only on 

CSEPDI, which is a design institute. He pleaded that a reading 

of Brief Introduction and Achievement shows that CSEPDI 

undertook only design projects and they are not EPC Projects. 

In effect, it is argued that design is the core area of the leader 

107 | P a g e 


of the consortium and moreover, they have no experience in 

India insofar as supercritical Thermal Power Projects. 

23.2. He pleaded that BHEL has been granted 

"Maharatna" status by the Department of Heavy Industries, 

Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, 

Government of India, which has been so far awarded to only 

seven Central Public Sector Enterprises in the country. 
He 

also brought to the notice of this Court the various awards 

given to BHEL by the Ministry of Power for Outstanding 

Performance. 

23.3. It is pleaded that the present tender is an 

International Competitive Bidding, whereas the consortium has 

got private contracts to the maximum by negotiation. 

23.4. With regard to the letter of the Hon'ble Chief 

Minister dated 25.11.2013 addressed to the Hon'ble Prime 

Minister of India, it is pleaded that BHEL has not been singled 

out, so vendor rating need not fall and this does not vitiate the 

108 | P a g e 


fact that the third respondent has done a lot in the power 

sector. 

23.5. With regard to the reports of the CAG; the order of 

the CERC and other newspaper reports, he reiterated the 

submissions made by the learned Advocate General. 

23.6. The third respondent produced a status report of 

the project, stating that the work is under progress and they 

have expended substantial amount. 

REPLY OF THE APPELLANT 

24.1. Refuting the above said contentions made on behalf 

of the respondents, Mr.Sriram Panchu, learned Senior Counsel 

appearing for the appellant argued that: 

(i)The Consultant's report is dated 30.5.2014 and the 

Consultant in any way declared that BHEL is L1. That apart, 

the day on which the Consultant's report was submitted, 

namely 30.5.2014, is a Friday and there is no chance for the 

109 | P a g e 


Board to take a decision by 2.6.2014, namely within two 

days (Saturday and Sunday), after scrutinizing voluminous 

records submitted by the appellant, BHEL and the 

Consultant. 

(ii)The Board Level Technical Committee is also not the 

Tender Accepting Authority. They cannot declare BHEL as 

L1. Only the Board can do it and it cannot delegate the 

legal duty cast on it to the BLTC. At best, BLTC can be an 

evaluation or scrutiny committee, but not Tender Accepting 

Authority. When the appellant submitted representations, 

BHEL was not L1 and, therefore, the representations should 

have been considered, more so, in compliance of the 

direction of the Division Bench of this Court in the judgment 

dated 19.8.2014 made in W.A.No.1065 of 2014. 

(iii)In the representation dated 13.6.2014, it has been 

clearly stated that "there shall be No Commitment Fee, if 

the loan amount is fully utilized as per the Schedule spelt 

out in the Financial Contract." Despite such stand taken by 

the appellant, the TANGEDCO has included it. 

110 | P a g e 


(iv) 

It is pleaded that the Consultant has loaded on the 

appellant an upfront fee (including interest) of Rs.801.18 

Crores. According to the appellant, if Commitment Fee and 

the Interest on Management Fee and Guarantee Fee are 

excluded and accordingly, the Moratorium Interest is 

reduced to Rs.17.875 Crores, the Consultant could have 

only loaded Rs.489.136 Crores. However, the Consultant 

has erroneously evaluated the bid of the appellant at 

Rs.9207.264 Crores. 

(v)Moreover, if the appellant's offer dated 5.6.2014 for 

reduction of interest rate from 7.2% per annum to 6.2% per 

annum had been accepted, TANGEDCO would have saved 

over Rs.1300 Crores on the Total Cost of Ownership basis. 

The appellant offered reduction of interest rate from 7.2% 

to 6.2% much before the third respondent offered interest 

reduction from 12.25% to 12.15% only on 27.6.2014, 

however the same was not considered by TANGEDCO. 

(vi)With regard to the fixed rate of interest, it was pointed 

out that in the email dated 10.1.2014 sent by the Chief 

Engineer, enclosing a tabular column, it is specifically 

111 | P a g e 


clarified at Sl.No.9 with regard to "Interest Rate" that "the 

fixed rate of interest has already been indicated in the 

Financial Term Sheet and the exact value has been 

submitted along with the price bid". This, even according to 

TANGEDCO, was the bidder's response vide letters dated 

18.12.2013 and 7.1.2014. If any clarification was required, 

the same ought to have been sought for, as in the case of 

the third respondent, before taking a decision on who is L1. 

Failure to consider renders the decision making process bad 

on account of procedural impropriety, one of tenets of 

Wednesbury's Principle. 

(vii)As per Section 10(1) of the TTIT Act, the Tender 

Accepting Authority shall cause an objective evaluation of 

the tenders taking into consideration the prevailing market 

rate for procurement. The appellant is procuring money. 

Therefore, the Tender Accepting Authority should take into 

account the prevailing market rate, saving interest to the 

tune of Rs.1300 Crores. This is an issue that should have 

been considered in public interest. 

112 | P a g e 


24.2. Mr.N.L.Rajah, learned counsel for the appellant 

argued that: 

(i)As per Clause 14.0 of the Instructions to Bidders, more 

specifically Clause 14.0(b), the Financing Term Sheet shall 

be based on preliminary appraisal of the project jointly by 

the bidder and the lender satisfying themselves on the 

project financial viability. Laying emphasis on the term 

"preliminary" it is pleaded that it is only a preliminary stage 

and the TANGEDCO ought to have called for clarifications, if 

so advised. If in the repayment schedule the appellant has 

stated anything wrong, the lender will rectify it, there is 

nothing for the TANGEDCO to ring alarm bells. 

(ii)The poor performance in executing the project by BHEL, 

referred to in the order of CERC, is not only on account of 

shutdown, but also on technical reasons and, therefore, the 

past performance of BHEL should also be considered. 

(iii)The CAG report says Rs.3200 Crores is to be collected 

from BHEL by TANGEDCO, but there is no reply from 

TANGEDCO. Even if the CAG report requires approval from 

the Public Undertakings Committee, there must be an 

113 | P a g e 


answer by the TANGEDCO to the Court as to the veracity of 

the said disclosure in the CAG report. 

(iv)It cannot be said that the appellant is a private player 

and just because the appellant is a private enterprise, it 

cannot be disregarded. The appellant produced End-user 

Certificates. However, the learned Single Judge has held 

that the appellant has no experience in India, when the 

tender is an International Competitive Bidding. The learned 

Single Judge has erroneously restricted the scope of the 

work to the projects done only in India. 

(v)It is stated that on 2.6.2014, BHEL was identified as L1. 

However, on 18.7.2014 TANGEDCO submitted before the 

Court in the first round of litigation that performance 

evaluation is yet to be done and they will look into the 

representation of the appellant. Therefore, BHEL could not 

have been identified as L1 by then and the entire 

proceedings reeks of malafide. 

(vi)Sections 10(2) and 10(6) of the TTIT Act should be read 

together. If at all Section 10(3) of the Act is to be invoked 

by the Authority, it can only be after 26.9.2014, on which 

114 | P a g e 


day the Board resolved to accept the tender of the third 

respondent in compliance of Section 10(6) of the TTIT Act. 

Therefore, for negotiation under Section 10(3) of the TTIT 

Act, the appellant should have also been called for. 

(vii)The non-obstante clause in Section 10(3) of the TTIT 

Act should be read harmoniously and should not obliterate 

the effect of Section 10(2) of the TTIT Act. Section 10(2) of 

the TTIT Act states that after evaluation and comparison of 

tenders, the Tender Accepting Authority shall accept the 

lowest tender. Only after evaluation, the Tender Accepting 

Authority can come to a conclusion as to who is the lowest 

tenderer. Only after that stage, negotiation under Section 

10(3) of the TTIT Act should have been called for and not as 

stated by the learned Advocate General immediately after 

Section 10(2) of the TTIT Act. 

CONSIDERATION 

25. We have heard the rival contentions at length, 

perused the order passed by the learned Single Judge; the 

documents filed in these appeals; the records produced before 

this Court as was produced before the learned Single Judge, 

115 | P a g e 


and given our anxious consideration to the issue involved in 

these appeals. We heard the appellant and the respondents 

for several days, i.e., 3.6.2015, 9.6.2015, 10.6.2015, 

16.6.2015, 19.6.2015, 25.6.2015, 1.7.2015, 15.7.2015, 

16.7.2015, 20.7.2015, 21.7.2015, 22.7.2015, 23.7.2015, 

27.7.2015, 29.7.2015, 31.7.2015, 7.8.2015, 20.8.2015, 

21.8.2015, 24.8.2015 and 25.8.2015, in the course of our 

regular hearing, some in part and the rest specifically at their 

request. 

ALTERNATIVE REMEDY 

26.1. With regard to the plea of the learned Advocate 

General that the appellant instead of filing an appeal as 

contemplated under Section 11 of the TTIT Act has directly 

invoked the writ jurisdiction and, therefore, the writ 

proceedings are not maintainable, it is to be noted that the 

learned Single Judge in the order under challenge has clearly 

observed that: 

"38. Incidentally, one more contention was raised in 

this regard, with respect to the failure of the first 

respondent to notify the appellate authority under 

Section 11 of the Tamil Nadu Transparency in 

116 | P a g e 


Tenders Act, 1998. But, in this case, there is actually 

no scope for considering the said contention. As 

admitted by the petitioner themselves, the 

supplementary bid was submitted by them on 

05.02.2014. Thereafter, the petitioner sent several 

representations not only to the first respondent, but 

also to the Government on 16.6.2014, 17.6.2014, 

01.7.2014 and 08.7.2014. These representations 

were addressed to all important officers of the 

Government, including the Chief Secretary, the 

Secretary to Government, Environment and Forests, 

etc. The petitioner even came up with a writ petition 

in W.P.No.19247 of 2014 seeking a Mandamus to 

direct the first respondent to dispose of his 

representations. Therefore, this is a case where 

the petitioner ignited the fire of litigation much 

before the finalisation of the tenders. In such 

circumstances, I do not think that the 

notification of an Appellate Authority would 

have really made a difference. In any case, I 

do not propose to hold the non availing of an 

alternative remedy of appeal under Section 11 

against the petitioner . This is the second round 

of litigation in respect of the same contract, 

with the first one preceding the finalisation. 

Therefore, this incidental plea relating to non 

notification of the Appellate Authority cannot be 

accepted by me." 

(emphasis supplied) 

117 | P a g e 


26.2. In respect of challenge to tender, Courts have been 

entertaining the writ petition on certain parameters and 

availability of an alternative remedy is not an absolute 

embargo. The said view of this Court is fortified by the 

following decisions: 

(a) In Harbanslal Sahnia v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., (2003) 

2 SCC 107, the Supreme Court held as under: 

"In an appropriate case in spite of availability 

of the alternative remedy, the High Court may 

still exercise its writ jurisdiction in at least 

three contingencies: (i) where the writ petition 

seeks enforcement of any of the Fundamental 

Rights; (ii) where there is failure of principles 

of natural justice or, (iii) where the orders or 

proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or 

the vires of an Act and is challenged [ See 

Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade 

Marks, Mumbai and Ors ., (1998) 8 SCC 11. The 

present case attracts applicability of first two 

contingencies. Moreover, as noted, the petitioners' 

dealership, which is their bread and butter came to 

be terminated for an irrelevant and non-existent 

cause. In such circumstances, we feel that the 

appellants should have been allowed relief by the 

118 | P a g e 


High Court itself instead of driving them to the need 

of initiating arbitration proceedings." 

(emphasis supplied) 

(b) In ABL International Ltd. v. Export Credit Guarantee 

Corporation of India Ltd., (2004) 3 SCC 553, the Supreme 

Court held as under: 

"8. As could be seen from the arguments addressed in this 

appeal and as also from the divergent views of the two 

courts below one of the questions that falls for our 

consideration is whether a writ petition under Article 226 

of the Constitution of India is maintainable to enforce a 

contractual obligation of the State or its instrumentality, by 

an aggrieved party. 

*** 

23. It is clear from the above observations of this 

Court, once State or an instrumentality of State is a 

party to the contract, it has an obligation in law to 

act fairly, justly and reasonably which is the 

requirement of Article 14 of the Constitution of 

India. Therefore, if by the impugned repudiation of 

the claim of the appellants the first respondent as 

an instrumentality of the State has acted in 

contravention of the above said requirement of 

article 14 then we have no hesitation that a writ 

court can issue suitable directions to set right the 

arbitrary actions of the first respondent. 

119 | P a g e 


*** 

28. However, while entertaining an objection as to 

the maintainability of a writ petition under Article 

226 of the Constitution of India, the court should 

bear in mind the fact that the power to issue 

prerogative writs under Article 226 of the 

Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited 

by any other provisions of the Constitution. The High 

Court having regard to the facts of the case, has a 

discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ 

petition. The Court has imposed upon itself certain 

restrictions in the exercise of this power [See : 

Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai 

and Ors.] And this plenary right of the High Court to 

issue a prerogative writ will not normally be 

exercised by the Court to the exclusion of other 

available remedies unless such action of the State or 

its instrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so 

as to violate the constitutional mandate of Article 14 

or for other valid and legitimate reasons, for which 

the court thinks it necessary to exercise the said 

jurisdiction. 

*** 

53. From the above, it is clear that when an 

instrumentality of the State acts contrary to public 

interest, unfairly, unjustly and unreasonably, in its 

contractual, constitutional or statutory obligations, 

it really acts contrary to the constitutional 

guarantee found in Article 14 of the Constitution." 

120 | P a g e 


(c) In Coal India Ltd. v. Alok Fuels (P) Ltd., (2010) 10 SCC 

157, the Supreme Court observed as under: 

"15. It is settled by a series of decisions of this Court starting 

from Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.P. [(1991) 1 

SCC 537] that even in the domain of contractual mat-

ters, the High Court can entertain a writ petition on the 

ground of violation of Article 14 of the Constitution 

when the impugned act of the State or its instrumental-

ity is arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable or in breach of 

obligations under public law. In Sterling Computers Ltd. v. 

M/s M & N Publications Limited and Others [(1993) 1 SCC 

445] in para 28, however, this Court held: 

'Public authorities are essentially different from those 

of private persons. Even while taking decision in 

respect of commercial transactions a public authority 

must be guided by relevant considerations and not by 

irrelevant ones.'" 

(emphasis supplied) 

(d) In Union of India v. Tantia Construction Private Limited, 

(2011) 5 SCC 697, the Supreme Court has categorically held 

that: 

"… even on the question of maintainability of the writ 

petition on account of the Arbitration Clause included in 

the agreement between the parties, it is now well-

established that an alternative remedy is not an 

absolute bar to the invocation of the writ 

jurisdiction of the High Court or the Supreme Court 

and that without exhausting such alternative 

121 | P a g e 


remedy, a writ petition would not be maintainable. 

The various decisions cited by Mr. Chakraborty would 

clearly indicate that the constitutional powers vested 

in the High Court or the Supreme Court cannot be 

fettered by any alternative remedy available to the 

authorities. Injustice, whenever and wherever it 

takes place, has to be struck down as an anathema 

to the rule of law and the provisions of the 

Constitution. We endorse the view of the High Court 

that notwithstanding the provisions relating to the 

Arbitration Clause contained in the agreement, the High 

Court was fully within its competence to entertain and 

dispose of the Writ Petition filed on behalf of the 

Respondent Company." 

(e) In Maa Binda Express Carrier and another v. North-East 

Frontier Railway and others, (2014) 3 SCC 760, the Supreme 

Court held as under: 

"9. Suffice it to say that in the matter of award 

of contracts the Government and its agencies 

have to act reasonably and fairly at all points 

of time. To that extent the tenderer has an 

enforceable right in the Court who is 

competent to examine whether the aggrieved 

party 
has 
been 
treated 
unfairly 
or 

discriminated against to the detriment of 

public interest. (See: Meerut Development 

Authority v. Association of Management Studies and 

122 | P a g e 


Anr. etc. (2009) 6 SCC 171 and Air India Ltd. v. 

Cochin International Airport Ltd. (2000) 1 SCR 505). 

10. The scope of judicial review in contractual 

matters was further examined by this Court in Tata 

Cellular v. Union of India, (1994) 6 SCC 651, 

Raunaq International Ltd.'s case (supra) and in 

Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa and Ors. (2007) 

14 SCC 517 besides several other decisions to which 

we need not refer. In Michigan Rubber (India) Ltd. v. 

State of Karnataka and Ors., (2012) 8 SCC 216, the 

legal position on the subject was summed up after a 

comprehensive review and principles of law 

applicable to the process for judicial review identified 

in the following words: 

"19. From the above decisions, the following 
principles emerge: 
(a) the basic requirement of Article 14 is 
fairness in action by the State, and non-
arbitrariness in essence and substance is the 
heartbeat of fair play. These actions are 
amenable to the judicial review only to the 
extent that the State must act validly for a 
discernible reason and not whimsically for 
any ulterior purpose. If the State acts within 
the bounds of reasonableness, it would be 
legitimate to take into consideration the 
national priorities; 
(b) fixation of a value of the tender is 
entirely within the purview of the executive 
and courts hardly have any role to play in 
this process except for striking down such 
action of the executive as is proved to be 
arbitrary 
or 
unreasonable. 
If 
the 
Government acts in conformity with certain 
healthy standards and norms such as 
awarding of contracts by inviting tenders, in 

123 | P a g e 


those circumstances, the interference by 
Courts is very limited; 

(c) In the matter of formulating conditions 
of a tender document and awarding a 
contract, greater latitude is required to be 
conceded to the State authorities unless the 
action of tendering authority is found to be 
malicious and a misuse of its statutory 
powers, interference by Courts is not 
warranted; 

(d) Certain preconditions or qualifications for 
tenders have to be laid down to ensure that 
the contractor has the capacity and the 
resources to successfully execute the work; 
and 

(e) If the State or its instrumentalities act 
reasonably, fairly and in public interest in 
awarding contract, here again, interference 
by Court is very restrictive since no person 
can claim fundamental right to carry on 
business with the Government. 

20. Therefore, a Court before interfering in 
tender or contractual matters, in exercise of 
power of judicial review, should pose to 
itself the following questions: 
(i) Whether the process adopted or decision 
made by the authority is mala fide or 
intended to favour someone; or whether the 
process adopted or decision made is so 
arbitrary and irrational that the court can 
say: "the decision is such that no 
responsible authority acting reasonably and 
in accordance with relevant law could have 
reached"; and (ii) Whether the public 
interest is affected. If the answers to the 
above questions are in negative, then there 
should be no interference under Article 
226." 

(emphasis supplied) 

124 | P a g e 


26.3. In any event, the TANGEDCO has not filed any 

appeal challenging the said portion of the order of the learned 

Single Judge. This is the fourth litigation on this tender and 

mostly the allegation is on the first respondent on the ground 

of arbitrariness, unjust and unfair treatment, besides being 

against public interest. Therefore, the plea of alternative 

remedy has no bearing at this point of time. Accordingly, this 

Court does not propose to entertain the said plea of availability 

of alternative remedy at this stage and would proceed to 

consider the appeals as under. 

SCOPE OF CONSIDERATION 

27. We are of the considered opinion that these appeals 

will have to be tested on the touchstone of the tests laid down 

by the Supreme Court in Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa, 

(2007) 14 SCC 517, wherein it is held as under: 

"24. Therefore, a court before interfering in 

tender or contractual matters, in exercise of 

power of judicial review, should pose to itself the 

following questions: 

125 | P a g e 


(i) Whether the process adopted or 

decision made by the authority is mala fide 

or intended to favour someone; or whether 

the process adopted or decision made is so 

arbitrary and irrational that the court can 

say: 'the decision is such that no 

responsible authority acting reasonably 

and in accordance with relevant law could 

have reached'? and 

(ii) Whether the public interest is affected? 

If the answers to the above questions are 

in the negative, then there should be no 

interference under Article 226." 

(emphasis supplied) 

(I) FIRST TEST -TENDERING PROCESS: 

28. On the basis of the law enunciated in the decision 

referred supra, let us at first analyze the process adopted and 

decision made in the tender by TANGEDCO. 

(A) IS THE PROCEDURE FLAWED? 

29.1. On 6.5.2013, TANGEDCO invited tenders for 2 x 

660 MW Ennore SEZ Supercritical Thermal Power Project at 

126 | P a g e 


Ash Dyke of NCTPS, Chennai -600 057. During July, 2013, the 

bids submitted by the appellant and the third respondent were 

taken up for consideration. By letter dated 3.2.2014, the 

second respondent requested the appellant to submit its 

supplementary price schedule. In due compliance of the same, 

the appellant submitted its Supplementary Price Bid on 

5.2.2014. 

29.2. The second respondent opened the price bid 

submitted by the appellant and the third respondent in the 

presence of their respective representatives on 5.2.2014 itself. 

It is borne out by records and the files produced, as was 

produced before the learned Single Judge, that the appellant's 

quoted price of Rs.9709.3822 was evaluated at Rs.9207.258 

Crores by the Consultant after disallowing a sum of Rs.508 

Crores and thereafter certain amounts are added, which tilted 

the balance in favour of the third respondent (BHEL). The 

report of the Consultant, we wish to state was not revealed 

before the learned Single Judge, in the first round of litigation, 

while the Court passed the two interim orders, as above, and 

127 | P a g e 


the Division Bench on 19.8.2014. It is not stated so in the 

counter affidavit or in the appeal memorandum. So to say it 

was not in public domain. 

29.3. Even prior to filing of the first writ petition 

(W.P.No.19247 of 2014) on 17.7.2014, the appellant offered 

reduction of interest from 7.2% to 6.2% on 5.6.2014 itself. 

Thereafter, the appellant sent representations to the first 

respondent on 16.6.2014, 17.6.2014, 1.7.2014 and 8.7.2014 

impressing upon them the various aspects of the Bid, namely, 

lowering of interest, commitment fee, interest on management 

fee and guarantee fee, etc., and the relevance of Clause 

29(viii) of the Instructions to Bidders in the matter of bid 

consideration, particularly in the context of various materials 

on the vendor rating and the poor track record of the third 

respondent, and also inviting their attention to the wrong and 

improper calculations made contrary to financial statements 

submitted by the appellant. It is apposite to refer to Clause 

29.0 (viii) of the Instructions to Bidders, which reads as under: 

128 | P a g e 


"29.0. Rejection of Bids: 

The tender shall be rejected if it is: 

(i) to (vii) *** 

(viii) 
From 
the 
tenderer 
whose 
past 

performance/vendor rating is not satisfactory." 

29.4. As the representations sent by the appellant did not 

evoke any response, the appellant filed W.P.No.19247 of 2014 

seeking issuance of a writ of Mandamus to direct respondents 

1 and 2 to consider the appellant's representations dated 

16.6.2014, 17.6.2014, 1.7.2014 and 8.7.2014 and take 

necessary action on the same in strict compliance with law, 

particularly in accordance with Sections 10(1) and 10(2) of the 

TTIT Act read with Clause 29 of the Tender Documents issued 

by TANGEDCO. 

29.5. In the interim order dated 18.7.2014 passed in 

M.P.No.1 of 2014 in W.P.No.19247 of 2014, it is specifically 

recorded as under: 

"3. .... The learned Advocate General would further 
submit that in respect of tenders floated, Techno-
Commercial bid was opened on 27.06.2014 and the 
price bid was opened on 8.6.2014 and the 
performance evaluation is yet to be done and 

129 | P a g e 


while doing so, all the representations of the 
petitioners dated 16.6.2014, 17.6.2014, 1.7.2014 
and 8.7.2014 would definitely be considered and 
seeks time to get written instructions in this regard. 
The said submission of the learned Advocate 
General, assisted by Mr.P.Gunaraj, learned counsel 
appearing for respondents 1 and 2, on instructions, 
is placed on record." 

(emphasis supplied) 

The date of opening of price bid along with the Supplementary 

Price Bid submitted by both tenderers was 5.2.2014 and not 

8.6.2014. This is an error in recording of date. 

29.6. Consequent to the above order, the first respondent 

addressed a communication dated 20.7.2014 to the Advocate 

General, wherein it is averred as under: 

"I inform that the post bid representations of the 

bidder M/s.CSEPDI-TRISHE CONSORTIUM relating to 

the award of contract for establishment of Ennore 

SEZ Thermal Power Project cited in the reference, 

will be duly considered by the Board of Directors of 

TANGEDCO as the tender accepting authority while 

finalizing the tender and appropriate order passed 

strictly in accordance with the Tender Specifications 

and Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998 

and the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tender Rules, 

2000." 

(emphasis supplied) 

130 | P a g e 


29.7. When the said communication dated 20.7.2014 was 

produced before the learned Single Judge in the first round of 

litigation, an interim order dated 31.7.2014 was passed in 

M.P.No.1 of 2014 in W.P.No.19247 of 2014, and it is as follows: 

"25. It is well settled position of law that as per the 

series of decisions rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court of India in the matter of award of contracts, 

the Government and its agency, have to act 

reasonably and fairly at all points of time and to that 

extent the tender has an enforceable right in the 

court which is competent to examine whether the 

aggrieved party has been treated unfairly or 

discriminated against to the detriment of public 

interest. 
Therefore, it cannot be said that writ 

petition is not maintainable. 

26. This Court can take judicial notice of the fact 

that this State is reeling under power shortage and 

the commissioning of the above said projects is vital 

and very much important to the welfare of the State 

and therefore, excepts the respondents 1 and 2 to 

act fairly and reasonably by considering the 

representation of the petitioner dated 16.6.2014, 

17.6.2014, 1.7.2014 and 8.7.2014. The letter dated 

20.7.2014 addressed to the learned Advocate 

General by the Principal Secretary/Chairman-cum-

131 | P a g e 


Managing Director of TANGEDCO also states that the 

above said post bid representations submitted by the 

petitioner will be duly considered by its Board of 

Directors while finalizing the tenders and appropriate 

orders will be passed strictly in accordance with the 

tender specifications and Tamil Nadu Transparency in 

Tenders Act, 1998 and the rules framed thereunder 

and being a State Agency, it is under obligation to do 

so and till the respondents 1 and 2 considers and 

pass orders on the above said representations, after 

affording opportunity of personal hearing to the 

authorized representatives of the petitioner and 

communicate 
the 
same 
to 
the 
petitioner, 

finalization of the bid/tender cannot be done." 

(emphasis supplied) 

29.8. Aggrieved by the said interim order dated 

31.7.2014 passed in M.P.No.1 of 2014 in W.P.No.19247 of 

2014, TANGEDCO filed W.A.No.1065 of 2014 before the 

Division Bench. The Division Bench tagged the writ petition 

along with the writ appeal and disposed of the same by 

common judgment dated 19.8.2014, holding as under: 

"12. We have considered the rival submissions made 
by the learned counsel on either side and we have 
also gone through the order passed by the learned 
Single Judge as well as the provisions under the 
Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998 read 

132 | P a g e 


with Rule 27 of the Tamil Nadu Transparency in 
Tender Rules, 2000. 

13. On a perusal of the statutory provisions, we find 

that the rule nowhere contemplates affording of 

personal hearing to the person who is objecting. 

Hence, the 1 st respondent cannot demand personal 

hearing, as a matter of right. However, it is made 

clear that if any clarification is required regarding 

the documents submitted by the 1 st respondent to 

the appellants to consider its objections, the same 

shall be called for from the 1 st respondent and if 

such clarification is sought, the same shall be 

communicated to the 2 nd respondent also and after 

considering the clarification to be given by the 

1 st respondent, the 1 st appellant shall pass an 

order as directed by the learned Single Judge. 

It is also made clear that if an opportunity of 

personal hearing is afforded to the 1 st respond, if it is 

required to be afforded, after considering the 

clarification given by the 1 st respondent, the same 

shall be extended to the 2 nd respondent also. 

14. At this juncture, the learned counsel for the 1 st 

respondent submitted that the 1 st respondent is 

having some additional materials to prove the 

disqualification of the 2 nd respondent and he has 

prayed for a reasonable time to submit the said 

documents in support of its contention. 

133 | P a g e 


15. In view of the above submission made by the 

learned counsel for the 1 st respondent, the 1 st 

respondent is granted one week time from the 

date of receipt of a copy of this order to submit 

the additional particulars/documents before 

the 1 st appellant along with a copy of this order 

and the 1 st appellant shall pass an order as 

stated above. The order to be passed by the 1 st 

appellant shall be communicated to the 1 st 

respondent as well as the 2 nd respondent. The 

order of the learned Single Judge is modified 

accordingly." 

(emphasis supplied) 

29.9. Further to the above said order passed by the 

Division Bench, the appellant submitted a representation dated 

25.8.2014 enclosing relevant documents. However, the first 

respondent vide communication dated 27.9.2014 rejected the 

representations submitted by the appellant. This proceedings is 

challenged in W.P.No.26762 of 2014. 

29.10. Without prejudice to the right of the appellant to 

challenge the first respondent's communication dated 

134 | P a g e 


27.9.2014, the appellant sent a representation dated 

1.10.2014 
to 
the 
first 
respondent 
highlighting 
the 

arbitrariness, anomalies and inconsistencies in its approach 

and the malafide writ large in the matter of evaluating the 

merits of the third respondent's bid, despite materials placed 

by the appellant for rejection of the third respondent's bid. It 

also pleaded for considering the financial terms clarified before 

proceeding to finalize the bid. 

29.11. When things stood thus, at the time of hearing of 

W.P.No.26762 of 2014, namely on 8.10.2014, the learned 

Advocate General produced a copy of the fourth respondent's 

proceedings dated 27.9.2014 addressed to the third 

respondent awarding the tender in favour of the third 

respondent and the letter of the third respondent dated 

27.9.2014 accepting the award of tender. 

29.12. Thereafter, the fourth respondent, by proceedings 

dated 10.10.2014, informed the appellant that tender has been 

135 | P a g e 


finalized and orders have been placed on the evaluated L1 

bidder, namely the third respondent. 

29.13. Aggrieved by the proceedings dated 27.9.2014 of 

the fourth respondent awarding the tender in favour of the 

third respondent and the consequential proceedings dated 

10.10.2014 informing the appellant that the tender has been 

finalized in favour of BHEL, the appellant filed W.P.No.27529 of 

2014. 

29.14. In this factual matrix, let us analyze the process 

adopted in finalizing the tender. At the outset, a reading of the 

judgment of the Division Bench of this Court, dated 

19.08.2014, makes it clear that but for a clarification that 

personal hearing cannot be demanded by the appellant herein, 

no part of the order of the learned Single Judge in the first 

round of litigation has been modified, which in effect, is a 

direction to consider the post-bid representation submitted by 

the appellant. The appellant was granted one week time 

further to submit additional particulars/documents and the first 

136 | P a g e 


respondent was directed to pass orders as directed by the 

learned Single Judge, by the Division Bench. Even at this 

stage, TANGEDCO never averred or stated before the Division 

Bench or before the learned Single Judge that the tender has 

been finalized and the third respondent is L1. The date of the 

learned Single Judge's order is 31.07.2014 and the order of 

the Division Bench is dated 19.08.2014. The Division Bench did 

not modify that portion of the order of the learned Single 

Judge directing TANGEDCO not to finalize the bid/tender till 

TANGEDCO passes orders on the representation of the 

appellant and communicates the same to the appellant. 

29.15. This stand clearly reveals that the evaluation 

process was going on and nothing was finalized and, therefore, 

the claim of the appellant would be considered. This is fortified 

by the letter of the Chairman and Managing Director, 

TANGEDCO, dated 20.7.2014, wherein it is stated that "post 

bid representations of the bidder M/s.CSEPDI-TRISHE 

CONSORTIUM relating to the award of contract for 

establishment of Ennore SEZ Thermal Power Project cited in 

137 | P a g e 


the reference, will be duly considered by the Board of Directors 

of TANGEDCO as the tender accepting authority while 

finalizing the tender and appropriate order passed strictly in 

accordance with the Tender Specifications and Tamil Nadu 

Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998 and the Tamil Nadu 

Transparency in Tender Rules, 2000." This undertaking clearly 

establishes the case that there was no evaluation of L1. This 

contradiction clearly shows that to get over the impasse, the 

BLTC decision dated 2.6.2014 is quoted as a decision taken to 

identify L1, consequent to which negotiation was done with L1, 

i.e., the third respondent (BHEL). 

29.16. On the face of it, there appears to be a 

misstatement of fact before the Court. If the letter of the 

Chairman and Managing Director, TANGEDCO dated 20.7.2014, 

recorded by the Court is taken into account, then the 

evaluation of L1 said to be done on 2.6.2014 is clearly a 

misrepresentation of fact. It was agreed by the Chairman and 

Managing Director, TANGEDCO that before finalizing the tender, 

all the issues raised in the representations will be considered. 

It is on record that the decision on issues raised on financial 

138 | P a g e 


aspects, vendor rating, etc., was taken only on 27.9.2014. 

The comparative analysis of the tenderers was done in the 

month of September, 2014, but the first respondent however 

has proceeded to negotiate with the third respondent (BHEL) 

on and from 2.6.2014. This is also evident from the various 

references cited by the third respondent (BHEL) in their letter 

of acceptance dated 27.9.2014. 
Simultaneously, the first 

respondent has been proceeding with the award of the tender 

with the third respondent, despite an undertaking to the Court 

in the above terms. We find that this itself is a breach on which 

the Court can interfere with, as the tendering process is mired 

in illegality and arbitrariness, coupled with bias in favour of the 

third respondent. We have no hesitation to hold so. 

29.17. The learned Advocate General submitted that on 

2.6.2014 itself, a decision was taken by BLTC that the third 

respondent was L1 and it was decided to negotiate with them. 

It is the plea of TANGEDCO that the Consultant submitted its 

report on 30.5.2014. 
This could be done only after an 

evaluation under Section 10(1) of the Act is completed. 

However, in the earlier round of litigation during July and 

139 | P a g e 


August, 2014, it was submitted before the Court that 

performance evaluation is yet to be done. Such statement of 

the learned Advocate General is clearly recorded in the order 

dated 18.7.2014 passed in M.P.No.1 of 2014 in W.P.No.19247 

of 2014, extracted supra. If such performance evaluation is 

yet to be done as on 18.7.2014, it is hard to accept the 

submission of the learned Advocate General that on 2.6.2014 

itself a decision was taken by BLTC that the third respondent 

(BHEL) was L1 and negotiations should be held only with them. 

In any event, BLTC cannot step into the shoes of the Tender 

Accepting Authority as mandated by Section 10 of the TTIT 

Act. Neither the provisions of Section 10 nor any other 

provision of TTIT Act provide that the role of the Tender 

Accepting Authority could be delegated and such delegatee can 

perform the act. When the provisions of the Act prescribe a 

thing to be done in a particular manner, it has to be done in 

that manner and not otherwise. 

29.18. It is not the case of the TANGEDCO at any point of 

time, before this Court in the first round of litigation that they 

have already accepted BHEL as L1 based on the Consultant's 

140 | P a g e 


report. It is the finding of the learned Single Judge that L1 

was identified on 30.5.2014 (i.e.,) the date of the Consultant's 

report, that too, on perusal of the files. That is also not the 

recommendation of the Tender Scrutiny Committee or the 

decision of the Tender Accepting Authority. 
We fail to 

understand as to how the Court can set the clock back so as to 

enure a benefit to BHEL, which the Tender Accepting Authority 

did not decide at that point of time. 

29.19. At this juncture, the aspect which gains 

prominence is the submission of the learned Advocate General 

that BLTC may be treated as Tender Scrutiny Committee. As 

per Rule 24 of the TTIT Rules, the Tender Scrutiny Committee 

may be constituted to scrutinize the tender documents, 

supervise opening of tenders, to carry out the preliminary 

examination and detailed evaluation of the tenders received 

and to prepare an evaluation report for the consideration of 

the Tender Accepting Authority. The BLTC is not the Tender 

Accepting Authority. 
Section 10 of the TTIT Act, which 

prescribes the procedure for evaluation and acceptance of 

tender clearly stipulates that evaluation and acceptance should 

141 | P a g e 


be done only by the Tender Accepting Authority. Moreover, 

there is no reference to the proceedings of the BLTC dated 

2.6.2014 in any of the proceedings, either it be the first round 

of litigation or before the learned Single Judge in the present 

round of litigation, which order is impugned. 

29.20. 
Despite such direction given by the Division 

Bench of this Court on 19.8.2014, it is admitted by TANGEDCO 

that they did not go back to the Consultant on the clarifications 

provided by the appellant. Moreover, till the date of passing of 

the judgment, i.e. 19.8.2014, it is never the case of 

TANGEDCO that tender has been finalized in favour of the third 

respondent. The first respondent apparently kept the issue 

fluid and fixed the dates based on the turn of event. If this is 

not an arbitrary and malafide action in the Transparent 

Tendering process, we fail to know what else. 

29.21. The impugned proceedings dated 27.9.2014 of the 

fourth respondent addressed to BHEL, accepting their offer, is 

extracted hereunder: 

142 | P a g e 


"We are pleased to inform that the Board of 

TANGEDCO has accepted your offer as the 

successful tenderer and decided to award the 

work 'Design, engineering, inspection and testing at 

manufacturer/sub vendor's works, supply, storage, 

erection, testing and commissioning of complete coal 

fired Supercritical Thermal Power Plant including all 

Mechanical, Electrical, Civil/Structural/Architectural, 

Control & Instrumentation' for the establishment of 

2x660 MW Ennore SEZ Supercritical Thermal Power 

Project in the ash dyke of North Chennai Thermal 

Power Station, Vayalur Village, Tiruvallur District, in 

Tamil Nadu, for a total contract price of Rs.7788 

Crores (Rupees Seven Thousands Seven Hundreds 

and Eighty Eight Crores only), which is inclusive of 

CIF component price of Rs.1510 Crores, taxes & 

duties under single EPC cum debt financing basis 

availing loan from Power Finance Corporation (PFC) 

for an amount not less than 75% EPC cost plus 

100% IDC with fixed rate of interest @ 12.15%. 

The details terms and conditions will be issued 

shortly. 
Kindly acknowledge the receipt of the 

acceptance of award of tender." 

(emphasis supplied) 

In the written submissions submitted on behalf of TANGEDCO, 

it is stated that the 51 st Board Meeting convened on 26.9.2014 

decided to pass an order in compliance of Sections 10(2) and 

143 | P a g e 


10(6) of the Act, whereby the third respondent (BHEL) was 

accepted as L1. Hence, the plea of the first respondent that on 

2.6.2014, they could negotiate with the third respondent 

(BHEL) on the premise that the third respondent (BHEL) is L1 

appears to be a fallacy. It is nothing but an unfair approach in 

the tendering process. Procedural impropriety is writ large. 

This itself establishes the case that the tender process adopted 

and the decision taken by TANGEDCO are malafide or intended 

to favour the third respondent (BHEL), besides being arbitrary 

and unjust. The TANGEDCO has clearly breached the 

undertaking given to the Court and proceeded to negotiate 

with the third respondent identifying it as L1. 

29.22. The shallowness in the case of the TANGEDCO has 

been buttressed by placing reliance on the Consultant's report 

in the order of the learned Single Judge, which was on the 

basis of the files circulated in the Court. But on going through 

the files, we find that the decision to accept BHEL as L1 was 

made on 26.9.2014, in the 51 st Board Meeting of the 

TANGEDCO. Therefore, by any stretch of imagination, there 

144 | P a g e 


cannot be two evaluations and two tender acceptances one by 

the Consultant and the other by the Tender Accepting 

Authority. The scheme of Section 10 of the TTIT Act does not 

provide that evaluation and comparison of tender as done by 

the Consultant should be accepted by the Tender Accepting 

Authority. Section 10(1) of the TTIT Act postulates that it is 

the Tender Accepting Authority which shall cause objective 

evaluation of the tenders based on the schedule of rates 

mentioned in the tender document; prevailing market rate for 

procurement; and comparison of tenders in accordance with 

the procedure and criteria specified in the tender document. 

Thereafter, in terms of Section 10(2) of the TTIT Act, after 

evaluation and comparison of tenders as specified in Section 

10(1) of the TTIT Act, the Tender Accepting Authority shall 

accept the lowest tender that too on the basis of objective and 

quantifiable factors specified in the tender document. There is 

also a further emphasis that relative weights of the 

participating tenderers should be made. All this makes it clear 

that the Tender Accepting Authority has a role to cause 

objective evaluation of the tenders and it cannot merely fall 

145 | P a g e 


back on the opinion of the Consultant and they have in this 

case just did it that way. It is nothing but abdication of their 

role and a stark procedural irregularity. It hits the root of 

tendering procedure. At best, the Consultant's report could be 

a guiding factor. The decision making has to be by the Tender 

Accepting Authority and not by any other authority, much less 

the Consultant. 

29.23. Before adverting to the procedure for evaluation 

and acceptance of tenders, it is apposite to refer to Sections 

10(1), 10(2), 10(3), 10(6) and 10(7) of the TTIT Act, which 

read as under: 

"10. Evaluation and Acceptance of tender.-

(1) The Tender Accepting Authority shall cause an 
objective evaluation of the tenders taking into 
consideration the schedule of rates as mentioned in the 
tender document and the prevailing market rate for 
procurement and comparison of the tenders in accordance 
with the procedure and criteria specified in the tender 
document. 

(2) After evaluation and comparison of tenders as specified 
in sub-section (1), the Tender Accepting Authority shall 
accept the lowest tender ascertained on the basis of 
objective and quantifiable factors specified in the tender 
document and giving relative weights among them. 

146 | P a g e 


(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), 
if the Tender Accepting Authority decides that the price of 
the lowest tender is higher with reference to the prevailing 
market rate or the schedule of rates, he may negotiate for 
a reduction of price with that tenderer. 

…. 

(6) If the Tender Accepting Authority proposes to accept 
the tender as per the provisions of this section, he shall 
pass orders accepting the tender together with reasons for 
such acceptance. 

(7) The Tender Accepting Authority shall intimate the 
information regarding the name and address of the 
tenderer whose tender has been accepted along with the 
reasons for rejection of other tenders to the appropriate 
Tender Bulletin Officers." 

29.24. The procedure for evaluation and acceptance of 

tender is specified in Section 10 of the TTIT Act. We are at this 

stage concerned with Section 10(6) of the Act, which reads as 

under: 

"If the Tender Accepting Authority proposes to 

accept the tender as per the provisions of this 

section, the said authority shall pass orders 

accepting the tender together with reasons for 

such acceptance." 

147 | P a g e 


In the said proceedings dated 27.9.2014, extracted above, as 

pleaded by the appellant, we find no reasons as contemplated 

under Section 10(6) of the Act. The learned Single Judge 

supports the reasoning of the TANGEDCO that BHEL will not be 

interest in knowing the reasons for his acceptance, but that is 

not the issue here. The provisions of Section 10(6) of the TTIT 

Act state that when the Tender Accepting Authority proposes to 

accept the tender as per the provisions of the Act, it is 

incumbent on them to pass an order accepting the tender 

together with reasons for such acceptance. This should be 

considered in the light of the objects of the TTIT Act, which 

provides for transparency in tenders. When such reasoned 

orders are passed, it gives sufficient material to the other 

party to know as to what is the ground on which the tender 

has been accepted in favour of the lowest tenderer. Section 

10(7) of the TTIT Act provides that the Tender Accepting 

Authority should intimate the information regarding the name 

and address of the tenderer whose tender has been accepted 

along with reasons for rejection of other tenders to the Tender 

Bulletin Officers. Therefore, the two provisions need not be 

148 | P a g e 


confused with each other. If the question posed is whether the 

TANGEDCO has complied with the provisions of Section 10(6) 

of the TTIT Act and if the answer is "NO", then the provisions 

of the TTIT Act having not been complied with, the order can 

be tested by way of judicial review, as it is not only a clear 

breach of the said provision, but also a case of procedural 

impropriety, unfair approach and arbitrariness. 

29.25. In this context, it would be apposite to refer to an 

observation of the Supreme Court in Star Enterprises and 

others v. City and Industrial Development Corporation of 

Maharashtra Ltd., (1990) 3 SCC 280, wherein it was held as 

under: 

"In recent times, judicial review of administrative 

action has become expansive and is becoming wider 

day by day. The traditional limitations have been 

vanishing and the sphere of judicial scrutiny is being 

expanded. State activity too is becoming fast 

pervasive. As the State has descended into the 

commercial 
field 
and 
giant 
public 
sector 

undertakings have grown up, the stake of the public 

exchequer is also large justifying larger social audit, 

judicial control and review by opening of the public 

149 | P a g e 


gaze; these necessitate recording of reasons for 

executive actions including cases of rejection of 

highest offers. That very often involves long stakes 

and availability of reasons for action on the record 

assures credibility to the action; disciplines public 

conduct and improves the culture of accountability. 

Looking for reasons in support of such action 

provides an opportunity for an objective review in 

appropriate cases both by the administrative 

superior and by the judicial process. The submission 

of Mr. Dwivedi, therefore, commends itself to our 

acceptance, namely, that when highest offers of the 

type in question are rejected reasons sufficient to 

indicate the stand of the appropriate authority 

should be made available and ordinarily the same 

should be communicated to the concerned parties 

unless there be any specific justification not to do 

so." 

(emphasis supplied) 

This was a case where the Supreme Court took a view that 

reasons for rejection should be made available to the 

concerned parties. The paramount indication in this judgment 

is that the State or its instrumentality, in commercial dealings, 

should act with credibility; improve culture of accountability; 

support actions with reasons for an objective review, and 

150 | P a g e 


fairness. That appears to be the substance of Section 10(6) of 

the TTIT Act. 

29.26. Absence of reasons clearly establishes a case of 

procedural impropriety, which is susceptible to judicial review, 

in the words of Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions 

v. Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374 at 411, (the 

'GCHQ case'): 

"I have described the third head as "procedural 
impropriety" rather than failure to observe basic 
rules of natural justice or failure to act with 
procedural fairness towards the person who will 
be affected by the decision. This is because 
susceptibility to judicial review under this head 
covers also failure by an administrative tribunal 
to observe procedural rules that are expressly 
laid down in the legislative instrument by which 
its jurisdiction is conferred, even where such 
failure does not involve any denial of natural 
justice." 

It is quoted in the words of Professor Helen Fenwick-

"The development of appropriate administrative 
procedures is fundamental to any proper system 
of administrative law in the interests of 
orderliness, openness, timeousness and justice." 

29.27. As to the necessity for giving reasons under 

Section 10(6) of the TTIT Act, it will be worthy to refer to the 

151 | P a g e 


decision in Jeyeanthan case [2000] 1 WLR 354, at 359B-359D, 

in the words of Lord Woolf,-

"Because of what can be the very undesirable 
consequences of a procedural requirement 
which is made so fundamental that any 
departure 
from 
the 
requirement 
makes 
everything that happens thereafter irreversibly 
a nullity it is to be hoped that provisions 
intended to have this effect will be few and far 
between. In the majority of cases, whether the 
requirement is categorised as directory or 
mandatory, the tribunal before whom the defect 
is properly raised has the task of determining 
what are to be the consequences of failing to 
comply with the requirement in the context of 
all the facts and circumstances of the case in 
which the issue arises. In such a situation the 
tribunal's task will be to seek to do what is just 
in all the circumstances." 

29.28. Reasoning for decision could be tested on the 

ground that breach was deliberate, which, we wish to hold in 

the present case, reasons have not been recorded deliberately 

and thereby, prejudice is apparent on the face of record. The 

manner in which evaluation was done and coupled with the 

lack of reasons in the proceedings in terms of TTIT Act, will 

invalidate the decision of the first respondent in determining 

the third respondent as L1. We feel, judicial review should be 

152 | P a g e 


rightly exercised in this case to test the decision making 

process and we are inclined to do so. 

29.29. Insofar as rejection of bid of the appellant is 

concerned, drawing strength from the decision of the Supreme 

Court in Star Enterprises cases, referred supra, we find that 

the TANGEDCO is trying to take shelter by the detailed reply 

given on 27.9.2014 stating that reasons for rejection are 

contained therein. We are not able to accept such a contention. 

The reply of the TANGEDCO is to the representations of the 

appellant, which partly contain issues relating to the appellant 

and partly relating to the third respondent. There is nothing to 

show that it has a detailed evaluation and analysis of the offer 

made by the appellant and the reasons as to why their offer 

has not been accepted. The recording of reasons for rejection 

of the other tenders, namely, unsuccessful tenderers, is 

contained in Section 10(7) of the Act. Though it is stated that 

the such reasons should be sent to the Tender Bulletin Officer 

and the same has been published, we find that the said 

publication also calls for further introspection, of which we will 

153 | P a g e 


deal with later. At present, we find that the reasons for 

rejection of appellant's representations cannot be termed as 

reasons for rejection of the bid of the appellant. Bid is 

separate from the substance of the representations. The two 

need not be confused, one for the other. The requirement of 

recording of reasons is in-built in the provision of Section 10 of 

the TTIT Act. The reasons in support of rejection of 

representations are based on the direction given by the Court. 

The first respondent's plea is that reasons in the order 

rejecting the representation are good enough. We do not 

accept that proposition. The requirement of the Act is 

compliance of Section 10, i.e. to record reasons which the first 

respondent failed to do. 

29.30. In our considered opinion, the argument of the 

learned Advocate General placing reliance on M.Vasudevan 

case that reasons as contemplated under Section 4(1)(d) of 

the RTI Act need not be given in contractual matters cannot be 

sustained. Moreover, in M.Vasudevan case, referred supra, the 

154 | P a g e 


decision of the Supreme Court in Star Enterprises, was not 

considered. 

29.31. That apart, in Hasbi Traders case, referred supra, 

which relates to the erstwhile TNEB, the Division Bench of this 

Court held that TNEB is a public authority and even in 

contractual matters it cannot have an unfettered discretion. 

The argument that tender documents provide for rejecting the 

tender without assigning reasons was negatived in the said 

decision. This decision has been accepted by the TNEB. 

29.32. In such view of the matter, we are of the 

considered opinion that reasons as contemplated in Section 10 

of the TTIT Act are required to be spelt out and should have 

been communicated to the appellant. Non furnishing of the 

same runs counter to the decisions of the Supreme Court and 

this Court and is also contrary to the provisions of the TTIT 

Act. 
We, therefore, have no hesitation to hold that the 

decision making process is flawed and breach of statutory 

provisions. 

155 | P a g e 


(B) TENDER BULLETIN: 

30.1. It is the contention of the learned Advocate General 

that as per Rule 30(3) of the TTIT Rules there is no 

requirement that the tender evaluation report should be sent 

to the Tender Bulletin Officer and all that is contemplated to be 

sent to the Tender Bulletin Officer is a statement of evaluation 

of tenders with a comparative statement of tenders received 

and decision therein for publication in the Tender Bulletin. 

30.2. At the outset, it is to be noted that such publication 

in the Tender Bulletin was never produced before the learned 

Single Judge. However, the same was produced for the first 

time before us stating that the publication has been effected in 

the Tender Bulletin on 9.10.2014 in due compliance of Section 

10(7) of the TTIT Act and Rule 30(3) of the TTIT Rules. For 

better clarity, we extract the relevant portion of the English 

translated version of the publication in the Tender Bulletin 

hereunder:

STPP/ D.No.60/ dt.27.09.2014." 

30.3. For better understanding regarding what should be 

published in the Tender Bulletin, it would be apposite to refer 

to the relevant provisions. Section 6(1) of the TTIT Act reads 

as under: 

"On receipt of intimation relating to details of 
notice of invitation of Tender, from the Tender 
Inviting Authority, information relating to 
acceptance of tender together with a 
comparative analysis and reasons for 
acceptance of tenders from the Tender 
Accepting Authority, the State or as the case 
may be, the District Tender Bulletin Officer shall, 
publish the same in the State or District 
Tender Bulletin, as the case may be within such 
time as may be prescribed." 

Section 10(7) of the Act reads thus: 

"The Tender Accepting Authority shall intimate 

the information regarding the name and address 

of the tenderer whose tender has been accepted 

158 | P a g e 


along with the reasons for rejection of other 

tenders to the appropriate Tender Bulletin 

Officers." 

Rule 30(3) of the TTIT Rules reads as under: 

"As soon as the tenderer qualified to perform the 

contract is identified, in accordance with section 

10(6) of the Act, the Tender Accepting Authority 

shall pass orders accepting the tender and 

communicate the order of acceptance to the 

successful tenderer. The Tender Accepting 

Authority will also send to the Tender 

Bulletin Officer a statement of evaluation of 

the tenders with a comparative statement 

of tenders received and decision thereon 

for publication in the Tender Bulletin." 

30.4. The above said provisions should be read conjointly 

in order to further the object of the Act. The main object 

behind such publication is to communicate to the public at 

large the information received from the Tender Accepting 

Authority, which in turn is the object of the TTIT Act, namely to 

ensure greater transparency and greater accountability. 

159 | P a g e 


30.5. In the Tender Bulletin, extracted above, the reasons 

for acceptance of tender are absent. There is no statement of 

evaluation of tenders and there is no comparative statement of 

tenders received and decision thereon. This is certainly a clear 

violation of the requirements of the TTIT Act and the Rules. All 

that we can observe is that it is vague as vagueness can be. It 

also shows the arbitrariness in approach, besides being casual 

and perfunctory. It is stated that the EPC-cum-Debt Financing 

Project is an International Competitive Bid and a very big 

project. We find, the approach is very casual and therefore 

amenable to judicial review. 

30.6. Even though the learned Advocate General taking 

support from the judgment of the learned Single Judge, more 

particularly, paragraph 37, pleaded that even if the procedure 

contemplated under Section 10(7) of the TTIT Act read with 

Rule 30(3) of the TTIT Rules is not complied with, it will not 

vitiate the tender process, as post finalization of tender only 

the said provisions come into play, this Court is not inclined to 

160 | P a g e 


accept such a plea, as it is well settled proposition of law that 

where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way, 

the thing must be done in that way or not at all and that other 

methods of performance are necessarily forbidden (See Taylor 

v. Taylor, (1876) 1 Ch.D 426). When even after compliance of 

Section 10(7) and Rule 30(3), some more formalities need to 

be complied with by the parties and the contract has not been 

entered into between the parties, it cannot be claimed that 

such non compliance of post-decisional tasks cannot be 

assailed. 

30.7. In such view of the matter, we hold that publication 

effected in Tender Bulletin is not in terms of Section 6(1) read 

with Section 10 of the TTIT Act and Rule 30(3) of the TTIT 

Rules. 

30.8. With regard to the plea of the Advocate General by 

referring to Rule 7 of the TTIT Rules that the information 

contained in the Tender Bulletin regarding accepting a tender 

161 | P a g e 


will not create a legal right or liability, it would be apt to refer 

to Rule 7 of the TTIT Rules, which reads as under: 

"7. Tender bulletin to contain information only.-(1) The 

tender bulletin shall contain only information of the notice 

inviting tenders and the orders accepting a tender and 

does not in itself create a legal right or liability. 

(2) A notice inviting tender will not be invalidated merely 

on the grounds that the notice although published in 

newspapers has not been published in one or the other of 

the District Tender Bulletins or State Tender Bulletins or 

when published in the State Tender Bulletin could not be 

published in a District Tender Bulletin or vice versa." 

30.8. In our considered opinion, there is no need for this Court 

to go into the said provision. On a plain reading of the said 

provision, it is evident that it is relatable to the presently successful 

bidder, namely, BHEL. That rule provides that the successful bidder 

does not have any right. We are not on that issue at present. 

(C) (i) WHETHER INTEREST OFFERED BY APPELLANT 
IS VAGUE; AND 

(ii) WHETHER THE REDUCTION OF INTEREST 
FROM 7.2% TO 6.2% SHOULD BE ACCEPTED. 

162 | P a g e 


31.1. We will first deal with the issue as to the vagueness 

of the rate of interest offered by the appellant. 

31.2. With regard to interest rate, it is stated in the Term 

Sheet as under: 

"The Borrower will pay interest on the full Loan 

amount at a floating rate of 6 month LIBOR (The 

relevant Inter-bank Offered rate Bid Rate displayed 

on Reuters at or about 10.00am New York time on 

the commencement date for each interest period) 

plus 3.5-4.5% margin per annum, or at a fixed rate 

of 7.2~7.5% per annum. Both rates are estimated 

based on current market conditions. 
The final 

pricing is subject to the Lender's final discretion, and 

may be adjusted in future." 

31.3. While it is the plea of the appellant that fixed rate 

of 7.2~7.5% per annum or LIBOR floating rate has been 

quoted by them, it is the case of the learned Advocate General 

that Clause 12.1 of the Instructions to Bidders stated that 

interest is to be quoted at fixed rate and it is not subject to 

change, and since the interest quoted is variable, it is not 

possible to evaluate the bid. 

163 | P a g e 


31.4. It is seen from the records, that subsequently, 

based on a query from the first respondent, the appellant had 

confirmed that it would be fixed rate of interest at 7.2%. The 

same was also confirmed in the Repayment Schedule and the 

same rate of interest was taken into consideration by the 

Consultant in his report dated 30.5.2014. He did not find fault 

with the rate of interest. It is to be noted that the Term Sheet 

was submitted during July, 2013 and tender was evaluated in 

the year 2014. 
The contention of vagueness in rate of 

interest does not appeal to us. When the Consultant's report 

dated 30.5.2014 is accepted by TANGEDCO for the purpose of 

evaluation, it has to be accepted for all purposes, though we 

have reservation on the Consultant's report dated 30.5.2014. 

There is, therefore, no vagueness in the rate of interest quoted 

at 7.2%. 

31.5. The second issue relates to the reduction of rate of 

interest. It is not in dispute that various meetings were held 

between the appellant and the TANGEDCO. 
The learned 

Advocate General states that the Consultant was appointed 

164 | P a g e 


based on the 21 st Board Meeting on 28.1.2012 and the 

Consultant participated in all pre-bid and post-bid meetings 

and minutes were signed by all parties, including BHEL and the 

appellant. He stated that the appellant was aware of the 

Consultant's appointment and his role. This only fortifies the 

fact that there have been series of consultation between both 

the bidders. The finding of the learned Single Judge that the 

appellant acted on inside information is demolished by the 

stand of the learned Advocate General as above. 
The 

insinuation has no basis. 

31.6. Coming to the issue of reduction of rate of interest, 

taking into consideration the prevailing market rate, the 

appellant offered to reduce the rate of interest from 7.2% to 

6.2% on 5.6.2014, even prior to any form of litigation. When 

such an offer was given by the appellant the tender was not 

accepted in terms of Section 10(6) of the Act. To recapitulate, 

what has happened earlier is that the writ petition in 

W.P.No.19247 of 2014 was filed on 17.7.2014, subsequent to 

the offer made on 5.6.2014. The first interim order was 

165 | P a g e 


passed on 18.7.2014. The second interim order was passed on 

31.7.2014. The Division Bench passed an order on 19.8.2014. 

At that point of time, there was never a statement by the 

TANGEDCO that L1 was identified and discussion was going on. 

We have also clearly stated the statement of the Chairman-

cum-Managing Director of TANGEDCO that the representations 

of the appellant will be duly considered by the Board of 

Directors while finalizing the tender and appropriate orders will 

be passed strictly in accordance with the tender specifications 

and by following the provisions of TTIT Act and TTIT Rules. 

31.7. Therefore, the issue relating to reduction of rate of 

interest should have been considered. This reasoning of ours 

is also based on the fact that we have clearly held that the 

third respondent could not be ascertained as L1 on 2.6.2014 as 

per the statement of TANGEDCO or on 30.5.2014 as per the 

finding of the learned Single Judge. 
Once there is no 

identification of L1, TANGEDCO is bound to consider the 

reduction in rate of interest of both the appellant in their offer 

dated 5.6.2014 and that of the third respondent dated 

166 | P a g e 


27.6.2014, reducing the rate of interest from 12.25% to 

12.15%. 

31.8. Even otherwise, by virtue of the power under 

Clause 25.3 of the Instructions to bidders, which states that 

"The Purchaser reserves the right to relax or waive any of the 

conditions of this Specification in the best interests of the 

TANGEDCO", the TANGEDCO could have considered such 

reduced rate of interest offered by the appellant and the third 

respondent. 

31.9. Moreover, when the present tender is for 

Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Debt Financing 

and Section 10(1) of the TTIT Act specifies that "The Tender 

Accepting Authority shall cause an objective evaluation of the 

tenders taking into consideration the schedule of rates as 

mentioned in the tender document and the prevailing market 

rate for procurement and comparison of the tenders in 

accordance with the procedure and criteria specified in the 

tender document", certainly in a debt financing contract, where 

loan is to be procured for the first respondent, the prevailing 

167 | P a g e 


market rate of interest, which was offered at 6.2% as against 

7.2% by the appellant ought to have been considered by the 

TANGEDCO, while considering the offer of the third respondent 

for reduction of interest rate from 12.25% to 12.15%. The fact 

that this reduction would result in reduction of cost at about 

Rs.1300 Crores, is a very vital and relevant factor. What 

prevents the first respondent to accept such an offer is 

unfathomable, but certainly unpalatable. 

31.10. Even in the letter of acceptance of the third 

respondent dated 27.9.2014, it is stated that negotiations 

were held on 27.6.2014 qua reduction of interest. On that 

day, the offer of the appellant to reduce interest rate from 

7.2% to 6.2% was very much available, having been 

submitted on 5.6.2014. To avoid such an offer, the clock was 

set back and the date was reset to 2.6.2014 by the first 

respondent and 30.5.2014 by the learned Single Judge. These 

dates identifying BHEL as L1 are contrary to the provisions of 

TTIT Act. 

168 | P a g e 


31.11. In any event, invoking Clause 25.3, the 

TANGEDCO ought to have considered the reduced rate of the 

appellant in the best interests of TANGEDCO, as it would have 

resulted in a benefit of about Rs.1300 Crores. This valuable 

financial benefit cannot be frittered away by the first 

respondent on hyper-technical plea. 

31.12. It is an admitted fact that the present tender is an 

International Competitive Bidding. The degree of care which is 

required to be taken and transparency in such bidding is 

greater and the same has been emphasized by the Supreme 

Court in W.B. State Electricity Board v. Patel Engineering Co., 

(2001) 2 SCC 451, wherein it was observed as under: 

"24. The controversy in this case has arisen at the 

threshold, it cannot be disputed that this is an 

international competitive bidding which postulates 

keen competition and high efficiency. The bidders 

have or should have assistance of technical experts. 

The degree of care required in such a bidding is 

greater than in ordinary local bids for small works. It 

is essential to maintain the sanctity and integrity of 

process of tender/bid and also award of a contract. 

The appellant, Respondents 1 to 4 and Respondents 

169 | P a g e 


10 and 11 are all bound by the ITB which should be 

complied with scrupulously. In a work of this nature 

and 
magnitude 
where 
bidders 
who 
fulfill 

prequalification alone are invited to bid, adherence 

to the instructions cannot be given a go-by branding 

it as a pedantic approach, otherwise it will 

encourage and provide scope for discrimination, 

arbitrariness and favouritism which are totally 

opposed to the rule of law and our constitutional 

values. 
The 
very 
purpose 
of 
issuing 

rules/instructions is to ensure their enforcement lest 

the rule of law should be a casualty. Relaxation or 

waiver of a rule or condition, unless so 

provided under the ITB, by the State or its 

agencies (the appellant) in favour of one 

bidder would create justifiable doubts in the 

minds of other bidders, would impair the rule 

of transparency and fairness and provide room 

for manipulation to suit the whims of the State 

agencies in picking and choosing a bidder for 

awarding contracts as in the case of 

distributing bounty or charity. In our view such 

approach should always be avoided. Where power to 

relax or waive a rule or a condition exists under the 

rules, it has to be done strictly in compliance with 

the rules. We have, therefore, no hesitation in 

concluding that adherence to the ITB or rules is the 

best principle to be followed, which is also in the 

best public interest." 

170 | P a g e 


(emphasis supplied) 

31.13. In the case on hand, de hors the factual misgiving 

relatable to the first respondent on the date when the 

appellant offered to reduce the rate of interest i.e., on 

5.6.2014, the third respondent was not called for negotiation. 

The third respondent was called for negotiation on 27.6.2014. 

Clause 25.3 
of Instructions to Bidders enables the 

respondents to relax or waive any of the conditions of the 

specification in the best interests of the TANGEDCO. When 

Rs.1300 Crores is the amount involved on account of the 

difference in the interest rate offered by the appellant and third 

respondent, certainly, in the best interest of the TANGEDCO, 

relaxation or waiver of the condition for consideration of the 

bid of the appellant is manifest. However, such indulgence was 

granted only to the third respondent, even though even as per 

the submission of the TANGEDCO, as on 27.6.2014, finalization 

of tender has not taken place. The same would certainly 

create justifiable doubts in the minds of other bidders and 

would impair the rule of transparency and fairness and provide 

room for manipulation to suit the whims of the State agencies 

171 | P a g e 


in picking and choosing a bidder for awarding contracts. We 

also keep in mind that the decision in W.B. State Electricity 

Board case, referred supra, will have a bearing as to how L1 

should be determined, because the larger public interest in a 

project of this magnitude warrants not only timely 

implementation of the project, but also a cost effective 

measure. Substantial saving in the order of Rs.1300 Crores 

only on account of reduction in interest is by no means a small 

amount which could be ignored by the State instrumentality, 

especially when this amount will be a boon to the State for 

development of other infrastructure or for any other welfare 

measure. When the third respondent is clearly not L1 till 

27.9.2014, there is no impediment in considering the reduction 

of interest, which is part of the representation/record/ 

document/letter submitted for consideration and which had the 

stamp of approval of the Court. 

31.14. Moreover, the observation of the learned Single 

Judge that the appellant is a private limited company, whereas 

the third respondent is a Government of India Enterprise and 

172 | P a g e 


therefore the third respondent's case should be viewed with a 

lesser amount of suspicion than a decision in favour of the 

private players is, in our considered opinion, uncalled for, as 

the present tender is International Competitive Bidding, 

wherein tenders have been invited globally. Even though BHEL 

is a Government of India Enterprise, it should be placed on the 

same pedestal as any private player or else there is no 

necessity to invite tenders globally and conduct such a lengthy 

tender process. 

31.15. We are of the firm view that the TANGEDCO, in its 

best interest, ought to have considered the offer made by the 

appellant for reduction of interest keeping in mind the vast 

difference of Rs.1300 Crores. The project cost will certainly 

come down. The cost factor will reduce to a great extent and 

consequently, the cost per unit of power produced for the 

benefit of the public at large will also be reduced. The first 

respondent will have to consider the most competitive bid and 

not play on technicalities. 

173 | P a g e 


(D) COMMITMENT FEE 

32.1. According to the learned Advocate General, the 

Commitment Fee is part of Financing Charges specified in 

Clause 14.0 (d)(6) and the appellant cannot contend that the 

same should be excluded for the purpose of bid evaluation. 

32.2. A reading of Clause 14.0 (d)(6) of the Instructions 

to Bidders, which is as under: 

"Financing Charges: All financing charges of any 
nomenclature relating to financing of the project 
including but not limited to Finders Fees, 
Commitment 
Fees, 
Arrangement 
Fees, 
Management Fees, Up Front Fees, Syndication 
Fees, Service Charges, Guarantee Charges, 
Other Fees and Taxes, if any should be clearly 
outlined in the Financing Term Sheet. 
No 
variation in Financing Charges is permitted 
during the tenor of loan." 

makes it clear that the details of the Financing Charges should 

be clearly outlined in the Financing Term Sheet, and it is not 

stated that the same should be included in the price 

evaluation. As per the term sheet, as against the Column 

"Commitment Fee" it is stated as under: 

174 | P a g e 


"The accrued commitment fee (1% per annum) 
is payable on the last day of each successive 
interest period which ends during the availability 
period, on the last day of the Availability Period 
and, if cancelled in full, on the cancelled amount 
of the relevant Lender's Commitment at the time 
the cancellation is effective." 

It clearly states that Commitment Fee is only on the cancelled 

portion of the loan. That apart, even as per the Drawdown 

Schedule, the fee is to be paid only if the loan amount is not 

drawn by the 18 th , 30 th and 42 nd month. 
Moreover, the 

appellant in the letters dated 13.6.2014, 16.6.2014 and 

17.6.2014, clarified that Commitment Fee is only on the 

unused credit line and that there shall be no Commitment Fee 

if the loan amount is fully utilized as per the Drawdown 

Schedule. All these representations sent by the appellant were 

not considered by TANGEDCO, despite there being a specific 

direction by the Division Bench of this Court to consider the 

same. It is a clear case of arbitrariness in approach and 

intended to oust the appellant. This act of the TANGEDCO is 

nothing but a case of malafide in evaluation process to suit one 

and reject the other. 

175 | P a g e 


32.3. The proceedings of the first respondent is also hit 

by the Wednesbury's principles. The decision taken by the 

TANGEDCO is not only unreasonable but also irrational. They 

have taken into account matters which they ought not to have 

taken or conversely refused to take into account matters which 

they ought to have. In this connection, the observation of 

Mukharji,J. State of U.P. v. Renusagar Power Co. reported 

in (1988) 4 SCC 59, is apposite: 

"The exercise of power whether legislative 
or administrative will be set aside if there is 
manifest error in the exercise of such power or 
the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary. 
Similarly, if the power has been exercised on 
non-consideration or non-application of mind to 
relevant factors the exercise of power will be 
regarded as manifestly erroneous. If a power 
(whether 
legislative 
or 
administrative) 
is 
exercised on the basis of the facts which do not 
exist and which are patently erroneous, such 
exercise of power will stand vitiated." 

The failure on the part of the TANGEDCO to take into 

consideration relevant materials and clarifications in the form 

of representations in support of the plea of no Commitment 

Fee, if loan is taken and no Interest during Construction, is an 

attempt to misread the documents, which an ordinary man in 

normal commercial parlance would clearly understand. This 

176 | P a g e 


would establish the case that relevant materials have been 

deliberately misread to load the cost on the appellant's bid. 

This action of the TANGEDCO, if tested on Wednesbury's 

principles, will fail. 

32.4. While exercising the power of judicial review, in 

Associated 
Provincial 
Picture 
Houses 
Ltd. 
v. 

Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223, [1947] 2 All 

ER 680, Lord Green MR, drew attention to the fact that the 

word 'unreasonable' had often been used in a sense which 

comprehended different grounds of review. He summarised the 

principles as follows: 

"The court is entitled to investigate the 

action of the local authority with a view to seeing 

whether or not they have taken into account 

matters which they ought not to have taken into 

account, or, conversely, have refused to take into 

account or neglected to take into account 

matters which they ought to take into account. 

Once that question is answered in favour of the 

local authority, it may still be possible to say 

that, although the local authority had kept within 

the four corners of the matters which they ought 

177 | P a g e 


to consider, they have nevertheless come to a 

conclusion so unreasonable that no reasonable 

authority could ever have come to it. In such a 

case, again, I think the court can interfere. The 

power of the court to interfere in each case is 

not as an appellate authority to override a 

decision of the local authority, but as a judicial 

authority which is concerned, and concerned 

only, to see whether the local authority has 

contravened the law by acting in excess of the 

power which Parliament has confided in them." 

This principle was further amplified by Lord Diplock with a new 

name 'irrationality' in the case of Council of Civil Service 

Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374 at 

410-

"By "irrationality" I mean what can now be 
succinctly 
referred 
to 
as 
"Wednesbury 
unreasonableness" 
(Associated 
Provincial 
Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation 
[1948] 1 KB 223). It applies to a decision which 
is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of 
accepted moral standards that no sensible 
person who had applied his mind to the 
question to be decided could have arrived at it." 

Tested on these principles of law, the decision making process 

followed by TANGEDCO has to fail. 

178 | P a g e 


(E) INTEREST ON MANAGEMENT FEE & GUARANTEE FEE 

33.1. It is the case of the appellant that the Term Sheet 

only mentions that a Management Fee is to be paid, but does 

not mention any interest on Management Fee or Guarantee Fee 

for the 36 month construction period. 

33.2. If the TANGEDCO had any doubt on this issue, a 

clarification could have been taken from the appellant. 

Appellant has also sent clarifications on this issue on 

13.6.2014, 16.6.2014 and 17.6.2014. 
That apart, in the 

representation sent by the appellant pursuant to the direction 

of the Division Bench of this Court in the earlier round of 

litigation, the appellant had clarified this issue. The same is 

also evident from the Supplementary Price Bid. This makes it 

clear that there was no doubt or vagueness on this issue. The 

learned Advocate General's argument that the department 

would only read in that manner is untenable. We find that the 

department has gone merely by the Consultant's report, who 

had no opportunity to consider the representations. This is a 

179 | P a g e 


clear breach of the order of the Division Bench and the 

undertaking given therein. 

33.3. Even as per the Consultant's Report the difference 

between the bid of the appellant and the third respondent is 

around Rs.71 Crores. 
That being the case, if either the 

Commitment Fee of Rs.156.184 Crores or the interest on 

Management Fee and Guarantee Fee for the 36 month 

construction period is not loaded on the appellant, it will have 

a bearing on deciding which one of the two is the lowest bid. 

Assuming the Consultant's report is of any value, such report 

without considering the relevant material is of no use. The 

approach to add these figures without taking note of the 

representations and additional particulars/documents is, 

therefore, arbitrary and tainted in bias. This is in violation of 

the Division Bench judgment as well as the orders of the 

learned Single Judge in the first round of litigation. 

33.4. In the course of arguments made on behalf of 

TANGEDCO, an attempt was made to say that the entire case 

180 | P a g e 


of the appellant is technical in nature dealing with financial 

jugglery and the interpretation which they want to make will 

only cause confusion and TANGEDCO should not be asked to 

go into these financial aspects to come to a conclusion and, 

therefore, they relied on the report of the Consultant. The 

learned Single Judge did not want to go into the financial 

aspect of the matter stating that it is not within the domain of 

judicial review. It is true that the scope of judicial review 

should not be concerned with a particular method of 

interpretation that is possible insofar as financial implication is 

concerned. But the fact remains that if the authority has 

simply overlooked a vital factor, which stares on the face of the 

record, it would be arbitrary approach to the matter. 

33.5. There are two ways to look at a problem -One, to 

look at the financial issue as a complicated complex factor and 

refrain and the other is to simplify the issue and consider. 

According the learned Single Judge, it is a very complicated 

way of looking at the matter and, therefore, he would not 

embark upon that. But, we would like to approach this issue 

181 | P a g e 


by understanding the issue in a simple manner. The financial 

implication in respect of two tenderers has been specified by 

the Consultant. The issue is what factors mean and how it 

impacts the bid. We find that the Repayment Schedule 

submitted by the appellant with regard to interest on 

management fee and guarantee fee during IDC period is an 

accepted document by the Consultant. If nothing more is to 

be paid beyond that and that is clarified in the course of 

representation in clear terms, we fail to understand as to how 

this amount could be included in the cost when there is no 

implication. The Consultant, as we have held, did not have the 

benefit of considering the representation and other documents 

on the financial implications in this issue. His opinion is 

therefore not based on relevant document/representation. 

This we have held is not in conformity with the order of the 

learned Single Judge in the first round of litigation, which was 

confirmed by the Division Bench. Withholding such a factor and 

to obtain an evaluation from the Consultant loading the bid of 

the appellant is clearly a case of bias. It is an unreasonable 

182 | P a g e 


approach and an unfair gesture which crumbles the spirit of 

transparent tender. 

33.6. We, therefore, have no hesitation to hold that the 

first respondent had erroneously added interest on 

Management Fee and Guarantee Fee when there is none and 

there is no ambiguity or vagueness. Once the appellant has 

indicated in the representation, in clear terms, as to how it 

should be treated, in the light of the order of the Division 

Bench, which TANGEDCO accepted to consider the bid of the 

appellant, the first respondent ought not to have loaded this 

amount on the basis of the Consultant's Report. In all fairness, 

the Tender Accepting Authority of the first respondent should 

have excluded this amount, if both the bidders are to be 

treated on the touchstone of fairness and on the doctrine of 

level-playing field. This becomes necessary because the entire 

tender is tested on the larger public interest, that is to say, the 

implementation of the project in a time bound manner where 

cost is another important factor to be considered in the 

decision making. In a Welfare State, public authority cannot 

183 | P a g e 


decide arbitrarily to throw away such an offer which they 

agreed to consider in the course of judicial proceedings, which 

we have referred to above. These factors, namely, adding 

interest on Management Fee and Guarantee Fee, have to be 

eschewed 
for the purpose of considering the bid of the 

appellant, otherwise, it will suffer from the vice of 

unreasonableness and irrationality. 

(F) CONSULTANT'S REPORT 

34. We have perused the Consultant's Report dated 

30.5.2014, furnished by the TANGEDCO, which the learned 

Single Judge has relied upon with emphasis. In fact, it is a 

Price Evaluation Report for the said project. Consultant has 

loaded on the appellant an upfront fee (including interest) of 

Rs.801.180 Crores. If Commitment Fee and the Interest on 

Management Fee and Guarantee Fee are excluded and 

accordingly, the Moratorium Interest is reduced to Rs.17.875 

Crores, the Consultant could have only loaded Rs.489.136 

Crores. If the Consultant had any doubt as to the amount to 

be added on any of the heads, he should have sought for 

184 | P a g e 


clarification from the appellant, as was done for BHEL. 

However, without resorting to such exercise, the Consultant 

evaluated the bid of the appellant at Rs.9207.264 Crores, and 

added the above amount. The Consultant's report cannot 

supplement the role of the Tender Accepting Authority in terms 

of Section 10 of the TTIT Act. In any event, the Consultant 

should have been consulted post 30.5.2014 as per the 

directions of the Court. That would have clarified the issue. 

This has given the third respondent an unfair advantage on 

norms. The decision of the Supreme Court in Reliance Energy 

Limited, cited supra, answers the issue precisely. 

Reliance Energy Limited Case: 

"The principle of "judicial review" cannot be denied 

even in contractual matters or matters in which the 
Government exercises its contractual powers, but 
judicial review is intended to prevent arbitrariness 
and it must be exercised in larger public interest. 
Expression of different views and opinions in 
exercise of contractual powers may be there, 
however, such difference of opinion must be based 
on specified norms. Those norms may be legal 
norms or accounting norms." 

(emphasis supplied) 

The above said decision may be more appropriate in the 

present case insofar as Commitment Fee, Interest During 

185 | P a g e 


Construction is concerned because in the repayment schedule, 

what is payable has been clearly explained. This has been 

submitted to comply with the norms for repayment taking into 

consideration the entire project cost and the loan component. 

Any attempt to misread the same under the guise of 

vagueness is nothing but a self-serving attempt by the first 

respondent to load the cost against the appellant and to tilt the 

balance in favour of the third respondent. 

(G) RIVAL CONTENTIONS ON PAST PERFORMANCE & 
VENDOR RATING: 

35.1. The ability of the two tenderers to take up the 

project of this magnitude was not found fault with by the 

Consultant. The volume of work undertaken by the BHEL 

cannot be disputed. We cannot comment about the efficiency 

of BHEL insofar as power generation in the subcritical arena is 

concerned. The issue that we are now grappling with is 

whether in this supercritical EPC-cum-debt financing project 

the TANGEDCO has floated, as between the two tenderers, 

whether there is incapacity in either of them and whether the 

efficiency level of the two bidders can be tested. 

186 | P a g e 


35.2. We find that the Consultant, on whose report the 

learned Single Judge has relied upon in extenso, has not found 

the appellant or the BHEL incompetent. The Consultant has not 

found either of the parties to be technically unsound. There 

rests the matter. The extensive argument by either side is of 

no avail on the ability to take up such a project. 

35.3. The argument on the side of the respondents that 

the appellant is a nascent company and the following points 

raised by the respondents on the misgivings of the appellant in 

executing the projects, viz., (i) that most of the projects 

undertaken by them are sub-critical projects; (ii) that the work 

involved in BTG (Boiler Turbine Generator) is only 40% of the 

total work involved in supercritical project; (iii) that the 

scheduled completion period in respect of one of the projects 

undertaken by the members of the appellant consortium was 

delayed for years, and (iv) that in yet another project the 

name of the appellant consortium is not found, are not the 

factors that weighed before the Consultant or the Tender 

Accepting Authority. Therefore, if the Consultant's report is 

187 | P a g e 


taken as a benchmark for evaluation of tenders, which has 

been accepted by the Tender Scrutiny Committee and the 

Board of TANGEDCO blindly, we hold that the analysis of the 

two tenderers on technical ability or capacity would be 

stretching the issues little far. But, we would like to add that 

both the tenderers may be technically sound, but when it 

comes to implementation some serious issues are raised 

insofar as BHEL is concerned. Few instances are as follows: 

(i) The letter from the Hon'ble Chief Minister dated 26.11.2013 

addressed to the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India; (ii) The 

Counter Affidavit filed by Tamil Nadu Electricity Board in 

W.P.(MD) No.3730 of 2012 before the Madurai Bench of the 

Madras High Court; (iii) The report of Comptroller and Auditor 

General of India, New Delhi dated 17.2.2014; (iv) Order of the 

Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, New Delhi, dated 

19.6.2014; and (v) various newspaper reports and the 

contents of the TANGEDCO website. 

35.4. It is for the Tender Scrutiny Committee or the 

Tender Accepting Authority to weigh these issues and decide as 

188 | P a g e 


to whether such a time bound project should be given to BHEL 

based on their past performance. We find these are relevant 

issues which should have been considered because the State 

and its instrumentalities should keep in mind the effect of non-

implementation of the project within the time specified and the 

cost overrun that it will entail. 

35.5. It is one thing to say that delay can be penalized. 

We cannot accept the proposition that delay can be mitigated 

by penalty. As has been rightly pointed out by the learned 

Single Judge, in introspection, that delay has caused serious 

damage to the efficiency of the Government and other limbs of 

democracy. But we have to keep in mind that in our country 

there has been a tendency to accept delay, lethargy, inaction 

and supine indifference as facets of life and, therefore, this 

laid-back attitude has not pushed the country in the direction 

of economic growth that we find in other developing countries, 

despite the fact that India has large work force, intellectual 

capacity, effective management gurus and great leaders to 

guide the country, not to miss the vitriolic public platform 

189 | P a g e 


speakers who take us nowhere. It is just that one single factor 

that we accept inaction or inefficiency as part of life and delay 

with a remedial measure where one tends to overlook 

important projects set to time limit, with a thought of penalty 

on account of delay. This destroys the entire project. Public 

interest suffers. Can Courts be mute spectators? We think, not. 

35.6. In fact, one should not lose sight of the fact that in 

large number of cases, arbitration clause is invoked for 

additional cost alleging delay on one or other party. Therefore, 

we have no hesitation to observe that time factor should be 

strictly adhered to and that is a relevant consideration. The 

first respondent should rate the rival bidders on efficiency -

ability to take up the project is one thing, but, efficiency in 

completing the project is yet another factor. Both are relevant. 

36.1. In the present case, the decision making process is 

arbitrary, irrational, illegal and procedurally improper. The first 

respondent has also abdicated its function by failure to take 

into consideration relevant factors and flawed its decision on 

190 | P a g e 


irrelevant and non-existent factors, merely based on 

Consultant report: 

(A) It is the specific direction of the Division Bench on 

19.8.2014 in W.A.No.1065 of 2014 to consider the 

representations of the appellant, which rests on the issues of 

(i) reduction of rate of interest; and (ii) past performance of 

BHEL. However, the same were not considered, more so when 

the award of tender in favour of BHEL was granted only on 

27.9.2014. 

(B) Even as per the records of TANGEDCO, BHEL was 

awarded tender only on 27.9.2014 and when prior to that 

negotiations were held with BHEL for reduction of interest rate, 

such an option should have also been given to the appellant as 

well. 

(C) The reduction of rate of interest is a substantial 

saving to TANGEDCO in the EPC-cum-Debt Financing contract 

for setting up Supercritical Thermal Power Plant. The cost 

would be a decisive factor. Therefore, the offers made by both 

the parties should have been considered. 

(D) Commitment Fee has been included on the basis of 

191 | P a g e 


the Consultant Report. It is merely advisory in nature. In any 

event, on this issue, clarification was given by the appellant on 

13.6.2014 and that was not considered. 

(E) No prudent man will understand the term 

"Commitment Fee" in the manner in which TANGEDCO wants. 

Interest is taken on the loan amount. If loan is availed as per 

the terms, then Commitment fees will be charged. That is how 

the document has been clarified. We fail to understand how 

TANGEDCO can merely quibble with words to give an illogical 

reasoning that commitment fee is payable even if loan is not 

availed. Any person in normal commercial transaction can 

perceive that if no loan is taken the commitment fee is not 

charged. If loan is availed, interest is payable. 

(F) Interest on Management Fee and Guarantee Fee is 

not included by the appellant. 
They have said so in no 

uncertain terms. 
However, the Consultant has included it 

without reference to the representation. If we accept the plea 

of the TANGEDCO that this is how they would like to 

understand, then it would amount to arbitrary and irrational 

appraisal and evaluation. This will render the decision making 

192 | P a g e 


process vulnerable to judicial review. We have no hesitation to 

hold that the decision of TANGEDCO declaring BHEL as L1 is 

flawed for all the reasons that we have discussed earlier. 

36.2. We, therefore, hold that the process adopted and 

the decision made by TANGEDCO is arbitrary, unfair, irrational, 

biased and mala fide. It is not in accordance with the 

provisions of the TTIT Act and TTIT Rules. Accordingly, based 

on Jagdish Mandal case, referred supra, M/s.TANGEDCO's 

decision to declare the third respondent -BHEL as L1 fails and 

has to be interfered with. 

II TEST -PUBLIC INTEREST 

37.1. The second test to be considered is the public 

interest involved in this case. 

37.2. The Supreme Court in Raunaq International Ltd. v. 

IVR Construction Ltd. and others, (1999) 1 SCC 492 has 

clearly laid down as to what are the elements of public interest 

193 | P a g e 


in commercial transactions like the award of contract. The 

relevant portion of the said decision is extracted hereunder: 

"10. What are these elements of public 
interest? (1) Public money would be expended 
for the purposes of the contract. (2) The goods 
or services which are being commissioned 
could be for a public purpose, such as, 
construction of roads, public buildings, power 
plants or other public utilities. (3) The public 
would be directly interested in the timely 
fulfilment of the contract so that the services 
become available to the public expeditiously. 
(4) The public would also be interested in the 
quality of the work undertaken or goods 
supplied by the tenderer….." 

37.3. In the case on hand, we have already held that the 

procedure followed by the TANGEDCO reeks of arbitrariness, 

unfair and unjust treatment to appellant, besides malafide and 

being unreasonable and irrational. As to how an authority 

awarding contract should have conducted itself, has been 

specifically stated by the Supreme Court in LIC v. Consumer 

Education & Research Centre, (1995) 5 SCC 482, as under: 

"27. In the sphere of contractual relations the State, 
its instrumentality, public authorities or those whose 
acts bear insignia of public element, action to public 
duty or obligation are enjoined to act in a manner 
i.e. fair, just and equitable, after taking objectively 
all the relevant options into consideration and in a 
manner that is reasonable, relevant and germane to 
effectuate the purpose for public good and in general 

194 | P a g e 


public interest and it must not take any irrelevant or 
irrational factors into consideration or appear 
arbitrary in its decision. Duty to act fairly is part of 
fair procedure envisaged under Articles 14 and 21. 
Every activity of the public authority or those under 
public duty or obligation must be informed by reason 
and guided by the public interest." 

37.4. When a writ petition is filed challenging the award 

of a contract by a public authority or the State, the Court must 

be satisfied that there is some element of public interest 

involved in entertaining such a petition. The Court should 

always keep the larger public interest in mind in order to 

decide whether its intervention is called for or not. Only when 

it comes to a conclusion that overwhelming public interest 

requires interference, the Court should intervene. On a 

challenge to the award of a contract or rejection of a tender, by 

a public authority or the State, the court must be satisfied that 

there is some element of public interest involved in 

entertaining such a petition. 

37.5. In the case on hand, even as per the Consultant's 

Report the difference between the bid of the appellant and the 

third respondent is around Rs.71 Crores. The difference on 

195 | P a g e 


account of the reduction of the rate of interest from 7.2% to 

6.2% as offered by the appellant would reduce the cost of the 

project by about Rs.1300 Crores. If either the Commitment 

Fee of Rs.156.184 Crores or the interest on Management Fee 

and Guarantee Fee for the 36 month construction period is not 

loaded, certainly the cost of project will come down even 

further. The said factors cannot be brushed aside by the 

TANGEDCO, as the above constitute overwhelming public 

interest, i.e., reduction of cost of the EPC-cum-Debt Financing 

project. The TANGEDCO in the larger public interest that it 

serves ought to have considered the bid submitted by the 

appellant and that of the third respondent in order to ensure a 

level-playing field between the tenderers and fruitfully gain the 

benefit of lowest cost in the 2x660 MW Supercritical Thermal 

Power Project based on all relevant parameters contained in 

the two bids. 

37.6. In such view of the matter, we answer this issue 

also against TANGEDCO. 

196 | P a g e 


CONCLUSION 

38. However, we are cognizant of the fact that the price 

offered may not always be the sole criterion for awarding a 

contract, and it is one among the relevant and important 

criteria. The quality of work executed, the past record of the 

tenderers, the quality of the goods or services which are 

offered, assessing such quality on the basis of the past 

performance of the bidders, their market reputation, the cost 

factor and so on, play an important role in deciding, to whom 

the contract should be awarded. The decision making process 

should be transparent and open in finding the best bid 

considering all the relevant parameters and keeping in mind 

the public interest paramount. When all these relevant factors 

have not been considered in the right perspective but more in 

breach, as observed above, certainly Courts in exercise of 

power of judicial review can interfere and we are inclined to 

interfere with the proceedings impugned in the writ petitions. 

39. Resultantly, we allow these appeals and set aside the 

common order passed by the learned Single Judge. 

197 | P a g e 


Consequently, the proceedings of the TANGEDCO impugned in 

the writ petitions are set aside. The TANGEDCO is directed to 

evaluate the appellant's price bid along with the bid of the third 

respondent, in the light of our findings as above and also 

taking into consideration all required parameters and the 

clarifications submitted by the appellant in its various 

representations, as directed by the Single Judge in the order 

dated 31.7.2014 and that of the Division Bench in its order 

dated 19.8.2014, afresh, at the earliest. 

40. It is made clear that this Court has not expressed any 

opinion on whether or not the subject contract should be 

awarded to the appellant or the 3 rd respondent, as it is for the 

TANGEDCO to decide which one of these two bidders, would 

subserve the larger public interest in executing the project by 

taking into consideration all relevant parameters including the 

representations/documents, etc. submitted. We, however, 

make it clear that, while undertaking this exercise, the 

TANGEDCO shall record detailed reasons for their decision and 

communicate the same to the appellant and the third 

198 | P a g e 


respondent so as to comply with the requirement of the 

provisions of the TTIT Act and TTIT Rules and the decisions of 

the Supreme Court, referred supra. No costs. Consequently, 

M.P.No.1 of 2015 in W.A.No.712 of 2015 and M.P.Nos.1 and 2 

of 2015 in W.A.No.713 of 2015 are closed.
