			<body>For R5 in W.A.No.2510/2013 <lb/>: <lb/>Mr.C.Johnson. <lb/>COMMON JUDGMENT <lb/>V.Dhanapalan,J. <lb/>All these appeals have been filed against the common order of a learned <lb/>single Judge of this Court, dated 19.12.2013, dismissing the Writ Petitions, <lb/>challenging G.O.Ms.No.380 Revenue [LD1 (1)] Department, dated 28.09.2013, <lb/>which culminated in the orders of the District Collector, Chennai, dated <lb/>30.09.2013, directing the appellants to vacate the land and hand over <lb/>possession of the premises to the Tahsildar, Fort-Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai. <lb/>2. <lb/>Case of the appellants before the writ court was that they were the <lb/>lessees/sub-lessees/tenants of the building constructed by a Trust, namely, <lb/>Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar Choultry, situated opposite to the Central <lb/>Railway Station, Chennai, and when they are in possession and enjoyment of <lb/>the same, the Government of Tamil Nadu passed a Government Order in <lb/>G.O.Ms.No.380, Revenue, [LD1 (1)] Department, dated 28.09.2013, pursuant <lb/>to which the District Collector, Chennai, by his orders, dated 30.09.2013, <lb/>directing them to vacate the land and hand over possession of the premises to <lb/>the Tahsildar, Fort-Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai, on the ground that the land was <lb/>required for Chennai Metro Rail Project with larger public interest to Chennai <lb/>Metro Rail Limited (in short CMRL), for implementing the project, which <lb/>action, according to the appellants, was illegal and unjustified. <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>3. According to the appellant in W.A.No.2510 of 2013, namely, <lb/>S.V.R.Ramprasad, he was appointed as a co-trustee of Rajah Sir Ramasamy <lb/>Mudaliar Choultry by an order of this Court in O.S.A.Nos.66 &amp; 67 of 2000, <lb/>dated 05.06.2000; Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar had submitted a proposal to <lb/>construct a choultry in Chennai at the cost of about Rs.30,000/-before the <lb/>Government on 10.03.1888 and sought a piece of land for that purpose and in <lb/>consideration of that laudable objective and upon taking into account the <lb/>various charitable activities of Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar rendered to the <lb/>society, the Government had come forward to allot a piece of land measuring an <lb/>extent of 1.33 acres, now comprised in T.S.No.41, Vepery Village, Fort-<lb/>Tondiarpet Taluk, valued at Rs.3,638/-at free of cost for the purpose of <lb/>construction of the choultry in that piece of land with a condition that the said <lb/>piece of land shall be used for construction of choultry and on failure of <lb/>fulfillment of the conditions and that the said grant of land would be liable for <lb/>resumption; the choultry building so constructed by the founder Rajah Sir <lb/>Ramasamy Mudaliar way back in the year 1888 has been classified as a <lb/>historical and heritage building by the High Power Heritage Committee so <lb/>constituted under the orders of this Court; after considering the reports <lb/>submitted by the heritage committee, this Court directed the Heritage <lb/>Conservation Committee to issue notice to all the buildings shown in Sl.Nos.1 <lb/>to 467 in the Committee Report for preserving and maintaining such buildings <lb/>without causing any damage to them; in compliance of the directions of a <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>Division Bench of this Court, the Heritage Conservation Committee, under the <lb/>management and control of CMDA, issued a notice to the appellant, by <lb/>proceedings dated 21.09.2010, thereby cautioning him to ensure safety of the <lb/>said heritage building and, presently, the said heritage building is under <lb/>occupation of Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation. His further case <lb/>is that the right to property is a constitutional right safeguarded under Article <lb/>300-A of the Constitution of India and that the Government has intruded and <lb/>invaded the right of the founder trustee and there is an encumbrance existing in <lb/>T.S.No.41, which cannot be ignored by the State and, hence, he prayed to allow <lb/>the appeal. <lb/>4. The facts are that originally the Government of Tamil Nadu issued an <lb/>order in G.O.Ms.No.168, Revenue, dated 21 May 2012, resuming the land in <lb/>T.S.No.41, alleging the violation of the terms of original Grant and also on <lb/>account of a larger public purpose and to hand it over to Chennai Metro Rail <lb/>Limiteid, in connection with the introduction of Metro Rail at Chennai. The <lb/>said Government Order and the consequential order passed by Administrator <lb/>General and Official Trustee (AGOT) were challenged in W.P.No.19269 of <lb/>2012 and its batch. The Writ Petitions were allowed by a learned single Judge <lb/>by his common order, dated 26.11.2012, with a direction to the Government to <lb/>issue notice to the lesseees, AGOT and Co-Trustee and thereafter to pass fresh <lb/>orders, taking into consideration their objections. The common order, dated <lb/>26.11.2012, was taken on appeal in W.A.Nos.70 to 88 of 2013 and 91 to 106 of <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>2013 before a Division Bench and the said Division Bench, by its judgment, <lb/>dated 12.07.2013, allowed the appeals. The unsuccessful writ petitioners filed <lb/>Special Leave Petitions before the Supreme Court, which granted leave and <lb/>after recording the undertaking given by the learned Solicitor General, directed <lb/>that all the affected parties should be given notices and an opportunity to <lb/>respond and, accordingly, disposed of the Petitions, by an order dated <lb/>25.07.2013. Thereafter, the District Collector, Chennai, issued individual <lb/>notices to the affected parties and received their response. The District <lb/>Collector, after examining the objections, submitted a report to the Government <lb/>with a recommendation to resume the land in T.S.No.41. The Government has <lb/>examined the proposal in the light of the earlier proceedings and the objections <lb/>raised by the affected parties and resolved to resume the land by an order, dated <lb/>28.09.2013, in G.O.Ms.No.380, Revenue (LD1(1)) Department. The District <lb/>Collector, pursuant to the said order dated 28.09.2013, issued notices, dated <lb/>30.09.2013, directing the petitioners to vacate and hand over the premises to <lb/>the Tahsildar, Fort Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai, on 15.10.2013. The Government <lb/>Order in G.O.Ms.No.380, dated 28.09.2013, and the consequential eviction <lb/>notices, dated 30.09.2013, were under challenge in the Writ Petitions before the <lb/>learned single Judge. <lb/>5. Resumption of the land in question vide G.O.Ms.No.380, dated <lb/>28.09.2013, as well as the subsequent order of the District Collector, Chennai, <lb/>was justified by the Government, stating that the purpose for which the grant <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>was given was no more in existence and that the land belonged to the <lb/>Government; hence, there was no need to take recourse to acquisiton of the <lb/>land and, as such, the appellants, being the lessees/sub-lessees/tenants, were not <lb/>entitled to challenge the process of resumption. <lb/>6. The stand of Chennai Metro Rail Limited was that Chennai Metro Rail <lb/>Project was managed by the Government of India and the State Government by <lb/>way of equal equity contribution and suordinate debt; CMRL received loan <lb/>from Japan International Cooperation Agency; CMRL required the subject land <lb/>for railways in public interest and, therefore, any delay of the project would <lb/>escalate the cost and defeat the public purpose. <lb/>7. <lb/>Upon hearing the rival submissions made by the parties, the <lb/>learned single Judge dismissed all the writ petitions, challenging the legality <lb/>and correctness of the orders, directing resumption of land, on the ground that <lb/>the benefit to public would outweigh the loss to the petitioners. By dismissing <lb/>the writ petitions, the single Judge directed Chennai Metro Rail Limited to <lb/>assess the reasonable compensation payable to the petitioners, with the <lb/>assistance of the District Collector, Chennai, and the Chief Engineer, Public <lb/>Works Department, and pay the same to the petitioners on or before 10th <lb/>January,2014. Aggrieved over the said dismissal, these appeals are filed by <lb/>some of the writ petitioners. <lb/>8. Mr.A.Vijay Narayan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the <lb/>appellant in W.A.No.2508/2013, would contend that resumption of subject <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>lands on the ground of violation of conditions of the grant was wholly illegal. <lb/>According to him, should there be a requirement of the lands for a public <lb/>purpose, the initiation of proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act is a sine <lb/>qua non and, therefore, the action of the respondents in resuming the lands by <lb/>way of government orders is non est in law and a violation of the provisions of <lb/>Article 300-A of the Constitution of India and Sections 10,25 and 29 of the <lb/>Official Trustees Act,1913. <lb/>9. <lb/>The learned Senior Counsel, in support of his submissions, has <lb/>relied on the following decisions : <lb/>(i) Bishan Das and others vs. State of Punjab and others, reported in AIR <lb/>1961 SC 1570 : <lb/>&quot;(11) We consider that both these contentions are <lb/>unsound and the petitioners have made out a clear case of the <lb/>violation of their fundamental rights. There has been some <lb/>argument before us as to the true legal effect of the sanction <lb/>granted in 1909 to Ramji Das subject to the conditions <lb/>adverted to earlier: whether it was a lease in favour of the <lb/>firm Faquir Chand Bhagwan Das; whether it was a licence <lb/>coupled with a grant or an irrevocable licence within the <lb/>meaning of s. 60(b) of the Easements Act, 1882. These are <lb/>disputed questions which we do not think that we are called <lb/>upon to decide in the present proceeding. The admitted <lb/>position, so far as the present proceeding is concerned, is that <lb/>the land belonged to the State; with the permission of the <lb/>State Ramji Das, on behalf of the joint family firm of Faquir <lb/>Chand Bhagwan Das, built the dharmasala, temple and shops <lb/>and managed the same during his life time. After his death the <lb/>petitioners, other members of the joint family, continued the <lb/>management. On this admitted position the petitioners cannot <lb/>be held to be trespassers in respect of the dharmasala, temple <lb/>and shops; nor can it be held that the dharmasala, temple and <lb/>shops belonged to the State, irrespective of the question <lb/>whether the trust created was of a public or private nature. A <lb/>trustee even of a public trust can be removed only by <lb/>procedure known to law. He cannot be removed by an <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>executive fiat. It is by now well settled that the maxim, what <lb/>is annexed to the soil goes with the soil, has not been <lb/>accepted as an absolute rule of law of this country; see <lb/>Thakoor Chunder Parmanick v. Ramdhone Bhuttacharjee, 6 <lb/>Suth WR 228; Beni Ram v. Kundan Lall, 26 Ind App 58 and <lb/>Narayan Das Khettry v. Jatindranath, 54 Ind App 218; (AIR <lb/>1927 PC 135). These decisions show that a person who bona <lb/>fide puts up constructions on land belonging to others with <lb/>their permission would not be a trespasser, nor would the <lb/>buildings so constructed vest in the owner of the land by the <lb/>application of the maxim quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit. <lb/>It is, therefore, impossible to hold that in respect of the <lb/>dharmasala, temples and shops, the State has acquired any <lb/>rights whatsoever merely by reason of their being on the land <lb/>belonging to the State. If the State thought that the <lb/>constructions should be removed or that the condition as to <lb/>resumption of the land should be invoked, it was open to the <lb/>State to take appropriate legal action for the purpose. Even if <lb/>the State proceeded on the footing that the trust was a public <lb/>trust it should have taken appropriate legal action for the <lb/>removal of the trustee as was opined by the State&apos;s Legal <lb/>Remembrancer. It is well recognised that a suit under s. 92, <lb/>Civil Procedure Code, may be brought against persons in <lb/>possession of the trust property even if they claim adversely <lb/>to the trust, that is, claim to be owners of the property, or <lb/>against persons who deny the validity of the trust. <lb/>(14) Before we part with this case, we feel it our duty <lb/>to say that the executive action taken in this case by the State <lb/>and its officers is destructive of the basic principle of the rule <lb/>of law. The facts and the position in law thus clearly are (1) <lb/>that the buildings constructed on this piece of Government <lb/>land did not belong to Government, (2) that the petitioners <lb/>were in possession and occupation of the buildings and (3) <lb/>that by virtue of enactments binding on the Government, the <lb/>petitioners could be dispossessed, if at all, only in pursuance <lb/>of a decree of a Civil Court obtained in proceedings properly <lb/>initiated. In these circumstances the action of the Government <lb/>in taking the law into their hands and dispossessing the <lb/>petitioners by the display of force, exhibits a callous disregard <lb/>of the normal requirements of the rule of law apart from what <lb/>might legitimately and reasonably be expected from a <lb/>Government functioning in a society governed by a <lb/>Constitution which guarantees to its citizens against arbitrary <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>invasion by the executive of peaceful possession of property. <lb/>As pointed out by this Court in Wazir Chand v. The State of <lb/>Himachal Pradesh (1), the State or its executive officers <lb/>cannot in-terfere with the rights of others unless they can <lb/>point to some specific rule of law which authorises their acts. <lb/>In Ram Prasad Narayan Sahi v. The State of Bihar (2) this <lb/>Court said that nothing is more likely to drain the vitality <lb/>from the rule of law than legislation which singles out a <lb/>particular individual from his fellow subjects and visits him <lb/>with a disability which is not imposed upon the others. We <lb/>have here a highly discriminatory and autocratic act which <lb/>deprives a person of the possession of property without <lb/>reference to any law or legal authority. Even if the property <lb/>was trust property it is difficult to see how the Municipal <lb/>Committee, Barnala, can step in as trustee on an executive <lb/>determination only. The reasons given for this extraordinary <lb/>action are, to quote what we said in Sahi&apos;s case (supra), <lb/>remarkable for their disturbing implications. <lb/>(15) For these reasons, we allow the application with <lb/>costs and a writ will now issue as directed.&quot; <lb/>(ii) Smt. Chandra Kali vs. Managing Committee Aryasamaj, Meerut <lb/>and others, reported in AIR 1987 Allahabad 341 : <lb/>&quot;17. There is, however, one aspect of the matter which <lb/>has to be clarified in this order. Although the Official Trustee <lb/>is the sole trustee of the property vested in the Official <lb/>Trustee, yet he has to seek order from the Court. Section 25 of <lb/>the Official Trustees Act makes it clear that the High Court <lb/>may make such orders as it thinks fit respecting, any Trust <lb/>property vested in the Official Trustee or the income or <lb/>produce thereof. Even in the matter of the income or the <lb/>produce of vested property the High Court has power to make <lb/>order or give directions. The sale of a Trust property is <lb/>certainly the sale of the corpus and it is all the more necessary <lb/>that the High Court&apos;s permission ought to be obtained by the <lb/>Official Trustee before he disposes of any immovable <lb/>property. <lb/>18. Section 29 also says that nothing in this Act shall be <lb/>deemed to prevent the transfer by the Official Trustee of any <lb/>property vested in him to any other person if the Court so <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>directs. Since the transfer by auction sale in the present case <lb/>is in favour of a person other than original transferee or any <lb/>other lawfully appointed trustee it can only take place if the <lb/>Court so directs. It is, therefore, evident that to effect a valid <lb/>transfer of a trust property which has vested in the Official <lb/>Trustee the latter has to seek direction from the Court for its <lb/>transfer. If .the Official Trustee feels that it is in the interest <lb/>of the Trust to dispose of any immovable property of the <lb/>Trust he can always seek direction from the Court. My <lb/>attention has not been drawn to any paper by which Court&apos;s <lb/>direction was sought for the transfer of the aforesaid <lb/>immovable property. I am of the opinion that unless there is a <lb/>direction by the Court or an order by the Court within the <lb/>meaning of Sections 29 and 25 of the Official Trustees Act, <lb/>1913, no Trust property can be transferred by the Official <lb/>Trustee.&quot; <lb/>(iii) K.T.Plantation Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. State of Karnataka, <lb/>reported in AIR 2011 SC 3430: <lb/>&quot;115. Principles of eminent domain, as such, is not <lb/>seen incorporated in Article 300A, as we see, in Article <lb/>30(1A), as well as in the 2nd proviso to Article 31A(1) <lb/>though we can infer those principles in Article 300A. <lb/>Provision for payment of compensation has been specifically <lb/>incorporated in Article 30(1A) as well as in the 2nd proviso to <lb/>Article 31A(1) for achieving specific objectives. <lb/>Constitution&apos;s 44th Amendment Act, 1978 while omitting <lb/>Article 31 brought in a substantive provision Clause (1A) to <lb/>Article 30. Resultantly, though no individual or even <lb/>educational institution belonging to majority community shall <lb/>have any fundamental right to compensation in case of <lb/>compulsory acquisition of his property by the State, an <lb/>educational institution belonging to a minority community <lb/>shall have such fundamental right to claim compensation in <lb/>case State enacts a law providing for compulsory acquisition <lb/>of any property of an educational institution established and <lb/>administered by a minority community. Further, the second <lb/>proviso to Article 31A(1) prohibits the Legislature from <lb/>making a law which does not contain a provision for payment <lb/>of compensation at a rate not less than the market value which <lb/>follows that a law which does not contain such provision shall <lb/>be invalid and the acquisition proceedings would be rendered <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>void. <lb/>116. Looking at the history of the various <lb/>constitutional amendments, judicial pronouncements and the <lb/>statement of objects and reasons contained in the 44th <lb/>Amendment Bill which led to the 44th Amendment Act we <lb/>have no doubt that the intention of the Parliament was to do <lb/>away with the fundamental right to acquire, hold and dispose <lb/>of the property. But the question is whether the principles of <lb/>eminent domain are completely obliterated when a person is <lb/>deprived of his property by the authority of law under Article <lb/>300A of the Constitution. <lb/>PUBLIC PURPOSE <lb/>117. Deprivation of property within the meaning of <lb/>Art.300A, generally speaking, must take place for public <lb/>purpose or public interest. The concept of eminent domain <lb/>which applies when a person is deprived of his property <lb/>postulates that the purpose must be primarily public and not <lb/>primarily of private interest and merely incidentally beneficial <lb/>to the public. Any law, which deprives a person of his private <lb/>property for private interest, will be unlawful and unfair and <lb/>undermines the rule of law and can be subjected to judicial <lb/>review. But the question as to whether the purpose is <lb/>primarily public or private, has to be decided by the <lb/>legislature, which of course should be made known. The <lb/>concept of public purpose has been given fairly expansive <lb/>meaning which has to be justified upon the purpose and <lb/>object of statute and the policy of the legislation. Public <lb/>purpose is, therefore, a condition precedent, for invoking <lb/>Article 300A. <lb/>COMPENSATION <lb/>118. We have found that the requirement of public <lb/>purpose is invariably the rule for depriving a person of his <lb/>property, violation of which is amenable to judicial review. <lb/>Let us now examine whether the requirement of payment of <lb/>compensation is the rule after the deletion of Article 31(2). <lb/>Payment of compensation amount is a constitutional <lb/>requirement under Article 30(1A) and under the 2nd proviso <lb/>to Article 31A(1), unlike Article 300A. After the 44th <lb/>Amendment Act, 1978, the constitutional obligation to pay <lb/>compensation to a person who is deprived of his property <lb/>primarily depends upon the terms of the statute and the <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>legislative policy. Article 300A, however, does not prohibit <lb/>the payment of just compensation when a person is deprived <lb/>of his property, but the question is whether a person is <lb/>entitled to get compensation, as a matter of right, in the <lb/>absence of any stipulation in the statute, depriving him of his <lb/>property. <lb/>121. We find no apparent conflict with the words used <lb/>in Entry 42, List III so as to infer that the payment of <lb/>compensation is inbuilt or inherent either in the words <lb/>&quot;acquisition and requisitioning&quot; under Entry 42, List III. <lb/>Right to claim compensation is, therefore, cannot be read into <lb/>the legislative Entry 42 List III. Requirement of public <lb/>purpose, for deprivation of a person of his property under <lb/>Article 300-A, is a pre-condition, but no compensation or nil <lb/>compensation or its illusiveness has to be justified by the <lb/>State on judicially justiciable standards. Measures designed <lb/>to achieve greater social justice, may call for lesser <lb/>compensation and such a limitation by itself will not make <lb/>legislation invalid or unconstitutional or confiscatory. In <lb/>other words, the right to claim compensation or the obligation <lb/>to pay, though not expressly included in Article 300-A, it can <lb/>be inferred in that Article and it is for the State to justify its <lb/>stand on justifiable grounds which may depend upon the <lb/>legislative policy, object and purpose of the statute and host <lb/>of other factors. <lb/>122. Article 300-A would be equally violated if the <lb/>provisions of law authorizing deprivation of property have <lb/>not been complied with. While enacting Article 300-A, <lb/>Parliament has only borrowed Article 31(1) [the &quot;Rule of <lb/>law&quot; doctrine] and not Article 31(2) [which had embodied the <lb/>doctrine of Eminent Domain]. Article 300-A enables the <lb/>State to put restrictions on the right to property by law. That <lb/>law has to be reasonable. It must comply with other <lb/>provisions of the Constitution. The limitation or restriction <lb/>should not be arbitrary or excessive. The legislation <lb/>providing for deprivation of property under Article 300-A <lb/>must be &quot;just, fair and reasonable&quot; as understood in terms of <lb/>Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 26(b), 301, etc. Thus, in each case, <lb/>courts will have to examine the scheme of the impugned Act, <lb/>its object, purpose as also the question whether payment of nil <lb/>compensation or nominal compensation would make the <lb/>impugned law unjust, unfair or unreasonable in terms of other <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>provisions of the Constitution as indicated above. At this <lb/>stage, we may clarify that there is a difference between &quot;no <lb/>compensation shall be paid&quot;. However, there could be a law <lb/>awarding &quot;nil&quot;compensation in cases where the State <lb/>undertakes to discharge the liabilities charged on the property <lb/>under acquisition and onus is on the government to establish <lb/>validity of such law. In the latter case, the court in exercise of <lb/>judicial review will test such a law keeping in mind the above <lb/>parameters.&apos;&apos; <lb/>10. Mr.A.R.L.Sundaresan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the <lb/>appellants in W.A.Nos.2511 and 2512 of 2013, would submit that there is no <lb/>breach of conditions of the lease or grant by the appellants and, therefore, the <lb/>impugned order is vitiated in law. He would further submit that the <lb/>respondents have failed to take note of the provisions of Sections 10 and 25 <lb/>and 29 of the Official Trustees Act and to follow the rule of law and, in the <lb/>absence of any order from AGOT Court, the respondents ought not to have <lb/>proceeded with the matter for resumption of the land. He finally contends that <lb/>no personal hearing or opportunity is provided to the appellants before <lb/>initiating the impugned action, as directed by the Supreme Court. In support of <lb/>his contentions, the learned Senior Counsel has relied upon a decision in the <lb/>case of Azim Ahmed Kazmi and others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and another, <lb/>reported in (2012) 7 SCC 278, wherein it is held as under : <lb/>&quot;17. The questions which requires consideration are (i) <lb/>whether the order passed by the State Government on 15th <lb/>December, 2000 for cancellation of lease and resumption of <lb/>possession is legally valid and (i) whether the State <lb/>Government can dispossess the lessee in accordance with the <lb/>Government Grants Act, 1895 without resorting to other <lb/>procedure established by any other law. <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>18. There is clear recital in the lease deed executed in <lb/>favour of the appellants by the Government of U.P. on 19th <lb/>March, 1996 that the same is being done under the <lb/>Government Grants Act, 1895. Clause 3 (C) of the deed reads <lb/>as follows: <lb/>&quot;3(C) That if the demised premises are at any <lb/>time required by the lessor for his or for any public <lb/>purpose he shall have the right to give one month&apos;s clear <lb/>notice in writing to the lessees to remove any building <lb/>standing at the time of the demised premises and within <lb/>two months of the receipt of the notice to take <lb/>possession thereof on the expiry of that period subject <lb/>however to the condition that if the lessor is willing to <lb/>purchase the building on the demised premises, the <lb/>lessees shall be paid for such building such amount as <lb/>may be determined by the Secretary to Government of <lb/>U.P. in the Nagar Awas Department.&quot; <lb/>27. For taking possession, the State Government is <lb/>required to follow the law, if any, prescribed. In the absence <lb/>of any specific law, the State Government may take <lb/>possession by filing a suit. <lb/>28. Under the Provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, <lb/>1894, if the State Government decides to acquire the property <lb/>in accordance with the provisions of the said Act, no separate <lb/>proceedings have to be taken for getting possession of the <lb/>land. It may even invoke the urgency provisions contained in <lb/>Section 17 of the said Act and the Collector may take <lb/>possession of the land immediately after the publication of <lb/>the notice under Section 9. In such a case, the person in <lb/>possession of the land acquired would be dispossessed <lb/>forthwith. <lb/>29. However, if the Government proceeds under the <lb/>terms of the Government Grants Act, 1895 then what <lb/>procedure is to be followed. Section 3 of Government Grants <lb/>Act, 1895, stipulates that the lease made by or on behalf of <lb/>the Government to take effect according to their tenor -All <lb/>provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations contained <lb/>in any such creation, conferment or grant referred to any <lb/>Section 2, shall be valid and take effect according to their <lb/>tenor; any decree or direction of a Court of Law or any rule <lb/>of law, statute or enactments of the Legislature, to the <lb/>contrary. <lb/></body>

Mr.M.Abdul Nazeer, learned counsel appearing for the appellants <lb/>in W.A.Nos.2509 of 2013 and 275 and 276 of 2014, would submit that the <lb/>appellants are in lawful possession of the property and the finding of the <lb/>Supreme Court in this regard would fortify the stand that these appellants are in <lb/>continuous possession in terms of the lease and there is no violation of the <lb/>terms of lease by the appellants. It is his contention that the land alone belongs <lb/>to the State and the superstructure thereon is built by the appellants by <lb/>incurring huge expenditure, but, till-date, no compensation is paid and also no <lb/>procedure has been bollowed by the respondents before taking the action to <lb/>oust the appellants from their possession. He has relied on the following <lb/>decisions: <lb/>(i) Virendra Singh and others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, reported in AIR <lb/>1954 SC 447: <lb/>&quot;29. Now what effect did the Constitution have on <lb/>that? In our opinion, the Constitution, by reason of the <lb/>authority derived from, and conferred by, the peoples of this <lb/>land, blotted out in one magnificent sweep all vestiges of <lb/>arbitrary and despotic power in the territories of India and over <lb/>its citizens and lands and prohibited just such acts of arbitrary <lb/>power as the State now seeks to uphold. <lb/>Let it be conceded (without admitting or deciding the <lb/>point) that the Dominion of India once had the powers for <lb/>which the Union Government now contends. The self-same <lb/>authorities which appear to concede that power also admit that <lb/>it can be waived or relinquished. What then was the attitude of <lb/>the Dominion towards those States which it sought to draw <lb/>into the Republic of India which was yet to be free, sovereign, <lb/>democratic, as its Constitution later proclaimed it to be? We <lb/>quote from the mouthpiece of that Government as disclosed in <lb/>the White Paper on Indian States published by official <lb/>authority. <lb/></body>

			<body>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel&apos;s statement (he was then in <lb/>charge of the States Department) 5th July, 1947, is reproduced <lb/>at page 157. He said at page 158:-&quot;This country with its <lb/>institutions is the proud heritage of the people who inhabit it, It <lb/>is an accident that some live in the States and some in British <lb/>India but all alike partake of its culture and character. We are <lb/>all knit together by bonds of blood and feeling. no less than of <lb/>self-interest&apos; None can segregate us into segments; no <lb/>impassable barriers can be set up between us. I suggest that it <lb/>is therefore better for us to make laws sitting together as <lb/>friends than to make treaties as aliens. I invite my friends,the <lb/>Rulers of States and their people to the Councils of Constituent <lb/>Assembly in this spirit of friendliness and co-operation in a <lb/>joint endeavour, inspired by common allegiance to our <lb/>motherland for the common good of us all.&quot; <lb/>This invitation was accepted on 19th May, 1949. Page <lb/>109 of the White Paper says <lb/>&quot;As the States came closer to the Centre it <lb/>became clear that the idea of separate Constitutions <lb/>being framed for different constituent units of the <lb/>Indian Union was a legacy from the Rulers&apos; polity <lb/>which could have no place in a democratic set-up. The <lb/>matter was, therefore, further discussed by the Ministry <lb/>of States with the Premiers of Unions and States on <lb/>May 19, 1949, and it was decided, with their <lb/>concurrence, that the Constitution of the States should <lb/>also be framed by the Constituent Assembly of India <lb/>and should form part of the Constitution of India.&quot; <lb/>It is impossible to think of those who -sat down together <lb/>-in the Constituent Assembly, and of those who sent <lb/>representatives there, as conqueror and conquered, as those <lb/>who ceded and as those who absorbed, as sovereigns or their <lb/>plenipotentiaries, contracting alliances and entering into <lb/>treaties as high contracting parties to an act of State. They were <lb/>not there as sovereign and subject as citizen and alien, but as <lb/>the sovereign peoples of India, free democratic equals, forging <lb/>the pattern of a new life for the common weal. <lb/>Every vestige of sovereignty was abandoned by the <lb/>Dominion of India and by the States and surrendered to the <lb/>peoples of the land who through their representatives in the <lb/>Constituent Assembly hammered out for themselves a new <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>Constitution in which all were citizens in a new order having <lb/>but one ie, and owing but one allegiance: devotion, loyalty, <lb/>idelity, to the Sovereign Democratic Republic that is India. At <lb/>one stroke all other territorial allegiances were wiped out and <lb/>the past was obliterated except where expressly preserved; at <lb/>one moment of time the new order was born with its new <lb/>allegiance springing from the same source for all, grounded on <lb/>the same basis: the sovereign will of the, peoples of India with <lb/>no class, no caste, no race, no creed, no distinction, no <lb/>reservation.&quot; <lb/>(ii) State of Bihar vs. Rani Sonabati Kumari, reported in AIR 1961 SC 221: <lb/>&quot;It was urged that the Subordinate Judge by his order <lb/>directed the State &quot; not to issue any notification for taking <lb/>possession &quot;-and as the notification under s. 3(1) does not <lb/>proprio vigore affect or interfere with the possession of the <lb/>proprietor or tenure-holder, the issue of such a notification was <lb/>not within the prohibition. The same argument was addressed <lb/>to the High Court and was repelled by the learned Judges and <lb/>in our opinion correctly. In the first place, the only <lb/>&quot;notification&quot; contemplated by the provisions of the Act <lb/>immediately relevant to the suit, was a notification under s. <lb/>3(1). Such a notification has the statutory effect of divesting <lb/>the owner of the notified estate of his or her title to the <lb/>property and of trans-ferring it to and vesting it in the State. <lb/>The State is enabled to take possession of the estate and the <lb/>properties comprised in it by acting under s. 4, but the latter <lb/>provision does not contemplate any notification, only <lb/>executive acts by authorized officers of the State. Of course, if <lb/>action had been taken under s. 4, and the possession of the <lb/>respondent had been interfered with, there would have been a <lb/>further breach of the order which directed the State. not to <lb/>interfere with or disturb in any manner, the plaintiff&apos;s <lb/>possession. What we desire to point out is that the order of the <lb/>Court really consisted of two parts-the earlier directed against <lb/>the defendant publishing a notification which in the context of <lb/>the relevant statutory provisions could only mean a notification <lb/>under s. 3(1) and that which followed, against interfering with <lb/>the plaintiff&apos;s possession and the fact that-the second part of <lb/>the order was not contravened is no ground for holding that <lb/>there had been no breach of the first part. In the next place, the <lb/>matter is put beyond the pale of controversy, if the order were <lb/>read, as it has to be read, in conjunction with the plaint and the <lb/></body>

			<body>application for a temporary injunction. Mr. Sinha did not <lb/>seriously contend that if the order of the Court were <lb/>understood in the light of the allegations and prayers in these <lb/>two documents, the reference to the &quot; notification &quot; in it was <lb/>only to one under s. 3(1) of the Act, and that the injunction <lb/>therefore was meant to cover and covered such a notification. <lb/>We, therefore, hold that this objection must fail. &quot; <lb/>(iii) The Special Land Acquisition Officer, Hosanagar vs. K.S. <lb/>Ramachandra Rao and others, reported in AIR 1972 SC 2224: <lb/>&quot;2. Mr.M.Veerappa, the learned counsel for the State of <lb/>Mysore, contends that the Land Acquisition Officer had not <lb/>assessed the compensation payable for the rights of the <lb/>respondents in the lands acquired. According to him, the Land <lb/>Acquisition Officer merely estimated the value of the lands <lb/>acquired. He contends that the respondents are not entitled to <lb/>the entire value of the lands acquired, but that they are entitled <lb/>only to the value of their rights into those lands as held by this <lb/>Court in Seshagiri Rao&apos;s case (1964) 2 Mys LJ 287 (supra). <lb/>We have gone through the Award made by the Land <lb/>Acquisition Officer. The Land Acquisition Officer appears to <lb/>have valued the rights of the respondents in the lands acquired. <lb/>Whether the valuation made by him is correct or not cannot be <lb/>gone into these proceedings. The appellants is bound by the <lb/>valuation made by the Land Acquisition Officer. The view <lb/>taken by the Land Acquisition Officer that the respondents are <lb/>not entitled to any compensation in respect of the lands <lb/>acquired cannot be sustained in view of this Court&apos;s decision in <lb/>Seshagiri Rao&apos;s case (supra). &quot; <lb/>(iv) The State of U.P. And Zahoor Ahmad and another, reported in (1973) <lb/>2 SCC 547: <lb/>&quot;16. Section 3 of the Government Grants Act declares <lb/>the unfettered discretion of the Government to impose such <lb/>conditions and limitations as it thinks fit, no matter what the <lb/>general law of the land be. The meaning of sections 2 and 3 of <lb/>the Government Grants is that the scope of that Act is not <lb/>limited to affecting the provisions of the Transfer of Property <lb/>Act only. The Government has unfettered discretion to impose <lb/>any conditions, limitations, or restrictions in its grants, and the <lb/>right, privileges and obligations of the grantee would be <lb/>regulated according to the terms of the grant, notwithstanding <lb/></body>

			<body>any provisions of any statutory or common law.&quot; <lb/>(v) Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Gurnam Kaur, reported in AIR <lb/>1989 SC 38: <lb/>&quot;13. At the end of the day, we must make a mention <lb/>that Shri Verghese, learned counsel for the respondent made a <lb/>valiant effort to bring into play the principles laid down by this <lb/>Court in Olga Tellis &amp; Ors. v. Bombay Municipal Corporation <lb/>&amp; Ors., [1985] 3 SCC 545 and Bombay Hawkers&apos; Union &amp; <lb/>Ors. v. Bombay Municipal Corporation &amp; Ors., [1985] 3 SCC <lb/>528. We are afraid, we cannot permit the question to be raised <lb/>for two reasons. In the first place, no such point was taken in <lb/>the writ petition nor any contention advanced before the High <lb/>Court that the removal of the illegal encroachment by the <lb/>Municipal Corporation constitutes a threat to life and liberty <lb/>guaranteed under Art. 21 of the Constitution or that the right to <lb/>life includes a right to livelihood. Secondly, the rights of the <lb/>parties now stand crystallized by the aforementioned judgment <lb/>of the learned Subordinate Judge in the suit brought by the <lb/>respondent, and the rights have to be worked out in terms of <lb/>the decree passed by him which has since become final. <lb/>Besides, the decision in Olga Tellis is of little avail. <lb/>Chandrachud, CJ. speaking for the Constitution Bench <lb/>observed that the word &apos;life&apos; in Art. 21 included livelihood, but <lb/>upheld the validity of ss. 313(1) and 314 of the Bombay <lb/>Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 which provided that the <lb/>Commissioner may &apos;without notice, cause to be removed&apos; <lb/>obstructions as an encroachment on footpaths could not be <lb/>regarded as unreasonable, unfair or unjust. The learned Chief <lb/>Justice however said that the section conferred a discretionary <lb/>power which like all power must be exercised reasonably and <lb/>in conformity with the provisions of our Constitution. In <lb/>Bombay Hawkers&apos; Union, Chandrachud, CJ. speaking for <lb/>himself and one of us (Sen, J.) held that the impugned <lb/>provision was in the nature of a reasonable restriction in the <lb/>interests of the general public, on the exercise of the right of <lb/>hawkers to carry on their trade or business. ...&quot; <lb/>(vi) State of U.P. and another vs. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and <lb/>another, reported in (1991) 4 SCC 139 : <lb/></body>

			<body>&quot;41.... In Lancaster Motor Company (London) Ltd. v. <lb/>Bremith Ltd., [1941] IKB 675 the Court did not feel bound by <lb/>earlier decision as it was rendered &apos;without any argument, <lb/>without reference to the crucial words of the rule and without <lb/>any citation of the authority&apos;. It was approved by this Court in <lb/>Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Gumam Kaur, [1989] 1 <lb/>SCC 101. The Bench held that, &apos;precedents sub-silentio and <lb/>without argument are of no moment&apos;. The Courts thus have <lb/>taken recourse to this principle for relieving from injustice <lb/>perperated by unjust precedents. A decision which is not <lb/>express and is not founded on reasons nor it proceeds on <lb/>consideration of issue cannot be deemed to be a law declared <lb/>to have a binding effect as is contem-plated by Article 141. <lb/>Uniformity and consistency are core of judicial discipline. But <lb/>that which escapes in the judg-ment without any occasion is <lb/>not ratio decedendi. In Shama Rao v. State of Pondicherry, <lb/>AIR 1967 SC 1680 it was ob-served, &apos;it is trite to say that a <lb/>decision is binding not because of its conclusions but in regard <lb/>to its ratio and the principles, laid down therein&apos;. Any <lb/>declaration or conclusion arrived without application of mind <lb/>or preceded without any reason cannot be deemed to be <lb/>declaration of law or authority of a general nature binding as a <lb/>precedent. Restraint in dissenting or overruling is for sake of <lb/>stabil-ity and uniformity but rigidity beyond reasonable limits <lb/>is inimical to the growth of law.&quot; <lb/>(vii) R.Abdul Jabbar and 5 others vs. The State of Tamil Nadu and 4 <lb/>others, reported in 1996 (II) CTC 719 : <lb/>&quot;15. It is plain that the Government need not acquire its <lb/>own lands, and the Government was not competent in the <lb/>proceedings under the Land acquired, denying compensation <lb/>to the persons entitled, having issued notifications specifying <lb/>the lands and the names of owners/occupiers/persons <lb/>interested. <lb/>Thus, under the circumstances, I have not <lb/>hesitation to hold that whenever the Government waives to <lb/>avail or invoke the condition of the grant or assignment, that a <lb/>grantee or asignee will surrender lands whenever required by <lb/>the Government without claiming compensation, and initiates <lb/>proceedings for compulsory acquisition of such lands under <lb/>the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, treating such lands <lb/>as not belonging to itself, but to others, is under an obligation <lb/>to pay compensation as provided in the Act. Viewed in any <lb/></body>

			<body>way, the petitioners are entitled to succeed.&quot; <lb/>(viii) Amit Das vs. State of Bihar, reported in AIR 2000 SC 2264 (1) : <lb/>&quot;13. Under Section 18, when any person accused of a <lb/>bailable or non-bailable offence and apparently a juvenile is <lb/>arrested or detained or appears or is brought before a Juvenile <lb/>Court, such person shall, notwithstanding anything contained <lb/>in the Code of Criminal Procedure, or in any other law for the <lb/>time being in force, be released on bail with or without surety <lb/>unless there appears reasonable grounds for believing that the <lb/>release is likely to bring him in association with any known <lb/>criminal or expose him to moral danger or that his release <lb/>would defeat the ends of justice. In the latter case, the person <lb/>has to be kept in an observation home or a place of safety until <lb/>he can be brought before a Juvenile Court. The Juvenile Court <lb/>if not releasing the person on bail must not commit him to <lb/>prison but send him to an observation home or a place of safety <lb/>during the pendency of the enquiry before him. Under Section <lb/>20, where a juvenile charged with an offence appears or is <lb/>produced before a Juvenile Court, the Juvenile Court shall hold <lb/>an enquiry in accordance with the provisions of Section 39. A <lb/>reading of all these provisions referred to herein above makes <lb/>it very clear that an enquiry as to the age of the juvenile has to <lb/>be made only when he is brought or appears before the <lb/>competent authority. A Police Officer or a Magistrate who is <lb/>not empowered to act or cannot act as a competent authority <lb/>has to merely form an opinion guided by the apparent age of <lb/>the person and in the event of forming an opinion that he is a <lb/>juvenile, he has to forward him to the competent authority at <lb/>the earliest subject to arrangements for keeping in custody and <lb/>safety of the person having been made for the duration of time <lb/>elapsing in between. The competent authority shall proceed to <lb/>hold enquiry as to the age of that person for determining the <lb/>same by reference to the date of the appearance of the person <lb/>before it or by reference to the date when person was brought <lb/>before it under any of the provisions of the Act. It is irrelevant <lb/>what was the age of the person on the date of commission of <lb/>the offence. Any other interpretation would not fit in the <lb/>scheme and phraseology employed by the Parliament in <lb/>drafting the Act.&quot; <lb/>(ix) M/s.A-One Granites vs. State of U.P. and others, reported in AIR <lb/></body>

			<page>23 <lb/></page>

			<body>2001 SC 1203: <lb/>&quot;10. The first question which falls for consideration of <lb/>this Court is as to whether the question regarding applicability <lb/>of rule 72 of the Rules in relation to the present lease is <lb/>concluded by the earlier decision of this Court rendered in <lb/>Prem Nath Sharma vs. State of U.P. &amp; Anr., (1997) 4 SCC <lb/>552. From a bare perusal of the said judgment of this <lb/>Court it would be clear that the question as to whether rule 72 <lb/>was applicable or not was never canvassed before this Court <lb/>and the only question which was considered was whether there <lb/>was violation of the said rule. <lb/>11. This question was considered by the Court of Appeal in <lb/>Lancaster Motor Co. (London) Ltd. vs. Bremith Ltd., (1941) 1 <lb/>KB 675, and it was laid down that when no consideration was <lb/>given to the question, the decision cannot be said to be binding <lb/>and precedents sub silentio and without arguments are of no <lb/>moment. Following the said decision, this Court in the case of <lb/>Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Gurnam Kaur, 1989 (1) <lb/>SCC 101 observed thus:-<lb/>In Gerard v. Worth of Paris Ltd.(k), (1936) 2 All ER 905 <lb/>(CA), the only point argued was on the question of priority of <lb/>the claimants debt, and, on this argument being heard, the <lb/>court granted the order. No consideration was given to the <lb/>question whether a garnishee order could properly be made on <lb/>an account standing in the name of the liquidator. When, <lb/>therefore, this very point was argued in a subsequent case <lb/>before the Court of Appeal in Lancaster Motor Co. (London) <lb/>Ltd. v. Bremith Ltd., (1941) 1 KB 675, the court held itself not <lb/>bound by its previous decision. Sir Wilfrid Greene, M.R., said <lb/>that he could not help thinking that the point now raised had <lb/>been deliberately passed sub silentio by counsel in order that <lb/>the point of substance might be decided. He went on to say that <lb/>the point had to be decided by the earlier court before it could <lb/>make the order which it did; nevertheless, since it was decided <lb/>without argument, without reference to the crucial words of the <lb/>rule, and without any citation of authority, it was not binding <lb/>and would not be followed. Precedents sub silentio and <lb/>without argument are of no moment. This rule has ever since <lb/>been followed. <lb/>In State of U.P. &amp; Anr. vs. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. &amp; <lb/></body>

			<page>24 <lb/></page>

			<body>Anr., (1991) 4 SCC 139, reiterating the same view, this Court <lb/>laid down that such a decision cannot be deemed to be a law <lb/>declared to have binding effect as is contemplated by Article <lb/>141 of the Constitution of India and observed thus: <lb/>A decision which is not express and is not founded on reasons <lb/>nor it proceeds on consideration of issue cannot be deemed to <lb/>be a law declared to have a binding effect as is contemplated <lb/>by Article 141. <lb/>In the case of Arnit Das vs. State of Bihar, 2000 (5) SCC 488, <lb/>while examining the binding effect of such a decision, this <lb/>Court observed thus:-<lb/>A decision not expressed, not accompanied by reasons and not <lb/>proceeding on a conscious consideration of an issue cannot be <lb/>deemed to be a law declared to have a binding effect as is <lb/>contemplated by Article 141. That which has escaped in the <lb/>judgment is not the ratio decidendi. This is the rule of sub <lb/>silentio, in the technical sense when a particular point of law <lb/>was not consciously determined. <lb/>12. Thus we have no difficulty in holding that as the <lb/>question regarding applicability of rule 72 of the Rules having <lb/>not been even referred to, much less considered by this Court <lb/>in the earlier appeals, it cannot be said that the point is <lb/>concluded by the same and no longer res integra and <lb/>accordingly this Court is called upon to decide the same.&quot; <lb/>(x) Achaldas Durgaji Oswal (dead) through L.Rs. vs. Ramvilas <lb/>Gangabisan Hoda (dead) through L.Rs. And others, reported in (2003) 2 MLJ 1 <lb/>(SC): <lb/>&quot;Order XXXIV Rules 7 and 8 do not confer any right <lb/>upon the usufructuary mortgagee to apply for final decree <lb/>which is conferred on mortgagee on other types of mortgages. <lb/>By reason of sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of Order XXXIV, a <lb/>mortgagor is entitled to make an application for final decree at <lb/>any time before a final decree debarring the plaintiff from all <lb/>right to redeem the mortgaged property has been passed or <lb/></body>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>before the confirmation of a sale held in pursuance of a final <lb/>decree passed under sub-rule (3) of this rule. No such <lb/>application is again contemplated at the instance of the <lb/>usufructuary mortgagee. By reason of sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of <lb/>Order XXXIV, a right of redemption is conferred upon the <lb/>mortgagor of a usufructuary mortgage. Such a provision has <lb/>been made evidently having regard to the right of redemption <lb/>of a mortgagor in terms of Section 60 of the Transfer of <lb/>Property Act and further having regard to the fact that a <lb/>usufructuary mortgagee would be entitled to possess the <lb/>property in question till a final decree of redemption is passed. <lb/>25. A bare perusal of the provisions of Order XXXIV <lb/>Rule 7 &amp; 8 would show that despite failure to pay the amount <lb/>found or declared due by the preliminary decree on or before <lb/>the date fixed by the Court, the mortgagee-defendant shall be <lb/>entitled to apply for a final decree under clause c(ii) of rule 7 <lb/>of Order XXXIV. In a case of a mortgage by conditional sale <lb/>or anomalous mortgage, the mortgagee can pray for passing of <lb/>a final decree debaring the mortgagor from claiming his right <lb/>to redeem the properly. In a case of a usufructuary mortgage, <lb/>however, the mortgagee is not entitled to apply for a final <lb/>decree. The right of mortgagee to apply for a final decree is <lb/>provided in sub-clause (3) of rule 8 of Order XXXIV. His <lb/>application for a final decree must be confined to for <lb/>declaration that the plaintiff and all persons claiming under <lb/>him are debarred from all right to redeem the property in the <lb/>case of a mortgage by a conditional sale or of an anomalous <lb/>mortgage the terms whereof provide for foreclosure only and <lb/>not for sale. In the case of the mortgage other than <lb/>usufructuary mortgage, the mortgagee can file an application to <lb/>pass a final decree that the mortgaged property or a sufficient <lb/>part thereof be sold, and the proceeds thereof be paid into <lb/>Court and applied in payment of what is found due to the <lb/>defendant, and the balance, if any, be paid to the plaintiff or <lb/>other persons entitled to receive the same. Sub-rule (1) of Rule <lb/>8 shows that only a mortgagor can apply to the Court to pass a <lb/>final decree on payment of the amount found or declared due <lb/>under the preliminary decree on making this deposit and upon <lb/>filing the application as provided for in sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 <lb/>the mortgagor can request the Court to order the mortgagee to <lb/>put him in possession of the properties which were the subject <lb/>matter of the mortgage. The amount determined by the Court <lb/>which the mortgagor is liable to pay to the mortgagee can be <lb/>deposited before the right of redeem is lost. It may be noticed <lb/></body>

			<page>26 <lb/></page>

			<body>that even sub-rule (2) of Rule 7 of Order XXXIV does not <lb/>apply to the usufructuary mortgage. It may be noticed that by <lb/>reason of the amendment introduced in 1929 the right <lb/>conferred earlier on a usufructuary mortgage to bring the <lb/>property to sale in case of the mortgagor not making the <lb/>payment within the time fixed in the decree was taken away; <lb/>As sub-rule (2) of Rule 7 is applicable only in a case of <lb/>mortgages other than the usufructuary mortgages, a <lb/>usufructuary mortgagor is not entitled to seek extension of <lb/>time and in that view of the matter the fact that such an <lb/>application made by the First Respondent herein was rejected <lb/>becomes irrelevant. <lb/>43. In the said case, the contentions raised herein had not <lb/>been raised obviously because no such question arose for <lb/>consideration and any passing observation made therein <lb/>without any argument and without any precedent cannot be <lb/>treated to be a declaration of law in terms of Article 141 of the <lb/>Constitution of India. <lb/>44. Any observation made therein contrary to what we <lb/>have held above cannot be said to be good law and is hereby <lb/>overruled.&quot; <lb/>(xi) Land Acquisition Officer-cum-R.D.O., Chevella Division, <lb/>Hyderabad and others, reported in 2004 (3) CTC 19 : <lb/>&quot;100. The deprivation of the assignee&apos;s right to <lb/>payment of just compensation equivalent to the market value <lb/>of the assigned land may amount to deprivation of right to <lb/>livelihood. The denial of constitutional claim to receive just <lb/>compensation after depriving the assignee of his land is <lb/>impermissible except pursuant to a constitutionally valid rule <lb/>or law. <lb/>104. Therefore, notwithstanding the fact that the <lb/>recipients had accepted the assignment subject to &apos;no <lb/>compensation clause&apos; and that they will not object to the <lb/>resumption of the assigned lands for a &quot;public purpose, they <lb/>are entitled to assert that any such action on the part of the <lb/>authorities will be in violation of their guaranteed fundamental <lb/>rights. How far the argument regarding the existence and scope <lb/>of the right claimed by the recipients is well-founded is another <lb/>matter. But, the argument has to be examined despite the <lb/>concession. <lb/></body>

			<body>105. In the matter of distribution of material resources of <lb/>the community to the vulnerable sections of the society by the <lb/>State in furtherance of its constitutional obligations no <lb/>argument can be heard from the State contending that the <lb/>recipient of the benefit may either accept with the restrictions <lb/>or not to accept the benefit at all. The whole idea of <lb/>distributive justice is to empower the weaker sections of the <lb/>society and to provide them their share of cake in the material <lb/>resources of the community of which they were deprived from <lb/>times immemorial for no fault of theirs. Having resolved to <lb/>extend the benefits as a welfare measure, no unconstitutional <lb/>condition can be imposed depriving the recipients of the <lb/>benefits of their legitimate right to get compensation in case of <lb/>taking over of the benefit even for a valid public purpose. The <lb/>recipients cannot be at the mercy of the State forever. <lb/>108. Be it noted, the land by way of assignment is let for <lb/>purposes of agriculture or for purposes ancillary thereto, for <lb/>personal occupation and cultivation by the agricultural <lb/>labourers and others belonging to weaker sections of the <lb/>society. It may be lawful for the State to acquire any portion of <lb/>such land as is within the ceiling limit but not without <lb/>providing for compensation at a rate which shall not be less <lb/>than the market value thereof. The acquisition of such land <lb/>even for a public purpose without payment of compensation <lb/>shall be in the teeth of Article 31-A of the Constitution of <lb/>India. <lb/>110. In the result, we hold that &apos;no compensation&apos; clause, <lb/>restricting the right of the assignees to claim full compensation <lb/>in respect of the land resumed equivalent to the market value <lb/>of the land, is unconstitutional. The &apos;no compensation clause&apos; <lb/>infringes the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14 and <lb/>31-A of the Constitution. We are conscious that Article 21 <lb/>essentially deals with personal liberty. But in cases where <lb/>deprivation of property would lead to deprivation of life or <lb/>liberty or livelihood, Article 21 springs into action and any <lb/>such deprivation without just payment of compensation <lb/>amounts to infringement of the right guaranteed thereunder. <lb/>The doctrine of &apos;unconstitutional conditions&apos; applies in all its <lb/>force. <lb/>111. In the circumstances, we hold that the assignees of <lb/></body>

			<page>28 <lb/></page>

			<body>the Government lands are entitled to payment of compensation <lb/>equivalent to the full market value of the land and other <lb/>benefits on par with full owners of the land even in cases <lb/>where the assigned lands are taken possession of by the State <lb/>in accordance with the terms of grant or patta, though such <lb/>resumption is for a public purpose. We further hold that even <lb/>in cases where the State does not invoke the covenant of the <lb/>grant or patta to resume the land for such public purpose and <lb/>resorts to acquisition of the land under the provisions of the <lb/>Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the assignees shall be entitled to <lb/>compensation as owners of the land and for all other <lb/>consequential benefits under the provisions of the Land <lb/>Acquisition Act, 1894. No condition incorporated in patta/deed <lb/>of assignment shall operate as a clog putting any restriction on <lb/>the right of the assignee to claim full compensation as owner <lb/>of the land. <lb/>112. In such view of ours, the view taken by this Court in <lb/>Bondapalli Sanyasi (supra) that whenever the land is taken <lb/>possession of by the State invoking the terms of the grant, the <lb/>right of an assignee to any compensation may have to be <lb/>determined in accordance with the conditions in patta itself is <lb/>unsustainable. With due respect, we are unable to agree with <lb/>the view taken in this regard. We are also unable to agree with <lb/>the view taken that the assignee shall be entitled to <lb/>compensation in terms of the Land Acquisition Act not as <lb/>owner but as an interested person for the interest he held in the <lb/>property.&quot; <lb/>(xii) Chairman, Indore Vikas Pradhikaran vs. M/s. Pure Industrial Cock <lb/>&amp; Chemicals Ltd. &amp; Others, reported in AIR 2007 SC 2458 : <lb/>&quot;114. The question again came up for consideration in <lb/>Howrah Municipal Corpn. v. Ganges Rope Co. Ltd. [(2004) 1 <lb/>SCC 663], wherein this Court categorically held : <lb/>&quot;The context in which the respondent Company claims a <lb/>vested right for sanction and which has been accepted by the <lb/>Division Bench of the High Court, is not a right in relation to <lb/>ownership or possession of any property for which the <lb/>expression vest is generally used. What we can understand <lb/>from the claim of a vested right set up by the respondent <lb/></body>

			<page>29 <lb/></page>

			<body>Company is that on the basis of the Building Rules, as <lb/>applicable to their case on the date of making an application <lb/>for sanction and the fixed period allotted by the Court for its <lb/>consideration, it had a legitimate or settled expectation to <lb/>obtain the sanction. In our considered opinion, such settled <lb/>expectation, if any, did not create any vested right to obtain <lb/>sanction. True it is, that the respondent Company which can <lb/>have no control over the manner of processing of application <lb/>for sanction by the Corporation cannot be blamed for delay but <lb/>during pendency of its application for sanction, if the State <lb/>Government, in exercise of its rule-making power, amended <lb/>the Building Rules and imposed restrictions on the heights of <lb/>buildings on G.T. Road and other wards, such settled <lb/>expectation has been rendered impossible of fulfilment due to <lb/>change in law. The claim based on the alleged vested right or <lb/>settled expectation cannot be set up against statutory <lb/>provisions which were brought into force by the State <lb/>Government by amending the Building Rules and not by the <lb/>Corporation against whom such vested right or settled <lb/>expectation is being sought to be enforced. The vested right or <lb/>settled expectation has been nullified not only by the <lb/>Corporation but also by the State by amending the Building <lb/>Rules. Besides this, such a settled expectation or the so-called <lb/>vested right cannot be countenanced against public interest and <lb/>convenience which are sought to be served by amendment of <lb/>the Building Rules and the resolution of the Corporation issued <lb/>thereupon.&quot; <lb/>(xiii) Pradeep Oil Corporation vs. Municipal Corporation of Delhi and <lb/>another, reported in (2011) 5 SCC 270: <lb/>&quot;41. It is well settled legal position that a license can be <lb/>revoked at any time at the pleasure of the licensor. Even <lb/>otherwise, unless the parties to the agreement had an intention <lb/>to enter into a deed of lease the Administration would not have <lb/>agreed to demise the premises on payment of rent in lieu of <lb/>grant of exclusive possession of the demised land and further <lb/>stipulated service of three months&apos; notice calling upon either <lb/>party to terminate the agreement. In view of the same, the <lb/>argument advanced by the learned counsel of the appellant that <lb/>a stipulation having been made in the agreement itself that by <lb/>reasons thereof the grantee shall not be a tenant and thus the <lb/>deed must be construed to be a license cannot be accepted. In <lb/></body>

			<page>30 <lb/></page>

			<body>our considered view, such a clause may at best be one of the <lb/>factors for construction of the document in question but the <lb/>same by itself certainly be a decisive factor.&quot; <lb/>(xiv) Azim Ahmad Kazmi and others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and <lb/>another, reported in (2012) 7 SCC 278 : <lb/>&quot;30. In State of U.P. vs. Zahoor Ahmad, this Court held <lb/>that Section 3 of the Act declares the unfettered discretion of <lb/>the Government to impose such conditions and limitations as it <lb/>thinks fit, no matter what the general law of the land be. From <lb/>Clause 3(C) of the deed, it is clear that the State of U.P. While <lb/>granting lease made it clear that if the demised premises are at <lb/>any time required by the lessor for his or for any public <lb/>purpose, he shall have the right to give one month&apos;s clear <lb/>notice to the lessee to remove any building standing at the time <lb/>on the demised property and within two months of the receipt <lb/>of the notice to take possession thereof on the expiry of that <lb/>period subject to the condition that if the lessor is willing to <lb/>purchase the property on the demises premises, the lessees <lb/>shall be paid for such building such amount as may be <lb/>determined by the Secretary to the Government of U.P. In the <lb/>Nagar Awas Department.&quot; <lb/>12. Mr.R.Natarajan, learned counsel appearing for the appellant in <lb/>W.A.No.2510 of 2013, would submit that the appellant is one of the <lb/>descendants in the family of Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar and was appointed <lb/>as a co-Trustee by this Hon&apos;ble Court vide order dated 05.06.2000 in <lb/>O.S.A.Nos.66 and 67 of 2000. The Government, vide G.O.Ms.No.534 dated <lb/>06.08.1888, had allotted a piece of land measuring an extent of 1.33 acres, <lb/>comprised in T.S.No.41, Vepery Village, Fort-Tondiarpet Taluk valued at <lb/>Rs.3,638/-at free of cost solely for the purpose of construction of choultry, <lb/>failing which, the said grant of land would be liable for resumption. The <lb/>choultry building so constructed has been classified as a historical and heritage <lb/></body>

			<page>31 <lb/></page>

			<body>building by the High Power Heritage Committee under orders of this Court and <lb/>subsequently, a direction was issued by this Court to the Heritage Conservation <lb/>Committee to issue notice to all occupants of the building so as to preserve and <lb/>maintain such buildings without causing any damage to them, thereby also <lb/>cautioning the appellant to ensure safety of the heritage building. He would <lb/>further submit that the protection of ancient monuments has to be necessarily <lb/>kept in mind while carrying out developmental activities. The need for ensuring <lb/>protection and preservation of ancient monuments for the benefit of future <lb/>generations has to be balanced with benefits which may accrue from mining <lb/>and other development-related activities. The appellant has also submitted a <lb/>claim to the Government for maintenance and preservation of temples and the <lb/>statue of Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar, but there was no direct consideration <lb/>of the claim of the appellant, instead, it was simply stated that CMRL has <lb/>committed to preserve the heritage building as per the meeting of Heritage <lb/>Committee held on 17.02.2012. It is indeed regrettable to note that the <lb/>Heritage Committee has only directed CMRL to ensure as to the non-hindrance <lb/>of the view of Central Railway Station, which falls in the proximity of the <lb/>proposed station area. The learned counsel would also argue that on an earlier <lb/>occasion, CMRL filed an affidavit before the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in <lb/>O.S.A.Nos.100 and 101 of 2011, stating its inability to plan setting up of <lb/>underground metro station in lands, where Hotel Picnic was situated thereon. <lb/>Therefore, it is crystal clear that there was no discussion regarding resumption <lb/></body>

			<page>32 <lb/></page>

			<body>of Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar Choultry located in T.S.No.41. Moreover, <lb/>the founder Trustee had invested a sum of Rs.30,000/-in the year 1888 itself <lb/>towards construction of choultry in the grant land, which is under the <lb/>management and control of this Court as per the Official Trustee Act, 1913. <lb/>According to Section 10 (2) of the said Act, the Official Trustee has to take <lb/>periodical directions and orders from this Court as required under Section 25 <lb/>thereof. <lb/>13. Further, according to the learned counsel, even in matters of transfer <lb/>of Trust property, as per the mandate of Section 29 of the Official Trustee Act, <lb/>this Court alone is vested with the authority of ordering transfer of the Trust <lb/>property. All these provisions of law have been completely breached and <lb/>smashed by the Government under the arbitrary assumption to the effect that, it <lb/>has its own authority and power to resume the Trust property of Rajah Sir <lb/>Ramasamy Mudaliar without reference to this Court. Hence, the only course <lb/>available to the State is to either move this Court under Section 25 of the <lb/>Official Trustees Act or under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, that <lb/>the Government has no power to intrude or invade the right of the founder <lb/>Trustee and that the encumbrance existing in T.S.No.41 cannot be ignored by <lb/>the State. Thus, it is prayed by the learned counsel for the appellant that the <lb/>impugned order passed in W.P.No.28461 of 2013 is liable to be set aside in <lb/>view of the reason that encumbrance exists in the subject property, which <lb/>debars the 1 st respondent from adopting the measure of resumption and the legal <lb/></body>

			<page>33 <lb/></page>

			<body>encumbrance confers possessory rights and title upon Rajah Sir Ramasamy <lb/>Mudaliar Choultry, which has to be addressed and redressed in the manner <lb/>specified under the scheme of Land Acquisition Act. <lb/>14. In support of his case, Mr.R.Natarajan, learned counsel, has relied on <lb/>the following decisions: <lb/>(i) Bachan Singh vs. State of Punjab etc Batch, reported in (1982) 3 SCC <lb/>24 : <lb/>&quot;18. It will thus be seen that the rule of law has much <lb/>greater vitality under our Constitution than it has in other <lb/>countries like the United Kingdom which has no <lb/>constitutionally enacted fundamental rights. The rule of law has <lb/>really three basic and fundamental assumptions; one is that law <lb/>law-making must be essentially in the hands of a <lb/>democratically elected legislature, subject of course to any <lb/>power in the executive in an emergent situation to promulgate <lb/>ordinances effective for a short duration while the legislature is <lb/>not in session as also to enact delegated legislation in <lb/>accordance with the guidelines laid down by the legislature; the <lb/>other is that, even in the hands of a democratically elected <lb/>legislature, there should not be unfettered legislative power, <lb/>for, as Jefferson said: &quot;Let no man be trusted with power but tie <lb/>him down from making mischief by the chains of the <lb/>Constitution&quot;; and lastly there must be an independent judiciary <lb/>to protect the citizen against excesses of executive and <lb/>legislative power. Fortunately, whatever uncharitable and <lb/>irresponsible critics might say when they find a decision of the <lb/>court going against the view held by them, we can confidently <lb/>assert that we have in our country all these three elements <lb/>essential to the rule of law. It is plain and indisputable that <lb/>under our Constitution law cannot be arbitrary or irrational and <lb/>if it is, it would be clearly invalid, whether under Article 14 or <lb/>Article 19 or Article 21, whichever be applicable.&quot; <lb/>(ii) Amba Bai and Others vs. Gopal and other, reported in (2001) 5 SCC <lb/>570 : <lb/></body>

			<page>34 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;11. If the Judgement or order of an inferior Court is <lb/>subjected to an appeal or revision by the superior court and in <lb/>such proceeedings the order or judgment is passed by the <lb/>superior court determining the rights of parties, it would <lb/>supersede the order or judgment passed by the inferior court. <lb/>The juristic justification for such doctrine of merger is based <lb/>on the common law principle that there cannot be, at one and <lb/>the same time, more than one operative order governing the <lb/>subject matter and the judgment of the inferior court is deemed <lb/>to lose its identity and merges with the judgment of the <lb/>superior court. In the course of time, this concept which was <lb/>originally restricted to appellate decrees on the ground that an <lb/>appeal is continuation of the suit, came to be gradually <lb/>extended to other proceedings like Revisions and even the <lb/>proceedings before quasi-judicial and executive authorities. <lb/>(iii) Saraswati Devi (Dead) By Lr. vs. Delhi Development Authority and <lb/>others, reported in (2013) 3 SCC 571: <lb/>&quot;34. What is the effect of provisional possession <lb/>which was given to the appellants husband in 1960 on <lb/>approval of his highest bid? Does it amount to creation of <lb/>an encumbrance in the property? If the provisional <lb/>possession given to the appellant&apos;s husband amounted to <lb/>creation of an encumbrance, whether the said property could <lb/>have been acquired under the LA Act although the <lb/>ownership vested in the central government? The fate of the <lb/>appeal significantly will depend upon answer to these <lb/>questions. <lb/>39. In M. Ratanchand Chordia &amp; Ors. v. Kasim <lb/>Khaleeli, a Division Bench of the Madras High Court had <lb/>an occasion to consider the meaning of the word <lb/>&quot;encumbrances&quot; with reference to the 1954 Act and the LA <lb/>Act in the context of the easemantary right of way. The <lb/>Division Bench considered the word &quot;encumbrances&quot; thus : <lb/>(AIR p.215, para 18) <lb/>&quot;18. The word &quot;Encumbrances&quot; in regard to a <lb/>person or an estate denotes a burden which <lb/>ordinarily consists of debts, obligations and <lb/>responsibilities. In the sphere of law it connotes a <lb/></body>

			<page>35 <lb/></page>

			<body>liability attached to the property arising out of a <lb/>claim or lien subsisting in favour of a person who is <lb/>not the owner of the property. Thus a mortgage, a <lb/>charge and vendor&apos;s lien are all instances of <lb/>encumbrances. The essence of an encumbrance is <lb/>that it must bear upon the property directly and in-<lb/>directly and not remotely or circuitously. It is a right <lb/>in realiena circumscribing and subtracting from the <lb/>general proprietary right of another person. An <lb/>encumbered right, that is a right subject to a <lb/>limitation, is called servient while the encumbrance <lb/>itself is designated as dominant&quot; <lb/>41. It is well known in law that a person in <lb/>possession of the property though not owner -is entitled to <lb/>certain rights by virtue of his possession alone. We are in <lb/>agreement with the view of the Punjab High Court in <lb/>Roshan Lal Goswami that an auction-purchaser on <lb/>provisional possession being given to him possesses <lb/>possessory rights, though he does not have proprietary <lb/>rights in the auctioned property. Thus, there remains no <lb/>doubt that in October, 1960 or near about encumbrance in <lb/>the subject property came to be created. <lb/>42. The next question is whether on creation of an <lb/>encumbrance, the subject property could have been acquired <lb/>under the LA Act although the ownership in the land vested <lb/>in the central government. Ordinarily, when the government <lb/>possesses an interest in land, which is the subject of <lb/>acquisition under the LA Act, that interest is outside such <lb/>acquisition because there can be no question of the <lb/>government acquiring what is its own. This is what this <lb/>Court said in Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri13 but this rule is <lb/>not without an exception. There is no impediment in <lb/>acquisition of land owned by the central government by <lb/>invoking the provisions of the LA Act where such land is <lb/>encumbered or where in respect of the land owned by the <lb/>government some private interest has been created. As a <lb/>matter of fact, Sharda Devi11 does not hold to the contrary. <lb/>It is so because what Sharda Devi holds is this : the <lb/>acquisition of land wherein the ownership or the entirety of <lb/>rights already vested in the State on which there are no <lb/>private rights or encumbrance such land is beyond the <lb/></body>

			<page>36 <lb/></page>

			<body>purview of the LA Act. In other words, if the government <lb/>has complete ownership or the entirety of rights in the <lb/>property with it, such land cannot be acquired by the <lb/>government by invoking its power of acquisition under the <lb/>LA Act but if some private rights have been created in such <lb/>property or the property has encumbrance(s), the acquisition <lb/>of such land is not beyond the pale of the LA Act. <lb/>43. Madan Lal Nangia has been relied upon by the <lb/>Division Bench in the impugned order in upsetting the <lb/>decision of the Single Judge. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned <lb/>senior counsel for the appellant sought to distinguish this <lb/>judgment. He submitted that Madan Lal Nangia was a case <lb/>where this Court was concerned with the properties which <lb/>vested in the custodian and having regard to this aspect, this <lb/>Court said that merely because the properties vest in the <lb/>custodian as an evacuee property it does not mean that the <lb/>same cannot be acquired for some other purpose. <lb/>44. It is true that facts in Madan Lal Nangia were <lb/>little different but, in our view, the legal position <lb/>highlighted therein does not become inapplicable to the <lb/>present case on that ground. In paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 of <lb/>the Report (Pgs. 334-335), this Court observed as follows: <lb/>(SCC pp.334-35) <lb/>&quot;16. A property is a composite property <lb/>because a private party has an interest in that <lb/>property. The scheme of separation, to be framed <lb/>under Section 10 of the Evacuee Interest <lb/>(Separation) Act, is for the purpose of separating the <lb/>interest of the evacuee from that of the private party. <lb/>Therefore, even if the evacuee&apos;s interest was <lb/>acquired under Section 12, the interest of the private <lb/>person could have been acquired under the Land <lb/>Acquisition Act. Further, if the land stood acquired <lb/>by the notification dated 7-7-1955 then the question <lb/>would arise as to how the respondents acquired title <lb/>to these lands. If they purchased after the date of <lb/>notification dated 7-7-1955, they would get no title. <lb/>They then would not be able to maintain the writ <lb/>petition. Dr Dhavan submitted that the appellants <lb/>had admitted the title of the respondents and thus <lb/>this question would not arise. We are unable to <lb/></body>

			<page>37 <lb/></page>

			<body>accept the submission. It is only a person who has <lb/>an interest in the land who can challenge <lb/>acquisition. When a challenge is made to an <lb/>acquisition at a belated stage, then even if the court <lb/>is inclined to allow such a belated challenge, it must <lb/>first satisfy itself that the person challenging <lb/>acquisition has title to the land. Very significantly, <lb/>in their writ petition the respondents do not state <lb/>when they acquired title. <lb/>17. Undoubtedly, the evacuee properties <lb/>vested in the Custodian for the purposes of <lb/>distribution as per the provisions of the various <lb/>Acts. However, it is to be noted that under the <lb/>various Acts in lieu of properties, compensation in <lb/>terms of money can also be paid. Thus, merely <lb/>because the properties vest in the Custodian as <lb/>evacuee properties does not mean that the same <lb/>cannot be acquired for some other public purpose.... <lb/>18. It would be open to the Government to <lb/>acquire evacuee property and give to the Custodian <lb/>compensation for such acquisition. Section 4 <lb/>notification dated 23-1-1965 not having excluded <lb/>evacuee properties the respondents can get no <lb/>benefit from the fact that in the 1959 notification <lb/>evacuee properties had been excluded.&quot; <lb/>45.1.(i) At the time of acquisition of evacuee property <lb/>under Section 12 of the 1954 Act if such property has <lb/>interest of a private person, the interest of private person <lb/>can be acquired under the LA Act even though the land is <lb/>owned by the government. <lb/>46. What follows from proposition (i) is also this that <lb/>after the acquisition of evacuee property under Section 12, <lb/>if any encumbrance is created or interest of a private person <lb/>intervenes therein, such land even if owned by the <lb/>government can be acquired under the LA Act. This is in <lb/>congruity and consonance with Sharda Devi as well.&quot; <lb/>(iv) K.Guruprasad Rao vs. State of Karnataka and others, reported in <lb/>(2013) 8 SCC 418 : <lb/>&quot;94. In our view, the detailed reasons recorded by the <lb/></body>

			<page>38 <lb/></page>

			<body>Committee, which have been extracted hereinabove, for not <lb/>accepting the recommendations of the expert bodies about <lb/>the distance up to which mining should not be allowed are <lb/>correct and those recommendations cannot be relied upon <lb/>for accepting the argument of the learned counsel for the <lb/>State and the private respondents that the recommendations <lb/>made by the Committee should be rejected. We may hasten <lb/>to add that the Committee&apos;s recommendations are not in <lb/>conflict with the provisions of the 1957 Act and the Rules <lb/>framed thereunder. The 1959 Rules and the Karnataka <lb/>Rules provide for grant of permission/licence for mining in <lb/>the prohibited/regulated/protected area but the documents <lb/>produced before this Court do not show that the competent <lb/>authority had granted permission/licence to any of the <lb/>private respondents for undertaking mining operations <lb/>which have the effect of damaging the temple in question. <lb/>That apart, the distance criteria prescribed in the 1958 Act, <lb/>the Karnataka Act and the Rules framed thereunder has <lb/>little or no bearing on deciding the question of restricting <lb/>the mining operations near the protected monument which <lb/>has already suffered extensive damage due to such <lb/>operations. <lb/>98. When seen in this light, the protection of ancient <lb/>monuments has necessarily to be kept in mind while <lb/>carrying out development activities. The need for ensuring <lb/>protection and preservation of the ancient monuments for <lb/>the benefit of future generations has to be balanced with the <lb/>benefits which may accrue from mining and other <lb/>development related activities. In our view, the <lb/>recommendations and suggestions made by the Committee <lb/>for creation of Core Zone and Buffer Zone appropriately <lb/>create this balance. While mining activity is sure to create <lb/>financial wealth for the leaseholders and also the State, the <lb/>immense cultural and historic wealth, not to mention the <lb/>wealth of information which the temple provides cannot be <lb/>ignored and every effort has to be made to protect the <lb/>temple. <lb/>99. Before concluding, we may deal with the <lb/>submission of Shri Lalit that mining can be permitted <lb/>beyond the distance of 300 meters from the temple by using <lb/>Ripper Dozer and Rock Breaker machines. According to the <lb/>learned senior counsel, the use of Ripper Dozer and Rock <lb/></body>

			<page>39 <lb/></page>

			<body>Breaker will not produce vibration which may cause harm <lb/>to the temple. In our view, this submission does not merit <lb/>acceptance because in paragraph 6 of the suggestions made <lb/>by it, the Committee appointed by the Court has already <lb/>indicated that mining in the Buffer Zone may be permitted <lb/>with controlled blasting or without blasting by using Ripper <lb/>Dozer/Rock Breaker or any other machinery and taking <lb/>adequate measures towards generation, propagation, <lb/>suppression and deposition of airborne dust to be closely <lb/>monitored by experts from IBM etc. <lb/>100. In the result, the appeal is allowed and the <lb/>impugned order is set aside. The report of the Committee is <lb/>accepted and the State Government is directed to implement <lb/>the recommendations contained in Part V thereof including <lb/>the recommendation relating to creation of Corpus Fund of <lb/>Rs.3,43,19,160 which shall be utilized for implementing the <lb/>conservation plan for Jambunatheswara temple. However, it <lb/>is made clear that respondent No.18 shall be free to operate <lb/>the Beneficiation plant subject to the condition that it shall <lb/>procure raw material only through E-auction mode. <lb/>101. With a view to ensure that other protected <lb/>monuments in the State do not suffer the fate of <lb/>Jambunatheswara temple, we direct that the Committee <lb/>appointed by this Court vide order dated 26.4.2011 shall <lb/>undertake similar exercise in respect of other protected <lb/>monuments in the State in whose vicinity mining operations <lb/>are being undertaken and submit report to the State <lb/>Government within a maximum period of nine months. The <lb/>State Government shall release a sum of Rs.30 lacs in <lb/>favour of the Committee to meet the expenses of survey, <lb/>investigation etc. The report submitted by the Committee <lb/>shall be considered by the Government within next two <lb/>months and appropriate order be passed. <lb/>102. We hope and trust that the Government of India <lb/>will also appoint an expert committee/group to examine the <lb/>impact of mining on the monuments declared as protected <lb/>monuments under the 1958 Act and take necessary remedial <lb/>measures.&quot; <lb/>15. Mr.Anirudh Krishnan, learned counsel appearing for the appellants in <lb/></body>

			<body>W.A.Nos.2513 to 2517 of 2013, would vehemently contend that resumption <lb/>will be subject to the terms of the lease and the first respondent has to initiate <lb/>appropriate legal proceedings to evict the lessees and any other method to evict <lb/>the lessees would amount to extra-judicial dispossession, which is <lb/>impermissible in law. The doctrine of sub-silentio has been practised in the <lb/>present case, meaning thereby resumption was implied without expression or <lb/>notice and directions issued by the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court to the effect that <lb/>objections of the appellants and the other lessees must be taken into account <lb/>before passing an order, were not followed. Above all, it is evident from the <lb/>map produced by CMRL that the area earmarked for CMRL project does not <lb/>include appellants&apos; lease-hold area and the lands required for the said project <lb/>are situated on the northern side of Poonamallee High Road. Based on the <lb/>source of information elicited under RTI Act, it is obvious that the appellants&apos; <lb/>lease-hold areas fall outside the lands earmarked for the purpose of Metro Rail <lb/>Project. The appellants, as per the impugned orders, are to vacate their premises <lb/>without claiming compensation for the amount spent on it, which is wholly <lb/>arbitrary, illegal and violative of Articles 14 and 300(A) of the Constitution of <lb/>India. He would submit that Section 25 of the Official Trustees Act clearly <lb/>stipulates that any involvement of the Trust property should be dealt with only <lb/>by the Hon&apos;ble High Court and the Government has no business to interfere <lb/>with the administration of the Trust.

			<body>without even determining the compensation amount has taken away the rights <lb/>of appellants, would submit that pronouncements of law, which are not part of <lb/>the ratio decidendi and are not authoritative and the same was delivered <lb/>without reference to the relevant provisions of the Act and a decision which is <lb/>not express and is not founded on reasons nor it proceeds on consideration of <lb/>issue cannot be deemed to be a law declared to have a binding effect as is <lb/>contemplated under Article 141. He would finally contend that issuance of <lb/>impugned orders completely ignoring the fact that appellants are in possession <lb/>of the schedule property under a valid and subsisting lease is against the terms <lb/>of the lease and without recourse to law and, thus, dismissal of writ petitions <lb/>has resulted in a jeopardy to the right of appellants to livelihood, which needs <lb/>interference by this Court in entirety. The learned counsel has cited following <lb/>judgments: <lb/>(i) Lancaster Motor Company Limited vs. Bremith Limited, reported in <lb/>1941 1 K.B. 675 : <lb/>&quot;I should have thought, as I have said, that the appeal <lb/>could not succeed, but Mr.Mitchell refers us to the decision of <lb/>this Court in Gerard vs. Worth of Paris Ltd. There a <lb/>Company went into voluntary liquidation, the liquidator <lb/>discharged the manageress, and she sued the company for <lb/>wrongful dismissal and obtained judgment in default of <lb/>defence. She then applied for a garnishee order on a bank <lb/>account in the name of the liquidator. There was no evidence <lb/>of anyother claims on the company. The Master refused to <lb/>make the order absolute, but the judge in chambers reversed <lb/>his decision. There were several points argued in the case, <lb/>but the point on which the parties appeared to be anxious to <lb/>have a decision was the question to the priority of the <lb/>claimant&apos;s debt. So far as the report shows, no argument was <lb/>addressed to the Court on the question whether or not, in view <lb/></body>

			<page>42 <lb/></page>

			<body>of the fact that the account was in the name of the liquidator, a <lb/>garnishee order could properly be made. I cannot help <lb/>thinking, on reading the report, that that point was <lb/>deliberately passed sub silentio by counsel in order that the <lb/>point of substance might be decided. <lb/>Neverthless, it is fair to say that the point had to be <lb/>decided by the Court before it could make the order which it <lb/>did, because it had to decide whether the order of the judge <lb/>should stand or the order of the Master should be restored. <lb/>There were two members of the Court sitting, Slesser L.J. And <lb/>Romer L.J., and the only material passage in the judgment <lb/>(which was the judgment of Slesser L.J., Romer L.J. Not <lb/>delivering an independent judgment) is to the following <lb/>effect: The Master appears to have taken the view that, in so <lb/>far as the debt was owing to the company and the account was <lb/>in the name of the liquidator, there was a difficulty in <lb/>proceeding by garnishee order. In my view the learned <lb/>Master, if that was his view, was mistaken. If all other <lb/>requirements were satisfied and the lady was entitled to <lb/>garnishee that account of the company, the mere fact that it <lb/>stood in the name of the liquidator does not seem to me to <lb/>effect any difference in her rights.&quot; With all respect to the <lb/>learned Lord Judge who delivered that judgment, and to <lb/>Romer L.J., who agreed with it, I cannot consider that this <lb/>Court is bound to follow it. It was delivered without <lb/>argument, without reference to the cruicial words of the rule, <lb/>and without any citation of authority. Accordingly, I do not <lb/>propose to follow these observations, because it seems to me <lb/>that they are wrong in principle and are not to be justified <lb/>when the language of the rule and the ordinary principles <lb/>which govern the relationship of banker and customer are <lb/>considered. <lb/>It is worth noticing that in the later case of Hirschorn v. <lb/>Evans Slesser L.J. Delivered a judgment, as one of a majority <lb/>consisting of himself and Mackinnon L.J., the reasoning of <lb/>which appears to me to be quite inconsistent with the previous <lb/>decision to which he had been a party in Gerard vs. Worth of <lb/>Paris Ld. In Hirschorn v. Evans, a husband and a wife had a <lb/>bank account in their joint names and it was held by Slesser <lb/>L.J. And Mackinnon L.J., Greer L.J. Dissenting that <lb/>&quot;inasmuch as the debt which the bank owed was not a debt <lb/>due to the husband alone but to him jointly with his wife, it <lb/></body>

			<page>43 <lb/></page>

			<body>could not be attached to answer the judgment against these <lb/>matters. The crucial matter to be observed is what is the <lb/>relationship of the alleged debtor. That relationship must be <lb/>one of debtor and creditor and unless it falls within that <lb/>description the rule does not apply. That aspect of the matter <lb/>was fully gone into by Slesser L.J., and Mackinnnon L.J. Did <lb/>not dissent from that view. In fact, he took the same view <lb/>himself. <lb/>In those circumstances, I feel that I am justified in the <lb/>course which I propose to take and that is of saying that, in <lb/>my opinion, this appeal must be dismissed. <lb/>(ii) Anamallai Club vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and others, reported <lb/>in AIR 1997 SCC 3650 : <lb/>&quot;5. The question is; whether the resumption of <lb/>possession unilaterally, after determination of the grant in the <lb/>manner provided under the grant itself, is valid in law as was <lb/>held by the High Court? We think that the view taken by the <lb/>High Court is not correct in law. In Bishan Das &amp; Ors. vs. <lb/>State of Punjab &amp; Ors.[(1962 2 SCR 69], a Constitution <lb/>Bench of this Court had considered the question whether the <lb/>Government would unilaterally take possession of the land <lb/>after termination of the lease. One Ramjidas had built a <lb/>dharamasala, a temple and shops appurtenant thereto, after <lb/>having a licence of land from the State Government. The lease <lb/>was terminated and thereafter when the persons in possession <lb/>were sought to be dispossessed, without taking any recourse <lb/>to law, they filed writ petition under Article 226 but remained <lb/>unsuccessful. When writ petition under Article 32 was filed, <lb/>this Court had considered the question whether the <lb/>Government is entitled to resume the land with a minimum <lb/>use of force for ejectment without recourse to law. It was <lb/>contended therein that there was no dispute as the question of <lb/>the fact between the parties that the petitioners therein had no <lb/>right and title to the subject matter in dispute. The writ <lb/>petition under Article 226 was dismissed on the ground of the <lb/>disputed question of fact which was upheld in appeal by the <lb/>Division Bench. A writ petition under Article 32 was filed. <lb/>The right to possession of land was a fundamental right at that <lb/></body>

			<page>44 <lb/></page>

			<body>time. It was contended that the Government terminated the <lb/>lease, as thereafter they were trespassers and so they had no <lb/>right to resist the Government&apos;s power to resume the land. <lb/>This Court had repelled both the contentions as unsound and <lb/>has held that the Government violated the fundamental right <lb/>to possession of lead since the petitioners therein were not <lb/>trespassers. They remained in possession for long time. <lb/>Pursuant to the lease, they had constructed dharamasala, <lb/>temple and shops and managed them during the life time of <lb/>the licencee. After his death, the petitioner and members of <lb/>the family continued in possession of and in management of <lb/>the properties which was an admitted possession. Therefore, <lb/>they were not mere trespassers in respect of the said <lb/>properties. It was held that on the admitted facts of the case, <lb/>the petitioners therein could not said to be said in the <lb/>trespassers in respect of the dharamasala, temple and shops <lb/>not could the State could be said to be the owner of the <lb/>property, irrespective of whether it was a trust, public or <lb/>private having taking the possession unilaterally. It was open <lb/>to the State to take appropriate legal action for the purpose. It <lb/>was also held that the State could not remove them from <lb/>possession except under the authority of law. The same view <lb/>was reiterated by this Court inState of U.P. &amp; Ors. vs. <lb/>Maharaja Dharmander Pd. Singh &amp; Ors.[(1989) 2 SCC 505 at <lb/>516) thus: <lb/>&quot;A lessor, with the best of title, has no right to resume <lb/>possession extra-judicially by use of force, from a lessee, even <lb/>after the expiry of earlier termination of the lease by forfeiture <lb/>or otherwise. The use of the expression `re-entry&apos; in the lease <lb/>deed does not authorise extra-judicial possession and forcible <lb/>dispossession is prohibited; a lessee cannot be dispossessed <lb/>otherwise than in due course of law. In the present case, the <lb/>fact that the lessor is the State does not place it in any higher <lb/>or better position. On the contrary, it is under an additional <lb/>inhibition stemming from the requirement that all actions of <lb/>Government and Governmental authorities should have a <lb/>`legal&apos; pedigree&apos;. In Bishan Das vs. State of Punjab [(1962) 2 <lb/>SCR 69] this Court said: <lb/>&quot;We must, therefore, repel the argument based on the <lb/>contention that the petitioners were trespassers and could be <lb/>removed by an executive order. The argument is not only <lb/>specious but highly dangerous by reason of its implications <lb/></body>

			<page>45 <lb/></page>

			<body>and impact on law and order...&quot; <lb/>Before we part with this case, we feel it our duty to say that <lb/>the executive action taken in this case by the State and its <lb/>officers is destructive of the basic principle. <lb/>Therefore, there is no question in the present case of the <lb/>Government thinking of appropriating to itself an extra-<lb/>judicial right of re-entry. Possession can be resumed by <lb/>Government only in a manner known to or recognised by law. <lb/>It cannot resume possession otherwise than in accordance <lb/>with law. Government is, accordingly, prohibited from taking <lb/>possession otherwise than in due course of law.&quot; <lb/>6. In Lallu Yeshwant Singh vs. Rao Jagdish Singh &amp; <lb/>Ors. [(1968) 2 SCR 203], a Bench of this Court had <lb/>considered the same question after reviewing the case law in <lb/>that behalf and held that the Government cannot take <lb/>possession of the land except in accordance with the <lb/>procedure prescribed under the Act. In that case, the recourse <lb/>to the provisions under Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act <lb/>(Section 6 of the present Specific Relief Act, 1963) was <lb/>upheld. The question was also considered by this Court by <lb/>one of us (K. Ramaswamy, J.) in East India Hotels Ltd. vs. <lb/>Syndicate Bank [1992 Supp. (2) 29 at 44]. It was held in <lb/>paragraph 29, 30 and 32 that: <lb/>&quot;They must obtain such possession as they are entitled <lb/>to by proper course. In our jurisprudence governed by rule of <lb/>law even an unauthorised occupant can beejected only in the <lb/>manner provided by law. The remedy under Section 6 is <lb/>summary and its object is to prevent self help and to <lb/>discourage people in adopt any means fair or foul to <lb/>dispossess a person unless dispossession was in due course of <lb/>law or with consent. <lb/>What is meant by due course of law? Due course of law <lb/>in each particular case means such an exercise of the powers <lb/>by duly constituted tribunal or court in accordance with the <lb/>procedure established by law under such safeguards of the <lb/>protection of individual rights. A course of legal proceedings <lb/>according to the rules and principles which have been <lb/>established in our system of jurisprudence for the enforcement <lb/>and protection of private rights. To give such proceedings any <lb/>validity, there must thus be a tribunal competent by its <lb/>constitution, that is by law of its creation, to pass upon the <lb/></body>

			<page>46 <lb/></page>

			<body>subject matter of the suit or proceeding; and, if that involves <lb/>merely a determination of the personal liability of the <lb/>defendant, it must be brought within its jurisdiction by service <lb/>of process within the State, or his voluntary appearance. Due <lb/>course of law implies the right of the person affected thereby <lb/>to be present before the tribunal which pronounces judgment <lb/>upon the question of life, liberty or property in its most <lb/>comprehensive sense; to be heard, by testimony or otherwise <lb/>and to have the right determination of the controversy <lb/>byproof, every material fat which bears on the question of fact <lb/>or liability be conclusively proved or presumed against him. <lb/>This is the meaning of due course of law in a comprehensive <lb/>sense. <lb/>It is thus clear that the course have viewed with askance any <lb/>process other than strict compliance of law as valid in <lb/>dispossessing a person in occupation of immovable property <lb/>against his consent. The reason is obvious that it aims to <lb/>preserve the efficacy of law and peace and order in the society <lb/>relegating the jurisprudential perspectives to a suit under <lb/>Section 6 of the Act and restitute possession to the person <lb/>dispossessed, irrespective of the fact wether the has any title <lb/>to possession or not.&quot; <lb/>(iii) The Collector of Bombay vs. Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri and <lb/>others, reported in (1955) 1 SCR 1311 : <lb/>&quot;20. Then there remains the question whether the sale <lb/>deed, Exhibit A, imposes any limitation on the right of the <lb/>Crown to assess the lands. The deed conveys the lands to the <lb/>purchasers absolutely &quot;with all rights, easements and <lb/>appurtenances whatsoever&quot; to be held &quot;for ever&quot;. It does not, <lb/>however, recite that they are to be held revenue-free. But it is <lb/>argued for the respondents that where there is an absolute <lb/>sale by the Crown as here, that necessarily imports that the <lb/>land is conveyed revenue-free; and section 3 of the Crown <lb/>Grants Act No. XV of 1895 and certain observations in <lb/>Dadoba v. Collector of Bombay(1) were relied on as <lb/>supporting this contention. Section 3 of Act No. XV of 1895 <lb/>is as follows: <lb/>&quot;All provisions restrictions, conditions and limitations <lb/>over contained in any such grant or transfer as aforesaid shall <lb/>be valid and take effect according to their tenor any rule of <lb/></body>

			<page>47 <lb/></page>

			<body>law, statute or enactment of the Legislature to the contrary <lb/>notwithstanding&quot;. <lb/>21. The contention is that as the grant is of a freehold <lb/>estate without any reservation it must, to take effect <lb/>according to its tenor, be construed as granting exemption <lb/>from assessment to revenue. But that will be extending the <lb/>bounds of section 3 beyond its contents. The object of the Act <lb/>as declared in the preamble is to remove certain doubts &quot;as to <lb/>the extent and operation of the Transfer of Property Act, <lb/>1882, and, as to the power of the Crown to impose limitations <lb/>and restrictions upon grants and other transfers of land made <lb/>by it or under its authority&quot;. Section 2 enacts that the <lb/>provisions of the Transfer of Property Act do not apply to <lb/>Crown grants. Then follows section 3 with a positive <lb/>declaration that &quot;all provisions, restrictions, conditions and <lb/>limitations over&quot; shall take effect according to their tenor. <lb/>Reading the enactment as a whole, the scope of section 3 is <lb/>that it saves &quot;provisions, restrictions, conditions and <lb/>limitations over&quot; which would be bad under the provisions of <lb/>the Transfer of Property Act, such as conditions in restraint of <lb/>alienations or enjoyment repugnant to the nature of the estate, <lb/>limitations offending the rule against perpetuities and the <lb/>like. But no question arises here as to the validity of any <lb/>provision, restriction, condition, or limitation over, contained <lb/>in Exhibit A on the ground that it is in contravention of any <lb/>of the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, and there is <lb/>accordingly nothing on which section 3 could take effect. <lb/>23. In this view, section 3 must also be construed in <lb/>the light of the preamble, and so construed, it cannot, for the <lb/>reasons already given, have any bearing on the rights of the <lb/>parties. Moreover, that section only enacts that &quot;all <lb/>provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations over&quot; shall <lb/>take effect according to their tenor, and what is relied on is <lb/>not any provision, restriction, condition or limitation over, in <lb/>Exhibit A which according to its tenor entitles the <lb/>respondents to hold the lands rent-free, but the absolute <lb/>character of the interest conveyed under Exhibit A. <lb/>Therefore, section 3 does not in terms apply.&quot; <lb/>(iv) Raje Anandrao vs. Shamrao and others, reported in AIR 1961 SC <lb/>1206 : <lb/></body>

			<page>48 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;23.The last provision has been made to make it clear <lb/>that the management will not take away the money but <lb/>immediately give it to the representative of the pujaris for <lb/>distribution among them. The provisions of the Public Trusts <lb/>Act will be satisfied in that the management will be in a <lb/>position to know how much has gone to the pujaris including <lb/>the amount spent on dhoop, deep and neivedya. This <lb/>provision will also take away any objection about there being <lb/>interference with the private rights of the pujaris under the <lb/>agreement of 1872.&quot; <lb/>(v) Ahmed Adam Sait and Others vs. Inayathullah Mekhri and others, <lb/>reported in 1964 2 SCR 647 : <lb/>&quot;15. The first point which has been pressed before us <lb/>by Mr. Setalvad is that the present suit is barred by reason of <lb/>the fact that in the earlier suit instituted under s. 92 of the <lb/>Code a scheme had already been framed by a court of <lb/>competent jurisdiction and the decree by which the said <lb/>scheme wAs ordered to be drawn binds all parties interested <lb/>in the Trust. A suit under s. 92, it is urged, is a representative <lb/>suit, and so, whether or not the present respondents actually <lb/>appeared in that suit, they would be bound by the decree <lb/>which had framed a scheme for the proper administration of <lb/>the Trust. In support of this argument, reliance is placed on <lb/>the decision of this Court in Raja Anandrao v. Shamrao (1), <lb/>where it is observed that though the Pujaris were not parties to <lb/>the suit under s. 92, the decision in that suit binds the pujaris <lb/>as worshippers so far as the administration of the temple is <lb/>concerned, because a suit under s. 92 is a representative suit <lb/>and binds not only the parties thereto, but all those who are <lb/>interested in the Trust. Mr. Setalvad has also relied on the two <lb/>decisions of the Madras High Court, (1) in Ramados v. <lb/>Hanumantha Rao (2) and (2) in Khaja Hassaanullah Khan v. <lb/>Royal Mosque Trust Board (3) . The effect of those two <lb/>decisions is that a decree passed in a suit filed under s. 92 <lb/>framing a scheme is binding on all and it prevents every <lb/>person whether a party to the suit or not from asserting in a <lb/>subsequent suit rights which conflict with or attack the <lb/>scheme. <lb/>16. In assessing the validity of this argument, it is <lb/>necessary to consider the basis of the decisions that a decree <lb/></body>

			<page>49 <lb/></page>

			<body>passed in a suit under s. 92 binds all parties. The basis of this <lb/>view is that a suit under s . 92 is a representative suit and is <lb/>brought with the necessary sanction required by it on behalf <lb/>of all the beneficiaries interested in the Trust. The said section <lb/>authorises two or more persons having an interest in the Trust <lb/>to file a suit for claiming one or more of the reliefs specified <lb/>in clauses (a) to (h) of sub-section (1) after consent in writing <lb/>there prescribed has been obtained. Thus, when a suit is <lb/>brought under s. 92, it is brought by two or more persons <lb/>interested in the Trust who have taken upon themselves the <lb/>responsi-bility of representing all the beneficiaries of the <lb/>Trust. In such a suit, though all the beneficiaries may not be <lb/>expressly impleaded, the action is instituted on their behalf <lb/>and relief is claimed in a representative character. This <lb/>position immediately attracts the provisions of explanation VI <lb/>to s. 11 of the Code. Explanation VI provides that where <lb/>persons litigate bona fide in respect of a public right &apos;or of a <lb/>private right claimed in common for themselves and others, <lb/>all persons interested in such right shall, for the purposes of <lb/>this section, be deemed to claim under the persons so <lb/>litigating. It is clear that s. 1 1 read with its explanation VI <lb/>leads to the result that a decree passed in a suit instituted by <lb/>persons to which explanation VI applies will bar further <lb/>claims by persons interested in the same right in respect of <lb/>which the prior suit had been instituted. Explanation VI thus <lb/>illustrates one aspect of constructive res judicata. Where a <lb/>representative suit is brought under s. 92 and a decree is <lb/>passed in such a suit, law assumes that all persons who have <lb/>the same interest as the plaintiffs in the representative suit <lb/>were represented by the said plaintiffs and, therefore, are <lb/>constructively barred by res judicata from reagitating the <lb/>matters directly and substantially in issue in the, said earlier <lb/>suit. <lb/>17. A similar result follows if a suit is either brought or <lb/>defended under O. I, r. 8. In that case, persons either suing or <lb/>defending an action are doing so in a representative character, <lb/>and so, the decree passed in such a suit binds all those whose <lb/>interests were represented either by the plaintiffs or by the <lb/>defendants. Thus, it is clear that in determining the question <lb/>about the effect of a decree passed in a representative suit, it is <lb/>essential to enquire which interests were represented by the <lb/>plaintiffs or the defendants. If the decree was passed in a suit <lb/>under s. 92, it will become necessary to examine the plaint in <lb/></body>

			<page>50 <lb/></page>

			<body>order to decide in what character the plaintiffs had sued and <lb/>what interests they had claimed. If a suit is brought under O. 1 <lb/>r. 8, the same process will have to be adopted and if a suit is <lb/>defended under O. 1 r. 8, the plea taken by the defendants will <lb/>have to be examined with a view to decide which interests the <lb/>defendants purported to defend in common with others. The <lb/>decision of this question would be material in determining the <lb/>correctness of the argument urged by Mr. Setalvad before us. <lb/>22. That takes us to the next question as to whether it <lb/>would be appropriate to change the scheme in the present <lb/>litigation even though the present suit may not be technically <lb/>barred by res judicata. Mr. Setalvad contends that it is a well-<lb/>recognised principle of law that a scheme in regard to a public <lb/>trust once framed should not be altered light-heartedly unless <lb/>there are substantial reasons to do so and he has strenuously <lb/>relied on the finding of the High Court that the Trustees <lb/>appointed under the scheme ever since it was framed have, on <lb/>the whole, managed the trust properties and its affairs in a <lb/>reasonable and responsible manner and that the allegations of <lb/>breach of trust which had been made against them in the <lb/>present suit have been held not to be proved by both the <lb/>courts below. There can be no doubt that if a scheme is <lb/>framed in a suit brought under s. 92, it should not be changed <lb/>unless there are strong and substantial reasons to do so. This <lb/>position is well established and cannot and has not been <lb/>disputed before us. As observed by Halsbury, when a scheme <lb/>has been settled by the Charity Commissioners, the Court will <lb/>not interfere with it unless the Commissioners have acted ultra <lb/>vires, or the scheme contains something wrong in principle or <lb/>in law, or by reason of changed circumstances, the <lb/>continuance of the charity under the constitution established <lb/>by the scheme has become impracticable. This principle was <lb/>laid down as early as 1851 in the case of the Attorney-General <lb/>v. The&apos; Bishop of Worcester (1), where it was held that <lb/>schemes which have been settled under the directions of the <lb/>Court are not to be disturbed upon merely speculative view or <lb/>in matters of discretion or regulation upon which judges or <lb/>Attorneys-General may differ in opinion, or except upon <lb/>substantial grounds and clear evidence, not only that the <lb/>scheme does not operate beneficially, but that it can by <lb/>alteration be made to do so consistently with the object of the <lb/>foundation. The same principle was reiterated in 1872 in the <lb/>case of Attorney-General v. Stewart (1872) L.R.14.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>(vi) Bishambhar Dayal Chandra Mohan and others vs. State of Uttar <lb/>Pradesh and others, reported in (1982) 1 SCC 39 : <lb/>&quot;46. The first and second contentions may conveniently <lb/>be dealt with together. In order to appreciate these <lb/>contentions, it is necessary to state a few facts: <lb/>During the year 1979-80, the country was victim to a very <lb/>serious drought which affected with Kharif as well as Rabi <lb/>crops. The Government of India, therefore, fixed a target of <lb/>9.5 million tonnes of wheat to be purchased in the summer <lb/>months of 1981 for the national buffer stock. It fixed the <lb/>procurement price at Rs. 130 per quintal as against the <lb/>support price of Rs. 127 per quintal recommended by the <lb/>Agricultural Price Commission to provide a better incentive to <lb/>the farmers. The procurement was carried out as a measure of <lb/>price support without any restriction on movement from one <lb/>State to another. However, some of the States were <lb/>implementing local laws with regard to ensuring that the <lb/>private trade adhered to the stock limit restrictions on them <lb/>and did not try to corner stocks for speculation purposes. The <lb/>original target fixed for procurement was 9.5 million tonnes <lb/>but at the end of June, only 6.5 million tonnes had been <lb/>purchased, leaving a deficit of 3 million tonnes. The result <lb/>was that the Government of India was thus forced to buy 1.5 <lb/>million tonnes of wheat in the world market. The <lb/>Government&apos;s procurement drive was mainly frustrated by <lb/>wholesale dealers of foodgrains cornering the stocks of wheat <lb/>by paying a price higher than the procurement price to the <lb/>farmers. <lb/>47. The imperatives of the situation demanded that the <lb/>speculative tendencies of the trade were curbed by strictly <lb/>enforcing the stock limits of traders. Under original cl. 4 of <lb/>the Uttar Pradesh Foodgrains (Procurement and Regulation of <lb/>Trade) Order, 1978, a wholesale dealer, commission agent or <lb/>a retailer could have in stock wheat not more than 750 <lb/>quintals, 750 quintals and 100 quintals respectively, at any <lb/>time. In view of the worsening situation in the national buffer <lb/>stock and in the light of the experience gained during the past <lb/>few years, the State Government was of the opinion that it <lb/>was necessary and expedient to re-fix the stock limits of such <lb/>dealers. This was expected to maximise procurement of wheat <lb/>to meet the requirement of public distribution, as well as, the <lb/></body>

			<page>52 <lb/></page>

			<body>buffer stock. <lb/>48. It cannot be asserted that the restriction imposed by <lb/>the State Government on wholesale dealers of wheat is either <lb/>arbitrary or is of an excessive nature. The fixation of the stock <lb/>limit of wheat to be possessed by wholesale dealers, at any <lb/>time, at 250 quintals is an important step taken by the State <lb/>Government to obviate hoarding and black-marketing in <lb/>wheat which is in short supply. It is hardly necessary to <lb/>emphasise the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be <lb/>remedied thereby. Perhaps fixation of the minimum limit of <lb/>wheat permitted to be possessed by a wholesale dealer at 250 <lb/>quintals, at a time, is too low, but the restriction so imposed <lb/>cannot be treated to be arbitrary or of an excessive nature, <lb/>beyond what is required in the national interest. It is a matter <lb/>of common knowledge that wholesale dealers of foodgrains <lb/>mainly operate in large cities and towns and have the means <lb/>and capacity to manipulate the market by withholding stocks <lb/>of a commodity. There was need to check such speculative <lb/>tendencies in the trade. It was therefore felt expedient to re-fix <lb/>the stock limit of wheat for wholesale dealers at 250 quintals <lb/>at a time, as in the case of a commission agent. The <lb/>underlying idea is that the wholesale dealers should be <lb/>allowed to continue their trading activities within reasonable <lb/>limits. The fixation of stock limit at 250 quintals implies that <lb/>wholesale dealers can have at any time, in stock, a wagon-<lb/>load of wheat. In Krishan Lal Praveen Kumar &amp; Ors. etc. v. <lb/>The State of Rajasthan, this Court has interpreted the words <lb/>&apos;at any time&apos; as meaning &apos;at any given time&apos;. This means that a <lb/>wholesale dealer should not have in stock more than 250 <lb/>quintals at a time. But there is nothing to prevent a wholesale <lb/>dealer from entering into a series of transactions during the <lb/>course of the day. This Court in Krishan Lal Parveen Kumar&apos;s <lb/>case (supra) and Suraj Mal Kailash Chand &amp; Ors. v. Union of <lb/>India &amp; Anr., has upheld the validity of a similar notification <lb/>dated March 23, 1981, issued by the State Government of <lb/>Rajasthan in exercise of the powers conferred by cl. 18 of the <lb/>Rajasthan Trade Articles (Licensing and Control) Order, <lb/>1980, fixing the maximum limit of wheat to be possessed by a <lb/>dealer at any one time at 200 quintals, on the ground that it is <lb/>a reasonable restriction by the State Government within the <lb/>meaning of Art. 19(6) of the Constitution. In view of these <lb/>decisions, it is difficult to conceive as to how the contention <lb/>based on Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution can survive. <lb/></body>

True it is, if the governmental action is arbitrary or <lb/>there is no rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved <lb/>it is liable to be struck down as violative of Art. 14 of the <lb/>Constitution. The State Government has adopted various <lb/>measures in the interest of the general public for the control of <lb/>production, supply and distribution of, and trade and <lb/>commerce in, essential commodities. To obviate hoarding and <lb/>blackmarketing in foodstuffs, it has promulgated the Order. It <lb/>introduces a system of checks and balances to achieve the <lb/>object of the legislation, i.e., to ensure equitable distribution <lb/>and availability of essential commodities at fair prices. It <lb/>cannot be said that looking to the prevailing conditions, the <lb/>imposition of such restrictions does not satisfy the test of <lb/>reasonableness. Nor can it be said that the fixation of such <lb/>stock limit is arbitrary or irrational having no nexus to the <lb/>object sought to be achieved and is, therefore, violative of <lb/>Art. 14. On the contrary, the limitation imposed fixing a stock <lb/>limit for a wholesale dealer at 250 quintals is a reasonable <lb/>restriction within the meaning of Art. 19(6) of the <lb/>Constitution. <lb/>50. One further point requires to be noticed. The <lb/>contention that the action taken by the State Government in <lb/>issuing the impugned teleprinter message amounts to an <lb/>&apos;intrusion&apos; on the fundamental right to carry on trade or <lb/>business under Art. 19(1)(g) or on the freedom of trade, <lb/>commerce and intercourse under Art. 301 of the Constitution <lb/>appears to be wholly misconceived. As already stated the <lb/>instructions conveyed by the State Government by the <lb/>impugned teleprinter message imposing the requirement for <lb/>the making of an endorsement by the Deputy Marketing <lb/>Officer or the Senior Marketing Officer or the physical <lb/>verification of stocks of wheat during the course of transit, are <lb/>not a &apos;restriction&apos; on the fundamental right to carry on trade or <lb/>business guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(g) or on the freedom of <lb/>trade, commerce and intercourse under Art. 301. These are <lb/>nothing but regulatory measures to ensure that the excess <lb/>stock of wheat held by a wholesale dealer, commission agent <lb/>or a retailer is not transported to a place outside the State or <lb/>from one district to another. Even if these requirements are <lb/>considered to be a &apos;restriction&apos; on inter-State or intra-State <lb/>trade, that is, across the State or from one part of the State to <lb/>another, the limitation so imposed on the enjoyment of the <lb/>right cannot be considered to be arbitrary or of an excessive <lb/></body>

			<page>54 <lb/></page>

			<body>nature and thus violative of Art. 19(1)(g) or Art. 301 of the <lb/>Constitution. The State Government in its return has stated <lb/>that there is no ban on the export of wheat from the State of <lb/>Uttar Pradesh to various other States or from one district to <lb/>another within the State, subject to the making of an <lb/>endorsement by the Deputy Marketing Officer or the Senior <lb/>Marketing Officer concerned. The petitioners who are <lb/>wholesale dealers of foodgrains in the State of Uttar Pradesh <lb/>are, therefore, free to carry on their business within the <lb/>permissible limits, i.e., they may carry on their trade or <lb/>business or enter into inter-State or intra-State transactions of <lb/>wheat subject to the stock limit of 250 quintals at a time. <lb/>(vii) Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Gurnam Kaur, reported in AIR <lb/>1989 1 SCC 101 : <lb/>&quot;11. Pronouncements of law, which are not part of the <lb/>ratio decidendi are classed as obiter dicta and are not <lb/>authoritative. With all respect to the learned Judge who passed <lb/>the order in Jamna Das&apos; case and to the learned Judge who <lb/>agreed with him, we cannot concede that this Court is bound <lb/>to follow it. It was delivered without argument, without <lb/>reference to the relevant provisions of the Act conferring <lb/>express power on the Municipal Corporation to direct removal <lb/>of encroachments from any public place like pavement or <lb/>public streets, and without any citation of authority. <lb/>Accordingly, we do not propose to uphold the decision of the <lb/>High Court because, it seems to us that it is wrong in principle <lb/>and cannot be justified by the terms of the relevant provisions. <lb/>A decision should be treated as given per incuriam when it is <lb/>given in ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a rule having <lb/>the force of a statute. So far as the order shows, no argument <lb/>was addressed to the Court on the question or not whether any <lb/>direction could properly be made compelling the Municipal <lb/>Corporation to construct a stall at the pitching site of a <lb/>pavement squatter. Professor P.J. Fitzgerald, editor of the <lb/>Salmond on Jurisprudence, 12th edn. explains the concept of <lb/>sub silentio at p. 153 in these words: <lb/>&quot;A decision passes sub silentio, in the technical sense that has <lb/>come to be attached to that phrase, when the particular point <lb/>of law involved in the decision is not perceived by the court or <lb/>present to its mind. The Court may consciously decide in <lb/>favour of one party because of point A, which it considers and <lb/></body>

			<page>55 <lb/></page>

			<body>pronounces upon. It may be shown, however, that logically the <lb/>court should not have decided in favour of the particular party <lb/>unless it also decided point B in his favour; but point B was <lb/>not argued or considered by the court. In such circumstances, <lb/>although point B was logically involved in the facts and <lb/>although the case had a specific outcome, the decision is not <lb/>an authority on point B. Point B is said to pass sub silentio.&quot; <lb/>(viii) R.Venugopala Naidu and others vs. Venkatarayulu Naidu Charities <lb/>and others, reported in AIR 1990 SC 444 : <lb/>&quot;7. Mr. S. Padmanabhan, learned counsel for the <lb/>appellants has vehemently argued that though the appellants <lb/>were not shown as parties in suit-title but the suit under <lb/>Section 92 of Civil Procedure Code being a representative suit <lb/>the scheme-decree binds not only the parties thereto but all <lb/>those who are interested in the trust. According to him <lb/>&quot;parties&quot; in clause 14 of the scheme decree would include <lb/>appellants and all those who are interested in the trust. He has <lb/>relied on Raje Anandrao v. Shamrao and Others, [1961] 3 <lb/>SCR 930 wherein this Court held as under: <lb/>&quot; ..... It is true that the pujaris were not parties to the <lb/>suit under s. 92 but the deci-sion in that suit binds the pujaris <lb/>as wor-shipers so far as the administration of the temple is <lb/>concerned, even though they were not parties to it, for a suit <lb/>under s. 92 is a representative suit and binds not only the <lb/>parties thereto but all those who are inter-ested in the trust.&quot; <lb/>8. The learned counsel further relied on Ahmed Adam <lb/>Sait and Others v. Inayathullah Mekhri and Others, [1964] 2 <lb/>SCR 647 wherein this Court observed as under: <lb/>&quot;A suit under s. 92, it is urged, is a repre-sentative suit, <lb/>and so, whether or not the present respondents actually <lb/>appeared in that suit, they would be bound by the decree, <lb/>which had framed a scheme for the proper administra-tion of <lb/>the Trust. In support of this argu-ment, reliance is placed on <lb/>the decision of this Court in Raja Anandrao v. Shamrao, <lb/>where it is observed that though the Pujaris were not parties to <lb/>the suit under s. 92, the decision in that suit binds the pujaris <lb/>as worshipers so far as the administration of the temple is <lb/>concerned, because a suit under s. 92 is a representative suit <lb/>and binds not only the parties thereto, but all those who are <lb/>interested in the Trust....... &quot; <lb/></body>

			<page>56 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot; ..... In assessing the validity of this argument, it is necessary <lb/>to consider the basis of the decisions that a decree passed in a <lb/>suit under s. 92 binds all parties. The basis of this view is that <lb/>a suit under s. 92 is a representative suit and is brought with <lb/>the necessary sanction required by it on behalf of all the <lb/>beneficiaries interested in the Trust. The said section <lb/>authorises two or more persons having an interest in the Trust <lb/>to file a suit for claiming one or more of the reliefs specified <lb/>in clauses (a) to (h) of sub-section (1) after consent in writing <lb/>there prescribed has been obtained. Thus, when a suit is <lb/>brought under s. 92, it is brought by two or more persons <lb/>interested in the Trust who have taken upon themselves the <lb/>responsi-bility of representing all the beneficiaries of the <lb/>Trust. In such a suit, though all the beneficiaries may not be <lb/>expressly impleaded, the action is instituted on their behalf <lb/>and relief is claimed in a representative character. This <lb/>position immediately attracts the provisions of explanation VI <lb/>to s. 11 of the Code. Explanation VI provides that where <lb/>persons litigate bona fide in respect of a public right or of a <lb/>private right claimed in common for themselves and others, <lb/>all persons interested in such right shall, for the pur-poses of <lb/>this section, be deemed to claim under the persons so <lb/>litigating. It is clear that s. 11 read with its explanation VI <lb/>leads to the result that a decree passed in a suit instituted by <lb/>persons to which explanation VI applies will bar further <lb/>claims by persons interested in the same right in respect of <lb/>which the prior suit had been instituted. Explanation VI thus <lb/>illustrates one aspect of constructive res judicata. Where a <lb/>representa-tive suit is brought under s. 92 and a decree is <lb/>passed in such a suit, law assumes that all persons who have <lb/>the same interest as the plaintiffs in the representative suit <lb/>were represented by the said plaintiffs and, there-fore, are <lb/>constructively barred by res judica-ta from reagitating the <lb/>matters directly and substantially in issue in the said earlier <lb/>suit. <lb/>A similar result follows if a suit is either brought or defended <lb/>under 0.1., r. 8. In that case per-sons either suing or <lb/>defending an action are doing so in a representative character, <lb/>and so the decree passed in such a suit binds all those whose <lb/>interests were represented either by the plaintiffs or by the <lb/>defendants ....... &quot; <lb/>The legal position which emerges is that a suit under <lb/></body>

			<page>57 <lb/></page>

			<body>Section 92 of the Code is a suit of a special nature for the <lb/>protection of Public rights in the Public Trusts and chari-ties. <lb/>The suit is fundamentally on behalf of the entire body of <lb/>persons who are interested in the trust. It is for the vindication <lb/>of public rights. The beneficiaries of the trust, which may <lb/>consist of public at large, may choose two or more persons <lb/>amongst themselves for the purpose of filing a suit under <lb/>Section 92 of the Code and the suit-title in that event would <lb/>show only their names as plaintiffs. Can we say that the <lb/>persons whose names are on the suit-title are the only parties <lb/>to the suit? The answer would be in the negative. The named <lb/>plaintiffs being the representatives of the public at large <lb/>which is interested in the trust all such interested persons <lb/>would be considered in the eyes of law to be parties to the <lb/>suit. A suit under Section 92 of the Code is thus a <lb/>representative suit and as such binds only the parties named in <lb/>the suit-title but all those who are interested in the trust. It is <lb/>for that reason that explanation VI to Section II of the Code <lb/>constructively bar by res judicata the entire body of interested <lb/>persons from reagitating the matters directly and substantially <lb/>in issue in an earlier suit under Section 92 of the Code.&quot; <lb/>(ix) Krishena Kumar and others vs. Union of India and others, reported <lb/>in 1990 4 SCC 207 : <lb/>&quot;59.The next question debated is that of financial <lb/>implica-tions. It is submitted that given the fact that the <lb/>budget for the year 1990-91 for disbursement of pension is <lb/>Rs.900 crores (as per page 11 of the Budget of the Railway <lb/>Revenue and Expenditure of the Central Government for <lb/>1990-91), the additional liability which would arise by giving <lb/>relief to the Petitioners would be insignificant in comparison. <lb/>Ac-cording to the petitioners as per their affidavit dated <lb/>15.9.88, the additional liability would come to Rs. 18 crores <lb/>per annum and this figure would steadily decrease as the <lb/>number of P.F. retirees diminishes every year due to the fact <lb/>that this question arises only with respect to very old retirees, <lb/>and a substantial number of them pass away every year. <lb/>60. The Government in its affidavit dated 21.9.88 has <lb/>stated that the additional liability as far as the Railway <lb/>employ-ees are concerned, would be Rs.50 crores a year. <lb/>This is based on the assumption that there are 79,000 <lb/></body>

			<page>58 <lb/></page>

			<body>surviving P.F. retirees. Apart from the fact that this number <lb/>of 79,000 was based on calculations made in 1988, and <lb/>would be greatly reduced by this time, the petitioners submit <lb/>that the actual number of survivors would only be about <lb/>38,000. Thus, the actual burden would be less than half. <lb/>Further, even assuming that the figure of 79,000 put forth by <lb/>the Government is correct, the aver-age annual expenditure <lb/>per retiree for pension calculated by the Government is <lb/>incorrect as the calculation includes the non-recurring arrear <lb/>payments for the year 1987-88. Taking the correct figures of <lb/>total pension outlay and total number of beneficiaries the per <lb/>capita pension expenditure per annum works out to Rs.4521. <lb/>Multiplying this by 79,000 (assuming the figures of the <lb/>Railways to be correct) the annual expenditure comes to <lb/>Rs.35.71 crores. This compared to the current budget of <lb/>pensions of Rs.900 crores, is quite insignificant and can be <lb/>easily awarded by this Court as was done in Nakara, it is <lb/>urged. <lb/>61. It is submitted in the alternative that if this Court <lb/>feels that a positive direction cannot be made to the Gov-<lb/>ernment in this regard, it is prayed that at least an option <lb/>should no given to the respondents either to withdraw the <lb/>benefit of switching over to pension from every one or to <lb/>give it to the petitioners as well, so that the discrimina-tion <lb/>must go. <lb/>62. We are not inclined to accept either of these <lb/>submissions. The P.F. retirees and pension retirees having not <lb/>belonged to a class, there is no discrimination. In the matter <lb/>of expenditure includable in the Annual Financial Statement, <lb/>this Court has to be loath to pass any order to give any <lb/>direction, because of the division of functions between the <lb/>three co-equal organs of the Government under the <lb/>Constitution. <lb/>63. Lastly, the question of feasibility of converting all <lb/>living P.F. retirees to Pension retirees was debated from the <lb/>point of view of records and adjustments. Because of the <lb/>view we have taken in the matter, we do not consider it <lb/>necessary to express any opinion. <lb/>64. Mr. C.V. Francis in W.P. No. 1165 of 1989 argued <lb/>the case more or less adopting the arguments of Mr. Shanti <lb/>Bhushan. Mrs. Swaran Mahajan, in W.P. No. 1575 of 1986, <lb/>submitted that the rule as to commuted portion of the pen-<lb/>sion reviving after 15 years should be applied to P.F. retirees <lb/></body>

			<page>59 <lb/></page>

			<body>so that the corpus of Provident Fund dues received more than <lb/>15 years ago should be treated as committed por-tion of <lb/>pension and be allowed to revive for adjustments against <lb/>pension. In the view we have taken in this case it is not <lb/>necessary to express any opinion on this question.&quot; <lb/>(x) State of U.P. and another vs. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and <lb/>another, reported in 1991 4 SCC 139 : <lb/>&quot;5. Does this principle extend and apply to a <lb/>conclusion of law, Which was neither raised nor preceded by <lb/>any consideration. In other words can such conclusions be <lb/>considered as declaration of law? Here again the English <lb/>Courts and jurists have carved out an exception to the rule of <lb/>precedents. It has been explained as rule of sub-silentio. A <lb/>decision passed sub-silentio, in the technical sense that has <lb/>come to be attached to that phrase, when the particular&apos; point <lb/>of law involved in the decision is not perceived by the Court <lb/>or present to its mind&apos; (Salmond 12th Edition). In Lancaster <lb/>Motor Company (London) Ltd. v. Bremith Ltd., [1941] IKB <lb/>675 the Court did not feel bound by earlier decision as it was <lb/>rendered &apos;wit-hout any argument, without reference to the <lb/>crucial words of the rule and without any citation of the <lb/>authority&apos;. It was approved by this Court inMunicipal <lb/>Corporation of Delhi v. Gumam Kaur, [1989] 1 SCC 101. The <lb/>Bench held that, &apos;prece-dents sub-silentio and without <lb/>argument are of no moment&apos;. The Courts thus have taken <lb/>recourse to this principle for relieving from injustice <lb/>perperated by unjust precedents. A decision which is not <lb/>express and is not founded on reasons nor it proceeds on <lb/>consideration of issue cannot be deemed to be a law declared <lb/>to have a binding effect as is contem-plated by Article 141. <lb/>Uniformity and consistency are core of judicial discipline. <lb/>But that which escapes in the judg-ment without any <lb/>occasion is not ratio decedendi.In Shama Rao v. State of <lb/>Pondicherry, AIR 1967 SC 1680 it was ob-served, &apos;it is trite <lb/>to say that a decision is binding not because of its conclusions <lb/>but in regard to its ratio and the principles, laid down therein&apos;. <lb/>Any declaration or conclusion arrived without application of <lb/>mind or preceded without any reason cannot be deemed to be <lb/>declaration of law or authority of a general nature binding as <lb/>a precedent. Restraint in dissenting or overruling is for sake <lb/>of stability and uniformity but rigidity beyond reasonable <lb/>limits is inimical to the growth of law.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>(xi) Inder Parshad vs. Union of India, reported in (1994) 5 SCC 239 : <lb/>&quot;5. In this case admittedly the Government being the <lb/>owner of the land, the appellant held the demised land as <lb/>lessee with superstructure built thereon and was in <lb/>possession and enjoyment of the same on the date of <lb/>acquisition. The contents of the award extracted hereinbefore <lb/>clearly indicate that the Land Acquisition Collector could not <lb/>determine compensation payable towards the leasehold <lb/>interest held by the appellant. Being an owner the <lb/>Government is not enjoined to acquire its own interest in the <lb/>land or land alone for public purpose. When its land is <lb/>granted on lease in favour of a lessee its power to resume the <lb/>land is subject to non-fulfilment of the terms and conditions <lb/>of the lease by the lessee. So long as the lessee acts and <lb/>complies with the covenants contained in the lease or the <lb/>grant, the right to resumption in terms of the lease or grant <lb/>would not arise. But when the land is required for public <lb/>purpose, the Government should get absolute title thereof <lb/>free from all encumbrances. Compensation becomes payable <lb/>for the leasehold right or interest held by the lessee or grantee <lb/>when the land is acquired. The point becomes clear from the <lb/>following illustrations. Take a case where the Government <lb/>granted lease of agricultural land on the annual payment of <lb/>rent with a covenant that the Government is entitled to <lb/>resume the land when needed for public purpose or as when <lb/>the Government finds that the land is required for public <lb/>purpose. In terms of the covenants, the Government is <lb/>entitled to exercise its option to determine the lease though <lb/>the lessee has been complying with the condition of payment <lb/>of annual premium or rent and resume the land in accordance <lb/>with terms of the grant. In that event the need to take <lb/>recourse to acquisition and to make compensation does not <lb/>arise. Take a case where the Government granted the lease of <lb/>the open land with, permission to the lessee to construct a <lb/>building for his quiet enjoyment with appropriate covenants <lb/>and the lessee with permission constructed the building and <lb/>by complying with the covenants of the lease was in quiet <lb/>enjoyment. The self same property, when required for public <lb/>purpose, the Government cannot unilaterally determine the <lb/>lease and call upon the lessee to deliver the possession. <lb/>Therefore, the Government is required to exercise the power <lb/>of eminent domain by invoking the provisions under the <lb/></body>

			<page>61 <lb/></page>

			<body>Land Acquisition Act for getting such land. The Collector <lb/>shall have to determine the compensation towards the <lb/>leasehold interest held by the lessee, if assessable separately <lb/>and determine the compensation. The lessee being the owner <lb/>of the superstructure and the Government being the owner of <lb/>the land, if compensation is determined for both the <lb/>components, then the same has to be apportioned between <lb/>them. At what proportion the lessor and the lessee are <lb/>entitled to receive the compensation has to be determined. In <lb/>the absence of any covenant in the lease for payment and in <lb/>the absence of any specific data available to him, the <lb/>Collector has to determine the respective shares at which the <lb/>compensation is to be apportioned between the Government <lb/>and the lessee, the course open to the Land Acquisition <lb/>Collector is to determine the total compensation, make an <lb/>award and make a reference to the civil court under Section <lb/>30 for decision on appointment. Exactly that is the situation <lb/>on the facts of this case. Take another illustration. The <lb/>Government grants a patta of its land subject to payment of <lb/>land revenue. Later, the land is required for public purpose. <lb/>The payment of land revenue is at par with the payment of <lb/>land revenue payable by a private owner to the State. By <lb/>grant of patta, the title has been vested in the grantee. <lb/>Therefore, the grantee is entitled to the full compensation of <lb/>the acquired land.&quot; <lb/>(xi) Arnit Das vs. State of Bihar, reported in 2000 5 SCC 488 : <lb/>&quot;22. All this exercise would have been avoided if only <lb/>the Legislature would have taken care not to leave an <lb/>ambiguity in the definition of juvenile and would have <lb/>clearly specified the point of time by reference to which the <lb/>age was to be determined to find a person a juvenile. The <lb/>ambiguity can be resolved by taking into consideration the <lb/>Preamble and the Statement of Objects and Reasons. The <lb/>Preamble suggests what the Act was intended to deal with. If <lb/>the language used by Parliament is ambiguous the Court is <lb/>permitted to look into the preamble for construing the <lb/>provisions of an Act (M/s. Burrakur Coal Co. Ltd. &amp; M/s. <lb/>East Indian Coal Co. Ltd. Vs. The Union of India and others, <lb/>AIR 1961 SC 954). A preamble of a statute has been said to <lb/>be a good means of finding out its meaning and, as it were, <lb/>the key of understanding of it, said this Court in A. Thangal <lb/>Kunju Musaliar Vs. M. Venkatachalam Potti AIR 1958 SC <lb/></body>

			<page>62 <lb/></page>

			<body>246. The Preamble is a key to un-lock the legislative intent. <lb/>If the words employed in an enactment may spell a doubt as <lb/>to their meaning it would be useful to so interpret the <lb/>enactment as to harmonise it with the object which the <lb/>Legislature had in its view. The Legislative aims and <lb/>objectives set out in the earlier part of this judgment go to <lb/>show that this Legislation has been made for taking care of <lb/>the care and custody of a juvenile during investigation, <lb/>inquiry and trial, i.e., from a point of time when the juvenile <lb/>is available to the law administration and justice delivery <lb/>system; it does not make any provision for a person involved <lb/>in an offence by reference to the date of its commission by <lb/>him. The long title of the Act too suggests that the content of <lb/>the Act is the justice aspect relating to juveniles. <lb/>23. We make it clear that we have not dealt with the <lb/>provisions of Chapter VI dealing with special offences in <lb/>respect of juveniles. Prima facie, we feel that the view which <lb/>we have taken would create no difficulty even in assigning <lb/>meaning to the term juvenile as occurring in Chapter <lb/>VI(Sections 41 to 45) of the Act because a juvenile covered <lb/>by any of these provisions is likely to fall within the <lb/>definition of neglected juvenile as defined in clause (l) of <lb/>Section 2 who shall also have to be dealt with by a Juvenile <lb/>Board under Chapter III of the Act and the view taken by us <lb/>would hold the field there as well. However, we express no <lb/>opinion on the scope of Chapter VI of the Act and leave that <lb/>aspect to be taken care of in a suitable case. At any rate in the <lb/>present context we need not vex our mind on that aspect. <lb/>Section 2 which defines juvenile and neglected juvenile itself <lb/>begins by saying that the words defined therein would have <lb/>the assigned meaning unless the context otherwise requires. <lb/>So far as the present context is concerned we are clear in our <lb/>mind that the crucial date for determining the question <lb/>whether a person is juvenile is the date when he is brought <lb/>before the competent authority. <lb/>24. So far as the finding regarding the age of the <lb/>appellant is concerned it is based on appreciation of evidence <lb/>and arrived at after taking into consideration of the material <lb/>available on record and valid reasons having been assigned <lb/>for it. The finding arrived at by the learned A.C.J.M. has <lb/>been maintained by the Sessions Court in appeal and the <lb/>High Court in revision. We find no case having been made <lb/></body>

			<body>out for interfering therewith.&quot; <lb/>(xii) Shanmugavel Nadar vs. State of Tamilnadu and another, reported in <lb/>2002 8 SCC 361 : <lb/>&quot;16. In the present case, the order dated 10.9.1986 <lb/>passed by this Court can be said to be declaration of law <lb/>limited only to two points -(i) that in a petition putting in <lb/>issue the constitutional validity of any State Legislation the <lb/>State is a necessary party and in its absence the issue cannot <lb/>be gone into, and (ii) that a belated prayer for impleading a <lb/>necessary party may be declined by this Court exercising its <lb/>jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution if the <lb/>granting of the prayer is considered by the Court neither <lb/>necessary nor proper to allow at the given distance of time. <lb/>By no stretch of imagination can it be said that the reasoning <lb/>or view of the law contained in the decision of the Division <lb/>of the High Court in M. Varadaraja Pillai &apos;s case had stood <lb/>merged in the order of this court dated 10.9.1986 in such <lb/>sense as to amount to declaration of law under Article 141 by <lb/>this Court or that the order of this Court had affirmed the <lb/>statement of law contained in the decision of High Court. <lb/>17. We are clearly of the opinion that in spite of the <lb/>dismissal of the appeals on 10.9.1986 by this Court on the <lb/>ground of non-joinder of necessary party, though the <lb/>operative part of the order of the Division Bench stood <lb/>merged in the decision of this Court, the remaining part of <lb/>the order of Division Bench of the High Court cannot be said <lb/>to have merged in the order of this Court dated 10.9.1986 nor <lb/>did the order of this Court make any declaration of law <lb/>within the meaning of Article 141 of the Constitution either <lb/>expressly or by necessary implication. The statement of law <lb/>as contained in the Division Bench decision of the High <lb/>Court in M. Varadaraja Pillai&apos;s case would therefore continue <lb/>to remain the decision of the High Court, binding as a <lb/>precedent on subsequent benches of coordinate or lesser <lb/>strength but open to reconsideration by any bench of the <lb/>same High Court with a coram of judges more than two. <lb/>18. The Full Bench was not dealing with a prayer for <lb/></body>

			<page>64 <lb/></page>

			<body>review of the earlier decision of the Division Bench in M. <lb/>Varadaraja Pillai&apos;s case and for setting it aside. Had it been <lb/>so, a different question would have arisen, namely, whether <lb/>another Division Bench or a Full Bench had jurisdiction or <lb/>competence to review an earlier Division Bench decision of <lb/>that particular Court and whether it could be treated as <lb/>affirmed, for whatsoever reasons, by the Supreme Court on a <lb/>plea that in view of the decision having been dealt with by <lb/>the Supreme Court the decision of the High Court was no <lb/>longer available to be reviewed. We need not here go into the <lb/>question, whether it was a case of review, or whether the <lb/>review application should have been filed in the High Court <lb/>or Supreme Court. Such a question is not arising before us. <lb/>19. Under Article 141 of the Constitution, it is the law <lb/>declared by the Supreme Court, which is binding on all <lb/>Courts within the territory of India. Inasmuch as no law was <lb/>declared by this Court, the Full Bench was not precluded <lb/>from going into the question of law arising for decision <lb/>before it and in that context entering into and examining the <lb/>correctness or otherwise of the law stated by the Division <lb/>Bench in M. Varadaraja Pillai&apos;s case and either affirming or <lb/>overruling the view of law taken therein leaving the operative <lb/>part untouched so as to remain binding on parties thereto. <lb/>20. Inasmuch as in the impugned judgment, the Full <lb/>Bench has not adjudicated upon the issues for decision before <lb/>it, we do not deem it proper to enter into the merits of the <lb/>controversy for the first time in exercise of the jurisdiction of <lb/>this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. We must <lb/>have the benefit of the opinion of the Full Bench of the High <lb/>Court as to the vires of the State legislation involved. <lb/>21. For the foregoing reason, the appeals are allowed. <lb/>The impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside. All <lb/>the appeals shall stand restored before the Full Bench of the <lb/>High Court and shall be heard and decided in accordance <lb/>with law. The Full Bench while doing so, shall not feel <lb/>inhibited by the fact that the appeals against the decision in <lb/>M. Varadaraja Pillai&apos;s case were dismissed by this Court <lb/>which, as we have already stated, were dismissed only on the <lb/>technical ground without any law being laid down by this <lb/>Court. We also clarify that in view of the time that has <lb/>already been lost, the Full Bench may proceed to hear and <lb/>decide all the controversies arising for decision in the writ <lb/></body>

			<body>petitions in the High Court, that is, the Full Bench may <lb/>obviate the need of sending the matter bade to the Division <lb/>Bench for hearing on such other issues as are not decided by <lb/>it Instead it may decide all the issues raised in the writ <lb/>petitions fully and finally so far as the High Court is <lb/>concerned. The hearing before the Full Bench shall be <lb/>expedited as there are a number of writ petitions and a large <lb/>number of cases are likely to be affected by the view that the <lb/>Full Bench may ultimately take. In view of the writ petitions <lb/>having been restored for hearing on the file of the High <lb/>Court, we also clarify that all the interim orders, which were <lb/>passed by the High Court shall also stand restored. Needless <lb/>to say the High Court shall have the liberty of reconsidering <lb/>the interim orders passed by it if any such occasion arises.&quot; <lb/>(xiii) Zee Telefilms Ltd., and another vs. Union of India and others, <lb/>reported in 2005 4 SCC 649 : <lb/>&quot;282. Are we bound hands and feet by Pradeep Kumar <lb/>Biswas (supra)? The answer to the question must be found in <lb/>the law of precedent. A decision, it is trite, should not be <lb/>read as a statute. A decision is an authority for the questions <lb/>of law determined by it. Such a question is determined <lb/>having regard to the fact situation obtaining therein. While <lb/>applying the ratio, the court may not pick out a word or a <lb/>sentence from the judgment divorced from the context in <lb/>which the said question arose for consideration. A judgment, <lb/>as is well-known, must be read in its entirety and the <lb/>observations made therein should receive consideration in <lb/>the light of the questions raised before it.&quot; <lb/>(xiv) Tika Ram vs. State of U.P. and others, reported in 2009 10 SCC <lb/>689: <lb/>&quot;59. It was reiterated by Shri Trivedi, Learned Senior <lb/>Counsel, as also, Shri Qamar Ahmed, Learned Counsel that <lb/>the question of constitutional validity of the Act was not <lb/>considered by the High Court as the Act was held to be valid <lb/>in GDA&apos;s case (cited supra) and in MDA&apos;s case (cited supra). <lb/>It was, however, urged that the question of Constitutional <lb/>validity was never considered in these cases. Reliance was <lb/>placed on judgments reported as Arnit Das v. State of Bihar <lb/></body>

			<page>66 <lb/></page>

			<body>reported in 2000 (5) SCC 488, State of UP &amp; Anr. v. <lb/>Synthetics &amp; Chemicals Ltd. &amp; Anr. reported in 1991 (4) <lb/>SCC 139, Nirmal Jeet Kaur v. State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; <lb/>Anr. reported in 2004 (7) SCC 558, ICICI Bank &amp; Anr. v. <lb/>Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay &amp; Ors. reported <lb/>in 2005 (6) SCC 404, 7 A.R.

We do not think that the law laid down in <lb/>these cases would apply to the present situation. In all these <lb/>cases, it has been basically held that a Supreme Court <lb/>decision does not become a precedent unless a question is <lb/>directly raised and considered therein, so also it does not <lb/>become a law declared unless the question is actually <lb/>decided upon. We need not take stock of all these cases and <lb/>we indeed have no quarrel with the propositions settled <lb/>therein. However, we may point out that, firstly, the question <lb/>of validity is settled in MDA&apos;s case (cited supra). This is <lb/>apart from the fact that we are of the opinion that there is <lb/>nothing wrong with the Amending Act insofar as its <lb/>Constitutional validity is concerned. We have already <lb/>rejected the argument that there was any discrimination <lb/>between Ujariyaon Part II and Ujariyaon Part III schemes. <lb/>We are convinced with the explanation given by the State <lb/>Government as to why Ujariyaon Part III scheme was left out <lb/>of the consideration of validation. Indeed the acquisition <lb/>therein could not have been validated on account of the time <lb/>having lapsed for doing so. Once Sections 2 and 3 and the <lb/>proviso are read in the manner indicated in MDA&apos;s case <lb/>(cited supra) as also in the light of observations made by us, <lb/>no question remains of any Constitutional invalidity. We are <lb/>not at all impressed by the contention raised that the <lb/>Amending Act cannot pass the test of Article 14. We hold <lb/>accordingly.&quot; <lb/>(xv) Rajendra Gupta and others vs. The Corporation of Chenai, reported <lb/>in Manu/TN/3722/2011 : <lb/>&quot;117. Even though, Appellants came into possession <lb/>by virtue of deed of sublease infavour of their father <lb/>N.D.Gupta, as discussed earlier, the main lease expired on <lb/>30.4.1985, the sublease also came to an end and the <lb/></body>

			<page>67 <lb/></page>

			<body>possession of Appellants is not lawful beyond 30.4.1985. As <lb/>pointed out by the learned Judge under clause 6 of registered <lb/>sub-lease dated 17.7.1968, Plaintiffs were obliged to <lb/>surrender the superstructures to the Trust without claiming <lb/>any compensation after the expiry of the initial period of 18 <lb/>years from 01.4.1968 to 31.3.1986 or atleast the period of <lb/>extended term of 22 years viz., 31.3.2008. Viewed from any <lb/>angle, possession of Appellants are not lawful one beyond <lb/>30.4.1985. <lb/>118. Considering all the aspects and observing that <lb/>document dated 12.10.1973 is vitiated, learned Judge held <lb/>that Appellants are not entitled to any compensation for the <lb/>superstructures. When sublease dated 12.10.1973 is vitiated, <lb/>and when the term of lease itself come to an end on <lb/>30.4.1985, Appellants cannot claim any right beyond that <lb/>and therefore, in our considered view, Appellants are not <lb/>entitled to claim any compensation. <lb/>119. Whether Plaintiffs are entitled to equitable relief <lb/>of interim injunction:-<lb/>Learned Senior Counsel for Appellants contended that <lb/>in an application for grant of temporary injunction, Court is <lb/>concerned only with prima facie case and balance of <lb/>convenience and while so, learned Judge has gone beyond <lb/>the scope of the application and dealt with the matter as if <lb/>Court is dealing with the main suit itself. Learned Senior <lb/>Counsel would further contend that learned single Judge <lb/>erred in dealing with all issues arising in the suit which need <lb/>to be adjudicated only after trial. Learned Senior Counsel for <lb/>Appellants would also contend that Appellants have put up <lb/>multi-storied buildings and the Civil Engineers appointed by <lb/>the Plaintiffs have arrived at the value of the buildings at <lb/>Rs.5.73 crores and Rs.3.96 crores and Rs.6.08 crores <lb/>respectively and if interim injunction is not granted, <lb/>Appellants would be subjected to irreparable loss. <lb/>120. The well settled principles for granting a <lb/>temporary injunction, either under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 <lb/>C.P.C. or under Section 151 of C.P.C. in favour of a party, <lb/>are:-(i) prima facie case, (ii) balance of convenience and (iii) <lb/>irreparable loss. Apart from prima facie case, the party <lb/>seeking injunction has to establish balance of convenience <lb/>and irreparable injury also. A person who seeks aid of the <lb/>Court must establish prima facie case in his favour though it <lb/>is not necessary for him to show at that stage a clear legal <lb/></body>

			<page>68 <lb/></page>

			<body>title; but must satisfy the Court that there is a fair question to <lb/>be tried. <lb/>121. Prima facie case means that there is a serious <lb/>question to be tried and that the claim of the Plaintiffs is not <lb/>frivolous or vexatious. It may not be necessary for the <lb/>Plaintiff to make out a clear, legal title, but he has to satisfy <lb/>the Court that he has fair question to be tried. A temporary <lb/>injunction would justify only if it was based on good prima <lb/>facie case made out by the Plaintiff showing that in all <lb/>probability he is entitled to get permanent injunction sought <lb/>before going through the evidence depending on the <lb/>pleadings and documents placed before the Court. <lb/>122. As discussed earlier, term of lease of the Trust <lb/>expired on 30.04.1985. Even though, Trust had obtained <lb/>decree in O.S.No.1349 of 1985, lease deed never came to be <lb/>executed. In the mean while, Trust arrived at a compromise <lb/>under which Trust had surrendered possession of Victoria <lb/>Public Hall building and the demised land to the owner <lb/>Corporation. Therefore, possession of Appellants beyond <lb/>30.4.1985 is not lawful possession. Assuming the best <lb/>possible for the Appellants as per the lease deed dated <lb/>17.07.1968 for 18 years i.e. till 31.03.1986 and thereafter <lb/>renewable for 22 years i.e. 31.03.2008. Even assuming the <lb/>best possible for the Appellants, possession of the Appellants <lb/>cannot be said to be lawful possession beyond 30.04.1985 <lb/>entitling them to obtain interim injunction from the Court as <lb/>against the true owner Chennai Corporation. The object of <lb/>interlocutory Application is to protect the Plaintiff against <lb/>the injury by violation of his right for which he could not <lb/>adequately be compensated for damages. Beyond 30.4.1985 <lb/>when the possession of the Appellants is not lawful <lb/>possession, Appellants cannot be said to have established <lb/>prima facie case to obtain an injunction against the lawful <lb/>owner. A person in wrongful possession will not be entitled <lb/>to protection by an injunction against the lawful owner. By <lb/>the grant of interim injunction, 1st Defendant-Corporation <lb/>would not be in a position to take possession and maintain <lb/>the VP Hall and the surrounding land. <lb/>123. Subsequent development is also relevant to be <lb/>noted. Enormous amount of traffic congestion in and around <lb/>the Chennai City has led both Central as well as State <lb/>Government to contemplate viable solution to reduce the <lb/>congestion in the traffic and to help the general public which <lb/></body>

			<page>69 <lb/></page>

			<body>paved the way for Chennai Metro Rail. Chennai Metro Rail <lb/>Limited (CMRL) aims to provide major railway inter-linking <lb/>to the suburban railway station as MRTS. First phase of <lb/>Chennai Metro Rail Project is being implemented by CMRL <lb/>at an estimated cost of Rs.14,600 crores. In G.O.Ms.No.148, <lb/>Planning, Development and Special Initiatives (SI) <lb/>Department, dated 20.11.2009, Government constituted a <lb/>High Power Committee (HPC) and discussed the proposal of <lb/>Chennai Metro Rail for transfer of lands of State <lb/>Government departments/Boards/Corporation of Chennai <lb/>both on permanent and temporary basis. CMRL proposed to <lb/>locate Central Metro Station [Corridor I &amp; II] and other <lb/>allied facilities in the land belonging to the Chennai <lb/>Corporation which was leased out to V.P. Hall Trust and or <lb/>Government lands. <lb/>124. Most of the land proposed for Chennai Metro <lb/>Rail Project is Government land. Government lands cater to <lb/>75% of the project land requirement and only 25% of the <lb/>project land requirement is proposed on private patta lands. <lb/>Land in Block No.28 in T.S.No.1269/4 in Vepery village, <lb/>Fort Tondiarpet Taluk belonging to the Chennai Corporation <lb/>to an extent of 2187 sq. mts was directed to be transferred <lb/>and alienated to CMRL in a meeting held by the HPC on <lb/>22.07.2010 and a Government Order to that effect was <lb/>passed by the Government in G.O.Ms.No.132, Planning <lb/>Development &amp; Special Initiatives (SI) Department dated <lb/>27.08.2010 and under the said order, the Secretary to <lb/>Government, Municipal Administration &amp; Water Supply <lb/>Department is directed to issue necessary order of alienation <lb/>of the aforesaid land to CMRL. At the time of finalising the <lb/>alignment of Corridors and design of the Metro Station, an <lb/>additional requirement of 955 sq. mts in the Corporation land <lb/>occupied by Picnic Hotel has been arrived at for locating <lb/>station related structures above ground. The above said land <lb/>shall be utilised for Central Metro Station, ventilation shaft, <lb/>ancillary building, traffic integration etc. The said <lb/>requirement was approved in the III High Power Committee <lb/>held on 04.01.2011. Chennai Central underground Metro <lb/>Station will be vital and key interchange between Metro Rail <lb/>Corridor I &amp; II where the transfer of passengers will take <lb/>place between Corridor I &amp; II at Chennai Central Metro <lb/>Station which is stated to be the complex underground <lb/>station with two levels (one for each corridor). This is to <lb/>ensure inter modal integration for the public which will <lb/></body>

			<page>70 <lb/></page>

			<body>substantially reduce the traffic congestion in the City. The <lb/>subsequent events and the predominant public purpose is an <lb/>important factor to be taken into consideration. If any <lb/>injunction is granted infavour of Appellants that would also <lb/>stall the Chennai Metro Rail Project which is aimed at <lb/>developing the infrastructure of the City of Chennai. <lb/>125. Upon consideration of all materials in issue, the <lb/>learned Judge rightly dismissed the applications declining <lb/>temporary injunction. Exercise of discretion by the trial <lb/>Court should not be lightly interfered with by the Appellate <lb/>Court. Only if the trial Court erroneously exercised its <lb/>discretion and has acted perversely without taking into <lb/>consideration the entire material on record, it is the duty of <lb/>the Appellate Court to interfere with the order of the trial <lb/>Court. In the instant case, Appellants are in occupation of the <lb/>large extent of prime property on a meagre rent of Rs.4000/-<lb/>per month. Upon consideration of the facts and materials, the <lb/>learned Judge has rightly held that Appellants are not <lb/>entitled to get injunction and there is no improper exercise of <lb/>discretion warranting interference.&quot; <lb/>(xvi) Purbanchal Cables and Conductors Pvt. Ltd. vs. Assam State <lb/>Electricity Board and another, reported in 2012 7 SCC 462 : <lb/>&quot;47) The learned Senior Counsel would rely on the <lb/>decision of this Court in Municipal Corporation, Delhi Vs. <lb/>Gurnam Kaur -(1989) 1 SCC 101. This Court has held: <lb/>&quot;11. Pronouncements of law, which are not part of the <lb/>ratio decidendi are classed as obiter dicta and are not <lb/>authoritative. With all respect to the learned Judge who passed <lb/>the order in Jamna Das case and to the learned Judge who <lb/>agreed with him, we cannot concede that this Court is bound to <lb/>follow it. It was delivered without argument, without reference <lb/>to the relevant provisions of the Act conferring express power <lb/>on the Municipal Corporation to direct removal of <lb/>encroachments from any public place like pavements or public <lb/>streets, and without any citation of authority. Accordingly, we <lb/>do not propose to uphold the decision of the High Court <lb/>because, it seems to us that it is wrong in principle and cannot <lb/>be justified by the terms of the relevant provisions. A decision <lb/>should be treated as given per incuriam when it is given in <lb/>ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a rule having the force <lb/></body>

			<page>71 <lb/></page>

			<body>of a statute. So far as the order shows, no argument was <lb/>addressed to the court on the question whether or not any <lb/>direction could properly be made compelling the Municipal <lb/>Corporation to construct a stall at the pitching site of a <lb/>pavement squatter. Professor P.J. Fitzgerald, editor of the <lb/>Salmond on Jurisprudence, 12th Edn. explains the concept of <lb/>sub silentio at p. 153 in these words: <lb/>&quot;A decision passes sub silentio, in the technical sense <lb/>that has come to be attached to that phrase, when the particular <lb/>point of law involved in the decision is not perceived by the <lb/>court or present to its mind. The court may consciously decide <lb/>in favour of one party because of point A, which it considers <lb/>and pronounces upon. It may be shown, however, that logically <lb/>the court should not have decided in favour of the particular <lb/>party unless it also decided point B in his favour; but point B <lb/>was not argued or considered by the court. In such <lb/>circumstances, although point B was logically involved in the <lb/>facts and although the case had a specific outcome, the <lb/>decision is not an authority on point B. Point B is said to pass <lb/>sub silentio&quot; <lb/>12. In Gerard v. Worth of Paris Ltd. (k)., the only point <lb/>argued was on the question of priority of the claimant&apos;s debt, <lb/>and, on this argument being heard, the court granted the order. <lb/>No consideration was given to the question whether a <lb/>garnishee order could properly be made on an account standing <lb/>in the name of the liquidator. When, therefore, this very point <lb/>was argued in a subsequent case before the Court of Appeal in <lb/>Lancaster Motor Co. (London) Ltd. v. Bremith Ltd., the court <lb/>held itself not bound by its previous decision. Sir Wilfrid <lb/>Greene, M.R., said that he could not help thinking that the <lb/>point now raised had been deliberately passed sub silentio by <lb/>counsel in order that the point of substance might be decided. <lb/>He went on to say that the point had to be decided by the <lb/>earlier court before it could make the order which it did; <lb/>nevertheless, since it was decided &quot;without argument, without <lb/>reference to the crucial words of the rule, and without any <lb/>citation of authority&quot;, it was not binding and would not be <lb/>followed. Precedents sub silentio and without argument are of <lb/>no moment. This rule has ever since been followed. One of the <lb/>chief reasons for the doctrine of precedent is that a matter that <lb/>has once been fully argued and decided should not be allowed <lb/>to be reopened. The weight accorded to dicta varies with the <lb/></body>

			<page>72 <lb/></page>

			<body>type of dictum. Mere casual expressions carry no weight at all. <lb/>Not every passing expression of a judge, however eminent, can <lb/>be treated as an ex cathedra statement, having the weight of <lb/>authority&quot; <lb/>48) In the case of State of U.P. Vs. Synthetics and <lb/>Chemicals Ltd. -(1991) 4 SCC 139, His Lordship R.M. Sahai. <lb/>J., in his concurring judgment set out the principles of per <lb/>incurium and sub silentio has held thus: <lb/>&quot;40. Incuria&apos;&apos; literally means &quot;carelessness&quot;. In practice <lb/>per incuriam appears to mean per ignoratium. English courts <lb/>have developed this principle in relaxation of the rule of stare <lb/>decisis. The &quot;quotable in law&quot; is avoided and ignored if it is <lb/>rendered, &quot;in ignoratium of a statute or other binding authority&quot; <lb/>(Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd.). Same has been <lb/>accepted, approved and adopted by this Court while <lb/>interpreting Article 141 of the Constitution which embodies the <lb/>doctrine of precedents as a matter of law. In Jaisri Sahu v. <lb/>Rajdewan Dubeythis Court while pointing out the procedure to <lb/>be followed when conflicting decisions are placed before a <lb/>bench extracted a passage from Halsbury&apos;s Laws of England <lb/>incorporating one of the exceptions when the decision of an <lb/>appellate court is not binding.&quot; <lb/>41. Does this principle extend and apply to a conclusion <lb/>of law, which was neither raised nor preceded by any <lb/>consideration. In other words can such conclusions be <lb/>considered as declaration of law? Here again the English courts <lb/>and jurists have carved out an exception to the rule of <lb/>precedents. It has been explained as rule of sub-silentio. â€oeA <lb/>decision passes sub-silentio, in the technical sense that has <lb/>come to be attached to that phrase, when the particular point of <lb/>law involved in the decision is not perceived by the court or <lb/>present to its mind. (Salmond on Jurisprudence 12th Edn., p. <lb/>153). In Lancaster Motor Company (London) Ltd. v. Bremith <lb/>Ltd. the Court did not feel bound by earlier decision as it was <lb/>rendered without any argument, without reference to the crucial <lb/>words of the rule and without any citation of the authority. It <lb/>was approved by this Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi <lb/>v. Gurnam Kaur. The bench held that, precedents sub-silentio <lb/>and without argument are of no moment. The courts thus have <lb/>taken recourse to this principle for relieving from injustice <lb/>perpetrated by unjust precedents. A decision which is not <lb/>express and is not founded on reasons nor it proceeds on <lb/></body>

			<page>73 <lb/></page>

			<body>consideration of issue cannot be deemed to be a law declared to <lb/>have a binding effect as is contemplated by Article 141. <lb/>Uniformity and consistency are core of judicial discipline. But <lb/>that which escapes in the judgment without any occasion is not <lb/>ratio decidendi. In B. Shama Rao v. Union Territory of <lb/>Pondicherry it was observed, â€˜it is trite to say that a decision <lb/>is binding not because of its conclusions but in regard to its <lb/>ratio and the principles, laid down therein. Any declaration or <lb/>conclusion arrived without application of mind or preceded <lb/>without any reason cannot be deemed to be declaration of law <lb/>or authority of a general nature binding as a precedent. <lb/>Restraint in dissenting or overruling is for sake of stability and <lb/>uniformity but rigidity beyond reasonable limits is inimical to <lb/>the growth of law.&quot; <lb/>49) In the case of Arnit Das Vs. State of Bihar -(2000) 5 <lb/>SCC 488, this Court held: <lb/>&quot;A decision not expressed, not accompanied by reasons and not <lb/>proceeding on a conscious consideration of an issue cannot be <lb/>deemed to be a law declared to have a binding effect as is <lb/>contemplated by Article 141. That which has escaped in the <lb/>judgment is not the ratio decidendi. This is the rule of sub <lb/>silentio, in the technical sense when a particular point of law <lb/>was not consciously determined. (See State of U.P. v. <lb/>Synthetics &amp; Chemicals Ltd. SCC, para 41.)&quot; <lb/>50) In the case of Tika Ram Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh -<lb/>(2009) 10 SCC 689, it was held: <lb/>&quot;104. We do not think that the law laid down in these <lb/>cases would apply to the present situation. In all these cases, it <lb/>has been basically held that a Supreme Court decision does not <lb/>become a precedent unless a question is directly raised and <lb/>considered therein, so also it does not become a law declared <lb/>unless the question is actually decided upon. We need not take <lb/>stock of all these cases and we indeed have no quarrel with the <lb/>propositions settled therein...&quot; <lb/>16. On the above contentions, we have heard the learned counsel for the <lb/>respondents, who would submit that the subject land is the property of the <lb/>State, which was leased out to the Trust with certain conditions, and, as there <lb/></body>

			<page>74 <lb/></page>

			<body>was violation of conditoins, coupled with the need of the land for railways for a <lb/>public purpose, the State has resumed the land after following the due <lb/>procedure and, hence, the act of the State in resuming the land cannot be <lb/>faulted with. <lb/>17. Mr.P.H.Arvind Pandian, learned Additional Advocate General <lb/>appearing for the State in all the Writ Appeals, would vehemently contend that <lb/>there is a violation of terms and conditions of the lease and further the land in <lb/>question has been required by CMRL for a public purpose and, therefore, for <lb/>the welfare of the people of the State and in order to ease out the congestion, <lb/>the State has taken immediate action to resume the land, which belongs to <lb/>itself. He also submits that Section 3 of the Government Grants Act empowers <lb/>the State to resume the land without any procedural impediment, as the land is <lb/>immediately needed for the public purpos. Finally, he would contend that the <lb/>ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in this regard is binding on the <lb/>appellants, as their survey numbers have also been taken into consideration <lb/>while rendering the finding, and the rules contemplated under the Government <lb/>Grants Act have been rightly invoked by the State while proceeding with the <lb/>impugned action and, therefore, there is no legal infirmity in the impugned <lb/>order passed by the Government. The learned Additional Advocate General has <lb/>relied upon the following authorities: <lb/>(i) State of U.P. vs. Zahoor Ahmad, reported in (1973) 2 SCC 547 : <lb/></body>

			<page>75 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;16. Section 3 of the Government Grants Act declares <lb/>the unfettered discretion of the Government to impose such <lb/>conditions and limitations as it thinks fit, no matter what the <lb/>general law of the land be. The meaning of sections 2 and 3 <lb/>of the Government Grants is that the scope of that Act is not <lb/>limited to affecting the provisions of the Transfer of Property <lb/>Act only. The Government has unfettered discretion to <lb/>impose any conditions, limitations, or restrictions in its <lb/>grants, and the right, privileges and obligations of the grantee <lb/>would be regulated according to the terms of the grant, <lb/>notwithstanding any provisions of any statutory or common <lb/>law.&quot; <lb/>(ii) Hajee S.V.M.Mohamed Jamaludeen Bros. &amp; Co. vs. Govt. of TN, <lb/>reported in (1997) 3 SCC 466 : <lb/>&quot;9. Section 2 of the Grants Act insulates all grants and <lb/>all transfers of land or any interest therein made by the <lb/>government from the checks of the provisions of Transfer of <lb/>Property Act. Section 3 of the Grants act protects the terms of <lb/>such grant from the provisions of any other law. We extract <lb/>the above two provisions hereunder : <lb/>&quot;2. Transfer of property Act, 1882, not to <lb/>apply to Government grants.-Nothing in the <lb/>Transfer of Property act, 1882, contained shall <lb/>apply or be deemed ever to have applied to any <lb/>grant or other transfer of land or of any interest <lb/>therein heretofore made or hereafter to be made by <lb/>or on behalf of the Government to, or in favour of, <lb/>any person whomsoever; but every such grant and <lb/>transfer shall be construed and take effect as if the <lb/>said Act had not been passed. <lb/>3. Government grants to take effect <lb/>according to their tenor:-All provisions, <lb/>restrictions, conditions and limitations, contained <lb/>in any such grant or transfer as aforesaid shall be <lb/>valid and the effect according to their tenor, any <lb/>rule of law, statute or enactment of the contrary <lb/>notwithstanding.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<page>76 <lb/></page>

			<body>10. The combined effect of the above two sections of <lb/>the Grants Act is that terms of any grant or terms of any <lb/>transfer of land made by a government would stand insulated <lb/>from the tentacles of any statutory law. Section 3 places the <lb/>terms of such grant beyond the reach of any restrictive <lb/>provision contained in any enacted law or even the equitable <lb/>principles of justice, equity and good conscience adumbrated <lb/>by common law if such principles are inconsistent with such <lb/>terms. The two provisions are so framed as to confer <lb/>unfettered discretion on the government to enforce any <lb/>condition or limitation or restriction in all types of grants <lb/>made by the government to any person. In other words, the <lb/>rights, privileges and obligations of any grantee of the <lb/>government would be completely regulated by the terms of <lb/>the grant, even if such terms are inconsistent with the <lb/>provisions of any other law. <lb/>11. The above legal position was recognised by the <lb/>courts in India before the Constitution of India came into <lb/>being. (Surja Kanta Roy Choudhary and Ors. v. Secretary of <lb/>State and Raza Hussain Khan and Ors. v. Sayid Mohd. and <lb/>Ors. AIR (1938) Oudh 175). The position continued to be so <lb/>even after the Constitution came into force (State of U.P. v. <lb/>Zahoor Ahmad.&quot; <lb/>(iii) Chitra Kumar (Smt) vs. Union of India and others, reported in <lb/>(2001) 3 SCC 208 : <lb/>&quot;32. We have considered the rival submission. In our <lb/>view Mr. Rohtagi is quite right. It is now too late in the day <lb/>for Mr. Andhyarujina&apos;s clients to take a contrary stand. Mr. <lb/>Yogeshwar Prasad&apos;s clients have on facts lost in all Courts <lb/>below. Notice to produce documents, given belatedly in some <lb/>other case, is of no relevance so far as these Appeals are <lb/>concerned. The practice of annexing irrelevant documents <lb/>and trying to rely on them for the first time in the Appeal or <lb/>in Review Petitions in the High Court should be deprecated. <lb/>33. In Civil Appeal Nos. 917-918 of 1998 it is clear <lb/>that, at all stages, the case has progressed on the basis that it <lb/>was not disputed that the land was on old grant terms. Of <lb/>course, in the Plaint, in Para. 4(b) it had been averred that the <lb/>land was not on old grant terms. However, except for making <lb/>such an averment that point has clearly not been pressed at <lb/>any stage. In evidence given by the plaintiff and/or on his <lb/></body>

			<page>77 <lb/></page>

			<body>behalf, there is no statement that the land was of plaintiff <lb/>ownership and/or that the land did not belong to the <lb/>Government. During trial the documents, now sought to be <lb/>relied upon by Mr. Andhyarujina were neither produced nor <lb/>tendered nor got marked as Exhibits. Were they produced <lb/>Respondents would have had an opportunity to cross <lb/>examine the witnesses and show that the averments in the <lb/>documents were not correct and/or to explain how and why <lb/>lease was taken by the Secretary of the State. It is clear that <lb/>the averments in para 4(b) of the Plaint were not pressed. <lb/>That they were not pressed is also clear from the Judgment of <lb/>the Trial Court. It sets out all the arguments of the parties. No <lb/>submission on the question of ownership of land by the <lb/>Plaintiff and/or that the land was not on old grant terms has <lb/>been recorded. If it was argued and their submissions were <lb/>not recorded cross objections should have been filed <lb/>particularly when in the last paragraph the Trial Court <lb/>clarifies that the Government could resume the land after <lb/>following due procedure of law. There could be no question <lb/>of resumption if it was being disputed that the Government <lb/>was the owner of the land. If Mr. Andhyarujina is right and <lb/>the parties had not given up this contention, then it would be <lb/>worse for the Appellants inasmuch as it would then mean that <lb/>the trial Court had not accepted Plaintiffs/Appellants claim to <lb/>ownership of land and had negatived it. <lb/>34. The Appellants never went in Appeal against the <lb/>Judgment of the Trial Court. Even when the Respondents <lb/>went in Appeal no cross objections were filed. Even before <lb/>the first Appellate Court it has not been stated that their <lb/>submissions were not dealt with and/or that the portion of the <lb/>Judgment permitting resumption, after due process of law, <lb/>could not have been granted. On the contrary the first <lb/>Appellate Court is also clarifying that the Government can <lb/>resume after following due process of law. This shows that <lb/>even before the first Appellate Court it was an admitted <lb/>position that the Government was the owner of the land and <lb/>that the land was on old grant terms. <lb/>35. When the Respondents went in Second Appeal <lb/>before the High Court, at this stage also, no cross objections <lb/>were filed. Before the High Court it was not disputed that the <lb/>land was on old grant terms. The High Court has so recorded <lb/>in its Judgment. It is settled law that one has to proceed on <lb/>basis of what has been recorded by the Court. If any party <lb/>feels aggrieved of what has been recorded by the Courts a <lb/></body>

			<page>78 <lb/></page>

			<body>clarification has to be sought from that same Court. In this <lb/>case the clarification was sought, by way of Review Petition, <lb/>to which as stated above, fresh documents were purported to <lb/>be attached for the first time. The High Court has rejected the <lb/>Review Petition. The High Court has thus confirmed that at <lb/>the time the Second Appeal was argued it was not disputed <lb/>that the land was on old grant terms. This Court has to go by <lb/>what has been recorded in the Judgment. What is recorded in <lb/>the Judgment is supported by the conduct of the parties <lb/>inasmuch as no evidence was led to dispute the fact, no <lb/>documents were tendered or marked as Exhibits and no <lb/>submissions were made on this aspect. That it was not <lb/>disputed that the land was on old grant terms is also <lb/>supported by what has been recorded in the Judgments of the <lb/>trial court and the First Appellate Court. There is no evidence <lb/>that the written admissions were taken forcibly and/or that <lb/>they were not binding or not correct. Admissions are relevant <lb/>evidence if not explained away. Thus these cases have been <lb/>fought over the last 17 years on an admitted position. Mr. <lb/>Rohtagi is right that it would be a travesty of justice and <lb/>would amount to permitting parties to misuse laws delays if <lb/>at this stage they are permitted to change their stand and take <lb/>contentions which are contrary to what has been the admitted <lb/>position all these years. <lb/>36. In Civil Appeals (arising out of SLP (C) Nos. <lb/>22436-22437 of 1997) all the Courts below have given <lb/>concurrent findings of fact. We see no infirmity in these <lb/>findings. The findings of fact are based on evidence before <lb/>the Trial Court and require no interference. <lb/>37. Once it is admitted that land was on old grant <lb/>terms it is irrelevant to argue that it is not shown that Ambala <lb/>was under the Bengal Army. The same would be the position <lb/>when on evidence Court has held that land is on old grant <lb/>terms.&quot; <lb/>(iv) Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar and others vs. State of Gujarat and <lb/>another, reported in 1995 Supp. (1) SCC 596 : <lb/>&quot;32. In Subodh Copal&apos;s case Patanjali Sastri, CJ, held <lb/>that the word &apos;deprived&apos; in clause (1) of Art. 31 cannot be <lb/>narrowly construed. No cut and dry test can be formulated as <lb/>to whether in a given case the owner is deprived of his <lb/>property within the meaning of Art. 31; each case must be <lb/></body>

			<page>79 <lb/></page>

			<body>decided as it arises on its own facts. Broadly speaking it may <lb/>be said that an abridgement would be so substantial as to <lb/>amount to a deprivation within the meaning of Art. 31, if, in <lb/>effect, if withheld the property from the posession and <lb/>enjoyment by him or materially reduced its value. S.R. Das, <lb/>J, as he then was, held that Clauses (1) and (2) of Art, 31 <lb/>dealt with the topic of &apos;eminent domain&apos;, the expressions <lb/>&apos;taken possession of or &apos;acquired&apos; according to Clause (2) <lb/>have the same meaning which the word &apos;deprived&apos; used in <lb/>clause (1). In other words, both the clauses are con-cerned <lb/>with the deprivation of the property; taking possession of or <lb/>ac-quired, used in Clause (2) is referable to deprivation of <lb/>the property in Clause (1). Taking possession or acquisition <lb/>should be in the connotation of the acquisition or requisition <lb/>of the property for public purpose. Deprivation specifically <lb/>referable to acquisition or requisition and not for any and <lb/>every kind of deprivation. In Dwarka Das Srinivas of <lb/>Bombay v. Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd., [1954] <lb/>SCR 674, Mahajan, J., as he then was, similarly held that the <lb/>word &apos;deprived&apos; in clause (1) of Art. 31 and acquisition and <lb/>taking possession in clause (2) have the same meaning <lb/>delimting the field of eminent domain, namely, compulsory <lb/>acquisition of the property and given protection to private <lb/>owners against the State action. S.R. Das, J. reiterated his <lb/>view laid in Subodh Gupal&apos;s case. Vivian Bose, J. held that <lb/>the word &apos;taken possession of or &apos;acquired&apos; in Art. 31(2) have <lb/>to be read along with the word &apos;deprived&apos; in clause (1). <lb/>Taking possession or acquisition amounts to deprivation <lb/>within the meaning of clause (1). No hard and fast rule can <lb/>be laid down. Each case must depend on its own facts. The <lb/>word &quot;law&quot; used in Art. 300A must be an Act of Parliament <lb/>or of State Legislature, a rule or statutory order having force <lb/>of law. The deprivation of the property shall be only by <lb/>authority of law, be it an Act of Parliament or State <lb/>Legislature, but not by executive fiat or an order. <lb/>Deprivation of property is by acquisition or requisition or <lb/>taking possession of for a public purpose. <lb/>33. It is true as contended by Sri Javery that clause (2) <lb/>of Art. 31 was not suitably incorporated in Art. 300A but the <lb/>obligation to pay compen-sation to the deprived owner of his <lb/>property was enjoined as an inherent incident of acquisition <lb/>under law is equally untenable for the following reasons. <lb/>Ramanatha Aiyar&apos;s &apos;The Law Lexicon&apos; Reprint Edition 1987, <lb/>p. 385, defined &apos;eminent demain&apos; thus: <lb/></body>

			<page>80 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;The right of the State or the sovereign to its or his <lb/>own property is absolute while that of the subject or citizen <lb/>to his property is only paramount. The citizen holds his <lb/>property subject always to the right of the soverign to take it <lb/>for a public purpose. This right is called &quot;eminent domain&quot;. <lb/>At p. 386 it was further stated that: <lb/>&quot;The sovereign power vested in the State to take <lb/>private property for the public use, providing first a just <lb/>compensation therefore. A superior right to apply private <lb/>property to public use. A superior right inherent in society, <lb/>and exercised by the sovereign power, or upon delegation <lb/>from it, whereby the subject matter of rights of property may <lb/>be taken from the owner and appropriated for the general <lb/>welfare. The right belonging to the society or to the <lb/>sovereign, of disposing in cases of necessity, and for the <lb/>public safety, of all the wealth contained in the state is called <lb/>eminent domain. The right of every government to <lb/>appropriate, otherwise than by taxation and its police <lb/>authority, private property for public use. The ultimate right <lb/>of sovereign power to appropriate not only the public <lb/>property but the private property of all citizens within the <lb/>territorial sovereignty, to public purpose. Eminent domain is <lb/>in the nature of a compulsory purchase of the property of the <lb/>citizen for the purpose of applying to the public use.&quot; <lb/>In &apos;Black&apos;s Law Dictionary&apos; 6th edition, at p. 523 &apos;eminent <lb/>domain&apos; is defined as: <lb/>&quot;The power to take private property for <lb/>public use by the state, municipalities and private <lb/>persons or corporations authoritised to exercise <lb/>functions of public character. in United States the <lb/>power of eminent domain is founded in both the <lb/>Federal <lb/>(Fifth <lb/>Amendment) <lb/>and <lb/>State <lb/>Constitutions. The Constitution gives the power to <lb/>take for public purpose and prohibits the exercise <lb/>of the power of eminent domain without just <lb/>compensation to the owners of the property which <lb/>is taken. The process of exercising the power of <lb/>eminent domain is commonly referred to as <lb/>&apos;condemnation&apos; or &apos;expropriation&apos;.&quot; <lb/>36. In Bisambhar Dayal Chandra Mohan v. State of <lb/>U.P., this Court had held that the State Govt. cannot while <lb/></body>

			<page>81 <lb/></page>

			<body>taking recourse to the executive power of the State under <lb/>Art. 162, deprive a person of his property. Such power can <lb/>be exercised, only by authority of law and not by a mere <lb/>executive fiat or order. It is, therefore, necessarily subject to <lb/>Art. 300A. Eminent domain, therefore, is a right inherent in <lb/>every sovereign State to expropriate private property for <lb/>public purpose without its owner&apos;s consent which inheres in <lb/>Art. 300A and it would be exercised by the authority of law <lb/>and not by executive fiat or order.&quot; <lb/>(v) Union of India and others vs. Harish Chand Anand (Dead) Through <lb/>Lrs., reported in (2010) 15 SCC 591 : <lb/>&quot;12. We have carefully considered the contention. We <lb/>are not persuaded to accept this contention raised by the <lb/>appellant. As noted earlier the High Court accepted the <lb/>contention raised by the respondent relying on the Division <lb/>Bench decision in Bhagwati Devi. Subsequently, the <lb/>Himachal Pradesh High Court took the same views as the <lb/>Allahabad High Court, in Durga Dass Sud v. Union of India. <lb/>We are of the view that the decision of the Delhi High Court <lb/>in Raj Singh vs. Union of India is acceptable. Therein in para <lb/>4 the learned Single Judge held that the determination of <lb/>compensation was not a condition precedent to the <lb/>resumption. The Division Bench concurred with the view <lb/>taken by the learned Single Judge. The Division Bench in para <lb/>21 of the judgment in Raj Singh case observed: <lb/>&quot;The question of compensation would have to be <lb/>considered in an independent proceeding between the ex <lb/>grantee and the Government in the light of the provisions of <lb/>the first condition of Regulation 6 and the whole of <lb/>Regulation 7 of Order 179 of 1836.&quot; <lb/>The question whether the Government must pay compensation <lb/>or whether they can take the stand that the grantee may <lb/>remove the structure and the quantum of compensation <lb/>payable would be considered in that proceeding.&quot; <lb/>14. It is contended by the learned counsel for the <lb/>respondent that in both the cases aforementioned this Court <lb/>referred to and relied on the decision in this very case (Union <lb/>of India v. Harish Chand Anand) and that the decision having <lb/>been set aside and the appeal restored to file, they have no <lb/>precedential value. We cannot agree. Apart from relying on <lb/></body>

			<page>82 <lb/></page>

			<body>the decision in this case which was subsequently set aside, the <lb/>learned Judges also approved the view taken by the Delhi <lb/>High Court in Raj Singh case. In any case, we are also of the <lb/>view that the process of resumption of land in terms of Clause <lb/>(5) of the grant does not get indefinitely postponed till the <lb/>dispute as to compensation is determined according to law. In <lb/>other words the determination of compensation after hearing <lb/>the affected parties, though mandatory, is not a condition <lb/>precedent for the exercise of power of resumption. The <lb/>resultant position that emerges is that the question formulated <lb/>earlier has to be answered in the negative and the writ petition <lb/>is liable to be dismissed.&quot; <lb/>18. Mr.R.Thiagarajan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the <lb/>respondent/CMRL, would argue that viewing the importance of the project to <lb/>ease out congestion in the city of Chennai and following the policy of the <lb/>Central Government to go ahead with the project in coordination with the State, <lb/>CMRL being the requisitioning body, resumption of the subject land is a sine <lb/>qua non and any delay in handing over possession of the land would not only <lb/>cause monetary loss but lead to the stalling of the project and, therefore, the <lb/>land is required for a public purpose and there is every need for handing over <lb/>the land at the earliest, in order to facilitate the project. It is his further <lb/>contention that public purpose will prevail over the individual&apos;s interest and the <lb/>appellants have exhausted all the remedies and the matter has been remanded <lb/>by the Supreme Court only for a limited purpose to give the appellants an <lb/>opportunity, which has been followed and any delay in completing the project <lb/>would result in heavy financial implications and, as such, CMRL, being the <lb/>requisitioning body, its interests should be protected. The learned Senior <lb/></body>

			<page>83 <lb/></page>

			<body>Counsel has relied on the following rulings : <lb/>(i) Gaya Prasad vs. Secretary of State, reported in AIR 1939 Allahabad <lb/>263 : <lb/>&quot;... No limit of time applies to Government in its <lb/>resumption of a grant. In the present case, the suit has been <lb/>brought for resumption and there is no reason whatever why <lb/>it should not be granted. It may be noted that the grant has <lb/>been violated by the transfer by sale of 22 nd July 1928 and <lb/>any sanction of the Municipal Board would not make that <lb/>transfer valid. Secondly, the grant was violated by the <lb/>appellant digging foundations with the intention of making a <lb/>building. The grant is not for the purpose of making a <lb/>building but for the purpose of planting a garden or grove. <lb/>Thirdly, the grant was violated by Gaya Prasad, the present <lb/>occupant, setting up title in himself which was in issue <lb/>before the Assistant Collector and was the subject of a <lb/>reference to the Munsif and was again the subject of a claim <lb/>apparently before the lower Appellate Court where the <lb/>appellant claimed to have heritable and transferable rights. <lb/>As regards the power of Municipal Boards, the quotation of <lb/>the Court below from the Municipal Manual, p.261, shows <lb/>that &quot;Nazul is at all times liable to resumption by the <lb/>Government.&quot; Therefore, no matter what action is taken by <lb/>the Municipal Board, the power of Government to resume the <lb/>nazul remains. For these reasons, we consider that the Court <lb/>below was correct in decreeing this suit for resumption and <lb/>we dismiss this second appeal with costs.&quot; <lb/>(ii) Collector of Bombay vs. Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri and others, <lb/>reported in AIR 1955 Supreme Court 298 : <lb/>&quot;15. Then there remains the question whether the <lb/>sale deed, Exhibit A, imposes any limitation on the right <lb/>of the Crown to assess the lands. The deed conveys the <lb/>lands to the purchasers absolutely &quot;with all rights, <lb/>easements and appurtenances whatsoever&quot; to be held &quot;for <lb/>ever&quot;. It does not, however, recite that they are to be held <lb/>revenue-free. But it is argued for the respondents that <lb/>where there is an absolute sale by the Crown as here, that <lb/>necessarily imports that the land is conveyed revenue-<lb/>free; and section 3 of the Crown Grants Act No. XV of <lb/></body>

			<page>84 <lb/></page>

			<body>1895 and certain observations in Dadoba v. Collector of <lb/>Bombay(1) were relied on as supporting this contention. <lb/>Section 3 of Act No. XV of 1895 is as follows: <lb/>&quot;All provisions restrictions, conditions <lb/>and limitations over contained in any such <lb/>grant or transfer as aforesaid shall be valid <lb/>and take effect according to their tenor any <lb/>rule of law, statute or enactment of the <lb/>Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding&quot;. <lb/>The contention is that as the grant is of a freehold <lb/>estate without any reservation it must, to take effect <lb/>according to its tenor, be construed as granting exemption <lb/>from assessment to revenue. But that will be extending <lb/>the bounds of section 3 beyond its contents. The object of <lb/>the Act as declared in the preamble is to remove certain <lb/>doubts &quot;as to the extent and operation of the Transfer of <lb/>Property Act, 1882, and, as to the power of the Crown to <lb/>impose limitations and restrictions upon grants and other <lb/>transfers of land made by it or under its authority&quot;. <lb/>Section 2 enacts that the provisions of the Transfer of <lb/>Property Act do not apply to Crown grants. Then follows <lb/>section 3 with a positive declaration that &quot;all provisions, <lb/>restrictions, conditions and limitations over&quot; shall take <lb/>effect according to their tenor. Reading the enactment as a <lb/>whole, the scope of section 3 is that it saves &quot;provisions, <lb/>restrictions, conditions and limitations over&quot; which would <lb/>be bad under the provisions of the Transfer of Property <lb/>Act, such as conditions in restraint of alienations or <lb/>enjoyment repugnant to the nature of the estate, <lb/>limitations offending the rule against perpetuities and the <lb/>like. But no question arises here as to the validity of any <lb/>provision, restriction, condition, or limitation over, <lb/>contained in Exhibit A on the ground that it is in <lb/>contravention of any of the provisions of the Transfer of <lb/>Property Act, and there is accordingly nothing on which <lb/>section 3 could take effect. <lb/>16. It is argued by the learned Attorney-General that <lb/>this limitation on the scope of the Act applies in terms <lb/>only to section 2, and that section 3 goes much further, <lb/>and is general and unqualified in its operation. The scope <lb/>of section 3 came up for consideration before the Privy <lb/></body>

			<page>85 <lb/></page>

			<body>Council in Thakur Jagannath Baksh Singh v. The United <lb/>Provinces(1). After setting out that section, Lord Wright <lb/>observed: <lb/>&quot;These general words cannot be read in <lb/>their apparent generality. The whole Act was <lb/>intended to settle doubts which had arisen as to <lb/>the effect of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, <lb/>and must be read with reference to the general <lb/>context......&quot; <lb/>In this view, section 3 must also be construed in the <lb/>light of the preamble, and so construed, it cannot, for the <lb/>reasons already given, have any bearing on the rights of <lb/>the parties. Moreover, that section only enacts that &quot;all <lb/>provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations over&quot; <lb/>shall take effect according to their tenor, and what is <lb/>relied on is not any provision, restriction, condition or <lb/>limitation over, in Exhibit A which according to its tenor <lb/>entitles the respondents to hold the lands rent-free, but the <lb/>absolute character of the interest conveyed under Exhibit <lb/>A. Therefore, section 3 does not in terms apply.&quot; <lb/>(iii) Fruit &amp; Vegetable Merchants Union, Subzi, Mandi, Delhi vs. Delhi <lb/>Improvement Trust, Regal Buildings, Cannaught Place, New Delhi, reported in <lb/>AIR 1957 SC 344 : <lb/>&quot;19. <lb/>That the word &quot;vest&quot; is a word of variable <lb/>import is shown by provisions of Indian statutes also. For <lb/>example, s. 56 of the Provincial Insolvency Act (V of <lb/>1920) empowers the court at the time of the making of the <lb/>order of adjudication or thereafter to appoint a receiver for <lb/>the property of the insolvent and further provides that &quot; <lb/>such property shall thereupon vest in the receiver.&quot; The <lb/>property vests in the receiver for the purpose of <lb/>administering the estate of the insolvent for the payment <lb/>of his debts after realising his assets. The property of the <lb/>insolvent vests in the receiver not for all purposes but <lb/>only for the purpose of the Insolvency Act and the <lb/>receiver has no interest of his own in the property. On the <lb/>other hand, ss. 16 and 17 of the Land Acquisition Act. <lb/>(Act I of 1894), provide that the property so acquired, <lb/>upon the happening of certain events, shall &apos;&apos;vest&quot; <lb/></body>

			<page>86 <lb/></page>

			<body>absolutely in the Government free from all <lb/>encumbrances&apos;. In the cases contemplated by ss. 16 and 17 <lb/>the property acquired becomes. the property of <lb/>Government without any conditions or limitations either <lb/>as to title or possession. The legislature has made it clear <lb/>that the vesting of the property is not for any limited <lb/>purpose or limited duration. It would thus appear that the <lb/>word &quot;vest&quot; has not got a fixed connotation, meaning in <lb/>all cases that the property is owned by the person or the <lb/>autho-rity in whom it vests. It may vest in title, or it may <lb/>vest in possession, or it may vest in a limited sense, as <lb/>indicated in the context in which it may have been used in <lb/>a particular piece of legislation. The provisions of the <lb/>Improvement Act, particularly ss. 45 to 49 and 54 and <lb/>54A when they speak of a certain building or street or <lb/>square or other land vesting in a municipality or other <lb/>local body or in a trust, do not necessarily mean that <lb/>ownership has passed to any of them. <lb/>20. The question of the ownership of the structure <lb/>built upon Government land by the Trust may be looked at <lb/>from another point of view. We have already held that the <lb/>Trust was in the position of a statutory agent of <lb/>Government and had erected the structure with money <lb/>belonging to Government but advanced at interest to the <lb/>Trust. In such a situation the structure also would be the <lb/>property of Government, though for the time being it may <lb/>be at the disposal of the Trust for the purpose of managing <lb/>it efficiently as a statutory body. Simply because the Trust <lb/>erected the structure in question and later on paid up the <lb/>amount advanced by Government for the purpose would <lb/>not necessarily lead to the,legal inference that the structure <lb/>was the property of the Trust. In this connection reference <lb/>may be made to the decision of this Court in Bhatia Co-<lb/>operative Housing Society Ltd. v. D. C. Patel(1). The case <lb/>is not on all fours with the facts of the present case. But <lb/>the following observations of Das J. (as he then was) at p. <lb/>195 of the report are pertinent:-<lb/>&quot; It is true that the lessee erected the <lb/>building at his own cost but he did so for the <lb/>lessor and on the lessor&apos;s land on agreed terms. <lb/>The fact that the lessee incurred expenses in <lb/>putting up the building is precisely the <lb/>consideration for the lessor granting him a lease, <lb/>for 999 years not only of the building but of the <lb/></body>

			<page>87 <lb/></page>

			<body>land as well at what may, for all we know, be a <lb/>cheap rent which the lessor may not have <lb/>otherwise agreed to do. By the agreement the <lb/>building became the property of the lessor and <lb/>the lessor demised the land and the building <lb/>which, in the circumstances, in law and in fact <lb/>belonged to the lessor. The law. of fixtures <lb/>under s. 108 of the Transfer of Property Act may <lb/>be different from the English law, but s. 108 is <lb/>subject to any agreement that the parties may <lb/>choose to make. Here, by the agreement the <lb/>building became part of the land and the <lb/>property of the lessor and the lessee took a lease <lb/>on that footing.&quot; <lb/>(iv) The Director of Rationing and Distribution vs. The Corporation of <lb/>Calcutta, reported in AIR 1960 Supreme Court 1355 : <lb/>&quot;38.... There is nothing in the Act of 1923 or in the Act <lb/>of 1951 exempting the State specifically from any of the <lb/>provisions of the Calcutta Municipal Act. In this case the <lb/>State is being prosecuted under s. 488 (or s. 537 now) and <lb/>that section provides for fine for breach of s. 386 (or s. 437 <lb/>now). The provision is a penal provision&apos; and immediately a <lb/>question arises whether the State as such, apart from its <lb/>individual officers as natural persons, is liable to prosecution <lb/>under the criminal law or has to be exempted from the <lb/>operation of the provisions of criminal statutes by necessary <lb/>implication. A criminal proceeding generally ends with <lb/>punishment which may be imprisonment, or fine, or both. <lb/>Now it does not require any elaborate reason to realise that <lb/>the State as such cannot be sentenced to imprisonment <lb/>because there is no way of keeping it in prison; therefore, by <lb/>necessary implication, the State is exempt from all penal <lb/>statutes and provisions providing for sentences of <lb/>imprisonment or death. Then come those penal provisions <lb/>which impose fines, like the present case, and the question is <lb/>whether in such a case also the State must be deemed by <lb/>necessary implication to be exempt from the penal provision. <lb/>Generally speaking fines when inflicted by courts are <lb/>realised by the State and go to the coffers of the State. In <lb/>effect, therefore if the State as such is to be prosecuted under <lb/>a penal statute imposing fine the result is that the Court will <lb/>sentence the State to fine which will go to the State itself. It <lb/>is obvious that if such is the result of a prosecution, namely <lb/></body>

			<page>88 <lb/></page>

			<body>that the accused gets the fine, the intention could never be <lb/>that such a prosecution should be launched. Therefore where <lb/>the penalty is fine and the fine goes to the State, it must be <lb/>held that by necessary implication the law does not intend <lb/>the State to be prosecuted for such an offence. In the present <lb/>case I find that under s. 81 of the Act of 1923 (or the corres-<lb/>ponding s. 115 of the Act of 1951) the fines imposed by the <lb/>Magistrate will not go to the Corporation but in the usual <lb/>way to the State. Under the circumstances whatever other <lb/>methods may be possible for enforcing the provisions of s. <lb/>386 (or s. 437 now) against the State it cannot be intended to <lb/>be enforced by prosecution resulting in fine which would go <lb/>to the State itself. In these circumstances it must be held that <lb/>by necessary implication the State is exempt from the penal <lb/>provisions contained in s. 488 (now s. 537). I would <lb/>therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the <lb/>High Court and restore the order of acquittal by the <lb/>Magistrate.&quot; <lb/>(v) State of Orissa vs. Ram Chandra Dev and another, reported in AIR <lb/>1964 Supreme Court 685 : <lb/>&quot;(4) When these petitions were argued before the High <lb/>Court, the High Court took the view that it was impossible <lb/>for it to decide the important question of title in writ <lb/>proceedings under Art. 226. It expressed the opinion, and we <lb/>think rightly, that such a question of title can be decided only <lb/>in a properly constituted suit where both parties would get <lb/>sufficient opportunity to adduce all material evidence <lb/>bearing on the question in dispute. Having reached this <lb/>conclusion, the High Court proceeded to examine the narrow <lb/>question as to whether the ex-Zamindars should be <lb/>maintained in their possession of the Maliahs until eviction <lb/>in due course of law, or whether they should be driven to the <lb/>civil court to establish their right after Government has <lb/>successfully evicted them by use of force or show of force. <lb/>In dealing with the petitions on this narrow ground the High <lb/>Court recognised that the existence of a right is the very <lb/>foundation of the exercise of its jurisdiction under Art. 226 <lb/>and it thought that possession of the lands for more than 80 <lb/>years with the ex-Zamindars afforded evidence of a right <lb/>which could sustain their petitions under Art. 226. It was <lb/>urged before the High Court that S. 9 of the Specific Relief <lb/>Act which affords a speedy and summary remedy to a person <lb/></body>

			<page>89 <lb/></page>

			<body>in possession who has been dispossessed is not applicable <lb/>where dispossession of a person in possession is caused by <lb/>the Central Government or any State Government, for that is <lb/>the effect of the clear provision in that behalf under S. 9 <lb/>itself. The High Court, however, was inclined to take the <lb/>view that the right to recover possession vesting in a person <lb/>who had been in possession prior to such dispossession <lb/>which is implicit in S. 9 can be enforced under Art. 226 by a <lb/>party even against the Central Government or the State <lb/>Government, and in that sense, the jurisdiction of the High <lb/>Court under Art. 226 was not limited in the manner in which <lb/>the jurisdiction of civil courts is limited under S. 9. The High <lb/>Court then expressed itself somewhat strongly against the <lb/>intention of the appellant to recover possession from the ex-<lb/>Zamindars merely be resuming the grants without taking <lb/>recourse to a court of law and so, it held that the ex-<lb/>Zamindars who had moved it under Art. 226 were entitled to <lb/>an appropriate writ under the said Article. The appellant then <lb/>moved the High Court for a certificate and it is with the <lb/>certificate issued by the High Court that it has come to this <lb/>Court in the present two appeals. <lb/>11. As we have already observed, the High Court did <lb/>not embark upon the enquiry as to title in the present <lb/>proceedings, because that is a question which may be <lb/>appropriately tried in a regular suit. In proceeding to issue a <lb/>writ in favour of the respondents, the High Court, however, <lb/>appears to have assumed that the appellant was not entitled <lb/>to seek to recover possession of the properties after resuming <lb/>the grants in question. Whether or not the grants in question <lb/>are resumable, and if they are, whether or not the appellant <lb/>can recover possession without filing a suit, are questions on <lb/>which we propose to express no opinion in the present <lb/>appeals. Ordinarily, where property has been granted by the <lb/>State on conditions which make the grant resumable, after <lb/>resumption it is the grantee who moves the Court for <lb/>appropriate relief, and that proceeds on the basis that the <lb/>grantor State which has reserved to itself the right to resume <lb/>may, after exercising its right, seek to recover possession of <lb/>the property without filing a suit. But apart from this aspect <lb/>of the matter, it is difficult to see how the High Court was <lb/>justified in issuing the writ in the present appeals the <lb/>inevitable consequence of which would be that the <lb/>respondents would remain in possession of the property until <lb/></body>

			<page>90 <lb/></page>

			<body>the appellant files a suit against them; and that, in our <lb/>opinion, would not be justified unless questions of title are <lb/>determined and it is held that the appellant must file a suit <lb/>before the respondents can be dispossessed. It appears that in <lb/>issuing the writ in favour of the respondents, the High Court <lb/>failed to appreciate the legal effect of its conclusion that <lb/>questions of title cannot be tried in writ proceedings. Once it <lb/>is held that the question of title cannot be determined, it <lb/>follows that no right can be postulated in favour of the <lb/>respondents on the basis of which a writ can be issued in <lb/>their favour under Article 226. <lb/>12. Mr. Tatachari, however, has contended that the <lb/>right on which the petitions of the respondents are founded is <lb/>a right flowing from the respondents&apos; continuous possession <lb/>of the properties for many years, and he argues that if such a <lb/>right is proved, the High Court would be justified in issuing <lb/>a writ protecting that right. This argument is clearly <lb/>fallacious. Mere possession of the property for however long <lb/>a period it may be, will not clothe the possessor with any <lb/>legal right if it is shown that the possession is under a grant <lb/>from the State which is resumable. Such long possession <lb/>may give him a legal right to protect his possession against <lb/>third parties, but as between the State and the grantee, <lb/>possession of the grantee under a resumable grant cannot be <lb/>said to confer any right on the grantee which would justify a <lb/>claim for a writ under Article 226 where the grant has been <lb/>resumed. In dealing with this argument, we have assumed <lb/>without deciding that though a suit under Section 9 of the <lb/>Specific Relief Act would have been incompetent against the <lb/>appellant, a similar relief can be claimed by the respondents <lb/>against the appellant under Article 226. Even on that <lb/>assumption, no right can be claimed by the respondents <lb/>merely on the ground of their possession, unless their right to <lb/>remain in possession is established against the appellant, and <lb/>this can be done if the grant is held to be not resumable.&quot; <lb/>(vi) State of Andhra vs. Gathala Abhishekam and others, reported in <lb/>AIR 1964 Andhra Pradesh 450 : <lb/>&quot;24. It is profitable to refer to the Government Grants <lb/>Act, XV of 1895 in this connection. That Act was enacted to <lb/>remove certain doubts which had arisen as to the extent and <lb/>operation of the Transfer of Property Act and as to the power <lb/></body>

			<page>91 <lb/></page>

			<body>of the Government to impose limitations and restrictions <lb/>upon grants and other transfers of land made by it or under <lb/>its authority. Section 2 of the said Act categorically states <lb/>that nothing in the Transfer of Property Act contained shall <lb/>apply or be deemed ever to have applied to any grant or <lb/>transfer of land or of interest therein and made by or on <lb/>behalf of the Government to or in favour of any person <lb/>whosoever, but every grant and transfer shall be construed <lb/>and take effect as if the said Act had not been passed. <lb/>Section 3 enjoins that all provisions, restrictions, conditions <lb/>and limitations ever contained in any such grant or transfer <lb/>as aforesaid shall be valid and take effect according to their <lb/>tenor any rule of law, statutes or enactment of the <lb/>Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding. It is thus evident <lb/>that the ordinary rule applicable to a grant made by a subject <lb/>does not apply to a grant made by the sovereign authority, <lb/>and the giants made by the sovereign are to be construed <lb/>most favourably for the sovereign. It is capable of important <lb/>relaxations in favour of the subject. If the intention is <lb/>obvious, a fair and liberal interpretation must be given to the <lb/>grant to enable it to take effect; and the operative part, if <lb/>plainly expressed, may take effect notwithstanding <lb/>qualifications in the recitals. In cases where the grant is for <lb/>valuable consideration, it is construed in favour of the <lb/>grantee, for the honour of the sovereign; and where two <lb/>constructions are possible, one valid and the other void, that <lb/>which is valid ought to be preferred, for the honour of the <lb/>sovereign&apos;s profit. <lb/>According to the said Act however the Crown has <lb/>unfettered discretion to impose any condition, limitation, or <lb/>restriction in its grants. It is not only the Transfer of Property <lb/>Act that is affected by the Crown Grants Act. Section 3 of <lb/>the Government Grants Act declares the unfettered <lb/>discretion of the Crown to impose such conditions and <lb/>limitations as it thinks fit, no matter what the general law of <lb/>the land is. The effect of Section 3 therefore is that when a <lb/>grant has been made by the Crown, the Crown is not with <lb/>reference to that grant, bound by any of the sections of either <lb/>the Tenancy Act or the Transfer of Property Act or the <lb/>Contract Act, or any other law for the time being in force. It <lb/>therefore follows that any grant made has to be construed in <lb/>accordance with the tenor of the grant, and the grant will <lb/>certainly be regulated in accordance with such tenor. This is <lb/></body>

Secy, of State for India, <lb/>14 Mad LW 386 at p. 387 : (AIR 1921 Mad 409). <lb/>(b) Kallingal Moosa Kutti v.

Sukhi, . <lb/>(e) Namdeo Lokman v. Narmadabai, . <lb/>(f) <lb/>Haji Fasihuddin v. Mohd. Habib, . <lb/>Applying these principles to the facts of the present <lb/>case we experience no difficulty in reaching the conclusion <lb/>that the tenor of the grant clearly indicates that the land was <lb/>assigned on condition that the plaintiffs should pay the fond <lb/>revenue on the prescribed dates. When they have failed to <lb/>pay, it follows that the Government has the right to resume <lb/>and re-enter and take &apos;possession of the land without paying <lb/>any compensation. No notice therefore is contemplated <lb/>under the tenor of the grant. Reference in this regard is <lb/>specifically made to cited -above. That was a case in which <lb/>the principal question which arose for decision was whether <lb/>notice as contemplated by Section 111 (g) of the Transfer of <lb/>Property Act was necessary for the determination of a lease <lb/>for non-payment of rent even where such lease was executed <lb/>before the corning into force of the Transfer of Property Act. <lb/>Discussing elaborately the law and authorities their <lb/>Lordships came to the conclusion that no such notice was <lb/>necessary and that the defaulting lessee cannot claim the <lb/>benefit of a notice in writing to complete the forfeiture he <lb/>has incurred, and that the lessor has to simply express an <lb/>intention that he is going to avail of the forfeiture and that <lb/>can be done by the filing of the suit, as in English law, in all <lb/>cases not governed by the Transfer of Property Act. <lb/>In this case no notice to determine the grant was <lb/>necessary. The Government by an overt act can indicate that <lb/>they are determining the grant and resuming the land and re-<lb/>entering and taking possession of the land. Admittedly no <lb/>such suit in such a case is necessary. We have therefore to go <lb/></body>

It is also perhaps relevant to <lb/>refer to . In that case it was held that a tenant of a service <lb/>tenure who refuses to perform his services is liable to be <lb/>eject-ed even without a notice to quit. It was found that it <lb/>was an incident of a service tenure that the holder thereof is <lb/>liable to ejectment upon refusal to perform service; as this <lb/>incident would be materially affected, and practically <lb/>destroyed, if the provisions of Section 155 of the Bengal <lb/>Tenancy Act relating to relief against forfeiture were made <lb/>applicable, service tenures must be held to be excepted from <lb/>the operation of that Section.&quot; <lb/>(vii) State of Madras, represented by the Collector of Madras vs. <lb/>T.M.Oosman Haji &amp; Co., Timber Merchants, Basin Bridge Road, Madras &amp; <lb/>Others, reported in 1969 (1) MLJ 433 : <lb/>&quot;14. The learned Government Pleader brought to our <lb/>notice the unreported decision of Natesan, J., in Mallanna <lb/>Gounder v. Muthuswami Gounder and Anr. S.A. No. 482 <lb/>of 1964, where a different view of Section 3 of the <lb/>Government taken in deciding whether the State can claim <lb/>immunity and exemption from the provisions of the Madras <lb/>Cultivating Tenant Protection Act in respect of agricultural <lb/>lands of the Government by virtue of Section 3 of the <lb/>Government Grants agricultural Act. In the case before the <lb/>learned Judge, a lessee of agriculture land government <lb/>Grants sought to rely upon the provisions of the Madras <lb/>Cultivating Act land from Govern-section Act and the State <lb/>met by putting forward a claim to immunity and exemption <lb/>from the provisions of that Act, by reason of the <lb/>Government Grants Act. The learned Judge held, firstly, <lb/>that the plaintiff&apos;s in the suit would be a cultivating tenant <lb/>within the meaning of the Madras Cultivating tenant the <lb/>Act should apply, he could not be evicted from his holding. <lb/>The State was undoubtedly the landlord and but for the <lb/>claim to immunity by reason of the Government Grants <lb/>Act, Section 3 of the Madras Cultivating Tenants <lb/>Protection act would afford protection to the tenant against <lb/>eviction. The learned Judge examined the provisions of the <lb/>Government Grants Act. He referred to the decisions <lb/>already cited by us earlier in this judgment He cited the <lb/></body>

			<body>observation to the Privy Council in Thakur Jagannath <lb/>Baksh Singh v. The United Provinces (1946) F.C.R. in : <lb/>(1946) F.L.J. 88 : L.R. 73 I.A. 123 : (1946) 2 M.L.J. 29 that <lb/>the generality&quot; and the observations of the Supreme Court <lb/>in Collector of Bombay v. Nasserwanji . The learned Judge <lb/>construed the observation that the general words in Section <lb/>3 cannot be read in their apparent generality to mean that <lb/>the scope of Section 3 of that Act was limited. It seems to <lb/>us that the observations both of the they were made. In the <lb/>Privy Council decision the validity of the Provinces which <lb/>Tenancy Act, as enacted by the Provincial Legislature <lb/>.United Provinces as it affected the rights conferred upon a <lb/>grantee under a Sannad. The contention then was that since <lb/>under the terms of the grant it was open to sannad. The <lb/>contention to deal with the land and the tenancy as he liked, <lb/>the impunged to the sannad-holder far as it interfered with <lb/>his right to deal with his tenants in any impunged <lb/>legislation , in so to the terms of the grant. The Judicial <lb/>Committee pointed out that any way was contrary power <lb/>could not be attacked and the Statute regulating the <lb/>relations that the legislative landlord and the tenant, though <lb/>it might affect or diminish the rights between the landlord <lb/>possessed earlier, did not in any way run contrary to <lb/>Section 3 of the Government Grants Act. By making a <lb/>grant of that description, the legislature did not deprive <lb/>itself of any power to legislate within the scope of its <lb/>authority, and the contention that by reason of the sannad, <lb/>the pre-existing relations between the sannad-holder and <lb/>his tenants could not be interfered with by legislation of <lb/>this kind was repelled, and it is in that context. Nor do the <lb/>observations of the Supreme Court in the next case referred <lb/>to above lead to a different conclusion. After quoting the <lb/>passage from the Supreme Court decision, Natesan, J. <lb/>proceeded to say that &quot;the Government Grants Act thus <lb/>being unavailable, the State sought to stand on the archaic <lb/>prerogative and immunity of the Crown from the operation <lb/>of the statutes...&quot; and proceeded to consider whether under <lb/>the general law the Crown was not bound by any statute, <lb/>unless the statute expressly or by clear implication so <lb/>bound it. We are unable to subscribe to the view taken by <lb/>our learned brother that the Government Grants Act <lb/>became &apos;unavailable&apos; solely by reason of the observations of <lb/>the Privy Council and the Supreme Court. We have already <lb/>pointed out that under the law as it stands at present, the <lb/></body>

			<page>95 <lb/></page>

			<body>State is bound by any legislation, unless it is expressly or <lb/>by necessary implication excluded from the operation of <lb/>that statutes in relation to certain matters covered by that <lb/>piece of legislation. In effect, the view of Natesan, J., <lb/>would appear to be that the two decision, that of the Privy <lb/>Council and of the Supreme Court, have virtually destroyed <lb/>the basis of the Government Grants Act, and that in so far <lb/>as transactions dealt with by that Act are concerned, the <lb/>Government by reason of the provisions contained in that <lb/>Act cannot claim immunity from the operation of any other <lb/>statute. We are unable to agree in the view taken by our <lb/>learned brother that the earlier decisions of this Court in <lb/>Murugesa Gramani v. Province of Madras (1946) 2 M.L.J. <lb/>171, Ullattuthedi Chovi v. Secretary of State for India <lb/>(1921) 41 M.L.J. 494 and Kallingal Moosa Kutty v. The <lb/>Secretary of Stale for India (1920) I.L.R. 43 Mad. 65 : 37 <lb/>M.L.J. 332, may not be good law after the decisions of the <lb/>Judicial Committee and the Supreme Court cited above. <lb/>Neither expressly nor by necessary implication does the <lb/>Government Grants Act either stand repealed or has fallen <lb/>into obsolescence. We hold that it is open to the State to <lb/>put forward successfully the contention that the express <lb/>stipulation found in the terms of the grant, such as that of <lb/>the lessee should surrender possession after the expiry of <lb/>the term of demise etc. can take effect, notwithstanding the <lb/>provisions of the Madras Cultivating Tenants Protection <lb/>Act. It is also our view that it is not necessary for the <lb/>Madras City Tenants Protection Act to contain any <lb/>provision excluding the State from its operation, for such <lb/>an exclusion from the operation of any particular enactment <lb/>may be found in a different enactment covering the same <lb/>field. In so far as the Madras City Tenants Protection Act <lb/>provides for the control over the eviction of cultivating <lb/>tenants, though the relevant section excluding its operation <lb/>in the case of lands belonging to certain specified bodies <lb/>are concerned does not expressly refer to the exclusion of <lb/>lands belonging to the State, the Government Grants Act <lb/>confers that exclusion.&quot; <lb/>(viii) Maharaj Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others, reported in <lb/>(1977) 1 SCC 155 : <lb/>&quot;15. <lb/>In the instant case the Act contemplates <lb/>taking over of all zamindari rights as part of land reform. <lb/></body>

			<page>96 <lb/></page>

			<body>However, instead of centralising management of all <lb/>estates at State level, to stimulate local self-government, <lb/>the Act gives an ena-bling power--not obligatory duty--to <lb/>make over these estates to Gaon Sabhas which, so long as <lb/>they are in their hands, will look after them through <lb/>management committees which will be under the statutory <lb/>control of Government under s.126. Apart from <lb/>management, no. power is expressly vested in the Sabhas <lb/>to dispose of the estates absolutely. The fact that as a <lb/>body corporate it can own and sell property does not mean <lb/>that the estates vested in a Sabha can be finally sold away, <lb/>in the teeth of the provisions striking a contrary note. For, <lb/>under s.117(6), if, for any reasons of better management <lb/>or other, the State (Government is but the operational arm <lb/>of the State and cannot, as contended, be delinked as a <lb/>separate entity, in this context) the. State thinks fit to <lb/>amend or cancel the earlier vesting declara-tion or <lb/>notification, it can totally deprive the Sabha of, and <lb/>resume from it, any estate. This plenary power to <lb/>emasculate or extinguish the Sabha&apos;s right to the estate is <lb/>tell-tale. True, this cut-back on the amplitude of the <lb/>vesting is not an incident of the estate created but is <lb/>provided for by the Act itself. Even so, we have to envi-<lb/>sion, in terms of realty law, what are the nature and inci-<lb/>dents of the interest vested in the Sabha--full ownership <lb/>divestible under no circumstances or partial estate with <lb/>the paramount interest still surviving in praesenti in the <lb/>State ?&quot; <lb/>(ix) State of U.P. and another vs. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and <lb/>another, reported in (1991) 4 SCC 139 : <lb/>&quot;38. The dispute is about levy of purchase tax on <lb/>industrial alcohol. The High Court held that the State <lb/>legislature was competent to enact a law imposing <lb/>purchase tax on it in exercise of power under Entry 54 of <lb/>List II. But it struck down the levy as it would disturb <lb/>price structure regulated by Central Government. It was <lb/>held that control of alcohol industry having been taken <lb/>over by the Parliament, for purpose of regulation and <lb/>development the State stood denud-ed of its taxing <lb/>power under Entry 54 of List II to the extent the field of <lb/>price fixation was covered by the price control order <lb/>issued by the Government. And the purchase price being <lb/></body>

			<page>97 <lb/></page>

			<body>component of price fixation which squarely fell within <lb/>the power of Central Government the imposition of <lb/>purchase tax amounted to intrusion into the forbidden <lb/>area of price fixation by Central Government. Support <lb/>for this was drawn, principally, from the two <lb/>Constitution Bench decision in Indian Cement Ltd. v. <lb/>State of Tamil Nadu, [1990] 1 SCC 12 and Synthetic and <lb/>Chemicals v. State of U.P., [1990] 1 SCC 1091. The first <lb/>was relied for the prin-ciple that even a taxing <lb/>legislation by the State could be invalid to the extent it <lb/>trenched on Central legislation on the same subject. And <lb/>the latter for the conclusion that, &apos;however, sales tax <lb/>cannot be charged on industrial alcohol in the present <lb/>case, because under the Ethyl Alcohol (Price Control) <lb/>Orders sales tax cannot be charged by the State on <lb/>industrial alcohol&apos;. Reliance on Indian Cement Ltd. <lb/>(supra) was under complete misapprehension. The State <lb/>in that case attempted to levy cess on royalty. It was held <lb/>to be in-valid. To save it the State attempted to justify it <lb/>as a tax in exercise of power under Entry 50 of List II. <lb/>The submission was negatived as the legislative power <lb/>of State under Entry 50 of List II was &apos;subject to any <lb/>limitation imposed by the Parliament by law relating to <lb/>mineral development&apos;. The Bench held that in view of <lb/>the Parliamentary legislation under Entry 54 of List &apos;I <lb/>and the declaration made under Section 2 and provisions <lb/>of Section 9 of the Act the State legislation was <lb/>overridden to that extent. No such restriction or <lb/>limitation is placed under Entry 54 of List II except that <lb/>the exercise of power has been made subject to the <lb/>provisions of Entry 92 of List I. &quot; <lb/>(x) Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Sun Engineering Works (P) Ltd.), <lb/>reported in (1992) 4 SCC 363 : <lb/>&quot;39.... It is neither desirable nor permissible to pick <lb/>out a word or a sentence from the judgment of this Court, <lb/>divorced from the context of the question under <lb/>consideration and treat it to be the complete &apos;law&apos; declared <lb/>by this Court. The judgment must be read as a whole and <lb/>the observations from the judgment have to be considered <lb/>in the light of the questions which were before this Court. <lb/>A decision of this Court takes its colour from the questions <lb/>involved in the case in which it is rendered and while <lb/></body>

			<body>applying the decision to a later case, the courts must <lb/>carefully try to ascertain the true principle laid down by the <lb/>decision of this Court and not to pick out words or <lb/>sentences from the judgment, divorced from the context of <lb/>the questions under consideration by this Court, to support <lb/>their reasonings. In Madhav Rao Jiwaji Rao Scindia <lb/>Bahadur and Ors. v. Union of India this Court cautioned: <lb/>&quot;It is not proper to regard a word, a <lb/>clause or a sentence occurring in a judgment <lb/>of the Supreme Court, divorced from its <lb/>context, as containing a full exposition of the <lb/>law on a question when the question did not <lb/>even fall to be answered in that judgment. ...&quot; <lb/>(xi) Committee of Management of Pachaiyappa&apos;s Trust vs. Official <lb/>Trustee of Madras and another, reported in (1994) 1 SCC 475 : <lb/>&quot;31. The learned Single Judge was also not right in <lb/>holding that the appellant has no locus standi in the matter. <lb/>Apart from being a tenant on the ground floor of the <lb/>building adjacent to the vacant plot of land the appellant <lb/>trust, is also the residuary legatee under the will and has a <lb/>beneficial interest in the trust property sought to be leased. <lb/>The appellant was, therefore, entitled to raise objections <lb/>regarding grant of lease in favour of Respondent 2 on the <lb/>ground that the said lease was not in the interest of the <lb/>trust property and the said objections could not be brushed <lb/>aside on the view that the appellant had no locus standi.&quot; <lb/>(xii) The Government Grants Act, 1895 : <lb/>&quot;Statement of Objects and Reasons : The Transfer of <lb/>Property Act, 1882, Sections 10-12 invalidate with certain <lb/>exceptions all conditions for the forfeiture of the transferred <lb/>property on alienation by the transferree and all limitations <lb/>over consequent upon any such alienation or any <lb/>insolvency of or attempted alienation by him. The Crown is <lb/>not specifically mentioned in the Act, and it may be <lb/>assumed that it was not designed to impose fetters of this <lb/>description upon the discretion of the Crown, especially as <lb/>to the creation of inalienable jahgirs in grants made for <lb/>public services; but it has been thought better to set the <lb/>question at rest by express legislation. <lb/>Upon a late occasion the Government of India were <lb/></body>

			<page>99 <lb/></page>

			<body>advised that it is not competent for the Crown to create an <lb/>inalienable and impartible estate in the land comprised in <lb/>any <lb/>Crown grant, unless such land has heretofore <lb/>descended by custom as an impartible Raj. The second sub-<lb/>section of the Bill is intended to obviate this inconvenience <lb/>by providing that all Crown grants are to be construed <lb/>according to their tenor, notwithstanding any rule of law <lb/>which might otherwise affect their operation.&quot; <lb/>1. Title and extent : (1) This Act may be called The <lb/>[Government] Grants Act, 1895. <lb/>(2) It extends to the whole of India except [the <lb/>territories which, immediately before the 1 st November, <lb/>1956, were comprised in Part B States].&quot; <lb/>3. Government grants to take effect according to their <lb/>tenor: <lb/>All provisions, restrictions, conditions and <lb/>limitations over contained in any such grant or transfer as <lb/>aforesaid shall be valid and take effect according to their <lb/>tenor, any rule of law, statute or enactment of the <lb/>Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding. &quot; <lb/>(xiii) Anamallai Club vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and others, <lb/>reported in (1997) 3 SCC 169 : <lb/>&quot;8. Law makes a distinction between persons in <lb/>juridical possession and rank trespassers. Law respects <lb/>possession even if there is no valid title to support it. Law <lb/>does not permit any person to take law into his hands and <lb/>to dispossess a person in actual possession without having <lb/>recourse to a court. The object thereby is to encourage <lb/>compliance of the rule of law and to deprive the person <lb/>who wanted, a person in lawful possession to have his <lb/>removed from possession, according to proper from and to <lb/>prevent them from going with a high band and eject such <lb/>person. Undoubtedly, the true owner is entitled to retain <lb/>possession even though he had obtain it by force or by <lb/>other unlawful means but that would not be a ground to <lb/>permit the owner to take law into his own hands and eject <lb/>the person in juridical possession or settled possession <lb/>without recourse to law. <lb/>9. <lb/>Thus, it could be seen that even after <lb/></body>

			<page>100 <lb/></page>

			<body>determination of the licence under the Government Grants <lb/>Act, the Government is entitled resume possession but <lb/>resumption of possession does not mean unilaterally taking <lb/>the possession without recourse to law. The Eviction Act <lb/>contemplates such a procedure. &quot;Premises&quot; defined under <lb/>Section 3(d) of the Act means and land or any building or <lb/>a part of a building or but and enclosed etc. Section 4 <lb/>prescribes procedure of issuance of a notice of show cause <lb/>before eviction giving an opportunity and thereafter taking <lb/>action under Section 5 of the Act. Unfortunately, on the <lb/>facts of the case on hand, the respondent, has not adopted <lb/>the procedure prescribed under Sections 4 and 5 of the <lb/>Eviction Act after determination of the licence granted <lb/>under the Government Grants Act. The High Court, <lb/>therefore, was not right in its conclusion that the procedure <lb/>prescribed under PPE Act is not applicable to the grants <lb/>made under the Government Grants Act since the <lb/>appellants remained in settled possession since a long time <lb/>pursuant to the grant. After determination of the grant, <lb/>though they have no right to remain in possession, the <lb/>State cannot take unilateral possession without taking <lb/>recourse to the procedure, provided under the Act. It is, <lb/>therefore, clear that it would have been open to the <lb/>respondent to have a notice issued to the appellant and <lb/>give time to vacate the premises within 10 days or 15 days <lb/>and, therefore, could leave resumed possession with <lb/>minimal use of police force. We cannot give and direction <lb/>in this case since possession was already resumed. We <lb/>have directed not to create third party right in the property. <lb/>We are not inclined to interfere with the order. <lb/>10. Shri Sorabjee contended that the appellant is <lb/>entitled to notice before the order of termination of grant <lb/>made and so the action is bad in law and so the appellant is <lb/>entitled to restitution of the property. We are not inclined <lb/>to agree with him. The recourse to Article 226 of the <lb/>Constitution, to establish title would not be proper remedy. <lb/>In this case, we are not inclined to go into the question for <lb/>the reason that the High Court has held that the writ <lb/>petition is not maintainable. After termination of the <lb/>licence by the Government under the Government Grants <lb/>Act, the Estate Officer appointed under Section 3 cannot <lb/>go into its correctness and adjudicate in the proceedings <lb/>under Section 3 thereof. In our view, the Division Bench <lb/>of the High Court is right in its finding. The Government <lb/></body>

			<page>101 <lb/></page>

			<body>having determined the licence, the Estate Officer cannot go <lb/>into the question of legality of the termination of the <lb/>licence under the Crown (Government) Grants Act to take <lb/>further steps under Section 4 and 5 of the Act. In that view <lb/>of the situation in this case, we think that it is not <lb/>necessary for the State Government to nominate the Estate <lb/>Officer and for the Estate Officer to give notice under <lb/>Sections 4 and 5. There is not need for State to file a suit <lb/>for eviction. But notice in compliance of principles of <lb/>natural justice should have been given giving reasonable <lb/>time of 10 or 15 days to vacate the premises and to deliver <lb/>vacant and peaceful possession; thereafter, the <lb/>Government would be free to resume possession. Since <lb/>possession was already taken, through we are not <lb/>approving of the manner in which the same was taken, we <lb/>do not think that in this matter notice afresh need be given <lb/>to the appellant. It may be open to the appellant to avail of <lb/>any remedy available in law.&quot; <lb/>(xiv) Hajee S.V.M. Mohamed Jamaludeen Bros. &amp; Co. vs. Government <lb/>of Tamil Nadu, reported in (1997) 3 SCC 466 : <lb/>&quot;7. <lb/>When a Letters Patent Appeal was preferred b <lb/>the Government a division bench of the Madras High <lb/>Court set aside the side decree and dismissed the suit <lb/>holding that clause 7 of the agreement is valid and <lb/>enforceable in view of the provisions in the grants act and <lb/>hence appellant is not entitled to claim damages for the <lb/>action resorted to by a government. <lb/>8. <lb/>If clause 7 of the agreement is valid it is <lb/>binding on both the parties to the contract and the corollary <lb/>is that government had the power to revoke it unilaterally <lb/>and hence termination of the contract is not liable to be <lb/>questioned by the other party. As the division bench <lb/>upheld the validity of clause 7 only on account of its <lb/>protection as per the Grants Act we are mainly called upon <lb/>to decide whether the impugned clause in the agreement <lb/>has the said protection. <lb/>9. Section 2 of the Grants Act insulates all grants <lb/>and all transfers of land or any interest therein made by the <lb/>government from the checks of the provisions of Transfer <lb/>of Property Act. Section 3 of the Grants act protects the <lb/></body>

			<page>102 <lb/></page>

			<body>terms of such grant from the provisions of any other law. <lb/>we extract the above two provision hereunder: <lb/>&quot;2. &quot;Transfer of Property Act, 1882, not to <lb/>apply to Government grants. -Nothing in the <lb/>Transfer of Property Act, 1882, contained shall <lb/>apply or be deemed ever to have applied to any <lb/>grant or other transfer of land or of any interest <lb/>therein heretofore made or hereafter to be made <lb/>by or on behalf of, any person whomsoever; but <lb/>every such grant and transfer shall be construed <lb/>and take effect as if the said Act had not been <lb/>passed.&quot; <lb/>3-&quot;Government grants to take effect <lb/>according to their tenor:-All provisions, <lb/>restrictions, conditions and limitations, contained <lb/>in any such grant or transfer as aforesaid shall be <lb/>valid and the effect according to their tenor any <lb/>rule of law, statute or enactment of the contrary <lb/>notwithstanding.&quot; <lb/>10. The combined effect of the above two sections <lb/>of the Grants Act is that terms of any grant of terms of any <lb/>transfer of land made by a government would stand <lb/>insulted from the tentacles of any statutory law. Section 3 <lb/>places the terms of such grant beyond the reach of any <lb/>restrictive provision contained n any enacted law or even <lb/>the equitable principles of justice equity and good <lb/>conscience adumbrated by common law if such principles <lb/>are inconsistent with such terms. The to provisions are so <lb/>framed as to confer unfettered discretion on the <lb/>government to enforce any condition or limitation or <lb/>restriction in all types of grants made by the government to <lb/>any person. In other words, the rights, privileges and <lb/>obligations of any grantee of the government would be <lb/>completely regulated by the terms of the grant, even if such <lb/>terms are inconsistent with the provisions of any other law. <lb/>11. The above legal position was recognised by the <lb/>courts in India before the Constitution of India came into <lb/>being. (Surja Kanta Roy Choudhury and others vs. <lb/>Secretary of State, Air 1938 cal. 229, and Raza Husain <lb/>Khan &amp; ors. vs. Sayid Mohd. &amp; ors. , AIR 1938 Oudh <lb/>178). The position continued to be so even after the <lb/>Constitution came into force [State of U.P. vs. Zahoor <lb/>Ahmad, 1974 (1) SCR 344 ]. <lb/></body>

			<page>103 <lb/></page>

			<body>12. An attempt was made to show that the <lb/>transaction evidenced by the agreement was not a grant but <lb/>a lease of land. Though it is not now open to the appellant <lb/>to raise such contention (in view of the clear finding of the <lb/>learned single judge that it was not a lease but only a <lb/>licence coupled with interest, which finding was not <lb/>challenged by the appellant before the division bench ) <lb/>assuming the it was lease of land still appellant cannot <lb/>succeed because lease made by the government is also <lb/>covered by the protection envisaged in Section 2 and 3 of <lb/>the Act.&quot; <lb/>(xv) Suganthi Suresh Kumar vs. Jagdeeshan, reported in (2002) 2 <lb/>SCC 420 : <lb/>&quot;11. When this Court pronounced in Hari Singh v. <lb/>Sukhbir Singh, (supra) that a court may enforce an order to <lb/>pay compensation &quot;by imposing a sentence in default&quot; it is <lb/>open to all courts in India to follow the said course. The said <lb/>legal position would continue to hold good until it is <lb/>overruled by larger Bench of this court. Hence learned single <lb/>judge of High Court of Kerala has committed an impropriety <lb/>by expressing that the said legal direction of this Court <lb/>should not be followed by the subordinate courts in Kerala. <lb/>We express our disapproval of the course adopted by the said <lb/>judge in Rajendran v. Jose, (2001) 3 Kerala Law Times 431. <lb/>It is unfortunate that when the Sessions judge has correctly <lb/>done a course in accordance with the discipline the Single <lb/>judge of the High Court has incorrectly reversed it.&quot; <lb/>(xvi) Union of India and others vs. Kannadapara Sanghatanegala <lb/>Okkuta &amp; Kannadigara and others, reported in (2002) 10 SCC 226 : <lb/>&quot;5. We do not find any basis for the High Court coming <lb/>to the conclusion that the decision of the Union Cabinet was <lb/>vitiated on account of legal malafides. Merely because an <lb/>administrative decision has been taken to locate the <lb/>headquarters at Bangalore, which decision is subsequently <lb/>altered by the same authority, namely, the Union Cabinet, <lb/>cannot lead one to the conclusion that there has been legal <lb/>mala fides. Why the headquarters should be at Hubli and <lb/>not at Bangalore, is not for the court to decide. There are <lb/></body>

			<page>104 <lb/></page>

			<body>various factors which have to be taken into consideration <lb/>when a decision like this has to be arrived at. Assuming that <lb/>the decision so taken is a political one, it cannot possibly <lb/>give rise to a challenge on the ground of legal mala fides. A <lb/>political decision, if taken by a competent authority in <lb/>accordance with law, cannot per se be regarded as mala fide. <lb/>In any case, there is nothing on the record to show that the <lb/>present decision was motivated by political consideration. <lb/>The observation of the High Court that there has been a <lb/>change in the decision because there was a change of the <lb/>Government and a different political party had come into <lb/>power, is not supported by any basis. That the court will not <lb/>interfere in questions of policy decision is clearly brought <lb/>out by the following passage from a decision of this Court in <lb/>Delhi Science Forum v. Union of India. ...&quot; <lb/>(xvii) Sharda Devi vs. State of Bihar and another, reported in (2003) <lb/>3 SCC 128; <lb/>&quot;25. Keeping in view the principles laid down by <lb/>this Court in Dr. G.H. Grant&apos;s case (supra) and analyzing <lb/>in-depth the provisions of the Act the difference between <lb/>reference under Section 18 and the one under Section 30 <lb/>can be summarized and set out as under:-<lb/>By reference to locus <lb/>Under Section 18(1) a reference can be made by <lb/>Collector only upon an application in writing having been <lb/>made by (i) any person interested (ii) who has not accepted <lb/>the award (iii) making application in writing, to the <lb/>Collector, requiring a reference by the Collector to the <lb/>Court (iv) for determination of any one of the four disputes <lb/>(specified in the provision), and (v) stating the grounds on <lb/>which objection to the award is taken. For reference under <lb/>Section 30 no application in writing is required. The prayer <lb/>may be made orally or in writing or the reference may be <lb/>made suo motu by the Collector without any one having <lb/>invited the attention of the Collector for making the <lb/>reference. <lb/>By reference to the disputes referable <lb/>Under Section 18(1) there are four types of disputes <lb/>which can be referred to Civil Court for determination. <lb/>They are the disputes: (i) as to the measurement of the land, <lb/>(ii) as to the amount of the compensation, (iii) as to the <lb/>persons to whom the compensation is payable, or (d) as to <lb/></body>

			<page>105 <lb/></page>

			<body>the apportionment of the compensation among the persons <lb/>interested. Under Section 30 the only disputes which are <lb/>referable are : (i) any dispute as to the apportionment of the <lb/>amount of compensation or any part thereof, or (ii) a <lb/>dispute as to the persons to whom the amount of <lb/>compensation or any part thereof is payable. A dispute as to <lb/>the measurement of the land or as to the quantum of <lb/>compensation or a dispute of a nature not falling within <lb/>Section 30, can neither be referred by the Collector under <lb/>Section 30 of the Act nor would the Civil Court acquire <lb/>jurisdiction to enter into and determine the same. <lb/>By reference to nature of power <lb/>Under Section 18 of the Act the Collector does not <lb/>have power to withhold the reference. Once a written <lb/>application has been made satisfying the requirements of <lb/>Section 18, the Collector shall make a reference. The <lb/>Collector has no discretion in the matter; whether the <lb/>dispute has any merit or not is to be left for the <lb/>determination of the Court. Under Section 30 the Collector <lb/>may refer such dispute to the decision of the Court. The <lb/>Collector has discretion in the matter. Looking to the nature <lb/>of the dispute raised, the person who is raising the dispute, <lb/>the delay in inviting the attention of the Court, and so on <lb/>are such illustrative factors which may enter into the <lb/>consideration by the Collector while exercising the <lb/>discretion. If the Collector makes the reference it may be <lb/>decided by the Court subject to its forming an opinion that <lb/>the dispute was capable of reference and determination <lb/>under Section 30 of the Act. In case the Collector refuses to <lb/>make a reference under Section 30 of the Act, the person <lb/>adversely affected by withholding of the reference or <lb/>refusal to make the reference shall be at liberty to pursue <lb/>such other remedy as may be available to him under the law <lb/>such as filing a writ petition or a civil suit. <lb/>By reference to limitation <lb/>Under Section 18 the written application requiring <lb/>the matter to be referred by the Collector for the <lb/>determination of the Court shall be filed within six weeks <lb/>from the date of the Collector&apos;s award if the person making <lb/>it was present or represented before the Collector at the <lb/>time when he made his award or within six weeks of the <lb/>notice from the Collector under Section 12(2) or within six <lb/>months from the date of the Collector&apos;s award, whichever <lb/></body>

			<page>106 <lb/></page>

			<body>period shall first expire. There is no such limitation <lb/>prescribed under Section 30 of the Act. The Collector may <lb/>at any time, not bound by the period of limitation, exercise <lb/>his power to make the reference. The expression &apos;the person <lb/>present or represented&apos; before the Collector at the time <lb/>when he made his award would include within its meaning <lb/>a person who shall be deemed to be present or represented <lb/>before the Collector at the time when the award is made. <lb/>No one can extend the period of limitation by taking <lb/>advantage of his own wrong. Though no limitation is <lb/>provided for making a reference under Section 30 of the <lb/>Act, needless to say, where no period of limitation for <lb/>exercise of any statutory power is prescribed the power can <lb/>nevertheless be exercised only within a reasonable period; <lb/>what is a reasonable period in a given case shall depend on <lb/>the facts and circumstances of each case.&quot; <lb/>(xviii) Federation of Railway Officers Association and others vs. Union <lb/>of India, reported in (2003) 4 SCC 289 : <lb/>&quot;18. Even if we assume that there is force in the <lb/>material placed by the petitioners that by forming new <lb/>railway zones efficiency in the railway administration <lb/>would not enhance, the reasons given by the Government <lb/>and material placed by them in support of forming new <lb/>railway zones is no less or even more forceful. Further, <lb/>when technical questions arise and experts in the field have <lb/>expressed various views and all those aspects have been <lb/>taken into consideration by the Government, in deciding <lb/>the matter, could it still be said that this Court should <lb/>reexamine to interfere with the same. The wholesome rule <lb/>in regard to judicial interference in administrative decisions <lb/>is that if the Government takes into consideration all <lb/>relevant factors, eschew from considering irrelevant factors <lb/>and act reasonably within the parameters of the law, courts <lb/>would keep off the same. Even on the test suggested by Dr. <lb/>Pal we cannot travel outside this principle to sit in appeal <lb/>on the decision of the Government. <lb/>19. The decision in B.S.Muddappa&apos;s case is <lb/>distinguishable both on principle and on facts from the <lb/>present case. The question in that case is whether &apos;park&apos; can <lb/>be alloted to a trust for setting up of a private nursing <lb/>home. There is no application of mind by any of the <lb/></body>

			<page>107 <lb/></page>

			<body>authorities as to whether setting up a nursing home in place <lb/>of a &apos;park&apos; would amount to an improvement as <lb/>contemplated under the statute with which this court was <lb/>concerned in that case. In the present case, the problem is <lb/>entirely different. The question before the Court is whether <lb/>formation of zones is for efficient administration of <lb/>Railways. On this aspect we have considered the rival <lb/>contentions including the material placed before the <lb/>Government of India and the criteria evolved for formation <lb/>of the zones. The test whether such formation of zones is <lb/>for the purpose of efficient administration of Railways have <lb/>been duly considered by the Government before taking <lb/>decision while such consideration was lacking in <lb/>Muddappa&apos;s case. Hence, that decision cannot be of any <lb/>assistance to appellant. We have applied the principles set <lb/>out in other decisions relied upon by the appellant to the <lb/>facts of the case in reaching our conclusion in this matter.&quot; <lb/>(xix) Escorts Farms Ltd. vs. Commissioner, Kumaon Division, <lb/>Nainital, U.P. And others, reported in (2004) 4 SCC 281 : <lb/>&quot;4. The lands were released to the ruler for its <lb/>development and for making it cultivable within the <lb/>prescribed period. The terms of the Govt. Grant are contained <lb/>in letter dated 26.1.1950 of the Deputy Secretary to the Govt. <lb/>of UP addressed to the Director of Colonization, Lucknow, <lb/>U.P. Consequent to the release of the lands in favour of the <lb/>ruler, no formal lease containing the terms and conditions of <lb/>the Govt. Grant came to be executed between the erstwhile <lb/>ruler and the Government of U.P. but it is not in dispute that <lb/>the possession of the lands under the grant was taken on the <lb/>basis of the proposal of the government, contained in the <lb/>letter dated 29.8.1950. The rights and liabilities of the parties <lb/>are governed by the terms of the said Govt. Grant. <lb/>20. The Learned Counsel for the Farm contended that <lb/>the land subjected to ceiling was held by the Company as a <lb/>Govt. Grantee pursuant to the letter of the Deputy Secretary <lb/>to the Govt. of U.P. dated 26.1.1950 referred above. The <lb/>tenure holder of the land, therefore, within the meaning of the <lb/>Ceiling Act was the Company i.e. the Govt. Grantee and all <lb/>proceedings initiated by notice to the Farm, submission of <lb/>statement and declaration by the Farm culminating in the <lb/>orders passed by the prescribed authority and the appellate <lb/></body>

			<body>authority were void and infructuous because the Govt. <lb/>Grantee, as holder of the land, was not at all a party before <lb/>the ceiling authority.&quot; <lb/>(xx) Bajaj Hindustan Limited vs. Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises Limited and <lb/>another, reported in (2011) 1 SCC 640 : <lb/>&quot;The lands were released to the ruler for its <lb/>development and for making it cultivable within the <lb/>prescribed period. The terms of the Govt. Grant are <lb/>contained in letter dated 26.1.1950 of the Deputy Secretary <lb/>to the Govt. of UP addressed to the Director of <lb/>Colonization, Lucknow, U.P. Consequent to the release of <lb/>the lands in favour of the ruler, no formal lease containing <lb/>the terms and conditions of the Govt. Grant came to be <lb/>executed between the erstwhile ruler and the Government <lb/>of U.P. but it is not in dispute that the possession of the <lb/>lands under the grant was taken on the basis of the proposal <lb/>of the government, contained in the letter dated 29.8.1950. <lb/>The rights and liabilities of the parties are governed by the <lb/>terms of the said Govt. Grant. <lb/>(xxi) Pradeep Oil Corporation vs. Municipal Corporation of Delhi and <lb/>another, reported in (2011) 5 SCC 270 : <lb/>&quot;45. By reason of the agreement in question, the <lb/>buildings in question do not belong to the Administration. <lb/>Admittedly, it belongs to the grantee i.e. appellant herein. <lb/>As discussed hereinbefore, the Oil tanks has been <lb/>construed as buildings for the purposes of tax. Therefore, <lb/>Section 119 of the MCD Act would not apply to the <lb/>building in question. That being the case, the <lb/>grantee/appellant is liable to pay tax although the <lb/>ownership of the land may belong to the Administration. <lb/>46. Section 115 of the MCD Act clearly <lb/>provides that the general tax shall be payable in respect of <lb/>lands and buildings. Such lands and buildings may be in <lb/>lawful occupation of the owner. The occupation of the said <lb/>building may be lawful or unlawful. Even in a case where <lb/>apartments are constructed on the land belonging to the <lb/>Government or a statutory body but the occupier of the <lb/>apartment is liable to pay tax. If a person encroaches upon <lb/></body>

			<page>109 <lb/></page>

			<body>somebody&apos;s lands and constructs buildings thereupon, he <lb/>would also be liable to pay tax. Once it is held that the <lb/>grantee were liable to pay tax, the same becomes payable <lb/>from the date of accrual of the liability. The said position is <lb/>also fortified from specific stipulation in the agreement that <lb/>the liability to pay all taxes including municipal taxes is on <lb/>the grantee. <lb/>47. The learned counsel for the appellant has placed <lb/>strong reliance on the decision of this Court in HUDCO v. <lb/>MCD; (2001) 1 SCC 455 to contend that land belonging to <lb/>the government is immune from the payment of property <lb/>tax by virtue of section 119(1) of the DMC Act and Article <lb/>285 of the Constitution of India. In the HUDCOs case <lb/>vacant land of the government, prior to execution of the <lb/>lease deed in favour of HUDCO, was sought to be taxed <lb/>and that no building had been constructed by HUDCO. <lb/>HUDCOs own case was that interest in land could pass <lb/>only on execution of lease and construction thereon under <lb/>section 120(2) of the MCD Act. MCD had invoked Section <lb/>120(1) DMC Act to fasten liability on HUDCO and not <lb/>under Section 120(2) DMC Act after construction was <lb/>made by HUDCO and lease deed executed bythe <lb/>government. In that case, this Court has held that vacant <lb/>land belonging to the Government was not taxable by <lb/>virtue of section 119 DMC Act and Article 285 of the <lb/>Constitution of India. However, in our considered view, the <lb/>case at hand is totally different. The HUDCO judgment <lb/>dealt with the case where vacant land belonging to the <lb/>lessor/Government and in regard whereto no lease deed had <lb/>been executed and no construction had been made by the <lb/>lessee/HUDCO. The land belonging to the central <lb/>government was sought to be taxed under Section 120(1) of <lb/>the DMC Act which fastens liability on the lessor. Since <lb/>land belonged to UOI the same was exempted from <lb/>payment of tax until the lease deed was executed and <lb/>construction made thereon by HUDCO-under Section <lb/>120(2). <lb/>48. Incidence to pay tax under section 120(2) DMC <lb/>Act is with regard to a composite assessment of land and <lb/>buildings as section 120(2) talks of a composite assessment <lb/>only. In the present case vacant land or property of <lb/>Railways is not sought to be taxed as was in the case of <lb/>HUDCO Vs. MCD under section 120(1) DMC Act, but <lb/>property tax/Composite Assessment is sought to be made <lb/></body>

			<page>110 <lb/></page>

			<body>on the installations/stotage depots having been constructed <lb/>by the appellant-by virtue of Section 120(2) DMC Act. It is <lb/>important to notice that w.e.f. the date of execution of lease <lb/>deed and construction made thereon by HUDCO, HUDCO <lb/>has been paying the property tax. HUDCOs case is <lb/>therefore not applicable.&quot; <lb/>(xxii) Government of Tamil Nadu vs. Mecca Prime Tannery and others, <lb/>reported in (2012) 6 MLJ 273 : <lb/>&quot;27. The Supreme Court in the case of Fruit &amp; <lb/>Vegetable Merchants Union vs. Delhi Improvement Trust <lb/>reported in A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 344, thoroughly discussed the <lb/>meaning of the word vest while interpreting different <lb/>provisions of the U.P. Town Improvement Act, 1819. Their <lb/>lordships first quoted the following passage of the <lb/>observations made by Lord Cranworth in Richardson vs. <lb/>Robertson, (1862) 6 L.T. 75 :-14. ... the word &apos;vest&apos; is a <lb/>word, at least of ambiguous import. Prima facie &apos;vesting &apos; in <lb/>possession is the more natural meaning. The expressions <lb/>&apos;investiture&apos; -&apos;clothing&apos; and whatever else be the explanation <lb/>as to the origin of the word, point prima facie rather to the <lb/>enjoyment than to the obtaining of a right. But I am willing <lb/>to accede to the argument that was pressed at the bar, that by <lb/>long usage &apos; vesting&apos; ordinarily means the having obtained <lb/>an absolute and indefeasible right, as contra-distinguished <lb/>from the not having so obtained it. But it cannot be disputed <lb/>that the word &apos;vesting&apos; may mean, and often does mean, that <lb/>which is its primary etymological signification, namely, <lb/>vesting in possession. <lb/>Their lordships of the Supreme Court then observed <lb/>as follows :-<lb/>19. That the word &quot;vest&quot; is a word of variable import <lb/>is shown by provisions of Indian statutes also. For example, <lb/>s.56 of the Provincial Insolvency Act (V of 1920) empowers <lb/>the court at the time of the making of the order of <lb/>adjudication or thereafter to appoint a receiver for the <lb/>property of the insolvent and further provides that &quot; such <lb/>property shall thereupon vest in the receiver.&quot; The property <lb/>vests in the receiver for the purpose of administering the <lb/>estate of the insolvent for the payment of his debts after <lb/>realizing his assets. The property of the insolvent vests in <lb/>the receiver not for all purposes but only for the purpose of <lb/></body>

			<page>111 <lb/></page>

			<body>the Insolvency Act and the receiver has no interest of his <lb/>own in the property. On the other hand, ss. 16 and 17 of the <lb/>Land Acquisition Act. (Act I of 1894), provide that the <lb/>property so acquired, upon the happening of certain events, <lb/>shall&quot; vest absolutely in the Government free from all <lb/>encumbrances&apos;. In the cases contemplated by ss.16 and 17 <lb/>the property acquired becomes. the property of Government <lb/>without any conditions or limitations either as to title or <lb/>possession. The legislature has made it clear that the vesting <lb/>of the property is not for any limited purpose or limited <lb/>duration. It would thus appear that the word &quot;vest&quot; has not <lb/>got a fixed connotation, meaning in all cases that the <lb/>property is owned by the person or the authority in whom it <lb/>vests. It may vest in title, or it may vest in possession, or it <lb/>may vest in a limited sense, as indicated in the context in <lb/>which it may have been used in a particular piece of <lb/>legislation. The provisions of the Improvement Act, <lb/>particularly ss.45 to 49 and 54 and 54A when they speak of <lb/>a certain building or street or square or other land vesting in <lb/>a municipality or other local body or in a trust, do not <lb/>necessarily mean that ownership has passed to any of them.&quot; <lb/>(xxiii) Azim Ahmad Kazmi and others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and <lb/>another, reported in (2012) 7 SCC 278 : <lb/>&quot;27. For taking possession, the State Government is <lb/>required to follow the law, if any, prescribed. In the absence of <lb/>any specific law, the State Government may take possession by <lb/>filing a suit. <lb/>28. Under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, <lb/>1894, if the State Government decides to acquire the property <lb/>in accordance with the provisions of the said Act, no separate <lb/>proceedings have to be taken for getting possession of the land. <lb/>It may even invoke the urgency provisions contained in <lb/>Section 17 of the said Act and the Collector may take <lb/>possession of the land immediately after the publication of the <lb/>notice under Section 9. In such a case, the person in <lb/>possession of the land acquired would be dispossessed <lb/>forthwith. <lb/>29. However, if the Government proceeds under the <lb/>terms of the Government Grants Act, 1895 then what <lb/>procedure is to be followed. Section 3 of the Government <lb/>Grants Act, 1895, stipulates that the lease made by or on behalf <lb/>of the Government is to take effect according to their tenor -<lb/></body>

			<page>112 <lb/></page>

			<body>All provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations <lb/>contained in any such creation, conferment or grant referred to <lb/>in Section 2, shall be valid and take effect according to their <lb/>tenor; any decree or direction of a court of law or any rule of <lb/>law, statute or enactments of the legislature, to the contrary.&quot; <lb/>19. We have gone through the records; the order impugned and also <lb/>the relevant laws. <lb/>20. To begin with, the Government of Tamil Nadu, vide <lb/>G.O.Ms.Nos.812, Revenue, dated 22.11.1888, and 763, Revenue, dated <lb/>09.12.1898, assigned the lands to Raja Sir Savalai Ramasamy Mudaliar in <lb/>T.S.No.41 to an extent of 1 Cawnie 10 Grounds and 1871 Sq.ft., and <lb/>T.S.No.43/2 to an extent of 5 Grounds and 275 Sq.ft., Vepery Village, Fort-<lb/>Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai District, for construction of a choultry, subject to <lb/>the conditions that (i) the choultry shall be available for free use of railway <lb/>travellers and it shall be kept in repair; (ii) the plans of the building shall be <lb/>approved by Government and (iii) the land shall be liable for resumption, <lb/>without compensation, if it ceases to be employed for the purpose for which it <lb/>is granted or is used for any other purposes, without the permission of <lb/>Government. <lb/>21. Following the allegations of misappropriation of funds and <lb/>mismanagement of the choultry, this Court passed a scheme decree on <lb/>18.08.1970 in C.S.No.90 of 1963, by removing the then existing hereditary <lb/>Trustee and appointing the Administrator General and Official Trustee (AGOT) <lb/>for the management of the property. Pursuant thereto, the High Power <lb/></body>

			<body>Committee for Chennai Metro Rail Project, chaired by the Chief Secretary, in <lb/>the meeting held on 09.12.2009, identified the lands assigned to Sir Ramasamy <lb/>Mudaliar Choultry, namely, the subject lands, and directed the Chennai Metro <lb/>Rail Limited and the Revenue Department to take appropriate action for <lb/>allocation of the lands well before the construction of Metro Station is taken up. <lb/>Thereafter, the District Collector, Chennai, and the Principal Secretary and <lb/>Commissioner of Land Administration sent reports to Government, on non-<lb/>functioning of choultry and the commercial exploitation of land/buiildings such <lb/>as hotels and travel agencies, which was a violation of the conditions imposed <lb/>by the Government at the time of granting of lands to the choultry. Based on <lb/>the said reports of the District Collector and the Principal Secretary and <lb/>Commissioner of Land Administiration and also considering the requirement of <lb/>the land for implementation of Chennai Metro Rail Project, orders were issued <lb/>by the Government vide G.O.Ms.No.168, Revenue, dated 21.05.2012, for <lb/>resumption of lands in Block No.7 of T.S.Nos.41 and 43/2, for violation of <lb/>conditions of grant and alienation to Chennai Metro Rail Limited. Challenging <lb/>the said G.O.Ms.No.168, dated 21.05.2012, and notice of eviction, some of the <lb/>lessees/tenants/occupants moved this Court by filing a batch of 21 writ <lb/>petitions in W.P.No.19469 of 2012. The said writ petitions were allowed and <lb/>G.O.Ms.No.168 was set aside by a learned single Judge of this Court vide his <lb/>order, dated 26.11.2012, and the matter was remitted to the Government to <lb/>issue notice to AGOT, Co-Trustee, CMRL and writ petitioners, who were in <lb/></body>

			<page>114 <lb/></page>

			<body>possession of the land/building, consider the objections to be filed, give them <lb/>an opportunity of hearing and, thereafter, to pass fresh orders as expeditiously <lb/>as possible. <lb/>22. The Government, considering that if notices were to be issued afresh <lb/>and further action taken on getting replies, it would further delay the matter <lb/>apart from paving way to further legal proceedings from the beginning and <lb/>issue of fresh notices also would not yield any new outcome, thought it fit to <lb/>file appeals against the order of the learned single Judge in the writ petitions. <lb/>Accordingly, based on the directions of the Government, the District Collector, <lb/>Chennai, filed Writ Appeals in W.A.Nos.68 to 88 of 2013 before a Division <lb/>Bench of this Court against the orders passed by the learned single Judge. <lb/>Chennai Metro Rail Limited also filed Writ Appeals in W.A.Nos.89 to 106 of <lb/>2013. In the above Writ Appeals, the Division Bench passed a common <lb/>judgment on 12.07.2013, by allowing W.A.Nos.70 to 88 of 2013 filed by the <lb/>Government and 91 to 106 of 2013 filed by CMRL pertaining to the lands in <lb/>T.S.No.41 and dismissing W.A.Nos.68 and 69 of 2013, filed by the <lb/>Government, and 89 and 90 of 2013, filed by CMRL, in respect of the lands in <lb/>T.S.No.43/2. <lb/>23. As against the judgment passed by the Division Bench, dated <lb/>12.07.2013, the aggrieved parties in respect of the lands in T.S.No.41 have filed <lb/>S.L.P.Nos.23081 to 23084 of 2013, which were numbered as Civil Appeal <lb/>Nos.6065 to 6068 of 2013, before the Supreme Court, which, by its order, dated <lb/></body>

			<page>115 <lb/></page>

			<body>25.07.2013, directed the State Government to issue notices to all the lease <lb/>holders concerned on or before 05.08.2013. The appellants therein were <lb/>permitted to respond to the said notices on or before 16.08.2013. The <lb/>determination thereon, one way or the other, was directed to be rendered by the <lb/>appropriate authority within one week thereafter. In case any of the appellants <lb/>were to be adversely affected, a well reasoned speaking order was directed to <lb/>be passed, taking into consideration all the issues canvassed in response to the <lb/>show cause notices. Likewise, the appellants were given liberty to obtain the <lb/>final orders passed in the matter on or after 30.09.2013 from the office of the <lb/>concerned District Collector, Chennai. <lb/>24. As per the directions of the Supreme Court of India, notices were <lb/>issued to AGOT, Co-Trustee and 44 lessees/tenants/occupants by the District <lb/>Collector, Chennai, on 01.08.2013 and the AGOT, Co-Trustee and 17 <lb/>lessees/tenants/occupants have furnished their replies before the due tate i.e., <lb/>16.08.2013. The District Collector, Chennai, has complied with all the <lb/>directions of the Supreme Court viz., issuing notice, getting replies, examining <lb/>with reference to legal position and sent her compliance report to the <lb/>Government through the Principal Secretary and Commissioner of Land <lb/>Administration with a request to pass orders for resumption of land in <lb/>T.S.No.41. The Principal Secretary and Commissioner of Land Administration <lb/>has endorsed the report of the District Collector, Chennai. <lb/>25. Based on the records available, legal position, relevant rules and <lb/></body>

			<page>116 <lb/></page>

			<body>regulations, the Government has examined the proposal of the District <lb/>Collector and the Principal Secretary and Commissioner of Land <lb/>Administration; considered the objections raised by AGOT, Co-Trustee, <lb/>lessees/tenants/occupants in depth vide the annexure; and decided to accept the <lb/>proposal for resumption of land and alienation to Chennai Metro Rail Limited. <lb/>Accordingly, the Government passed G.O.Ms.No.380, Revenue [LD1(1)] <lb/>Department, dated 28.09.2013, which was impugned in the writ petitions filed <lb/>before the learned single Judge, against whose order these Writ Appeals are <lb/>filed. By the said G.O., the District Collector was directed to take necessary <lb/>immediate follow-up action for resumption of the land in T.S.No.41, Block <lb/>No.7, Vepery Village, Fort-Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai District, and to send an <lb/>action taken report in that regard to the Government at an early date. Following <lb/>the same, the District Collector, Chennai, by his orders, dated 30.09.2013, <lb/>directed the appellants to vacate the land and hand over possession of the <lb/>premises to the Tahsildar, Fort-Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai, which orders also <lb/>were a part of impugnation in the writ petitions. <lb/>26. At this point, we feel it relevant to refer to the provisions of law, <lb/>relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellants. The said <lb/>provisions are : (1) Article 300-A of the Constitution of India; (2) Sections <lb/>10,25 and 29 of the Official Trustees Act,1913, and (3) Section 3 of the <lb/>Government Grants Act,1895, which read as under: <lb/>(1) Article 300-A:-Persons not to be deprived of <lb/></body>

			<page>117 <lb/></page>

			<body>property save by authority of law :-No person shall be <lb/>deprived of his property save by authrity of law. <lb/>(2) Sections 10,25 and 29 of the Official Trustees Act,1913: <lb/>Section 10 : <lb/>10. Power of High Court to appoint Official Trustee to <lb/>be Trustee of property.-(1) If any property is subject to a <lb/>Trust other than a Trust which the Official Trustee is <lb/>prohibited from accepting under the provisions of this Act, <lb/>and there is no Trustee within the local limits of the ordinary <lb/>or extraordinary original civil jurisdiction of the High Court <lb/>willing or capable to act in the Trust, the High Court may on <lb/>application make an order or the appointment of the Official <lb/>Trustee by that name with his consent to be the Trustee of <lb/>such property. <lb/>(2) Upon such order such property shall vest in the <lb/>Official Trustee and shall be held by him upon the same <lb/>Trusts as the same was held previously to such order, and the <lb/>same Trusts as the same was held previously to such order, <lb/>and the previous Trustee or Trustees (if any) shall be exempt <lb/>from the liability as Trustees of such property save in respect <lb/>of acts done before the date of such order. <lb/>(3) Nothing in this section shall, be deemed to affect <lb/>the provisions of the Indian Trust Act, 1882 (2 of 1882). <lb/>Section 25 : <lb/>25. Power of High Court to make orders in respect of <lb/>property vested in Official Trustee.-The High Court may <lb/>make such orders as it thinks fit respecting any Trust property <lb/>vested in the Official Trustee, or the income or produce <lb/>thereof. <lb/>Section 29 : <lb/>29. Transfer of Trust property by Official Trustee to <lb/>original Trustee or any other Trustee.-(1) Nothing in this <lb/>Act shall be deemed to prevent the transfer by the Official <lb/>Trustee of any property vested in him to-<lb/>(a) the original Trustee (if any); or <lb/>(b) any other lawfully appointed Trustee; or <lb/>(c) any other person if the Court so directs. <lb/>(2) Upon such transfer such property shall vest in such <lb/>Trustee, and shall be held by him upon the same Trusts as <lb/></body>

			<page>118 <lb/></page>

			<body>those upon which it was held prior to such transfer, and the <lb/>Official Trustee shall be exempt from all liability as <lb/>Trustee of such property except in respect of acts done <lb/>before such transfer: <lb/>Provided that, in the case of any transfer under this section, <lb/>the Official Trustee shall be entitled to retain out of the <lb/>property any fees leviable in accordance with the <lb/>provisions of this Act. <lb/>(3) Section 3 of the Government Grants Act :-<lb/>3. Government grants to take effect according to their <lb/>tenor.-All provisions, restrictions, conditions and <lb/>limitations over contained in any such grant or transfer as <lb/>aforesaid shall be valid and take effect according to their <lb/>tenor, any rule of law, statute or enactment of the <lb/>Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding. <lb/>Scope of applicability of Article 300-A to a property belonging to the State <lb/>: <lb/>27. As per Article 300-A of the Constitution, no person shall be deprived <lb/>of his property except by authority of law. In this case, the property in question <lb/>is the property of the Government and not the self-acquired property of the <lb/>appellants. Instead, it was given on lease for Choultry, which, in turn, was sub-<lb/>leased or sub-let to the appellants by AGOT. <lb/>28. Though the intention of the Parliament was to do away with the <lb/>fundamental right to acquire, hold and dispose of the property as evident from <lb/>the history of various constitutional amendments and judicial pronouncements, <lb/>the question that arises for consideration is whether the principles of eminent <lb/>domain are completely obliterated when a person is deprived of his property by <lb/>the authority of law under Article 300-A of the Constitution. Deprivation of <lb/></body>

			<page>119 <lb/></page>

			<body>property, under Article 300, must take place for a public purpose or public <lb/>interest. The concept of eminent domain which applies when a person is <lb/>deprived of his property postulates that the purpose must be primarily public <lb/>and not primarily of private interest and merely incidentally beneficial to the <lb/>public. Any law, which deprives a person of his private property for private <lb/>interest, will be unlawful and unfair and undermines the rule of law and can be <lb/>subjected to judicial review. But the question as to whether the purpose is <lb/>primarily public or private, has to be decided by the legislature, which of course <lb/>should be made known. <lb/>29. Requirement of public purpose is invariably the rule for depriving a <lb/>person of his property and any violation of it is amenable to judicial review. <lb/>Payment of compensation amount is a constitutional requirement under Article <lb/>30(1A) and under the 2nd proviso to Article 31A(1), unlike Article 300A. <lb/>After the 44th Amendment Act, 1978, the constitutional obligation to pay <lb/>compensation to a person who is deprived of his property primarily depends <lb/>upon the terms of the statute and the legislative policy. Requirement of public <lb/>purpose, for deprivation of a person of his property under Article 300-A, is a <lb/>pre-condition, but no compensation or nil compensation or its illusiveness has <lb/>to be justified by the State on judicially justiciable standards. Measures <lb/>designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for lesser compensation and <lb/>such a limitation by itself will not make legislation invalid or unconstitutional <lb/></body>

			<page>120 <lb/></page>

			<body>or confiscatory. In other words, the right to claim compensation or the <lb/>obligation to pay, though not expressly included in Article 300-A, it can be <lb/>inferred in that Article and it is for the State to justify its stand on justifiable <lb/>grounds which may depend upon the legislative policy, object and purpose of <lb/>the statute and a host of other factors. <lb/>Doctrine of Sub-silentio : <lb/>30. It is contended that pronouncements of law which are not part of the <lb/>ratio decidendi and are not authoritative and the same are delivered without <lb/>reference to the relevant provisions of the Act and decisions which are not <lb/>express and not founded on reasons nor they proceed on consideration of issue <lb/>cannot be deemed to be a law declared to have a binding effect as is <lb/>contemplated by Article 141. Therefore, this Court is not precluded from <lb/>considering the relevant provisions of law to the facts of this case. <lb/>31. The Theory &apos;Salmond on Jurisprudence&apos; explains that a decision <lb/>passes sub silentio, in the technical sense that has come to be attached to that <lb/>phrase, when the particular point of law involved in the decision is not <lb/>perceived by the court or present to its mind. The Court may consciously <lb/>decide in favour of one party because of Point A, which it considers and <lb/>pronounces upon. It may be shown, however, that logically the court should <lb/>not have decided in favour of the particular party unless it also decided point B <lb/>in his favour; but point B was not argued or considered by the court. In such <lb/></body>

			<page>121 <lb/></page>

			<body>circumstances, although point B was logically involved in the facts and <lb/>although the case had a specific outcome, the decision is not an authority on <lb/>point B. Point B is said to pass sub silentio. <lb/>32. In this case, the appellants have taken a stand that both the Survey <lb/>Numbers in S.No.43/2 and T.S.No.41 are identical. Though the said property <lb/>in the Survey numbers could be viewed in a different angle from that of other <lb/>Survey numbers, in which matter, the Apex Court has taken a view and laid <lb/>down a ratio that the course adopted by the respondents in resuming the land <lb/>for public purpose would be valid even assuming that this matter requires <lb/>examination, this Court is not the proper forum to examine the position, in <lb/>view of the questions raised and considered by the Supreme Court and even for <lb/>a new proposition of law. <lb/>33. It is for the Apex Court to look into the same as to the principle that a <lb/>decision should be treated as given per incuriam when it is given in ignorance <lb/>of the terms of a statute or of a rule having the force of a statute. So far as the <lb/>order shows, no argument was addressed to the Court on the question or not <lb/>whether any direction could properly be made compelling the concerned <lb/>authority. It may not be proper for this Court to examine this position, as the <lb/>ratio of that case in a given circumstance could be the law laid down under <lb/>Article 141 of the Constitution. Therefore, it is for the parties to raise the same <lb/>before the appropriate forum, as the ratio laid down under Article 141 of the <lb/>Constitution has binding effect and will be the force of law. <lb/></body>

			<page>122 <lb/></page>

			<body>34. A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in a recent decision in <lb/>the case of K.T.Plantation Private Limited v. State of Karnataka, (2011) 9 SCC <lb/>1, while dealing with the power of Government to withdraw exemption granted <lb/>in certain lands, has extensively discussed the scope of Article 300-A and to <lb/>what extent, it could be applied to the said property. In the said case, the Apex <lb/>Court, while asserting the importance of the law providing for deprivation of <lb/>property and where such law is unjust on account of payment of nil <lb/>compensation, had authoritatively held that Article 300-A enables the State to <lb/>put restriction on the right to property by a law that law, so as to be sustainable, <lb/>must comply with other provisions of the Constitution. The limitation or <lb/>restriction should not be arbitrary or excessive or what is beyond required in <lb/>public interest and such limitation must not be disproportionate to the <lb/>Constitution. The legislation providing for deprivation of the property under <lb/>Article 300-A must be just and reasonable, as understood in terms of Articles <lb/>14, 19(1)(g), 26(b), 301 etc. The Court will have to examine the scheme of the <lb/>impugned Act, its object, purpose as also the question whether payment of nil <lb/>compensation or nominal compensation would make the impugned law unjust, <lb/>unfair and unreasonable. It was further held therein that the rule of law, as a <lb/>principle, contains not explicit components like eminent domain, but has many <lb/>shades and colours. <lb/>35. Adverting to the provisions of the Official Trustees Act, 1913, as per <lb/></body>

			<page>123 <lb/></page>

			<body>Section 10, this Court, following the irregularities by the Trust, on application, <lb/>appointed AGOT to manage the property and also passed a scheme decree <lb/>under Section 25 with regard to the Trust property vested in the Official <lb/>Trustee, the income and the produce thereof. Section 29 provides for transfer of <lb/>Trust property by Official Trustee to original Trustee or any other Trustee or to <lb/>any other person if the Court so directs. <lb/>36. Section 3 of the Government Grants Act is categorical that all <lb/>provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations contained in any grant or <lb/>transfer shall be valid and take effect according to their tenor, despite there <lb/>being any rule of law, statute or enactment of the Legislature to the contrary. <lb/>37. In this context, it is indispensable to refer to Basic Structure of the <lb/>Constitution of India, in brief, whereupon the entire case on hand dwells. <lb/>Basic Structure of the Constitution of India :-<lb/>38. Constitution of India is the creation of a constituent act and is an <lb/>extra-ordinary legislation derived direct from the people and acting in their <lb/>sovereign capacity for setting up the structure of the Government. <lb/>39. Constitution is a set of laws and rules setting up machinery of the <lb/>Government of a State which defines and determines the relation between the <lb/>different institutions and areas of Government, the executive, legislature and <lb/>the judiciary, the central, the State and the local government. A Constitution is <lb/>a source of jurisprudential fountain head from which other laws must flow and <lb/>it must grow with the growth of the nation with the philosophical and cultural <lb/></body>

			<page>124 <lb/></page>

			<body>advancement of the people who gave birth to it. The Constitution of India is <lb/>one such document which is the longest of its kind representing the political, <lb/>economic and social ideals and aspirations of the vast majority of Indian <lb/>people. The ideals intended to be achieved by the provisions of the <lb/>Constitution were preceded by immense sacrifices and the Constitution could <lb/>not be a source for the destruction of these ideals. It is a constituted document <lb/>keeping with modern constitutional practice, and fundamental to the <lb/>governance of the country. The people of India have provided a constitutional <lb/>polity consisting of certain primary organs, institutions and functionaries to <lb/>exercise the powers provided in the Constitution. All powers belong to the <lb/>people are entrusted by them to specified institutions and functionaries. This is <lb/>enshrined in our Preamble with a statement of the Constitution. <lb/>40. Except the Indian Constitution, no other Constitution in the world <lb/>combines under its wings such diverse peoples with different nations, religious, <lb/>culture and in different stages of economic development into one nation and no <lb/>other nation is faced with such vast socio-economic problems. It is a noble and <lb/>grand vision carried out in part by conferring fundamental rights on the people. <lb/>Legislature, Executive and Judiciary have been created and constituted to serve <lb/>the people. The commitment of the Constitution to the social revolution <lb/>through rule of law lies in the effectuation of the fundamental rights and <lb/>directive principles as supplementary and complimentary to each other. We can <lb/>say that the preamble, fundamental rights and directive principles of State <lb/></body>

			<page>125 <lb/></page>

			<body>policy -the Trinity -are the conscience of the Constitution. <lb/>41. The Constitution of India, having solemn principle and concept, <lb/>underlined the Preamble as follows : <lb/>&quot;WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute <lb/>India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC <lb/>REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens : <lb/>JUSTICE -social, economic and political ; <lb/>LIBERTY -of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship ; <lb/>EQUALITY -of status and of opportunity ; <lb/>and to promote among them all <lb/>FRATERNITY -assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and <lb/>integrity of the Nation ; <lb/>IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of <lb/>November,1949, do HEREBY, ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO <lb/>OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION. <lb/>42. The Preamble to the Constitution forms an important part with the <lb/>hopes and aspirations of the people of India made on the day when this nation <lb/>has become republic. The solemn promise is not only to themselves, but also to <lb/>the coming generations and posterity. The Indian Republic was envisaged in <lb/>the Preamble as a form of Government of the people, for the people and by the <lb/>people through their freely elected representatives and thereby found necessary <lb/></body>

			<page>126 <lb/></page>

			<body>to qualify the sovereignty of the Republic by using the word &apos;Democratic&apos;, <lb/>which was made explicit by emphasising &quot;liberty of thought, expression, belief, <lb/>faith and worship and equality of status and of opportunity&quot;, which means, an <lb/>independent sovereign State may well become a people&apos;s Government. <lb/>Similarly, the dignity of the individual in the Preamble to the Constitution <lb/>emphases the positive aspect, which signifies the word of moral and spiritual <lb/>import. It implied an obligation on the part of the Union to respect the <lb/>personality of the citizen and to create conditions in which every citizen would <lb/>be left free to find individual self-fulfilment. <lb/>43. No reading of any Constitution can be complete without reading it <lb/>from the beginning to the end. While the end may expand, or alter, the point of <lb/>commencement can never change. It is the Preamble wherefrom the <lb/>Constitution commences. Hence, the significance of the Preamble. <lb/>44. It is no exaggeration to say that the Preamble to the Constitution of <lb/>India is its spirit and backbone. The Preamble pervades through and inspires all <lb/>the provisions of the Constitution. It is also the quintessence of the <lb/>Constitution. Ever since the day it was adopted by the Constituent Assembly, it <lb/>has enabled the Constitution to stand erect -neither bending nor breaking. <lb/>45. The significance of the Preamble is that it contains the fundamentals <lb/>of our Constitution. The people of India resolved to constitute their country <lb/></body>

			<page>127 <lb/></page>

			<body>into a sovereign democratic republic. No one can suggest that the words and <lb/>expressions in the Preamble are ambiguous in any manner. By their true import <lb/>and connotation, it is well known that no question of any ambiguity is involved. <lb/>46. The objectives specified in the Preamble contain the basic structure <lb/>of our Constitution, which cannot be amended in exercise of the power under <lb/>Article 368 of the Constitution. The concept relating to &quot;separation of powers <lb/>among the legislature, the executive and the judiciary&quot; and the fundamental <lb/>concept of an independent judiciary are now elevated to the level of basic <lb/>structure of the Constitution and are the very heart of the constitutional scheme. <lb/>47. Basic Structure of the Constitution of India consists of the following <lb/>features: <lb/>(1) Supremacy of the Constitution; <lb/>(2) Republican and Democratic form of Government; <lb/>(3) Secular character of the Constitution; <lb/>(4) Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the <lb/>judiciary; <lb/>(5) Federal character of the Constitution. <lb/>(6) Independence of the Judiciary. <lb/>Separation of Powers : <lb/>48. Of the above basic features, if we see Separation of Powers, the <lb/></body>

			<page>128 <lb/></page>

			<body>Constitution of India provides for governance of the country by its three <lb/>essential pillars viz., Legislature, Executive and Judiciary. The principle <lb/>&apos;Separation of Powers&apos; deals with the mutual relations among the said three <lb/>organs of the Government. The doctrine of separation of powers has no place in <lb/>strict sense in Indian Constitution, but the functions of different organs of the <lb/>Government have been sufficiently differentiated, so that one organ of the <lb/>Government could not usurp the functions of another. <lb/>49. In Indian Constitution, there is express provision that &quot;Executive <lb/>power of the Union shall be vested in the President and the executive power of <lb/>the State shall be vested in the Governor...&quot; (Article 154(1) of the Indian <lb/>Constitution). But, there is no express provision that legislative and judicial <lb/>powers shall be vested in any person or organ. <lb/>50. It is now to be seen, what is the real position in India, regarding <lb/>Separation of Powers ? <lb/>51. President, being the executive head, is also empowered to exercise <lb/>legislative powers. In his legislative capacity, he may promulgate Ordinances <lb/>in order to meet the situation, as Article 123 (1) says -&quot;If, at any time, except <lb/>when both Houses of Parliament are in Session, President is satisfied that <lb/>circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action, <lb/>he may promulgate such Ordinances as the circumstances appear to him to <lb/></body>

			<page>129 <lb/></page>

			<body>require.&quot; When proclamation of emergency has been declared by the President <lb/>due to failure of Constitutional machinery, the President has been given <lb/>legislative power under Article 357 of our Constitution to make any law in <lb/>order to meet the situations. A power has also been conferred on the President <lb/>of India under Articles 372 and 372-A to adopt any law in the country by <lb/>making such adaptations and modifications whether by way of repeal or <lb/>amendment as may be necessary or expedient and to provide that the law so <lb/>adapted or modified shall have effect subject to adaptation and modifications so <lb/>made and the adaptation and modifications shall not be questioned. <lb/>52. The President of India also exercises judicial function, as Article 103 <lb/>of the Constitution empowers the President to decide cases of disqualification <lb/>of membership of the Houses of Parliament. According to this Article, if any <lb/>question arises as to whether a member of either House of Parliament has <lb/>become subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in clause (1) of <lb/>Article 102, the question shall be referred for the decision of the President and <lb/>his decision shall be final. Article 50 lays emphasis to separate judiciary from <lb/>executive. But, in practice, we find that the executive also exercises the powers <lb/>of judicial function as in appointment of Judges (Articles 124, 126 and 127). <lb/>The legislature (either House of Parliament) also exercises judicial function in <lb/>removal of President (Article 56) in the prescribed manner. Judiciary also <lb/>exercises legislative power. High Court and Supreme Court are empowered to <lb/></body>

			<page>130 <lb/></page>

			<body>make certain rules, legislative in character. Whenever High Court or the <lb/>Supreme Court finds a certain provision of law against the Constitution or <lb/>public policy, it declares the same null and void and then amendments may be <lb/>incorporated in the legal system. Sometimes, High Court and Supreme Court <lb/>formulate the principles on the point where law is silent. This power is also <lb/>legislative in character. <lb/>53. Apart from this, when Judges establish a new principle by means of a <lb/>judicial decision, they may be said to exercise legislative and not merely <lb/>judicial power. The High Courts, in certain spheres, perform functions which <lb/>are administrative rather than judicial. Their power of supervision over <lb/>subordinate courts is more of administrative nature rather than judicial (Article <lb/>227). Under Article 228, they have power to effect transfer of cases. <lb/>54. In strict sense, the powers of one organ of democracy should not be <lb/>usurped by another organ, thereby maintaining the decorum of three pillars of <lb/>democracy. <lb/>Separation of Powers vis-a-vis Judicial Pronouncements : <lb/>55. The following cases explain the real position of doctrine of <lb/>separation of powers, prevailing in our country : <lb/>55.1. In re Delhi Laws Act case, AIR 1951 SC 332, the then Hon&apos;ble <lb/>Chief Justice Kania observed : <lb/>&quot;Although in the Constitution of India there is <lb/>no express separation of powers, it is clear that a <lb/></body>

			<page>131 <lb/></page>

			<body>legislature is created by the Constitution and detailed <lb/>provisions are made for making that legislature pass <lb/>laws. Is it then too much to say that under the <lb/>Constitution the duty to make laws, the duty to <lb/>exercise its own wisdom, judgment and patriotism in <lb/>making law is primarily cast on the legislature? Does <lb/>it not imply that unless it can be gathered from other <lb/>provisions of the Constitution, other bodies, <lb/>executive or judicial, are not intended to discharge <lb/>legislative functions ?&quot; <lb/>55.2. To the same effect, another case is Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya v. State <lb/>of Punjab, AIR 1955 SC 549, in which the then Hon&apos;ble Chief Justice <lb/>B.K.Mukherjea observed : <lb/>&quot;The Indian Constitution has not indeed <lb/>recognised the doctrine of separation of powers <lb/>in the absolute rigidity but the functions of the <lb/>different parts or branches of the Government <lb/>have been sufficiently differentiated and <lb/>consequently it can very well be said that our <lb/>Constitution does not contemplate assumption, <lb/>by one organ or part of the State, of functions <lb/>that essentially belong to another.&quot; <lb/>55.3. In Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice Tendolkar, AIR 1958 SC 538, <lb/>the then Hon&apos;ble Chief Justice S.R.Das opined that in the absence of specific <lb/>provision for separation of powers in our Constitution, such as there is under <lb/>the American Constitution, some such division of powers legislative, executive <lb/>and judicial, is nevertheless implicit in our Constitution. Same view was <lb/>expressed in Jayanti Lal Amrit Lal v. S.N.Rana, AIR 1964 SC 648. <lb/>55.4. Judiciary is independent and a separate wing of the Government. <lb/>Executive or Legislature has no concern with the day to day functioning of the <lb/></body>

			<page>132 <lb/></page>

			<body>Judiciary. In Chandra Mohan v. State of U.P., AIR 1966 SC 1987, Supreme <lb/>Court held : <lb/>&quot;The Indian Constitution, though it does not <lb/>accept the strict doctrine of separation of powers, <lb/>provides for an independent judiciary in the States.... <lb/>But, at the time the Constitution was made in most of <lb/>the States the magistracy was under the direct control <lb/>of the executive. Indeed, it is common knowledge <lb/>that in pre-independence India, there was a strong <lb/>agitation that the judiciary should be separated from <lb/>the executive and that the agitation was based upon <lb/>the assumption that unless they were separated, the <lb/>independence of the judiciary at the lower levels <lb/>would be a mockery.&quot; <lb/>55.5. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, AIR 1973 SC 1461, the <lb/>then Hon&apos;be Chief Justice Sikri observed : <lb/>&quot;Separation of powers between the legislature, the <lb/>executive and the judiciary is a part of the basic structure <lb/>of the Constitution; this structure cannot be destroyed by <lb/>any form of amendment.&quot; <lb/>55.6. In Smt.Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain, AIR 1975 SC 2299, the <lb/>then Hon&apos;ble Chief Justice Chandrachud observed : <lb/>&quot;The American Constitution provides for a <lb/>rigid separation of governmental powers into three <lb/>basic divisions -the executive, legislative and <lb/>judicial. It is an essential principle of that <lb/>Constitution that powers entrusted to one <lb/>department should not be exercised by any other <lb/>department. The Australian Constitution follows <lb/>the same pattern of distribution of powers. Unlike <lb/>these Constitutions, the Indian Constitution does <lb/>not expressly vest the three kinds of power in three <lb/>different organs of the State. But the principle of <lb/>separation of powers is not a magic formula for <lb/>keeping the three organs of the State within the <lb/>strict confines of their functions.&quot; <lb/>55.7. In Hari Shankar Bagla v. State of M.P., AIR 1954 SC 465, it was <lb/></body>

			<page>133 <lb/></page>

			<body>observed : <lb/>&quot;The Legislature cannot delegate its function of <lb/>laying down legislative policy in respect of a measure and <lb/>its formulation as a rule of conduct. The Legislature must <lb/>declare the policy of the law and the legal principles which <lb/>are to control any given cases and must provide a standard <lb/>to guide the officials or the body in power to execute the <lb/>law. The essential legislative function consists in the <lb/>determination of the choice of the legislative policy and of <lb/>formally enacting that policy into a binding rule of <lb/>conduct.&quot; <lb/>Evaluation of the principle : <lb/>56. The value of the principle &apos;&apos;Separation of Powers&apos;&apos; lies in the fact that <lb/>it seeks to preserve the human liberty by avoiding the concentration of powers <lb/>in one person or body of persons. The different organs of Government for the <lb/>sake of liberty should be prevented from encroaching on another province. <lb/>57. History has proved the fact that if there is a complete separation of <lb/>powers, the Government cannot run smoothly and effectively. Smooth running <lb/>of Government is possible only by co-operation and mutual adjustment of all <lb/>the three organs of the Government. The aim behind the principle is to protect <lb/>the people against capricious, tyrannical and whimsical powers of the State. <lb/>58. Virtually, absolute separation of powers is not possible in any form of <lb/>Government. In view of the variety of situations, the legislature cannot foresee <lb/>or anticipate all the circumstances to which a legislative measure should be <lb/>extended and applied. Therefore, legislature is empowered to delegate some of <lb/>its functions to administrative authority (executive). But, one thing is notable <lb/></body>

			<page>134 <lb/></page>

			<body>that legislature cannot delegate its essential legislative power. <lb/>59. With the widening of the horizons of &apos;Judicial Activism&apos;, criticism <lb/>emanated from a few percent of the people that the judiciary is overstepping its <lb/>bounds and taking over the Government functions, but, this is not a justifiable <lb/>thought. The Supreme Court and the High Courts act as watchman to keep <lb/>Executive and Legislature within the bounds of law. Today, millions of people <lb/>are suffering in the country because of the failures or inactions of the executive. <lb/>It is the Judiciary, which is holding out hope for them. <lb/>60. The Indian Constitution, adopted by the Constituent Assembly on <lb/>November 26,1949, is a comprehensive document, containing 395 Articles and <lb/>several Schedules. Besides dealing with the structure of Government, the <lb/>Constitution makes detailed provisions for the rights of citizens and other <lb/>persons in a number of entrenched provisions, and for the principles to be <lb/>followed by the State in the governance of the country, labelled as &quot;Directive <lb/>Principles of State Policy&quot;. <lb/>61. Historical and geographical factors have been responsible for the <lb/>build of the Constitution, which is the largest Constitution in the world. The <lb/>framers of the Constitution were keen to preserve the democratic values to <lb/>which Indians had attached the highest importance in their struggle for <lb/>freedom. But, they were also keen to make provisions considered to be <lb/></body>

			<page>135 <lb/></page>

			<body>necessary in the light of the social and economic backwardness of certain <lb/>sections of society. They had also before them the precedent of the <lb/>Government of India Act,1935, whose detailed provisions were found suitable <lb/>for adoption in the interests of continuity and certainty. Some precautions for <lb/>the constitutional image being distorted or being impaired in its essential <lb/>features were also required. All this has contributed to the length of the Indian <lb/>Constitution. Therefore, all the organs of the Government, including the <lb/>citizens of India, and various enactments are bound by and subject to the <lb/>provisions of the Constitution of India. <lb/>62. The basic structure doctrine or the doctrine of basic structure of the <lb/>Constitution, as evolved by the Supreme Court of India, is unique in <lb/>constitutional jurisprudence. The seeds of the theory are to be found in the <lb/>Preamble to the Constitution. Landmark pronouncements of the Supreme Court <lb/>in Kesavananda Bharati, AIR 1973 SC 1461, Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj <lb/>Narain, 1975 Supp SCC 1, and Minerva Mills, 1980 (3) SCC 625, bear <lb/>testimony to this truism. Any amendment of the Constitution is open to judicial <lb/>review and liable to be interfered with by the Court on the ground that it affects <lb/>one or the other of the basic features of the Constitution. <lb/>63. The Constitution of India is a constitutive document, in keeping with <lb/>modern constitutional practice, and fundamental to the governance of the <lb/>country. The people of India have provided a constitutional polity consisting of <lb/></body>

			<page>136 <lb/></page>

			<body>certain primary organs, institutions and functionaries to exercise the powers <lb/>provided in the Constitution. No other Constitution combines under its wings <lb/>such diverse people, numbering now more than one billion, with different <lb/>languages and religions and in different stages of economic development, into <lb/>one nation, and no other nation is faced with such vast socio-economic <lb/>problems. The Constitution cannot be interpreted like an ordinary statute, but <lb/>as a Constitution, which, apart from setting up a machinery for the Government, <lb/>has a noble and grand vision, which was put in words in the Preamble and <lb/>carried out in part by conferring fundamental rights on the people and by the <lb/>application of Directive Principles. <lb/>64. The Preamble of the Constitution of India, the Fundamental Rights <lb/>and the Directive Principles, constituting a &apos;Trinity&apos;, assure to every person in a <lb/>welfare State, social and economic democracy, with equality of status and <lb/>dignity of persons. Political democracy without social and economic democracy <lb/>would always remain unstable. Social democracy must become a way of life in <lb/>an egalitarian social order. Economic democracy aids consolidation of social <lb/>stability and smooth working of political democracy. The Preamble <lb/>emphatically declares that we have given to ourselves the Constitution with a <lb/>firm resolve to constitute a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic, <lb/>with equality of status and of opportunity to all its citizens. <lb/>&quot;Rule of Law&quot; <lb/>being our constitutional faith, it is imperative that every governmental <lb/>institution must observe it, irrespective of any obstacles or odds on its path. <lb/></body>

			<page>137 <lb/></page>

			<body>65. Indian Constitution is not to be construed as a mere law, but as the <lb/>machinery, by which laws are made. It is a living and organic instrument, <lb/>which, of all documents, has the greatest claim to be construed broadly and <lb/>liberally. <lb/>66. Keeping the above law in mind, if we see the present case, a <lb/>circumspection of the facts would reveal that the land to an extent of one Cawni <lb/>10 grounds and 1871 sq.ft. in T.S.No.41 of Vepery Village, Fort Tondiarpet, <lb/>Taluk, Chennai District was granted by the Government of Tamil Nadu to one <lb/>Sir Ramaswamy Mudaliar to build a Choultry for the use of persons, who come <lb/>by rail from different parts of the presidency and have no house or friends in <lb/>Madras. While assigning the above land by the Government, the following <lb/>conditions were imposed : <lb/>1. that Choultry should be available for the free use of <lb/>railway travellers; <lb/>2. that the buildings constructed should be approved by the <lb/>Government; and more importantly, <lb/>3. that the land shall be liable to resumption without <lb/>compensation, if it ceases to be used for the purpose for <lb/>which it is granted or is used for any other purposes <lb/>without the permission of the Government. <lb/>67. It is seen that the said lands were granted and assigned in <lb/>favour of Sir Ramaswamy Mudaliar by a Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.253 <lb/>dated 17.01.1899, whereby, the conditions were incorporated in the following <lb/>words: <lb/></body>

			<page>138 <lb/></page>

			<body>1. that the land shall revert to Government when it ceased to <lb/>be used for the purpose for which it is granted; and <lb/>2. that should be property be at any time resumed by <lb/>Government, the compensation payable, therefore, shall <lb/>in no case exceed the cost or the then present value <lb/>whichever shall be less of any building erected or other <lb/>works executed on the land. <lb/>68. Subsequently, the said lands were subjected to civil <lb/>jurisdiction and the competent Civil Court, namely, the High Court of <lb/>Judicature at Madras, framed a Scheme Decree in C.S.No.90 of 1963. <lb/>Accordingly, properties held by Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar&apos;s Choultry were <lb/>vested with the Administrator General and Official Trustee (hereinafter referred <lb/>to as &quot;AG&amp;OT&quot;) of Tamil Nadu from 18.08.1970. From then onwards, the <lb/>management of the Trust and the properties attached to it were under the <lb/>control of the AG&amp;OT. As per the Scheme Decree, the AG&amp;OT of Tamil Nadu <lb/>leased out the lands in T.S.No.41 to various tenants and collected rent. <lb/>69. While that being so, having regard to the unprecedented <lb/>growth of population in general with particular reference to the Metropolitan <lb/>City of Chennai, there was an imminent need to provide better transportation <lb/>facilities to the commuters as also office goers and business people, which <lb/>persuaded the State to expand the rail transport facility in the City of Chennai <lb/>and for such avowed object, CMRL had planned a project called &quot;Chennai <lb/>Metro Rail Project&quot; which aimed for construction of two corridors under <lb/>Phase-I. Corridor I starts from Washermenpet and ends at Airport at a length of <lb/>23.1 kms and Corridor II starts from Chennai Central and ends at St. Thomas <lb/></body>

			<page>139 <lb/></page>

			<body>Mount Station at a length of 22 kms. As per the project, portions of Corridor I <lb/>with a length of 14.3 kms between Washermenpet and Saidapet and portions of <lb/>Corridor II with a length of 9.7 kms from Chennai Central to Anna Nagar <lb/>would be underground Corridors and the remaining portions would be in an <lb/>elevated position. <lb/>70. CMRL is stated to be a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), formed <lb/>for the purpose of implementing the Chennai Metro Rail Project. The project is <lb/>stated to be funded by the Government of India and the State Government by <lb/>way of equal equity contribution in subordinate debt (Government of India <lb/>20%, Government of Tamil Nadu 20.78% and the balance 59.22% being met <lb/>from the loan assistance from Japan International Co-operation agency). The <lb/>Government of India has already accorded sanction for the project as well as for <lb/>its participation. <lb/>71. The lands in question are covered by the project, namely, Corridor I, <lb/>starting from Washermenpet to Chennai Airport and the project is a time-bound <lb/>project with an objective to ease out phenomenal growth of traffic congestion <lb/>in the City of Chennai and any delay in executing the project would affect the <lb/>plans announced by the Government of India as well as the State Government, <lb/>causing inconvenience to Chennai public and further leading to contractual <lb/>implications, such as extension of time and escalation of project costs, which in <lb/>turn would cost the public exchequer several hundred crores of rupees. <lb/>Therefore, the State has come out with an immediate action by invoking <lb/></body>

			<page>140 <lb/></page>

			<body>Section 3 of the Government Grants Act, 1895 for resumption of lands. <lb/>72. Interestingly, it is the matter concerned not only with the action of <lb/>the Executive, but also involvement of other organ of the Democracy, namely <lb/>Judiciary, for the purpose of maintenance and control over the said property. <lb/>The lands in question undoubtedly are lands belonging to the State of Tamil <lb/>Nadu and the same were originally granted in favour of Sir Ramaswamy <lb/>Mudaliar and an order of grant was also passed in this regard with certain <lb/>conditions. In the meanwhile, such persons ultimately approached the <lb/>competent Court of Civil jurisdiction i.e., High Court of Madras, wherein a <lb/>Scheme was framed and that decree is in force as on date. It is equally <lb/>important to note that after framing of the said Scheme, the subject property has <lb/>been entrusted to a Trustee under the control of judiciary, namely, AG&amp;OT. <lb/>Therefore, it is more important that in a public project, for immediate execution <lb/>of the same, the law of the land has to be followed in vesting and divesting the <lb/>property from the authorities concerned before resumption of the land. It is true <lb/>that the State Government is empowered to invoke appropriate jurisdiction <lb/>under the authority of law to resume the land and vacate persons, who later on <lb/>came to the picture in possession of the property, lawfully. <lb/>73. If that could be the position, the question, which arises for <lb/>consideration is, as to, whether the State, by invoking eminent domain, can <lb/></body>

			<page>141 <lb/></page>

			<body>resume the land under the authority of law, namely, Section 3 of the <lb/>Government Grants Act, 1895, notwithstanding any law for the time-being in <lb/>force. Here again, another question arises to the effect that when the subject <lb/>matter is concerned with two authorities, namely, Union of India and State of <lb/>Tamil Nadu, and the property in question has already been vested with the <lb/>judicial organ, viz., AG&amp;OT, which comes under the purview of Official <lb/>Trustees Act, is it appropriate for the State authority alone to take a decision for <lb/>resumption of the land, that too without taking proper course in resumption of <lb/>the land by approaching appropriate Scheme Court or in the absence of any <lb/>order in respect of vesting, divesting, modification or any change in control and <lb/>management of the property from the AG&amp;OT Court, dealing with AG&amp;OT <lb/>properties, which is normally headed by a senior-most Judge of the High Court <lb/>of Madras. Merely because the State is dominantly empowered to exercise its <lb/>jurisdiction under the Government Grants Act for resumption of the land for a <lb/>public purpose, will they be exempted from approaching the appropriate <lb/>Scheme Court and also AG&amp;OT Court especially when such Decrees and <lb/>Orders are in force as on date. <lb/>Eminent Domain : <lb/>74. Coming to the aspect of eminent domain, it is to be stated that <lb/>principles of public accountability are applicable to State officers/officials with <lb/>all their rigour. Greater the power to decide, higher is the responsibility to be <lb/>just and fair. The dimensions of administrative law permit judicial intervention <lb/></body>

			<page>142 <lb/></page>

			<body>in decisions, though of administrative nature, which are ex facie discriminatory. <lb/>The adverse impact of lack of probity in discharge of public duties can result in <lb/>varied defects, not only in the decision-making process but in the final decision <lb/>as well. Every officer in the hierarchy of the State, by virtue of his being <lb/>&quot;public officer&quot; or &quot;public servant&quot;, is accountable for his decisions to the <lb/>public as well as to the State. This concept of dual responsibility should be <lb/>applied with its rigours in the larger public interest and for proper governance. <lb/>Therefore, it is expected of the State officers not to forget the principles of <lb/>public accountability in exercise of the State&apos;s power of eminent domain and <lb/>the legislative intent behind providing safeguards and some benefits against the <lb/>resumption cannot be frustrated by inaction and omissions on the part of the <lb/>officers. Imperatively, it must follow that the Central Government and all State <lb/>Governments must issue appropriate directions to ensure that there is no <lb/>harassment, hardship or inequality caused to the owners/persons interested in <lb/>the lands to be resumed by the State in exercise of its power of eminent <lb/>domain. <lb/>75. Our Constitution, subject to certain exceptions, has guaranteed the <lb/>fullest protection to property. It has not only provided that no person can be <lb/>deprived of property by the executive without legislative sanction but it has <lb/>further provided that even the legislature cannot deprive a person of his <lb/>property unless there is a public purpose and then only on payment of <lb/>compensation. Article 31, in this regard, provides as follows: <lb/></body>

			<page>143 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;31. (1) No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of <lb/>law. <lb/>(2) No property, movable or immovable, including any interest in, or in <lb/>any company owning, any commercial or industrial undertaking, shall be <lb/>taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law <lb/>authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition, unless the law <lb/>provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired <lb/>and either fixes the amount of the compensation, or specifies the principles <lb/>on which, and the manner in which, the compensation is to be determined <lb/>and given. <lb/>(3) No such law as is referred to in clause (2) made by the legislature of a <lb/>State shall have effect unless such law, having been reserved for the <lb/>consideration of the President, has received his assent. <lb/>(4) If any Bill pending at the commencement of this Constitution in the <lb/>Legislature of a State has, after it has been passed by such legislature, been <lb/>reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, <lb/>then, notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the law so assented to <lb/>shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes <lb/>the provisions of clause (2). <lb/>(5) Nothing in clause (2) shall affect-<lb/>(a) the provisions of any existing law other than a law to which the <lb/>provisions of clause (6) apply, or <lb/>(b) the provisions of any law which the State may hereafter make-<lb/>(i) for the purpose of imposing or levying any tax or penalty, or <lb/>(ii) for the promotion of public health or the prevention of danger to <lb/>life or property, or <lb/>(iii) in pursuance of any agreement entered into between the <lb/>Government of the Dominion of India or the Government of India and <lb/>the Government of any other country, or otherwise, with respect to <lb/>property declared by law to be evacuee property. <lb/>(6) Any law of the State enacted not more than eighteen months before <lb/>the commencement of this Constitution may within three months from such <lb/>commencement be submitted to the President for his certification; and <lb/>thereupon, if the President by public notification so certifies, it shall not be <lb/>called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the <lb/>provisions of clause (2) of this article or has contravened the provisions of <lb/>sub-section (2) of Section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935.&quot; <lb/>76. Property, in legal sense, means an aggregate of rights, which are <lb/>guaranteed and protected by law. It extends to every species of valuable right <lb/></body>

			<page>144 <lb/></page>

			<body>and interest, more particularly, ownership and exclusive right to a thing, the <lb/>right to dispose of the thing in every legal way, to possess it, to use it, and to <lb/>exclude everyone else from interfering with it. The dominion or indefinite right <lb/>of use or disposition which one may lawfully exercise over particular things or <lb/>subjects is called property. The exclusive right of possessing, enjoying, and <lb/>disposing of a thing is property in legal parameters. Therefore, the word <lb/>&apos;property&apos; connotes everything which is subject of ownership, corporeal or <lb/>incorporeal, tangible or intangible, visible or invisible, real or personal; <lb/>everything that has an exchangeable value or which goes to make up wealth or <lb/>estate or status. Property, therefore, within the constitutional protection, <lb/>denotes group of rights inhering citizen&apos;s relation to physical thing, as right to <lb/>possess, use and dispose of it in accordance with law. <lb/>77. Article 31, which was deleted by the Constitution 44th Amendment <lb/>Act, 1978 with effect from 20.06.1979, provided for compulsory acquisition of <lb/>property. Clause (3) of that Article provided that, no law referred to in clause <lb/>(2), made by the legislature of a State shall have effect unless such law, having <lb/>been reserved for the consideration of the President, has received his assent. <lb/>Article 31-A confers protection upon laws falling within clauses (a) to (e) of <lb/>that Article, provided that such laws, if made by a State Legislature, have <lb/>received the assent of the President. Clause (a) of Article 31-A comprehends <lb/>laws of agrarian reform. Right to property is a human right as also a <lb/>Constitutional right. But, it is not a fundamental right. At the same time, each <lb/></body>

			<page>145 <lb/></page>

			<body>and every claim to property would not be a property right. <lb/>78. In Ramanatha Aiyar&apos;s The Law Lexicon, Reprint Edn., 1987, at p. <lb/>1031, it is stated that the property is the most comprehensive of all terms which <lb/>can be used, inasmuch as it is indicative and descriptive of every possible <lb/>interest which the party can have. The term property has a most extensive <lb/>signification, and, according to its legal definition, consists in free use, <lb/>enjoyment, and disposition by a person of all his acquisitions, without any <lb/>control or diminution, save only by the laws of the land. <lb/>79. Also, the word &apos;property&apos; used in Article 300-A, must be understood <lb/>in the context in which the sovereign power of eminent domain is exercised by <lb/>the State and property expropriated. No abstract principles could be laid. Each <lb/>case must be considered in the light of its own facts and setting. The phrase <lb/>&quot;deprivation of the property of a person&quot; must equally be considered in the fact <lb/>situation of a case. Deprivation connotes different concepts. Article 300-A gets <lb/>attracted to an acquisition or taking possession of private property, by <lb/>necessary implication for public purpose, in accordance with the law made by <lb/>Parliament or a State Legislature, a rule or a statutory order having force of law. <lb/>It is inherent in every sovereign State by exercising its power of eminent <lb/>domain to expropriate private property without owner&apos;s consent. Prima facie, <lb/>State would be the judge to decide whether a purpose is a public purpose. But it <lb/>is not the sole judge. This will be subject to judicial review and it is the duty of <lb/>the court to determine whether a particular purpose is a public purpose or not. <lb/></body>

			<page>146 <lb/></page>

			<body>Public interest has always been considered to be an essential ingredient of <lb/>public purpose. But every public purpose does not fall under Article 300-A nor <lb/>every exercise of eminent domain an acquisition or taking possession under <lb/>Article 300-A. Generally speaking, preservation of public health or prevention <lb/>of damage to life and property are considered to be public purposes. Yet, <lb/>deprivation of property for any such purpose would not amount to acquisition <lb/>or possession taken under Article 300-A. It would be by exercise of the police <lb/>power of the State. In other words, Article 300-A only limits the powers of the <lb/>State that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. <lb/>There has to be no deprivation without any sanction of law. Deprivation by any <lb/>other mode is not acquisition or taking possession under Article 300-A. <lb/>80. What needs to be emphasised is, that, although in exercise of the <lb/>power of eminent domain the State can acquire the property for a public <lb/>purpose, it must be remembered that compulsory acquisition of the property <lb/>which is under occupation of an individual is a serious matter and has grave <lb/>repercussions on his constitutional right of not being deprived of his property <lb/>without the sanction of law viz., Article 300-A and the legal rights. Therefore, <lb/>the State must exercise this power with great care and circumspection. At times, <lb/>compulsory acquisition of land is likely to make the owner/occupant landless. <lb/>The degree of care required to be taken by the State is greater when the power <lb/>of compulsory acquisition of land is exercised, because that results in depriving <lb/></body>

			<page>147 <lb/></page>

			<body>the individual of his property. <lb/>81. In this case, though the State, through the District Collector of <lb/>Chennai and also AG&amp;OT concerned, made applications before the AG&amp;OT <lb/>Court under the jurisdiction of the High Court of Madras for taking suitable <lb/>orders, such applications have subsequently been withdrawn by them for <lb/>reasons best known to them. In the matter in question, when the subject land is <lb/>governed by an authority of law being controlled and maintained by the <lb/>judiciary, then involvement of judiciary could not be bye-passed or dispensed <lb/>with merely by invoking the Government Grants Act. The basic structure of the <lb/>Constitution defines certain distinct and separate powers for Executive and <lb/>Judiciary. In the event of Executive acting independently under the authority of <lb/>law, the role of judiciary to look into its functioning is very limited. But, once <lb/>they approach the other organ, namely, Judiciary under the competent <lb/>jurisdictional Court, the Executive should understand and delineate as to the <lb/>proper method and procedures to be adopted in taking out the land, which has <lb/>already been entrusted with the judiciary for proper control and maintenance. In <lb/>that case, what is required to be done is fair play in applying proper rule of law, <lb/>which is the basic structure of governance of our country in dealing with <lb/>separation of powers of the Executive and Judiciary. <lb/>Rule of Law : <lb/>82. The Constitution of India provides for governance of the country by <lb/></body>

			<page>148 <lb/></page>

			<body>its three essential pillars viz., the legislature, the executive and the judiciary and <lb/>it promises governance through &quot;Rule of Law&quot;. Maintenance of &quot;Rule of Law&quot;, <lb/>therefore, is a sine qua non under our constitutional scheme and, in fact, is <lb/>essential to sustain any democracy. We must consider ourselves to be fortunate <lb/>enough that notwithstanding the vastness and size of our population and the <lb/>complexity and problems we have, on account of diverse philosophy, <lb/>democracy has taken deep roots in this country and democratic institutions have <lb/>flourished to such an extent that it will be difficult for any of our neighbours to <lb/>destabilise the same. It is the sacred duty of the judiciary to see that the &quot;Rule <lb/>of Law&quot; is maintained and it shall be construed as a constitutional obligation <lb/>for the judiciary to do all that is possible in maintaining the &quot;Rule of Law&quot; not <lb/>merely in interpreting the provisions of law but also in issuing directions and <lb/>orders to the authorities concerned for maintenance of the &quot;Rule of Law&quot;. <lb/>83. In the given situation, in the instant case, the action of the Executive, <lb/>without resorting to the Rule of Law in resumption of the land in question, <lb/>being controlled and maintained by the judiciary under the Civil jurisdiction, <lb/>cannot be said to be interpreted in the manner as contemplated under Section 3 <lb/>of the Government Grants Act, 1895, when notwithstanding any law for the <lb/>time being in force, the State has got absolute power to resume its own <lb/>property, which has been entrusted to the other organ of the democracy, <lb/>namely, Judiciary. The Executive should act only under the authority of law by <lb/>invoking appropriate jurisdiction, when the subject property is already under <lb/></body>

			<page>149 <lb/></page>

			<body>the control of the judiciary. Such an act of the State, in our considered opinion, <lb/>bypassed the procedures to be followed and is not the appropriate method to be <lb/>adopted by them for resumption of the land, though the said land is required for <lb/>a public purpose. Rule of law is supreme beginning with the fundamental to <lb/>special features of Constitution and no authority under them can waive such <lb/>jurisdictional limits contemplated under law. This Court has already taken a <lb/>view in one way or the other in interpreting Section 3 of the Government <lb/>Grants Act, 1895 and the basic structure of the Constitution is the fundament of <lb/>the Constitution. Therefore, the three organs should always be within the Rule <lb/>of law. <lb/>84. In this regard, the crucial question that arises for consideration in this <lb/>case is, when one organ of democracy, namely, the executive/Government has <lb/>been empowered to entrust its own property to another organ viz., judiciary <lb/>under which the control has been given to Administrator General &amp; Official <lb/>Trustee (AGOT) under an enactment, on the principle of eminent domain, can <lb/>the Government invoke another enactment i.e., Government Grants Act under <lb/>Section 3, resuming the land on its own, without resorting to any procedure <lb/>contemplated under the Official Trusts Act ? <lb/>85. To examine the above issue, in this case, the Government, while <lb/>making an order for resumption of land through its executive, did not take any <lb/>order either from the scheme court or from the AGOT Court. Though there <lb/></body>

			<page>150 <lb/></page>

			<body>were attempts made by the executive to file applications one by Chennai Metro <lb/>Rail Limited and the other by District Collector, subsequently, the same were <lb/>withdrawn. So, it is clear that there was no order made by AGOT Court, which <lb/>is the court of competent jurisdiction to permit AGOT to hand over the <lb/>possession of the land in its control to the Government, for resumption. The <lb/>said judicial procedure has been overlooked by the Government in resuming the <lb/>land, even of its own. This act of the Government, bypassing an act under <lb/>which the entrustment has been made, would amount to violation of the basic <lb/>structure of the Constitution of India and the power of separation which has <lb/>been demarcated could not be usurped by one organ on its own. <lb/>86. It is necessitated that though the earlier Division Benches of this <lb/>Court have taken their own perceptions on the matter, in the given facts and <lb/>circumstances of the case, our conscientious endeavour is to arrive at the <lb/>correct legal position in accordance with law, particularly, on the Basic <lb/>Structure of the Constitution and the Rule of Law. <lb/>Article 141 -Judicial Discipline and Binding Obligation : <lb/>87. The Supreme Court, with regard to the very same subject lands, on <lb/>the appeals filed by Chennai Metro Rail Limited and the State of Tamil Nadu in <lb/>Civil Appeal Nos.2572-2573 of 2014 and Civil Appeal Nos.2575-2578 of 2014 <lb/>respectively, against the Division Bench judgment, dated 12.07.2013, has dealt <lb/>with the matter as regards T.S.No.43/2 as well as T.S.No.41 and, by a <lb/>judgment, dated 21.02.2014, held that the project details and the plan annexed <lb/></body>

			<page>151 <lb/></page>

			<body>with it disclose that the lands situated in Survey No. 43/2 as well as Survey No. <lb/>41 were all part of the projects for putting up various other ancillary units such <lb/>as mechanical plant rooms, electrical plant rooms, building services, drop-off <lb/>and pick-up facilities, airport check-in facilities, ventilation shafts, subway, <lb/>feeder bus stand, multi-model facilities, pick-up and drop-off bay, MTC Bus <lb/>bay, fireman staircase, entry and exit points and that if the taking over of the <lb/>lands by the Chennai Metro is not allowed, the same would seriously prejudice <lb/>and cause unnecessary hurdles in proceeding with the project. Holding so, the <lb/>Supreme Court set aside the Division Bench judgment of this Court and <lb/>allowed W.A.Nos.68,69,89 and 90 of 2013, filed by State and CMRL, thereby <lb/>paving way for resumption of land for Chennai Metro Rail Project. Allowing <lb/>the appeals, the Supreme Court, however, directed the appellants therein, who <lb/>were State and CMRL, to value the buildings belonging to the first respondent <lb/>therein, who is not a party to the proceedings in these appeals, standing in <lb/>T.S.No.43/2, determine the compensation and pay the same to the first <lb/>respondent within three months. By the said judgment, the first respondent <lb/>therein was directed to surrender possession of the lands through AGOT within <lb/>four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of the said judgment. The relevant <lb/>portions of the judgment of the Supreme Court are as under : <lb/>&quot;18. While considering the submissions of learned <lb/>Additional Solicitor General and Mr. Gopal Subramanium, <lb/>learned Senior Counsel for the First Respondent, inasmuch <lb/>as we find that the reasoning of the Division Bench in <lb/>having stated that the underground Metro Station has been <lb/></body>

			<page>152 <lb/></page>

			<body>planned in a stretch of Land on the Northern side of the <lb/>Arterial Road, namely, Poonamallee High Road and that <lb/>certain other lands were available in that side and, <lb/>therefore, there was no necessity for taking over the lands <lb/>in the possession of the First Respondent is patently a <lb/>conclusion which was contrary to the records placed <lb/>before the Division Bench and the same cannot be <lb/>sustained. In other words, as rightly pointed out by learned <lb/>Additional Solicitor General, the conclusion of the <lb/>Division Bench that the lands concerned in these Appeals, <lb/>namely, the one situated in Survey No. 43/2 were not part <lb/>of the project of the Chennai Metro was a wrong <lb/>assimilation of facts. When it has been demonstrated <lb/>before us based on the project details and the plan annexed <lb/>with it, which disclose that the lands situated in Survey <lb/>No. 43/2 as well as Survey No. 41 were all part of the <lb/>projects for putting up various other ancillary units such as <lb/>mechanical plant rooms, electrical plant rooms, building <lb/>services, drop-off and pick-up facilities, airport check-in <lb/>facilities, ventilation shafts, subway, feeder bus stand, <lb/>multi-modal facilities, pick-up and drop-off bay, MTC Bus <lb/>bay, fireman staircase, entry and exit points, if the taking <lb/>over of the lands by the Chennai Metro is not allowed, the <lb/>same would seriously prejudice and cause unnecessary <lb/>hurdles in proceeding with the project. In our considered <lb/>view, the failure of the Division Bench in noting the <lb/>details displayed in the plan and the project which were <lb/>placed before it has resulted in the passing of the <lb/>impugned Order. The Division Bench failed to note that <lb/>the project details pertaining to the proposed underground <lb/>Metro Station and the other supporting provisions to be <lb/>made such as mechanical plant rooms, electrical plant <lb/>rooms, bus bay and other developments to be carried out <lb/>spread over a vast extent of land both on the Northern side <lb/>of the Poonamallee High Road as well as the lands situated <lb/>on the Southern side of the said Road with which we are <lb/>now concerned. Therefore, in the light of the above details <lb/>placed before the Court which according to learned <lb/>Additional Solicitor General was made available before <lb/>the Division Bench also, we have no reason to reject the <lb/>said submission in order to sustain the conclusion of the <lb/>Division Bench. In other words, the conclusion of the <lb/>Division Bench having been reached without properly <lb/>examining the relevant documents relating to the Chennai <lb/></body>

			<page>153 <lb/></page>

			<body>Metro Project, namely, the plans, the project schedule and <lb/>the other averments placed before the Division Bench, the <lb/>impugned order of the Division Bench cannot be <lb/>sustained. <lb/>19. Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior <lb/>Counsel appearing for the First Respondent in support of <lb/>his submission that the lands situated in Survey No. 43/2 <lb/>were not required at all for the purpose of carrying out the <lb/>Metro Project and referred to an affidavit filed before the <lb/>Division Bench by the Managing Director of Chennai <lb/>Metro Rail Limited. The learned Senior Counsel submitted <lb/>that in the said affidavit the reference to the Metro Rail <lb/>Station planned along the Poonamallee High Road has <lb/>been stated and while referring to the same, a specific <lb/>reference was made to the private buildings located <lb/>opposite to Picnic Hotel and that acquisition of those <lb/>private lands would cost dearly to the State Exchequer <lb/>apart from evacuation of the tenants/owners would <lb/>consume considerable length of time which would in turn <lb/>cause delay in the construction of the underground Station. <lb/>When we perused the said affidavit which has been <lb/>extracted in the reply affidavit filed by the Managing <lb/>Director of Chennai Metro in W.P. No. 19469 of 2012, we <lb/>find that statement came to be made when a litigation was <lb/>launched at the instance of Hotel Picnic and while meeting <lb/>the stand of Hotel Picnic, it was stated that the above <lb/>statement came to be made. We do not find any scope to <lb/>reject the stand of the Appellant with reference to the <lb/>lands situated in Survey No. 43/2 which had nothing to do <lb/>with the construction of the underground Metro Station. <lb/>Though, the various other units to be set up in the lands in <lb/>Survey No. 43/2 were also part of the Metro Project as has <lb/>been demonstrated before us based on relevant documents, <lb/>the reference to the Heritage Buildings and other private <lb/>buildings situated opposite to Hotel Picnic was referred to <lb/>by Chennai Metro while pointing out its inability to plan <lb/>the setting up of underground Metro Station in any other <lb/>land except the lands where Hotel Picnic was situated. <lb/>Therefore, the said submission of the learned Senior <lb/>Counsel for the First Respondent does not in any way <lb/>support the stand of the First Respondent. As far as the <lb/>contention of Mr. Gopal Subramanium that like in the case <lb/>of other occupants wherein a direction was issued by this <lb/></body>

			<page>154 <lb/></page>

			<body>Court to give a show cause notice and decide the matter, <lb/>the said contention cannot be countenanced in this case <lb/>inasmuch as before the Division Bench of the High Court <lb/>as well as before us the issue was argued on merits. In fact, <lb/>the Division Bench after hearing the Appellants and the <lb/>First Respondent allowed both his Writ Petitions by <lb/>modifying the order of the learned Single Judge and <lb/>thereby held that there was no necessity for a remand. <lb/>Therefore, since we have also decided the whole <lb/>controversy on merits there is no need for a remand. <lb/>20. Therefore, once we are convinced that the <lb/>entitlement of the Appellant to hold the lands belonging to <lb/>the State falling under Survey Nos. 43/2 as well as 41 <lb/>which the Appellant is able to take possession of from the <lb/>State Government without payment of any compensation, <lb/>the only other question to be examined is as to whether the <lb/>lease granted in favour of the First Respondent by the AG <lb/>&amp; OT based on the directions of the High Court can have <lb/>any implication in preventing the Appellant from taking <lb/>over the lands. As noted earlier, indisputably the lands in <lb/>Survey No. 43/2 belong to the State. At the time when the <lb/>lands were granted and assigned in favour of Sir <lb/>Ramaswamy Mudaliar Trust vide GO Ms. Nos. 763 and <lb/>253 dated 09.12.1898 and 17.01.1899 respectively, <lb/>conditions were imposed to the effect that the lands would <lb/>revert back to the Government when it ceases to be used <lb/>for the purpose for which it was granted and that should <lb/>the property at any time resumed by Government, the <lb/>compensation payable should in no case exceed the cost or <lb/>the then present value whichever shall be less of any <lb/>building erected or other works executed in the land. <lb/>Though, learned Additional Solicitor General sought to <lb/>contend as was also contended before the High Court that <lb/>by leasing out the lands to different parties the condition <lb/>No. 1 was violated, namely, that the land was put to <lb/>different use than for what it was granted, we do not find <lb/>any good grounds to accept the same. On the other hand, <lb/>we find that the Trust itself was vested with the AG &amp; OT <lb/>on 18.08.1970 pursuant to a Scheme Decree framed by the <lb/>High Court in C.S. No. 90 of 1963. From then onwards, <lb/>the AG &amp; OT was administering the Trust and was <lb/>apparently fulfilling the purpose for which the Trust came <lb/>to be created, though, by leasing out the lands to different <lb/></body>

			<page>155 <lb/></page>

			<body>individuals for the purpose of generating income from the <lb/>lands. The AG &amp; OT by approaching the High Court, as <lb/>and when required, seem to have granted the lease of the <lb/>lands to different parties based on the orders passed by the <lb/>High Court. <lb/>21. In so far as the First Respondent was concerned, <lb/>his lease came into existence initially on 22.12.1972, and <lb/>by Order dated 10.12.2004 in Application No. 915 of <lb/>2003, the lease in favour of the First Respondent was <lb/>extended for a further period of 25 years by enhancing the <lb/>rent. The said order was also confirmed by the Division <lb/>Bench in the Order dated 20.08.2009 in O.S.A. No. 298 of <lb/>2004. In the said circumstances, it cannot be held that the <lb/>said possession with the First Respondent was unlawful. <lb/>However, on that basis when it comes to the question of <lb/>resumption of the land by the State Government when the <lb/>Government through the AG &amp; OT thought it fit to resume <lb/>the lands which was in accordance with the terms <lb/>contained in the Original Grant, namely, GOS No. 763 and <lb/>253 dated 09.12.1898 and 17.01.1899, there would be no <lb/>scope for the First Respondent to contend that the <lb/>Appellants are not entitled for the resumption of the lands <lb/>situated in Survey No. 43/2. <lb/>22. We, therefore, hold that the State Government as <lb/>the owner of the land and having regard to the right <lb/>retained by it while making the grant in the years 1898 and <lb/>1899 and in the larger public interest of setting up of the <lb/>Chennai Metro Project the lands were required by it, the <lb/>same cannot be questioned by the Original Grantee or by <lb/>the lessees whose holding was subordinate in character to <lb/>the Original Grantee. Therefore, we do not find any <lb/>justification in the Division Bench in having interfered <lb/>with the impugned GO Ms. No. 168 dated 21.05.2012 and <lb/>the consequential orders of the Tehsildar dated 21.06.2012 <lb/>and that of the AG &amp; OT dated 25.06.2012 directing the <lb/>First Respondent to handover possession of the lands. <lb/>23. Therefore, while the impugned GO and the <lb/>consequential orders of the Tehsildar and AG &amp; OT can be <lb/>sustained, having regard to the condition contained in the <lb/>initial GO Ms. Nos. 763 and 253 dated 09.12.1898 and <lb/>17.01.1899 since based on valid orders of the High Court <lb/>and the AG &amp; OT the First Respondent developed its <lb/></body>

			<page>156 <lb/></page>

			<body>Hotel business in the lands in question, while resuming the <lb/>lands, the State Government along with the Chennai Metro <lb/>is bound to compensate the First Respondent for the <lb/>buildings which were erected in the said land in Survey <lb/>No. 43/2 based on the valuation to be made by the <lb/>appropriate Authorities. <lb/>24. Therefore, while allowing the Appeals of the <lb/>State Government as well as the Chennai Metro and while <lb/>setting aside the Judgment of the Division Bench, Writ <lb/>Appeal Nos. 68, 69, 89 and 90 of 2013 are allowed. We, <lb/>however, direct the Appellants to value the buildings <lb/>belonging to the First Respondent standing in Survey No. <lb/>43/2 and determine the compensation and pay the same to <lb/>the First Respondent. The said exercise of valuation and <lb/>payment of compensation shall be effected within three <lb/>months from this date. <lb/>25. In the light of our above orders, the First <lb/>Respondent is directed to surrender possession of the lands <lb/>in Survey No. 43/2 in an extent of 5644 sq. ft. through the <lb/>AG &amp; OT within four weeks from the date of receipt of <lb/>copy of this judgment. With the above directions, these <lb/>appeals are allowed.&quot; <lb/>88. Judicial discipline binds us and the constitutional wisdom <lb/>underlined under Article 141 of the Constitution is to be followed. The parties <lb/>before the Supreme Court with regard to Survey Nos.41 and 43/2 were same. <lb/>The Apex Court discussed about both the above survey numbers, while dealing <lb/>with survey number 43/2. Under the circumstances, the ratio laid down by the <lb/>Supreme Court in its recent judgment, allowing the appeals filed by State and <lb/>Chennai Metro Rail Limited, has to be squarely made applicable to the present <lb/>case also. <lb/>89. Accordingly, while upholding the rule of law that there shall be a <lb/></body>

			<page>157 <lb/></page>

			<body>proper procedure to approach the AGOT Court and also the competent court of <lb/>civil jurisdiction where the scheme decree has been formulated for control and <lb/>management of the property for obtaining an order before resumption of the <lb/>land under the Official Trustees Act, applying the law laid down by the <lb/>Supreme Court in Civil Appeal Nos.2572-2573 and 2575-2578 of 2014, these <lb/>Writ Appeals are to be dismissed. <lb/>90. It is true, as contended by the learned Additional Advocate General, <lb/>Section 3 of the Government Grants Act declares the unfettered discretion of <lb/>the Government to impose such conditions and limitations as it thinks fit, no <lb/>matter what the general law of the land be. The meaning of Sections 2 and 3 of <lb/>the Government Grants is that the scope of that Act is not limited to affecting <lb/>the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act only. The Government has <lb/>unfettered discretion to impose any conditions, limitations, or restrictions in its <lb/>grants, and the rights, privileges and obligations of the grantee would be <lb/>regulated according to the terms of the grant, notwithstanding any provisions of <lb/>any statutory or common law, but the same shall be subject to Rule of Law and <lb/>cananot be contrary to the basic structure of the Constitution, which means the <lb/>Government should follow the proper procedure, which, in this case, is already <lb/>in currency but not followed, while revoking the grants. <lb/>91. Moreso, Article 300-A would be equally violated if the provisions of <lb/>law authorising deprivation of property have not been complied with. While <lb/>enacting Article 300-A, the Parliament has only borrowed Article 31(1), the <lb/></body>

			<page>158 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;Rule of law&quot; doctrine and not Article 31(2), which had embodied the doctrine <lb/>of &quot;Eminent Domain&quot;. Article 300-A enables the State to put restrictions on the <lb/>right to property by law. That law has to be reasonable. It must comply with <lb/>other provisions of the Constitution. The limitation or restriction should not be <lb/>arbitrary or excessive. The legislation providing for deprivation of property <lb/>under Article 300-A must be just, fair and reasonable, as understood in terms of <lb/>Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 26(b), 301, etc. Thus, in each case, courts will have to <lb/>examine the scheme of the impugned Act, its object, purpose as also the <lb/>question whether payment of nil compensation or nominal compensation would <lb/>make the impugned law unjust, unfair or unreasonable in terms of other <lb/>provisions of the Constitution, as indicated above. <lb/>92. Therefore, we are constrained to hold that though there is a violation <lb/>of Rule of Law by the authorities in resumption of lands in question, with <lb/>heavy heart, by giving due respect to the ratio decidendi of the Supreme Court <lb/>with regard to the very same subject lands, we are left with no other choice but <lb/>to follow the same under Article 141 of the Constitution. <lb/>93. However, while parting with, we feel it our duty to say that the <lb/>executive action taken in this case by the State and its officers is incompatible <lb/>to the basic principle of the Rule of Law. The facts and the position in law are <lb/>(1) that the buildings constructed on the piece of Government land did not <lb/>belong to Government, (2) that the petitioners were in possession and <lb/>occupation of the buildings and (3) that by virtue of enactments binding on the <lb/></body>

			<page>159 <lb/></page>

			<body>Government, the petitioners could be dispossessed, if at all, only in pursuance <lb/>of a decree of a Civil Court obtained in proceedings properly initiated. Under <lb/>the circumstances, the action of the Government in taking the law into their <lb/>hands and dispossessing the appellants by way of a Government Order exhibits <lb/>a clear disregard to the normal requirements of the rule of law, apart from what <lb/>might legitimately and reasonably be expected from a Government functioning <lb/>in a society governed by a Constitution which guarantees to its citizens against <lb/>arbitrary invasion by the executive of peaceful possession of property. At the <lb/>same time, this Court is conscious of the situation, wherein the subject land has <lb/>been sought to be acquired for a public purpose on a larger public interest of <lb/>the people of Chennai Metropolitan city; the significance of the project, the <lb/>delay in its execution and the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court so also the <lb/>concern of CMRL for taking possession of the land for putting up various <lb/>ancillary units, such as, mechanical plant rooms, electrical plant rooms, <lb/>building services, drop-off and pick-up facilities, airport check-in facilities, <lb/>ventilation shafts, subway, feeder bus stand, multi-modal facilities, pick-up and <lb/>drop-off bay, MTC Bus bay, fireman staircase and entry and exit points. <lb/>94. With the above obiter dicta, all these Writ Appeals are dismissed. No <lb/>costs. Consequently, the connected M.Ps. are closed. <lb/>Index : Yes <lb/>(V.D.P.,J.) <lb/>(M.D.,J.) <lb/>Internet : Yes <lb/>12-06-2014 <lb/>dixit <lb/></body>
