COMMON JUDGMENT 
(Judgement of this Court was made by S. MANIKUMAR, J.) 

C.M.A.No.3273 of 2014 is preferred by M/s.Royal Sundaram Alliance 

Insurance Co. Ltd., Salem, challenging the compensation of 

Rs.25,61,000/-, awarded to legal representatives of the deceased, in 

M.C.O.P.No.549 of 2012, dated 31.10.2013, on the file of the Motor 

Accident Claims Tribunal, Additional District Court, Dharmapuri. 

2. 
In C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, M/s.Royal Sundaram Alliance 

Insurance Co. Ltd., Salem, has challenged the award made in 

M.C.O.P.No.253 of 2014, dated 10.09.2014, by which, the Motor Accident 


4 

Claims Tribunal, Special District Court, Dharmapuri, has awarded 

Rs.18,82,600/-with interest, at the rate of 7.5% per annum, from the 

date of claim, till the date of realisation. 

3. 
In C.M.A.No.2386 of 2015, the Managing Director, 

Metropolitan Transport Corporation (Chennai) Ltd., Chennai, has filed an 

appeal, with a delay of 20 days, challenging the award made in 

M.C.O.P.No.4193 of 2011, dated 22.08.2014, on the file of the Motor 

Accident Claims Tribunal (2 nd Court of Small Causes), Chennai, by which, 

compensation of Rs.16,10,000/-has been awarded to the legal 

representatives of the deceased. 

4. 
In all the appeals, the common issue, raised by the Insurance 

Company as well as the Transport Corporation, is that the Tribunals, 

while passing awards, as stated supra, have erred in fixing the monthly 

income of the deceased, in each of the appeals and should not add up 

income, under the head, future prospects, for the purpose of computing 

compensation to be paid to the family of the deceased. Contentions have 

been raised that except in the case of salaried persons, where there is a 

permanent source of income, there should not be any addition, towards 

future prospects, for computing the loss of contribution to the bereaved 

family. 


5 

5. 
On the contra, it is the contention of the learned counsel for 

the respondents/claimants that considering the escalation in the price of 

essential commodities, fuel, electricity and other factors, affecting the 

living conditions, wages or salary or earning in the case of self-employed 

has increased, and hence, the Tribunals/Courts should add up income, 

under the head, future prospects, while computing compensation. On 

merits, in respect of each of the appeals, arguments have been advanced 

that there should be increase in the quantum of compensation. 

6. 
Reference has also been made to the judgments of the Apex 

Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd., v. Pushpa [SLP(C)No.8058 of 

2014, dated 31.10.2013] and Shashikala v. Gangalakshmamma reported 

in 2015 (3) MLJ 373 (Decided on 13.03.2015), where a Hon'ble Division 

Bench of the Supreme Court has sought for reference, in the matter of 

adding up a percentage of income, under the head, future prospects and 

based on the above reference, contentions have been made. Per contra, 

it is the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents/claimants, 

future prospects have been considered in Kalpanaraj v. Tamil Nadu State 

Transport Corporation reported in 2015 (2) SCC 764 (decided on 

22.04.2014) and therefore, there is no error, in cases, where, future 

prospects have been considered. 


6 

On the issue raised in the appeals, as to whether, the Tribunals can 

award compensation, by adding up certain percentage of income under 

the head, future prospects, we propose to dispose of the appeals, by a 

common order, besides considering each case, on its merits. 

7. 
In C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, filed by M/s.Royal Sundaram 

Alliance Insurance Co. Ltd., Salem, it is the version of the 

respondents/claimants that in the accident, which occurred on 

17.11.2012, Muthusamy, a 34 year old man, claimed to have owned a 

grocery shop, besides engaged in Agriculture, sustained grievous injuries. 

Initially, he was provided treatment in Government Hospital, Dharmapuri 

and thereafter, referred to Mohan Kumaramangalam Hospital, Salem. He 

was inpatient between 17.11.2012 and 23.11.2012. Despite intensive 

treatment, he died. Wife, aged 27 years, minor son, aged 12 years, minor 

daughter, aged 10 years and parents, aged 55 and 65 years, have 

preferred a claim petition in M.C.O.P.No.131 of 2013, before the District 

Court, Dharmapuri, claiming compensation of Rs.15,00,000/-. The said 

claim petition has subsequently been transferred to the Motor Accident 

Claims Tribunal (Special District Court), Dharmapuri and re-numbered as 

M.C.O.P.No.253 of 2014. 


7 

8. 
Before the Tribunal, the claim of the respondents/claimants 

was that at the time of accident, Muthusamy was aged 34 years. He 

owned a grocery shop, besides engaging in Agriculture and earned 

Rs.8,000/-per month. There was no income proof. However, upon 

perusal of the contents of Ex.P8, Notices (2) sent by the Syndicate Bank, 

Mattalampati to the deceased, Muthusamy, the Tribunal has found that 

the said loan had been obtained only for the grocery shop and as he had 

defaulted, notices have been issued by the Bank. Upon perusal of Ex.P10, 

Patta (2), the Tribunal has also noticed that the deceased owned 

agricultural lands. Having regard to the number of dependants, viz., five 

and the documents, Exs.P8 and P10, stated supra, the Tribunal came to 

the conclusion that the deceased would have earned Rs.8,000/-per 

month. Thus, the Tribunal has fixed the monthly income as Rs.8,000/-. 

9. 
Mr.M.B.Gopalan, learned counsel for the appellants in 

C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, contended that the Tribunal has grossly erred in 

fixing the monthly income of the deceased as Rs.8,000/-, when there was 

no proof for the income and further contended that in such 

circumstances, notional income alone ought to have been taken into 

account, for the purpose of computing the loss of contribution of the 

family. 


8 

10. Ex.P8, Notices (2) sent by the Syndicate Bank, Mattalampati 

to the deceased, for recovery of the loan borrowed for the grocery shop, 

support the case of the respondents/claimants, as regards the avocation 

claimed. From the said business, one could reasonably expect that he 

would have earned Rs.5,000/-to Rs.7,000/-per month. Ex.P10, Patta (2), 

indicates that the deceased owned and possessed agricultural lands. The 

accident occurred in Dharmapuri District. 

11. During the course of hearing, Mr.S.Sathiaseelan, learned 

counsel for the respondents/claimants submitted that the extent of land 

covered under Ex.P10, was four acres. Even taking it for granted, there is 

a diminution in agricultural income, considering the extent of land, stated 

to have owned and possessed by the deceased and the agricultural 

activity, the possibility of augmenting some more income, from the 

agricultural lands, cannot be ruled out. 

12. But placing reliance on a decisions in Syed Sadiq etc. Vs. 

Division Manager, United India Insurance Company Limited reported in 

2014(1) TNMAC 459, Mr.S.Sathiaseelan, learned counsel for the 

respondents/claimants submitted that he has no objection, for the 

income being fixed at Rs.6,500/-, as done by the Hon'ble Apex Court, in 


9 

the above reported judgment, in the case of a vegetable vendor. In the 

reported case, the accident occurred in the year 2008 and the Apex Court 

fixed the monthly income as Rs.6,500/-. In the present case, the 

accident occurred on 20.02.2012. At the time of accident, the deceased 

was aged 34 years. There is no quarrel over the determination of the age, 

done as per the entry in Ex.P3 -Post-Mortem Certificate and such 

determination is also supported by declaration in the claim petition and 

fortified by the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Fakeerappa v. 

Karnataka Cement Pipe Factory reported in 2004 (4) LW 20 and The 

Managing Director, Tamilnadu State Transport Corporation, Madurai v. 

Mary [2005 (5) CTC 515]. 

13. By determining the monthly income as Rs.8,000/-and 

thereafter, adding 30% of the monthly income, towards future prospects 

and after deducting 1/4 th towards the personal and living expenses and by 

application of '16' multiplier, the Tribunal has computed the loss of 

contribution to the family as Rs.14,97,600/-. In addition to the above, the 

Claims Tribunal has awarded Rs.50,000/-each, under the head, loss of 

love and affection, to each of the claimants, which works out to 

Rs.2,50,000/-. Under the head, loss of consortium, to the 1 st 

respondent/claimant, the Claims Tribunal has awarded Rs.1,00,000/-. In 


10 

addition to the above, the Claims Tribunal has awarded Rs.10,000/-

towards transportation and Rs.25,000/-towards Funeral Expenses. In all, 

the Tribunal has awarded Rs.18,82,600/-as total compensation. 

14. Though in C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, it is the objection of 

M/s.Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Co. Ltd., Salem that the Tribunal 

ought not to have added up 30% towards future prospects, considering the 

age of the deceased, 34 years and the number of dependents, it is the 

contrary contention of Mr.S.Sathieseelan, the learned counsel for the 

respondents/claimants that the Tribunal ought to have added 50% 

towards future prospects, while determining the monthly income. It is 

also his contention that compensation awarded under the heads, loss of 

love and affection and the loss of contribution to the family, should be 

enhanced, as the compensation awarded by the Tribunal, under the above 

heads, is not just. He also submitted that before the death, the deceased 

was hospitalised in Mohan Kumaramangalam Hospital, Salem, between 

17.11.2012 and 23.11.2012 and underwent surgery and therefore, the 

Tribunal ought to have awarded compensation, under the head, pain and 

suffering, to the respondents/claimants. 


11 

15. In C.M.A.No.3273 of 2014, the accident has occurred on 

20.02.2015. Govindasamy, rider of a Motor Cycle (Hero Honda), bearing 

Registration No.TN 29 AJ 0410, aged about 35 years, died. He was stated 

to be a lorry owner cum driver. Wife, aged 22 years, parents, aged 58 and 

60 years and daughters, aged 42 and 37 years, respectively, have 

preferred a claim for compensation of Rs.15,00,000/-. 

16. To support the contention that the deceased owned a lorry, 

bearing Registration No.TN 30 S 5400, Ex.P10, document has been 

marked. Upon perusal of the same, the Claims Tribunal has observed that 

the deceased had purchased the said lorry from one Gomathi. Going 

through Ex.P11, the Tribunal has also found that the permit in the name 

of Gomathi had been transferred in the name of Govindasamy. Ex.P12 is 

the driving licence of the deceased and Ex.P13 is the Pan Card. Thus, 

after considering the abovesaid documents, marked on the side of the 

respondents/claimants, the Claims Tribunal has arrived at the conclusion 

that the deceased was a lorry owner cum driver. 

17. PW.1, wife of the deceased, has deposed that the deceased 

earned Rs.20,000/-per month. But the Tribunal, fixed the same, only as 

Rs.15,000/-per month, and adding up 30% towards future prospects, 


12 

fixed the monthly income at Rs.19,500/-for computing the loss of 

contribution to the family. Sisters were not awarded any compensation. 

The number of dependants were reduced to three. The Tribunal applied 

'16' multiplier, as per the 2 nd Schedule to Section 163-A of the Motor 

Vehicles Act and deducted 1/3 rd towards the personal and living expenses 

of the deceased and accordingly, computed the loss of contribution to the 

family, as Rs.24,96,000/-(Rs.19,500 x 16 x 12 x 1/3). 

18. In addition to the above, the Claims Tribunal has awarded 

Rs.10,000/-each to the wife and parents, under the head loss of love and 

affection. Rs.5,000/-is awarded towards Funeral Expenses and another 

sum of Rs.5,000/-under the head, transportation. The Tribunal has 

awarded Rs.25,000/-as loss of consortium. Altogether, the Claims 

Tribunal has awarded Rs.25,61,000/-, with interest, and apportioned the 

compensation, stating that the wife would be entitled to Rs.8,70,334/-

and the parents would be entitled to Rs.8,45,333/-each. 

19. Here again, the contention of M/s.Royal Sundaram Alliance 

Insurance Co. Ltd., Salem, is that the Claims Tribunal has erred in fixing 

the monthly income of the deceased, as Rs.15,000/-, without any 

evidence and also erred in adding up 30% of the future prospects, which is 


13 

not warranted, when determination of the monthly income of the 

deceased itself, is without proof and excessive. 

20. On the determination of monthly income of Rs.15,000/-, 

Mr.G.K.Sekar, learned counsel for the respondents/claimants submitted 

that the monthly income of the deceased fixed by the Tribunal as 

Rs.15,000/-, by operating a lorry with a national permit, by the owner-

cum-driver, cannot be said to be without any basis and more so, when 

Ex.P11 -Transfer of Permit, Ex.P12 -Driving Licence and Ex.P13 -Pan 

Card, have been produced before the Tribunal, to support the contention 

of avocation and income. 

21. It is also the contention of the learned counsel for the 

respondents/claimants that as the deceased was aged 35 years, the 

Tribunal ought to have added 50% towards future prospects, for 

determining the loss of dependency. He also prayed for suitable 

enhancement of compensation, under the heads, loss of consortium, loss 

of love and affection and funeral expenses. He pointed out that there is 

no award for conventional damages. For the abovesaid reasons, he prayed 

this Court to grant a reasonable compensation. 


14 

22. In C.M.A.No.2386 of 2015, that on 28.07.2011, about 05.20 

P.M., the deceased, B.Yasodha, aged about 53 years, was waiting at 

Thiruvotiyur bus stop, near Railway Gate, to go to her home and a bus, 

bearing Registration No.TN 01 N 5614, owned by the appellant-Transport 

Corporation, came from East to West direction, and stopped near the 

Railway Gate. When the deceased was boarding the bus, without noticing 

her, the driver suddenly started the bus, in a rash and negligent manner, 

due to which, she fell down from the bus and sustained grievous injuries, 

which resulted in death. In this regard, a case in Cr.No.144/H1/2011, has 

been registered against the driver of the bus, on the file of H-1 Traffic 

Investigation Washermenpet Range. 

23. Though the appellant-Transport Corporation has defended 

negligence, attributed against the driver of the bus, by stating that when 

the driver stopped the bus, near the Railway Gate, the deceased 

attempted to board the moving bus, through the front door, upon 

evaluation of pleadings and evidence, the Claims Tribunal has rejected 

the said defence and held that the driver of the bus, was negligent in 

causing the accident. 


15 

24. Perusal of the impugned judgment shows that to prove the 

manner of accident, PW.1, Mr.B.Thanga, has adduced evidence and 

marked Ex.P1 -FIR in Cr.No.144/H1/2011, registered against the driver of 

the bus, on the file of H-1 Traffic Investigation Washermenpet Range. 

PW.2, Mr.Ramesh, stated to have witnessed the accident, has supported 

the manner of accident. Though RW.1, driver of the bus, has deposed 

that at the time of accident, the deceased, who attempted to board the 

moving bus, lost her grip, fell down and succumbed to the fatal injuries 

and that there was a case of contributory negligence, the Claims 

Tribunal, by observing that the testimony of PW.2, eye-witness, was 

cogent and nothing has been elicited, in his cross-examination to discredit 

his reliability and held that it was RW.1, driver of the bus, was negligent 

in causing the accident. 

25. Though in the present appeal, the appellant-Transport 

Corporation has contended that the Claims Tribunal has erred in fixing 

negligence on the driver of the bus, when the accident occurred only due 

to the negligence of the deceased, this Court is not inclined to accept the 

same, for the reason that it is the fundamental duty of the crew viz., 

driver and conductor to see whether any passenger is getting into the bus 

or getting down from the bus before moving the bus. It is also the duty of 


16 

the driver and conductor to caution the passengers when they attempt to 

get down, irrespective of the fact whether that place is a bus stop or not. 

Reference can be made to the decisions made in Venkataswami Motor 

Service v. C.K.Chinnaswamy and others [1998 ACJ 371], 

M.Jagannathan v. Pallavan Transport Corporation Ltd., [1999 ACJ 366] 

and Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Madurai Division III) Ltd. 

v. Saraswathi and four others [2000 (1) LW 318]. 

26. It is settled law that in matters relating to Motor Accidents 

Claims, it is sufficient that there is preponderance of probability to the 

manner of accident and strict proof of evidence is not required. In the 

instant case, no concrete material is available to reverse the order of the 

Tribunal. On the other hand, there is ample evidence to conclude that 

the accident had occurred in the manner as detailed by the claimant. 

Therefore, the finding of the Tribunal regarding negligence is confirmed. 

27. On the quantum of compensation, it was the claimed by the 

respondents/claimant that the deceased was aged 53 years, but there is 

no documentary evidence. However, the Claims Tribunal, upon perusal of 

the entires made in Ex.P2 -Post-Mortem Certificate, fixed the age of the 

deceased as 54 years, at the time of accident. Before the Claims 


17 

Tribunal, the respondents/claimants have filed Ex.P4 -Legal Heirs 

Certificate and upon perusal of the same, the Claims Tribunal satisfied 

itself that the respondents/claimants are the sons and daughters of the 

deceased. However, during the pendency of the claim petition, the 3 rd 

claimant, B.Sathya, died on 29.10.2012 and his death certificate has been 

marked as Ex.P7. Therefore, the Claims Tribunal has come to the 

conclusion that the respondents 1, 2, 4 & 5/claimants are entitled to 

compensation. 

28. Before the Claims Tribunal, it was the contention of the 

respondents/claimants that the deceased was a Senior Factory Assistant 

in Tamil Nadu Co-operative Milk Federation Limited and earned 

Rs.18,900/-per month. As per Ex.P6 -Pay Slip, for the month of April, 

2011, the gross income of the deceased was Rs.18,900.40ps. Upon perusal 

of the same, the Claims Tribunal has noticed that deductions were not 

mentioned clearly and no signature was there. To prove the income, no 

employer was examined. Therefore, the Claims Tribunal has fixed the 

monthly income at Rs.15,000/-. Having regard to the age of the 

deceased, 54 years, as per Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation 

Ltd., reported in 2009 (2) TNMAC 1, the Tribunal applied '11' multiplier 

and computed the dependency compensation, by deducting 1/4 th towards 


18 

the personal and living expenses of the deceased. Thus, the Tribunal has 

arrived the pecuniary loss at Rs.14,85,000/-. 

29. 
That apart, the Claims Tribunal has awarded Rs.1,00,000/-

as compensation, under the head, loss of love and affection to the 

respondents/claimants. A sum of Rs.25,000/-is awarded under the head, 

funeral expenses. Altogether, the Claims Tribunal has awarded 

Rs.16,10,000/-, with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum, from the 

date of claim, till deposit. 

30. It is the submission of the appellant-Transport Corporation 

that even though the deceased had only four years of remaining service, 

as per the decision in Sarla Verma's case (cited supra), the Tribunal has 

applied a higher multiplier of '11' and computed the loss of contribution 

to the family and therefore, no further addition of income is required. 

31. Learned counsel for the respondents/claimants submitted 

that 10% income ought to have been added, while computing the loss of 

contribution to the family. He has sought for enhancement under the 

head, loss of love and affection and prayed for a higher compensation, 

towards transportation and damages to clothes and articles. 


19 

32. The main issue addressed in the present appeals, is whether, 

the legal representatives of the deceased, self-employed, can seek for 

determination of income, by adding up certain percentage of income, 

under the head, future prospects, while computing the loss of 

contribution of the bereaved family. There are other issues of awarding 

lesser compensation under other heads. 

33. Let us consider the line of the judgments, dealing with the 

determination of income and the addition component, future prospects. 

(i) 
In Smt.Sarla Verma & Ors. v. Delhi Transport Corporation 

and another reported in 2009 (2) TNMAC 1 (SC), (Decided on 

15.04.2009 by two Judges Bench) at Paragraphs 10 and 11, the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court held as follows: 

"Question (i) -addition to income for future 

prospects: 

10. Generally the actual income of the deceased less 

income tax should be the starting point for calculating the 

compensation. The question is whether actual income at 

the time of death should be taken as the income or 

whether any addition should be made by taking note of 

future prospects. In Susamma Thomas, this Court held that 

the future prospects of advancement in life and career 


20 

should also be sounded in terms of money to augment the 

multiplicand (annual contribution to the dependants); and 

that where the deceased had a stable job, the court can 

take note of the prospects of the future and it will be 

unreasonable to estimate the loss of dependency on the 

actual income of the deceased at the time of death. In 

that case, the salary of the deceased, aged 39 years at the 

time of death, was Rs.1032/-per month. Having regard to 

the evidence in regard to future prospects, this Court was of 

the view that the higher estimate of monthly income could 

be made at Rs.2000/-as gross income before deducting the 

personal living expenses. The decision in Susamma Thomas 

was followed in Sarla Dixit v. Balwant Yadav [1996 (3) SCC 

179], where the deceased was getting a gross salary of 

Rs.1543/-per month. Having regard to the future prospects 

of promotions and increases, this Court assumed that by the 

time he retired, his earning would have nearly doubled, say 

Rs.3000/-. This court took the average of the actual income 

at the time of death and the projected income if he had 

lived a normal life period, and determined the monthly 

income as Rs.2200/-per month. In Abati Bezbaruah v. Dy. 

Director General, Geologicial Survey of India [2003 (3) SCC 

148], as against the actual salary income of Rs.42,000/-per 

annum, (Rs.3500/-per month) at the time of accident, this 

court assumed the income as Rs.45,000/-per annum, having 

regard to the future prospects and career advancement of 

the deceased who was 40 years of age. 


21 

11. In General Manager, Kerala State Road Transport 

Corporation v. Susamma Thomas, [1994 (2) SCC 176], this 

Court increased the income by nearly 100%, in Sarla Dixit, 

the income was increased only by 50% and in Abati 

Bezbaruah the income was increased by a mere 7%. In view 

of imponderables and uncertainties, we are in favour of 

adopting as a rule of thumb, an addition of 50% of actual 

salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards 

future prospects, where the deceased had a permanent 

job and was below 40 years. [Where the annual income is 

in the taxable range, the words `actual salary' should be 

read as `actual salary less tax']. The addition should be 

only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years. 

There should be no addition, where the age of deceased is 

more than 50 years. Though the evidence may indicate a 

different percentage of increase, it is necessary to 

standardize the addition to avoid different yardsticks 

being applied or different methods of calculations being 

adopted. Where the deceased was self-employed or was 

on a fixed salary (without provision for annual increments 

etc.), the courts will usually take only the actual income 

at the time of death. A departure therefrom should be 

made only in rare and exceptional cases involving special 

circumstances."

(ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court in R.K.Malik v. Kiran Pal reported in 

2009 (1) TNMAC 593 (SC) (Decided on 15.05.2009 by two Judges Bench), 

standardised the payment of compensation for the death of children, upto 

the age of 18 years, by applying different multipliers, taking the notional 

income of Rs.15,000/-per annum. The quantum of compensation towards 

non-pecuniary loss of Rs.75,000/-and a further compensation of 

Rs.75,000/-for future prospects, remain the same, irrespective of the 

age group. In the reported case, the accident occurred on 18.11.1997, 

when a School bus, carrying school children, breaking the railing, got 

drowned in Yamuna river at Wazirabad Yamuna Bridge, killing 29 children. 

Though all the legal representatives of the deceased filed separate claims, 

under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the Tribunal, by its 

common award, dated 06.12.2004, awarded a sum of Rs.1,55,000/-to the 

dependents of children between the age group of 10 to 15 years and 

Rs.1,65,000/-between 15 to 18 years. Three of the children, viz., Kailash 

Rathi, Neena Jain and Jatish Sharma were less than 10 years. In the case of 

Kailash Rathi, compensation of Rs.1,05,000/-was awarded and in the cases 

of Neena Jain and Jatish Sharma, compensation of Rs.1,30,000/-and 

Rs.1,31,000/-respectively was awarded. In addition to the above, 

Rs.1,000/-was awarded in the case of Jatish Sharma, as in some other 

cases, for loss of books. The Tribunal has awarded Rs.5,000/-each towards 


23 

funeral and last rites. While computing dependency compensation, 

Rs.5,000/-was deducted towards personal living expenses, after applying 

'15' multiplier for children, below 15 years and '16' multiplier for children, 

between 16 and 18 years respectively. While considering the aspect, as to 

how, the quantum of compensation to be arrived at, by the Claims 

Tribunals/Courts, the Apex Court in R.K.Malik's case, at Paragraphs 10 to 12 

and 14, held as follows: 

"10. Undoubtedly, the compensation in law is paid 

to restore the person, who has suffered damage or loss in 

the same position, if the tortuous act or the breach of 

contract had not been committed. The law requires that 

the party suffering should be put in the same position, if 

the contract had been performed or the wrong had not 

been committed. The law in all such matters requires 

payment of adequate, reasonable and just monetary 

compensation. 

11. In cases of motor accidents the endeavour is to 

put the dependents/claimants in the pre-accidental 

position. Compensation in cases of motor accidents, as in 

other matters, is paid for reparation of damages. The 

damages so awarded should be adequate sum of money 

that would put the party, who has suffered, in the same 

position if he had not suffered on account of the wrong. 

Compensation is therefore required to be paid for 

prospective pecuniary loss i.e. future loss of 


24 

income/dependency suffered on account of the 

wrongful act. 

12. However, no amount of compensation can 

restore the lost limb or the experience of pain and 

suffering due to loss of life. Loss of a child, life or a 

limb can never be eliminated or ameliorated 

completely. To put it simply -pecuniary damages 

cannot replace a human life or limb lost. Therefore, in 

addition to the pecuniary losses, the law recognises 

that payment should also be made for non-pecuniary 

losses on account of, loss of happiness, pain, suffering 

and expectancy of life, etc. The Act provides f or 

payment of "just compensation" vide Sections 166 and 

168. It is left to the Courts to decide what would be 

"just compensation" in facts of a case. 

14. For calculating the yearly Loss of Dependency 

the starting point is the wages being earned by the 

deceased, less his personal and living expenses. This 

provides a basic figure. Thereafter, effect is given to the 

future prospects of the deceased, inflation and general 

price rise that erodes value and the purchasing power 

of money." 

Addressing the problem of quantifying the loss in the case of death of 

children, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, at Paragraph 15, observed as 

follows: 


25 

"15. The real problem that arises in the cases of 

death of children is that they are not earning at the 

time of the accident. In most of the cases they were 

still studying and not working. However, under no 

stretch of imagination it can be said that the parents, 

who are appellants herein, have not suffered any 

pecuniary loss. In fact, Loss of Dependency by its very 

nature is awarded for prospective or future loss. In this 

context, Lord Atkinson aptly observed in Taff Vale Rly. 

Co. v. Jenkins , (1911-13) All E.R. 160 as follows: 

"In case of the death of an infant, there may have 

been no actual pecuniary benefit derived by its parents 

during the child's lifetime. But this will not necessarily bar 

the parents' claim and prospective loss will found a valid 

claim provided that the parents establish that they had a 

reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit if the child 

had lived." 

As regards the assessment of non-pecuniary loss, the Supreme Court, at 

Paragraphs 19 to 23, extracted the decisions, as hereunder: 

"19.The other issue is with regard to non-pecuniary 

compensation to the appellants-dependents on the loss of 

human life, loss of company, companionship, happiness, pain 

and suffering, loss of expectation of life etc. 

20. In the Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edition, Vol. 

12, page 446, it has been stated with regard to non-pecuniary 


26 

loss as follows: 

"Non-pecuniary loss: the pattern. 

Damages awarded for pain and suffering and loss of 

amenity constitute a conventional sum which is taken to be 

the sum which society deems fair, fairness being interpreted 

by the Courts in the light of previous decisions. Thus there 

has been evolved a set of conventional principles providing a 

provisional guide to the comparative severity of different 

injuries, and indicating a bracket of damages into which a 

particular injury will currently fall. The particular 

circumstance of the plaintiff, including his age and any 

unusual deprivation he may suffer, is reflected in the actual 

amount of the award. 

The fall in the value of money leads to a continuing 

reassessment of these awards and to periodic reassessments 

of damages at certain key points in the pattern where the 

disability is readily identifiable and not subject to large 

variations in individual cases." 

21. In the case of Ward v. James, (1965) I All E R 

563, it was observed: 

"Although you cannot give a man so gravely injured 

much for his `lost years', you can, however, compensate him 

for his loss during his shortened, span, that is, during his 

expected `years of survival'. You can compensate him for his 

loss of earnings during that time, and for the cost of 

treatment, nursing and attendance. But how can you 

compensate him for being rendered a helpless invalid? He 


27 

may, owing to brain injury, be rendered unconscious for the 

rest of his days, or, owing to a back injury, be unable to rise 

from his bed. He has lost everything that makes life 

worthwhile. Money is no good to him. Yet Judges and juries 

have to do the best they can and give him what they think is 

fair. No wonder they find it well nigh insoluble. They are 

being asked to calculable. The figure is bound to be for the 

most part a conventional sum. The Judges have worked out a 

pattern, and they keep it in line with the changes in the 

value of money." 

22. The Supreme Court in the case of R.D.Hattangadi 

v. Pest Control (India) (P) Ltd., (1995) 1 SCC 551, at page 

556, has observed as follows in para 9: 

"9. Broadly speaking while fixing an amount of 

compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the 

damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary 

damages and special damages. Pecuniary damages are those 

which the victim has actually incurred and which are capable 

of being calculated in terms of money; whereas non-

pecuniary damages are those which are incapable of being 

assessed by arithmetical calculations. In order to appreciate 

two concepts pecuniary damages may include expenses 

incurred by the claimant: (i) medical attendance; (ii) loss of 

earning of profit up to the date of trial; (iii) other material 

loss. So far non-pecuniary damages are concerned, they may 

include (i) damages for mental and physical shock, pain and 

suffering, already suffered or likely to be suffered in future; 


28 

(ii) damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life 

which may include a variety of matters i.e. on account of 

injury the claimant may not be able to walk, run or sit; (iii) 

damages for the loss of expectation of life, i.e., on account 

of injury the normal longevity of the person concerned is 

shortened; (iv) inconvenience, hardship, discomfort, 

disappointment, frustration and mental stress in life." 

In this case, the Court awarded non-pecuniary special 

damages of Rs. 3, 00,000/-to the claimants. 

23. In Common Cause, A Registered Society v. Union 

of India (1999) 6 SCC 667 @ page 738, it was observed: 

"128. The object of an award of damages is to give the 

plaintiff compensation for damage, loss or injury he has 

suffered. The elements of damage recognised by law are 

divisible into two main groups: pecuniary and non-pecuniary. 

While the pecuniary loss is capable of being arithmetically 

worked out, the non-pecuniary loss is not so calculable. Non-

pecuniary loss is compensated in terms of money, not as a 

substitute or replacement for other money, but as a 

substitute, what McGregor says, is generally more important 

than money: it is the best that a court can do. In Mediana, 

Re87 Lord Halsbury, L.C. observed as under: 

"How is anybody to measure pain and suffering in 

moneys counted? Nobody can suggest that you can by 

arithmetical calculation establish what is the exact sum of 

money which would represent such a thing as the pain and 

suffering which a person has undergone by reason of an 


29 

accident.... But nevertheless the law recognises that as a 

topic upon which damages may be given." 

After considering the judgment in Lata Wadwa v. State of Bihar reported 

in 2001 ACJ 1735 and M.S. Grewal and another v. Deep Chand Sood 

and others (2001) 8 SCC 151, at Paragraph 31, the Apex Court in 

R.K.Malik's case (cited supra) held as follows: 

"31. A forceful submission has been made by the 

learned counsels appearing for the claimants-appellants 

that both the Tribunal as well as the High Court failed to 

consider the claims of the appellants with regard to the 

future prospects of the children. It has been submitted 

that the evidence with regard to the same has been 

ignored by the Courts below. On perusal of the evidence on 

record, we find merit in such submission that the Courts 

below have overlooked that aspect of the matter while 

granting compensation. It is well settled legal principle 

that in addition to awarding compensation for pecuniary 

losses, compensation must also be granted with regard 

to the future prospects of the children. It is incumbent 

upon the Courts to consider the said aspect while 

awarding compensation. Reliance in this regard may be 

placed on the decisions rendered by this Court in General 

Manager, Kerala S.R.T.C., v. Susamma Thomas, (1994) 2 

SCC 176; Sarla Dixit v. Balwant Yadav, (1996) 3 SCC 179; 

and Lata Wadhwa case (supra)." 


30 

Ultimately, the Supreme Court in R.K.Malik's case, awarded Rs.75,000/-

towards future prospects, holding that the legal representatives of the 

deceased are entitled to be compensated, under the head, "future 

prospects". 

(iii) In Reshma Kumar v. Madan Mohan reported in 2009 (2) 

TNMAC 36 (SC) : 2009 (13) SCC 422, (Decided on 23.07.2009 by two 

Judges' Bench), the following questions have been referred to a Larger 

Bench viz., (1) Whether the multiplier specified in the Second Schedule 

appended to the Act should be scrupulously applied in all the cases? And 

(2) Whether for determination of the multiplicand, the Act provides for 

any criterion, particularly as regards determination of future prospects?. 

(iv) The consideration in Sarla Verma's case, while adding a 

percentage to the income earned, at the time of death, was, whether, 

the deceased had a stable job, advancement in life and career. In Sarla 

Verma's case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the case of salaried 

persons. In the case of non-salaried or self employed or on a fixed salary 

(without provision for annual increments etc.), or if he was employed in 

unorganized sector, though paid salary or earned wages, whether the 

same would be static forever, without any upward revision? In respect of 


31 

self-employed, what is the effect of rise in the cost price and the efforts 

of the self-employed to generate more income, the above aspects have 

been considered in Santhosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., 

reported in 2012 (6) SCC 421. 

(v) In Santhosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., reported in 

2012 (6) SCC 421 (Decided on 23.04.2012 by two Judges Bench), the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court, held as follows: 

"14. We find it extremely difficult to fathom any 

rationale for the observation made in paragraph 24 of the 

judgment in Sarla Verma's case that where the deceased 

was self-employed or was on a fixed salary without 

provision for annual increment, etc., the Courts will 

usually take only the actual income at the time of death 

and a departure from this rule should be made only in rare 

and exceptional cases involving special circumstances. In 

our view, it will be naïve to say that the wages or total 

emoluments/income of a person who is self-employed or 

who is employed on a fixed salary without provision for 

annual increment, etc., would remain the same 

throughout his life. The rise in the cost of living affects 

everyone across the board. It does not make any 

distinction between rich and poor. As a matter of fact, the 

effect of rise in prices which directly impacts the cost of 

living is minimal on the rich and maximum on those who 


32 

are self-employed or who get fixed income/emoluments. 

They are the worst affected people. Therefore, they put 

extra efforts to generate additional income necessary for 

sustaining their families. The salaries of those employed 

under the Central and State Governments and their 

agencies/instrumentalities have been revised from time to 

time to provide a cushion against the rising prices and 

provisions have been made for providing security to the 

families of the deceased employees. The salaries of those 

employed in private sectors have also increased manifold. 

Till about two decades ago, nobody could have imagined 

that salary of Class IV employee of the Government would 

be in five figures and total emoluments of those in higher 

echelons of service will cross the figure of rupees one lac. 

Although, the wages/income of those employed in 

unorganized sectors has not registered a corresponding 

increase and has not kept pace with the increase in the 

salaries of the Government employees and those 

employed in private sectors but it cannot be denied that 

there has been incremental enhancement in the income of 

those who are self-employed and even those engaged on 

daily basis, monthly basis or even seasonal basis. We can 

take judicial notice of the fact that with a view to meet 

the challenges posed by high cost of living, the persons 

falling in the latter category periodically increase the cost 

of their labour. In this context, it may be useful to give an 

example of a tailor who earns his livelihood by stitching 


33 

cloths. If the cost of living increases and the prices of 

essentials go up, it is but natural for him to increase the 

cost of his labour. So will be the cases of ordinary skilled 

and unskilled labour, like, barber, blacksmith, cobbler, 

mason etc. Therefore, we do not think that while making 

the observations in the last three lines of paragraph 24 of 

Sarla Verma's judgment, the Court had intended to lay 

down an absolute rule that there will be no addition in the 

income of a person who is self-employed or who is paid 

fixed wages. Rather, it would be reasonable to say that a 

person who is self-employed or is engaged on fixed wages 

will also get 30 per cent increase in his total income over 

a period of time and if he / she becomes victim of accident 

then the same formula deserves to be applied for 

calculating the amount of compensation." 

(vi) In Reshma Kumar v. Madan Mohan reported in 2013 (9) SCC 

65 (Decided on 02.04.2013 by three Judges' Bench), while considering 

the question, as to whether, for determination of the multiplicand, the 

Motor Vehicles Act provides for any criterion, as regards determination of 

income towards future prospects, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, held as 

follows: 

"36. The standardization of addition to income for 

future prospects shall help in achieving certainty in 

arriving at appropriate compensation. We approve the 


34 

method that an addition of 50% of actual salary be made 

to the actual salary income of the deceased towards 

future prospects where the deceased had a permanent job 

and was below 40 years and the addition should be only 

30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and no 

addition should be made where the age of the deceased is 

more than 50 years. Where the annual income is in the 

taxable range, the actual salary shall mean actual salary 

less tax. In the cases where the deceased was self-

employed or was on a fixed salary without provision for 

annual increments, the actual income at the time of death 

without any addition to income for future prospects will 

be appropriate. A departure from the above principle can 

only be justified in extraordinary circumstances and very 

exceptional cases." 

(vii) In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh reported in 2013 (9) SCC 54, 

(Decided on 12.04.2013 by three Judges' Bench) the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court, held that in case of self-employed persons or persons with fixed 

wages, the actual income of the deceased must be enhanced for purpose 

of computation of compensation: (i) by 50% where his age was below 40 

years, (ii) by 30% where he belonged to age group of 40 to 50 years, and 

(iii) by 15% where he was between age group of 50 to 60 years. However, 

it is observed that no such addition/enhancement permissible where 


35 

deceased exceeded the age of 60 years. Relevant paragraph in Rajesh's 

case (cited supra), is extracted hereunder: 

" 11. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi's case (supra) 

actually intended to follow the principle in the case of 

salaried persons as laid in Sarla Verma's case (supra) and 

to make it applicable also to the self-employed and 

persons on fixed wages, it is clarified that the increase in 

the case of those groups is not 30% always; it will also 

have a reference to the age. In other words, in the case of 

self-employed or persons with fixed wages, in case, the 

deceased victim was below 40 years, there must be an 

addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased 

while computing future prospects. Needless to say that 

the actual income should be income after paying the tax, 

if any. Addition should be 30% in case the deceased was in 

the age group of 40 to 50 years." 

(viii) In Syed Sadiq etc. Vs. Division Manager, United India 

Insurance Company Limited reported in 2014(1) TNMAC 459 = 2014 (2) 

SCC 735 (Decided on 16.01.2014 by two Judges Bench), in the case of a 

vegetable vendor, aged 24 years, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, added 50% 

increment, under the head, future prospects. He was stated to have 

suffered 85% disablement, due to amputation. 


36 

(ix) In Sanjay Verma v. Haryana Roadways reported in 2014 (1) 

CTC 745 (Decided on 29.01.2014 by three Judges' Bench) the Supreme 

Court held as follows: 

"Though in Sarla Verma (Smt.) and Others vs. Delhi 

Transport Corporation and Another [(2009) 6 SCC 121], 

this Court had held that in case of a self employed person, 

unless there are special and exceptional circumstances, the 

annual income at the time of death is to be taken into 

account, a Coordinate Bench in Santosh Devi vs. National 

Insurance Company Ltd. and Others [(2012) 6 SCC 421] has 

taken a different view which is to the following effect: 

"14. We find it extremely difficult to fathom any 

rationale for the observation made in para 24 of the 

judgment in Sarla Verma case that where the deceased was 

self-employed or was on a fixed salary without provision for 

annual increment, etc., the courts will usually take only the 

actual income at the time of death and a departure from this 

rule should be made only in rare and exceptional cases 

involving special circumstances. In our view, it will be naive 

to say that the wages or total emoluments/income of a 

person who is self-employed or who is employed on a fixed 

salary without provision for annual increment, etc., would 

remain the same throughout his life." 

12. The view taken in Santosh Devi (supra) has been 

reiterated by a Bench of three Judges in Rajesh and Others 

vs. Rajbir Singh and Others [(2013) 9 SCC 54], by holding 


37 

as follows: 

"8. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi case actually 

intended to follow the principle in the case of salaried 

persons as laid down in Sarla Verma case and to make it 

applicable also to the self-employed and persons on fixed 

wages, it is clarified that the increase in the case of those 

groups is not 30% always; it will also have a reference to the 

age. In other words, in the case of self-employed or persons 

with fixed wages, in case, the deceased victim was below 40 

years, there must be an addition of 50% to the actual income 

of the deceased while computing future prospects. Needless 

to say that the actual income should be income after paying 

the tax, if any. Addition should be 30% in case the deceased 

was in the age group of 40 to 50 years. 

9. In Sarla Verma case, it has been stated that in the 

case of those above 50 years, there shall be no addition. 

Having regard to the fact that in the case of those self-

employed or on fixed wages, where there is normally no age 

of superannuation, we are of the view that it will only be 

just and equitable to provide an addition of 15% in the case 

where the victim is between the age group of 50 to 60 years 

so as to make the compensation just, equitable, fair and 

reasonable. There shall normally be no addition thereafter." 

13. Certain parallel developments will now have to be 

taken note of. In Reshma Kumari and Others vs. Madan 

Mohan and Another [(2009) 13 SCC 422], a two Judge 

Bench of this Court while considering the following questions 


38 

took the view that the issue(s) needed resolution by a larger 

Bench: 

"(1) Whether the multiplier specified in the Second 

Schedule appended to the Act should be scrupulously applied 

in all the cases? 

(2) Whether for determination of the multiplicand, the 

Act provides for any criterion, particularly as regards 

determination of future prospects?" 

14. Answering the above reference a three Judge 

Bench of this Court in Reshma Kumari and Ors. vs. Madan 

Mohan and Anr. [(2013) 9 SCC 65 (para 36)] reiterated the 

view taken in Sarla Verma (supra) to the effect that in 

respect of a person who was on a fixed salary without 

provision for annual increments or who was self-employed 

the actual income at the time of death should be taken into 

account for determining the loss of income unless there are 

extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. Though the 

expression "exceptional and extraordinary circumstances" is 

not capable of any precise definition, in Shakti Devi vs. New 

India Insurance Company Limited and Another [(2010) 14 

SCC 575] there is a practical application of the aforesaid 

principle. The near certainty of the regular employment of 

the deceased in a government department following the 

retirement of his father was held to be a valid ground to 

compute the loss of income by taking into account the 

possible future earnings. The said loss of income, 

accordingly, was quantified at double the amount that the 


39 

deceased was earning at the time of his death. 

15. Undoubtedly, the same principle will apply for 

determination of loss of income on account of an accident 

resulting in the total disability of the victim as in the present 

case. Therefore, taking into account the age of the claimant 

(25 years) and the fact that he had a steady income, as 

evidenced by the income-tax returns, we are of the view 

that an addition of 50% to the income that the claimant was 

earning at the time of the accident would be justified." 

(x) In V.Mekala v. V.Malathi reported in 2014 ACJ 1441 (SC), 

(Decided on 25.04.2014 by two Judges Bench), the injured was a 

student studying in 11th Standard. While determining the monthly income 

of the injured as Rs.10,000/-, the Hon'ble Supreme Court added 50% of 

the income, under the head, future prospects. 

(xi) The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shashikala v. Gangalakshmamma 

reported in 2015 (3) MLJ 373 (SC) [Decided on 13.03.2015], the Hon'ble 

Mrs. Justice R.Banumathi, has considered the decision in In National 

Insurance Co. Ltd., v. Pushpa [SLP(C)No.8058 of 2014, dated 

31.10.2013] and at Paragraphs 7 to 16, held as follows: 

"7. Learned counsel for the respondent-insurance 

company submitted that in Reshma Kumari & Ors., v. Madan 


40 

Mohan & Anr., [2013 (9) SCC 65], this Court has held that 

where the deceased was self-employed, it would be 

appropriate not to make any addition to income for future 

prospects and the High Court rightly declined to make 

addition towards future prospects. It was submitted that the 

deceased was engaged in the business and was not earning 

fixed income and has filed returns for different years 

showing different income viz., gross income of Rs.1,08,713/-

for the assessment year 2005-06 and Rs.2,02,911/-for the 

assessment year 2006-07 which only indicates the disparity in 

income of the deceased. To strike a balance, High Court has 

rightly taken the average and rightly deducted 10% towards 

income tax and other deductions. It was submitted that the 

compensation awarded by the High Court is just and 

reasonable and no grounds have been made out by the 

claimants for enhancement of the compensation whatsoever. 

8. I have carefully considered the rival contentions and 

perused the impugned judgment as also the award and the 

materials on record. 

9. The deceased was doing transport business of 

supplying newspapers from the Head Office to the other 

destinations as per the agreement entered into between the 

group of newspapers and himself. It is also not in dispute 

that the deceased was an income tax assessee and he has 

filed income tax returns for the assessment years 2005-06 

and 2006-07. The claimants had filed income tax returns of 

the deceased for the assessment years 2005-06 and 2006-07 


41 

with gross total income of Rs.1,08,713/-and Rs.2,02,911/-

respectively including the income from the house property. 

Total income of both the years comes to Rs.3,11,624/-and 

the High Court has taken the average of it which comes to 

Rs.1,55,812/-. High Court deducted 10% of the said amount 

towards income-tax and taken the balance amount to 

Rs.1,40,231/-. The High Court had further deducted 

Rs.2,400/-towards professional tax and income from the 

house property shown as Rs.20,000/-and the net income was 

calculated at Rs.1,17,831/-. Since the claimants are six in 

numbers as per the decision in Sarla Verma & Ors., v. Delhi 

Transport Corporation & Anr. [2009 (6) SCC 121], one-

fourth(1/4th ) deduction was made towards personal 

expenses. The loss of dependency was thus calculated at 

Rs.88,373/-. Taking the age of deceased at 45 years, the 

High Court adopted multiplier 14 and calculated the total 

loss of dependency at Rs.12,37,222/-. 

10. The deceased was aged 45 years and was doing 

transport business. Though the claimants have filed income 

tax returns for two assessment years 2005-06 and 2006-07, as 

per the income tax returns for the year 2006-07, the income 

of the assessee was Rs.2,02,911/-. Tribunal did not take the 

income of the deceased for the assessment year 2006-07 on 

the ground that only xerox copy was filed and the claimants 

have failed to examine income-tax authorities to prove the 

same. Instead of taking the income of the deceased as per 

the assessment year 2006-07, the High Court has chosen to 


42 

calculate the average of the income for two assessment 

years 2005-06 and 2006-07. Considering the age of the 

deceased and the nature of business he was doing, in my 

considered view, the High Court was not justified in so taking 

the average of income of the two assessment years. The 

deceased was aged 45 years and doing business. Admittedly, 

he was also owning agricultural lands. Even though 

agricultural income was not shown in the income tax return, 

it emerges from the evidence that the deceased was also 

doing agricultural work. 

11. On behalf of the claimants, reliance was placed 

upon Rajesh's case (supra) to contend that even in the case 

of self-employed persons or persons with fixed wages, there 

must be an addition to the income of the deceased towards 

future prospects. In Sarla Verma's case (supra), this Court 

held that in case of salaried persons additions have to be 

made depending upon the age of the deceased to the actual 

income of the deceased while computing future prospects. In 

Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company Ltd., & Ors., 

[2012 (6) SCC 421]. Sarla Verma was explained and it was 

held that the benefit of making addition to total income of 

persons who are self-employed or getting fixed wages was 

permissible. 

12. The principles laid down in Santosh Devi's case 

(supra) were reiterated in Rajesh and Ors., v. Rajbit Singh 

& Ors., [2012 (6) SCC 421], wherein this Court held that the 

case of self-employed persons or persons with fixed wages, 


43 

the actual income of the deceased must be enhanced for 

purpose of computation viz.(i) by 50% where his age was 

below 40 years; (ii) by 30% where he belonged to age group 

of 40 to 50 years, and (iii) by 15% where he was between age 

group of 50 to 60 years. However, it was observed that no 

such addition/enhancement was permissible where deceased 

exceeded the age of 60 years. Further, in Rajesh (supra), this 

Court while reiterating the meaning of "just compensation" 

with reference to settled principles observed that, at the 

time of fixing such compensation, the court should not 

succumb to the niceties or technicalities to grant just 

compensation in favour of the claimant. It is the duty of the 

court to equate, as far as possible, the misery on account of 

the accident with the compensation so that the injured or 

the dependants should not face the vagaries of life on 

account of discontinuance of the income earned by the 

victim, and the court's duty is to award just, equitable, fair 

and reasonable compensation, irrespective of claim made. 

13. Considering the question of making addition to the 

income of the deceased towards the future prospects in 

cases of salaried persons vis--vis in cases where the deceased 

was self-employed or on a fixed wage/salary in Reshma 

Kumari & Ors., v. Madan Mohan & Anr., [2013 (9) SCC 65], 

this Court held as under :-

"39. The standardization of addition to income for 

future prospects shall help in achieving certainty in arriving 

at appropriate compensation. We approve the method that 


44 

an addition of 50% of actual salary be made to the actual 

salary income of the deceased towards future prospects 

where the deceased had a permanent job and was below 40 

years and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the 

deceased was 40 to 50 years and no addition should be made 

where the age of the deceased is more than 50 years. Where 

the annual income is in the taxable range, the actual salary 

shall mean actual salary less tax. In the cases where the 

deceased was self-employed or was on a fixed salary without 

provision for annual increments, the actual income at the 

time of death without any addition to income for future 

prospects will be appropriate. A departure from the above 

principle can only be justified in extraordinary circumstances 

and very exceptional cases." 

14. The decision in Reshma Kumari's case was 

rendered at earlier point of time (2.04.2013) and Rajesh's 

case was pronounced subsequently (12.04.2013). Pointing out 

the divergent opinion expressed in the above cases and 

expressing the view that regarding the manner of addition of 

income for future prospects in case of self-employed or on 

fixed 
wages 
there 
should 
be 
an 
authoritative 

pronouncement, in National Insurance Co. Ltd., v. Pushpa 

[SLP(C)No.16735 of 2014],, the matter has been referred to 

a larger Bench by the order dated 2.07.2014, in which one of 

us (Hon'ble Mr. Justice V. Gopala Gowda) was a member, 

which is pending consideration. 

15. Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act enjoins the 


45 

courts/tribunals to make award determining the amount of 

compensation which appears to be just and reasonable. The 

wide amplitude of such power does not empower the tribunal 

to determine the compensation arbitrarily, although the Act 

is a beneficial legislation, it can neither be allowed as a 

source of profit nor as a windfall to the persons affected. 

Determination of compensation has to be fair and reasonable 

and acceptable by the legal standards. In Nagappa v. 

Gurudayal Singh & Ors., [2003 (6) SCC 274], this Court held 

as under:-

"10. Thereafter, Section 168 empowers the Claims 

Tribunal to "make an award determining the amount of 

compensation which appears to it to be just". Therefore, the 

only requirement for determining the compensation is that it 

must be "just". There is no other limitation or restriction on 

its power for awarding just compensation". 

The same principle was reiterated in the decisions of 

Oriental Insurance Company Ltd., v. Mohd. Nasir [2009 (6) 

SCC 280] and Ningamma and Anr., v. United India 

Insurance Company Ltd., [2009 (13) SCC 710]. 

16. Without adverting to the issue whether additions 

are to be made towards future prospects or not, as it is 

obligatory on the part of the Court to award just 

compensation, considering the age of the deceased and the 

nature of business he was doing, in my view, the income of 

the deceased as stated in the income tax return for the year 

2006-07 i.e. Rs. 2,02,911/-may be taken as the income of 


46 

the deceased. Ten per cent of the said amount i.e. 

Rs.20,290/-is to be deducted towards income tax and the 

remaining comes to Rs.1,82,620/-. The amount to be 

deducted for professional tax is Rs.2,400/-and after 

deducting the same, the balance comes out to Rs.1,80,220/-. 

The income from the house property for the year 2006-07 is 

shown to be Rs.20,000/-and after deducting the same, the 

net amount comes to Rs.1,60,220/-. Deducting 1/4th 

(one/fourth) towards personal expenses which comes out to 

Rs.40,055/-, the loss of dependency/loss of contribution is 

arrived at Rs.1,20,165/-per annum. 

(xii) In the above reported decision, one of the Hon'ble Judges of 

the Apex Court, by following the decision in Reshma Kumari's case, has 

disallowed the claim of addition of a percentage of income, under the 

head, "future prospect". The other Hon'ble Judge (Hon'ble Mr. Justice 

Gopala Gowda) in the said decision, has ordered as follows: 

"I have perused the judgment written by my learned 

Sister Mrs.Justice R. Banumathi in the above-mentioned 

matter. I am in respectful agreement with all the points 

which are answered in favour of the appellants-claimants, 

except for the non-consideration on the question of 

making addition to the income of the deceased towards 

the future prospects in the case of salaried persons vis-à-

vis where the deceased was self employed or on fixed 

wages after adverting to the judgments of this Court in 


47 

Reshma Kumari & Ors. v. Madan Mohan & Anr. (2013) 9 SCC 

65), Rajesh & Ors. v. Rajbir Singh & Ors. ((2013) 9 SCC 54), 

the relevant paragraphs of which are extracted hereinafter. 

2. After considering the legal principles laid down by 

this Court in the case of (1) General Manager, Kerala State 

Road Transport Corporation, Trivandrum & Ors. v. 

Susamma Thomas & Ors. ((1994) 2 SCC 176); (2) Sarla Dixit 

& Anr. v. Balwant Yadav & Ors. ((1996) 3 SCC 179)and (3) 

Abati Bezbaruah v. Dy. Director General, Geological 

Survey of India & Anr. (2003) 3SCC 148), this Court, on the 

question of future prospects in the case of Sarla Verma & 

Ors. v. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr. ((2009) 6 SCC 

121)has held as follows:-

"24. In Susamma Thomas, this Court increased the 

income by nearly 100%, in Sarla Dixit the income was 

increased only by 50% and in Abati Bezbaruah the income 

was increased by a mere 7%. In view of the imponderables 

and uncertainties, we are in favour of adopting as a rule of 

thumb, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual 

salary income of the deceased towards future prospects, 

where the deceased had a permanent job and was below 40 

years. (Where the annual income is in the taxable range, the 

words "actual salary" should be read as "actual salary less 

tax"). The addition should be only 30% if the age of the 

deceased was 40 to 50 years. There should be no addition, 

where the age of the deceased is more than 50 years. 

Though the evidence may indicate a different percentage of 


48 

increase, it is necessary to standardise the addition to avoid 

different yardsticks being applied or different methods of 

calculation being adopted. Where the deceased was self-

employed or was on a fixed salary (without provision for 

annual increments, etc.), the courts will usually take only 

the actual income at the time of death. A departure 

therefrom should be made only in rare and exceptional cases 

involving special circumstances." 

3. Interestingly, in Reshma Kumari & Ors. (supra), 

which was ultimately decided in 2.4.2013 by a three judge 

Bench, which arose out of the matter referred by the order 

of two judge Bench dated 23.7.2009. That order had 

referred two questions:-

"(1) Whether multiplier specified in the Second 

Schedule appended to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for 

short "the 1988 Act") should be scrupulously applied in all 

cases? And 

(2) Whether for determination of the multiplicand, the 

1988 Act provides for any criterion, particularly as regards 

determination of future prospect." 

4. The referring Bench (in Reshma Kumari & Ors.-

supra) had in fact, envisioned a situation where future 

prospects in private employment too, were to be taken into 

consideration (although in a slightly different context). 

The relevant paragraph of the referring Bench of this 

Court in the case of Reshma Kumari & Ors. is extracted 

hereunder:-

"46. In the Indian context several other factors should 


49 

be taken into consideration including education of the 

dependants and the nature of job. In the wake of changed 

societal conditions and global scenario, future prospects may 

have to be taken into consideration not only having regard to 

the status of the employee, his educational qualification; his 

past performance but also other relevant factors, namely, 

the higher salaries and perks which are being offered by the 

private companies these days…" 

Ultimately, the question of future prospects was decided in 

the Larger Bench judgment of this Court in Reshma Kumari's 

case. The relevant paragraph is extracted hereunder: 

"39. The standardisation of addition to income for 

future prospects shall help in achieving certainty in arriving 

at appropriate compensation. We approve the method that 

an addition of 50% of actual salary be made to the actual 

salary income of the deceased towards future prospects 

where the deceased had a permanent job and was below 40 

years and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the 

deceased was 40 to 50 years and no addition should be made 

where the age of the deceased is more than 50 years. Where 

the annual income is in the taxable range, the actual salary 

shall mean actual salary less tax. In the cases where the 

deceased was self-employed or was on a fixed salary without 

provision for annual increments, the actual income at the 

time of death without any addition to income for future 

prospects will be appropriate. A departure from the above 

principle can only be justified in extraordinary circumstances 


50 

and very exceptional cases." 

5. In Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. & 

Ors. ((2012) 6 SCC 421), a two judge Bench of this Court had 

earlier doubted the decision with respect to future prospects 

in Sarla Verma (supra) and interpreted the limiting of grant 

of compensation amount to a person who is self-employed, 

privately employed or is engaged on fixed wages if he /she 

becomes victim of an accident. The relevant paragraphs as 

discussed by this Court in Santosh Devi's case is extracted 

hereunder:-

"14. We find it extremely difficult to fathom any 

rationale for the observation made in para 24 of the 

judgment in Sarla Verma case that where the deceased was 

self-employed or was on a fixed salary without provision for 

annual increment, etc., the courts will usually take only the 

actual income at the time of death and a departure from this 

rule should be made only in rare and exceptional cases 

involving special circumstances. In our view, it will be naïve 

to say that the wages or total emoluments/income of a 

person who is self-employed or who is employed on a 

fixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc., 

would remain the same throughout his life. 

15. The rise in the cost of living affects everyone 

across the board. It does not make any distinction 

between rich and poor. As a matter of fact, the effect of 

rise in prices which directly impacts the cost of living is 

minimal on the rich and maximum on those who are self-


51 

employed or who get fixed income/emoluments. They are 

the worst affected people. Therefore, they put in extra 

efforts to generate additional income necessary for 

sustaining their families. 

16. The salaries of those employed under the Central 

and State Governments and their agencies/instrumentalities 

have been revised from time to time to provide a cushion 

against the rising prices and provisions have been made for 

providing security to the families of the deceased 

employees. The salaries of those employed in private sectors 

have also increased manifold. Till about two decades ago, 

nobody could have imagined that salary of Class IV employee 

of the Government would be in five figures and total 

emoluments of those in higher echelons of service will cross 

the figure of rupees one lakh. 

17. Although the wages/income of those employed 

in unorganised sectors has not registered a corresponding 

increase and has not kept pace with the increase in the 

salaries of the government employees and those employed 

in private sectors, but it cannot be denied that there has 

been incremental enhancement in the income of those 

who are self-employed and even those engaged on daily 

basis, monthly basis or even seasonal basis. We can take 

judicial notice of the fact that with a view to meet the 

challenges posed by high cost of living, the persons falling 

in the latter category periodically increase the cost of 

their labour. In this context, it may be useful to give an 


52 

example of a tailor who earns his livelihood by stitching 

clothes. If the cost of living increases and the prices of 

essentials go up, it is but natural for him to increase the 

cost of his labour. So will be the cases of ordinary skilled 

and unskilled labour, like, barber, blacksmith, cobbler, 

mason, etc. 

18. Therefore, we do not think that while making the 

observations in the last three lines of para 24 of Sarla Verma 

judgment, the Court had intended to lay down an absolute 

rule that there will be no addition in the income of a person 

who is self-employed or who is paid fixed wages. Rather, it 

would be reasonable to say that a person who is self-

employed or is engaged on fixed wages will also get 30% 

increase in his total income over a period of time and if 

he/she becomes the victim of an accident then the same 

formula deserves to be applied for calculating the amount of 

compensation." 

6. In Rajesh & Ors. (supra), a three judge Bench 

decision of this Court, which took into consideration the 

decisions of this Court in the case of Sarla Verma & Ors. and 

Santosh Devi (supra) held thus: 

"8. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi case actually 

intended to follow the principle in the case of salaried 

persons as laid down in Sarla Verma case and to make it 

applicable also to the self-employed and persons on fixed 

wages, it is clarified that the increase in the case of those 

groups is not 30% always; it will also have a reference to the 


53 

age. In other words, in the case of self-employed or persons 

with fixed wages, in case, the deceased victim was below 40 

years, there must be an addition of 50% to the actual income 

of the deceased while computing future prospects. Needless 

to say that the actual income should be income after paying 

the tax, if any. Addition should be 30% in case the deceased 

was in the age group of 40 to 50 years." 

7. Further, in National Insurance Company Ltd. v. 

Pushpa, this Court in SLP No. 16735 of 2014 (arising out of 

CC No. 8058 of 2014) vide order dated 2.7.2014 made a 

reference to a larger Bench in view of the seeming conflict 

between the legal principles with respect to future prospects 

laid down by this Court in the cases of Reshma Kumari & 

Ors. and Rajesh & Ors. (supra). The relevant para from the 

National Insurance Company case (supra) is extracted 

hereunder:-

"Be it noted, though the decision in Reshma (supra) 

was rendered at earlier of time, as is clear, the same has not 

been noticed in Rajesh (supra) and that is why divergent 

opinions have been expressed. We are of the considered 

opinion that as regards the manner of addition of income of 

future prospects there should be an authoritative 

pronouncement. Therefore, we think it appropriate to refer 

the matter to a larger Bench." 

Though, I am a party to the above reference, at the 

same time, it is worth mentioning that the reference even in 

the case of a perceived conflict or disagreement with the 


54 

views of a two judge (or even a three judge) Bench does not 

permit a lower Bench formation to refer the matter 

straightway to a five Judge Bench. This principle was stated 

in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. Mumbai Shramik 

Sangha & Ors. ((2001) 4 SCC 448). In that judgment, the 

Constitution Bench held that a decision of a Constitution 

Bench binds Benches of two and three learned Judges of this 

Court and that judicial discipline obliges them to follow it, 

regardless of their doubts about its correctness. At the most, 

they can direct that the matter to be heard by a Bench of 

three learned Judges. In Pradip Chandra Parija & Ors. v. 

Pramod Chandra Patnaik & Ors. ((2002) 1 SCC 1), a Bench 

of two learned judges expressed reservations with the 

judgment of a three judge Bench and directed the matter to 

be placed before a larger Bench of five judges. The 

Constitution Bench held that the rule of 'judicial discipline 

and propriety' as well as the theory of precedents permitted 

only a Bench of the same quorum to question the correctness 

of the decision by another Bench of co-ordinate strength 

upon which the matter can be placed for consideration by a 

Bench of larger quorum. A Bench of lesser quorum cannot 

thus, express disagreement with, or question the correctness 

of, the view of a Bench of a larger quorum. Central Board of 

Dawoodi Bohra Community & Anr. v. State of Maharashtra 

& Anr. ((2005) 2 SCC 673)summarized, for future guidance, 

the correct approach in such matters. The relevant para of 

the said case is extracted hereunder:-


55 

"12. Having carefully considered the submissions made 

by the learned Senior Counsel for the parties and having 

examined the law laid down by the Constitution Benches in 

the abovesaid decisions, we would like to sum up the legal 

position in the following terms: 

(1) The law laid down by this Court in a decision 

delivered by a Bench of larger strength is binding on any 

subsequent Bench of lesser or coequal strength. 

(2) A Bench of lesser quorum cannot disagree or 

dissent from the view of the law taken by a Bench of larger 

quorum. 

In case of doubt all that the Bench of lesser quorum 

can do is to invite the attention of the Chief Justice and 

request for the matter being placed for hearing before a 

Bench of larger quorum than the Bench whose decision has 

come up for consideration. It will be open only for a Bench 

of coequal strength to express an opinion doubting the 

correctness of the view taken by the earlier Bench of 

coequal strength, whereupon the matter may be placed for 

hearing before a Bench consisting of a quorum larger than 

the one which pronounced the decision laying down the law 

the correctness of which is doubted. 

(3) The above rules are subject to two exceptions: 

(i) the abovesaid rules do not bind the discretion of 

the Chief Justice in whom vests the power of framing the 

roster and who can direct any particular matter to be placed 

for hearing before any particular Bench of any strength; and 


56 

(ii) in spite of the rules laid down hereinabove, if the 

matter has already come up for hearing before a Bench of 

larger quorum and that Bench itself feels that the view of 

the law taken by a Bench of lesser quorum, which view is in 

doubt, needs correction or reconsideration then by way of 

exception (and not as a rule) and for reasons given by it, it 

may proceed to hear the case and examine the correctness 

of the previous decision in question dispensing with the need 

of a specific reference or the order of the Chief Justice 

constituting the Bench and such listing. Such was the 

situation in Raghubir Singh and Hansoli Devi." 

8. Hence, I am of the opinion that the Rajesh & Ors. 

(supra) itself applied the Santosh Devi (supra) case, even 

while clarifying that for self employed individuals, age is 

also a determining factor, as is seen in the observation in 

the case of Rajesh & Ors. (supra) that in the case of self-

employed or persons with fixed wages, in case, the 

deceased victim was below 40 years, there must be an 

addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased 

while computing future prospects. In fact, this gives shape 

to the view that future prospects are to be taken into 

account even in case of self employment and also that 

there cannot be a set formula for determining such 

compensation. The best application of this view may be 

seen in Sanjay Verma v. Haryana Roadways ( ((2014) 3 SCC 

210)where the facts were noticed as follows : 

"12. The appellant was a self-employed person. 


57 

Though he had claimed a monthly income of Rs.5000/-, 

the income tax returns filed by him demonstrate that he 

had paid income tax on an annual income of Rs.41,300/-. 

No fault, therefore, can be found in the order of the High 

Court which proceeds on the basis that the annual income 

of the claimant at the time of the accident was 

Rs.41,300/-..." 

Then, this Court after noticing the decisions of this Court in 

the cases of Sarla Verma & Ors., Santosh Devi, and the 

three Judge Bench of this Court in Reshma Kumari & Ors. 

And Rajesh & Ors. (supra) applied the law in the following 

manner in Sanjay Verma's case (supra):-

"16. Undoubtedly, the same principle will apply for 

determination of loss of income on account of an accident 

resulting in the total disability of the victim as in the present 

case. Therefore, taking into account the age of the claimant 

(25 years) and the fact that he had a steady income, as 

evidenced by the income tax returns, we are of the view 

that an addition of 50% to the income that the claimant was 

earning at the time of the accident would be justified. 

17. Insofar as the multiplier is concerned, as held in 

Sarla Verma or as prescribed under the Second Schedule to 

the Act, the correct multiplier in the present case cannot be 

15 as held by the High Court. We are of the view that the 

adoption of the multiplier of 17 would be appropriate. 

Accordingly, taking into account the addition to the income 

and the higher multiplier the total amount of compensation 


58 

payable to the claimant under the head "loss of income" is 

Rs.10,53,150/-(Rs.41,300/-+ Rs.20,650/-= Rs.61,950/-× 

17)." 

The clarification of the position, by a three judge 

Bench, in Rajesh & Ors., ipso facto could not have led to the 

conclusion that there was a conflict between the views of 

various Benches, since Santosh Devi itself had noticed Sarla 

Verma, the logic of which in respect of limiting 

compensation for non-permanent employment was clarified. 

9. The above facts recount the position as emerging 

from a combined reading of various orders and judgments. 

What is clear is that a two judge Bench as was the formation 

in the case of National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Pushpa 

(supra) could not, having regard to the settled legal principle 

outlined in the decision of this Court in Central Board of 

Dawoodi Bohar Community (supra) have referred the matter 

to a larger Bench. The correct view would have been to 

place the matter before a Bench of co-ordinate strength 

which decided Reshma Kumari & Ors. and Rajesh & Ors. 

(supra), i.e. three judges. 

10. However, I agree that the matter in relation to 

future prospects to be added to the annual income to 

determine the compensation towards loss of dependency 

cannot be finally decided by us and has to be ultimately 

referred to a larger Bench -because I was a party to the 

reference in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pushpa (supra) 

and more importantly, cannot in propriety recall that 


59 

reference while I am part of another Bench presently. In 

view of the observations, the matter has to be placed before 

the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders 

towards the constitution of a suitable larger Bench in 

accordance with law. 

ORDER: 

Since we have disagreed only insofar as the addition 

towards the future prospects in case of self-employed or 

fixed wages to be added to the compensation towards the 

dependency, the matter may be placed before the Hon'ble 

the Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders towards the 

constitution of a suitable larger Bench to decide the said 

issue." 

(xiii) In Munna Lal Jain v. Vipin Kumar Sharma reported in 2015 

(6) SCC 347 (Decided on 15.05.2015 by three Judges Bench), the 

deceased was a pandit and bachelor. He was aged 30 years. The accident 

occurred on 12.07.2008. Income at Rs.12,000/-per month, was 

determined by the High Court. Addition of 50% was made and thereafter, 

compensation was quantified. Thus, in the recent judgment, a three 

Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, has allowed addition of 50% 

under the head future prospects. 

(xiv) Shashikala's case has been decided on 13.03.2015 by two 


60 

Judges' Bench of the Apex Court, out of which, one of the learned Judges 

has expressed divergent views. In National Insurance Co. Ltd., v. Pushpa 

[SLP(C)No.8058 of 2014, dated 31.10.2013] [Decided by two Judges' 

Bench], there is a reference to a larger Bench. Thus, the last of the 

judgments decided by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Munna Lal Jain's case 

(cited supra), dated 15.05.2015, 50% of the income has been taken into 

consideration under the head, future prospects. 

(xv) In Sarla Verma's case (cited supra) (Decided by two Judges 

Bench) and Reshma Kumari's case (cited supra) (Decided by three Judges 

Bench), the Hon'ble Apex Court held that in respect of salaried persons in 

unorganised sector or self-employed, there should not be any addition 

towards future prospects, whereas, in Santhosh Devi's case (cited supra) 

(Decided by two Judges Bench) and Rajesh's case (cited supra) (Decided 

by three Judges Bench), the Hon'ble Apx Court held addition can be made 

towards future prospects, in respect of the above class also. We are the 

conscious of the fact that a reference has been made on the above 

subject. At the same time, we deem it fit to consider the decision of the 

Hon'ble Apex Court, as to how, the Courts should proceed till a reference 

is answered. 

(a) In State of Orissa v. Dandasi Sahu reported in 1988 (4) SCC 12, 


61 

the Supreme Court held as follows: 

"Arbitration is resorted to as a speedy method of 

adjudication of disputes. Stale and old adjudication should 

not be set at naught or examination of that question kept 

at bay on the plea that the point is pending determination 

by a larger Bench of this Court. Even if it is held ultimately 

that the unreasoned award per se is bad, it is not sure 

whether such a decision would upset all the awards in this 

country which have not been challenged so far." 

(b) In Uma Shankar Singh v. State of Bihar reported in 2010 (9) 

SCC 479, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as follows: 

".......for a decision in the facts of the case, it is not 

necessary to wait for the outcome of the result of the 

reference made to a larger Bench in Dharam Pal case." 

(c) In Ashok Sadarangani v. Union of India reported in (2012) 11 

SCC 321, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows: 

"29. As was indicated in Harbhajan Singh case, the 

pendency of a reference to a larger Bench, does not mean 

that all other proceedings involving the same issue would 

remain stayed till a decision was rendered in the 

reference. The reference made in Gian Singh case need 

not, therefore, detain us. Till such time as the decisions 

cited at the Bar are not modified or altered in any way, 


62 

they continue to hold the field." 

(d) In National Insurance Co. Ltd., v. Saju P.Paul reported in 2013 

(2) SCC 41, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, held as follows: 

"The pendency of consideration of the above 

questions by a larger Bench does not mean that the 

course that was followed in Baljit Kaur's case and Challa 

Bharathamma's case should not be followed, more so in a 

peculiar fact situation of this case." 

(e) In State of Maharashtra v. Sarva Shramik Sangh reported in 

(2013) 16 SCC 16, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows: 

"27. It is, however, contended on behalf of the 

appellant that the said undertaking was being run by the 

Irrigation Department of the first appellant, and the 

activities of the Irrigation Department could not be 

considered to be an "industry" within the definition of the 

concept under Section 2(j) of the ID Act. As noted earlier, 

the reconsideration of the wide interpretation of the 

concept of "industry" in Bangalore Water Supply and 

Sewerage Board is pending before a larger Bench of this 

Court. However, as of now we will have to follow the 

interpretation of law presently holding the field as per the 

approach taken by this Court in State of Orissa v. Dandasi 

Sahu, referred to above. The determination of the present 


63 

pending industrial dispute cannot be kept undecided until 

the judgment of the larger Bench is received." 

34. In the light of the above decisions, we deem it fit to 

consider, as to how, the monthly income of a victim has to be 

determined, while computing the loss of contribution to the family of the 

deceased or in the case of an injured, if there is a loss of earning capacity 

on account of disability suffered. 

35. Future prospects, depends upon education, skill and 

experience gained in the skilled jobs, managerial, supervisory or 

administrative positions in organised or unorganised sectors, or self-

employed. Prospects can be, with reference to employment, co-relating 

to income. The word, "future" needs, no explanation. 

36. As per R.Ramanatha Iyer's Concise Law Dictionary, prospects, 

means "expectation for something to come". 

37. As per Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, 

"prospect" means, "possibility that something will happen; a particular 

event, which will probably or definitely happen in the future. 


64 

"Prospects" means, "chances of future success". 

38. "Prospect", as per Chambers Dictionary, inter alia, means, 

"an outlook on the probable future; an expectation; a chance of success 

or advancement." 

39. "Prospect" as per Encarta World English Dictionary, means 

"possibility of happening soon; a chance or likelihood that will happen in 

future, (esp.) desirable; vision of future that is expected or certain to 

happen in future. "Prospects" means, "expectation of success; likelihood 

of successful or prosperous in future, especially in job or career. 

40. As per Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus, "Prospect" (noun), 

means, "(1) There is a little prospect of success, likelihood, hope, 

expectation, anticipation (good/poor), chance, odds, probability, 

possibility, promise, lookout, fear and danger." (2) "Potential, 

expectations, outlook". "Prospect"(Noun), means, possibility or likelihood 

of some future event occurring. "Prospects" means, "Chances or promise 

or opportunity for success." 

41. In American Heritage Dictionary, "Prospect", means, 


65 

"something expected, possibility". 

42. As per Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the 

English Language (Deluxe Edition), "Prospect" means, (1) Usually, 

"prospects". (a) an apparent probability of advancement, success, profit, 

etc., (b) good business prospects. (2) anticipation; expectation; a looking 

forward. 

43. Extract of the dictionary meaning of the words "Prospect" or 

"Prospects", would indicate that it is closely related to the probability or 

possibility of an event, expected in future. Thus, in the matter of 

awarding compensation to the accident victims, the expression, "future 

prospects" is more or less used and meant, with reference to the plurality 

of the word "prospect", in relation to employment or career prospects 

and consequently, the expected increase in income, after a passage of 

time. At this juncture, it should be noticed that the Hon'ble Apex Court in 

Sarla Verma's case (cited supra), has used the expression, advancement 

in life and career, but with reference to a stable job. In the said case, the 

Apex Court held that no amount need be added under the head, future 

prospects to others. 

44. In Sarla Verma's case (cited supra), the case of persons, 


66 

employed in a permanent job, in salaried structure and while considering 

the prospects of earning more income, consequent to periodical revision 

of salary of those employed in organised sectors. Subsequently in 

Santhosh Devi's case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, has extended addition 

of certain percentage to the income drawn by the victim, at the time of 

accident, towards future prospects and in Rajesh's case (cited supra), it 

has been clarified. But in Reshma Kumari's case (cited supra), it is held 

otherwise. 

45. At this juncture, we wish to consider the difference between 

organised and unorganised sector. What is meant by "organised sector"? 

In common parlance, it would be service in Government, Government 

Undertaking, Companies owned and controlled by the Government, 

Corporation or Boards. The unorganized sector consists of all individuals 

or households engaged in production or sale of goods and services, 

operated as a proprietor or on partnership or self employed. They can be 

said to be unorganised sectors. 

46. Who is there in the unorganised sector? Right from a roadside 

tea shop owner or tiffin vendor or a pushcart vendor, a vegetable vendor 

on road or in a market and many more home based self employment. 


67 

Wages or earning of self-employed correlates the subsistence level to 

meet out the basic needs of living standards. At home or outside, there 

are thousands and thousands of self-employed persons, who do not have 

adequate employment opportunities in the organised sector. 

47. Those engaged in unorganised sectors are self-employed or 

unregistered, carry on their avocations or activities, say for instance, a 

roadside tea stall vendor, a vegetable vendor or engaged in skilled, like a 

fitter, carpenter, plumber, etc., or unskilled work, either employed or on 

his own. This type of classification as unorganised sector, may be broadly 

classified on occupations, including skilled or semi-skilled, landless 

labourers, either in the field of agriculture or industry or small traders or 

self-employed, construction workers, weavers, artisans, those engaged in 

stone quarries, migrant workers, labourers engaged by private 

contractors, drivers, domestic workers and many more. They are in rural, 

urban and metropolitan cities. They are engaged in unorganised sectors, 

in manufacturing, trading and services oriented. 

48. Before adverting to the issue, taken up for consideration, let 

us have a cursory look at some of the factors, which decide the economy 

of any Country. General meaning of the words, "Gross Domestic Product", 


68 

"Per Capita Income" and "Consumer Price Index" are as follows: 

"Gross domestic product (GDP) is the monetary 

value of all the finished goods and services produced 

within a country's borders in a specific time period. 

Though GDP is usually calculated on an annual basis, it 

can be calculated on a quarterly basis as well. GDP 

includes all private and public consumption, 

government outlays, investments and exports minus 

imports that occur within a defined territory. Put 

simply, GDP is a broad measurement of a nation's 

overall economic activity. Gross domestic product can 

be calculated using the following formula: 

GDP = C + G + I + NX (where 'C' is equal to all 

private consumption, or consumer spending, in a 

nation's economy, G is the sum of government 

spending, 'I' is the sum of all the country's investment, 

including businesses capital expenditures and NX is the 

nation's total net exports, calculated as total exports 

minus total imports (NX = Exports -Imports)). 

Per Capita Income (PCI) is a measure of the 

amount of money that is being earned per person in a 

certain area. Income per capita can apply to the 

average per-person income for a city, region or country 

and is used as a means of evaluating the living 

conditions and quality of life in different areas. It can 

be calculated for a country by dividing the country's 

national income by its population. 


69 

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that 

examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of 

consumer goods and services, such as transportation, 

food and medical care. The CPI is calculated by taking 

price changes for each item in the predetermined 

basket of goods and averaging them; the goods are 

weighted according to their importance. Changes in CPI 

are used to assess price changes associated with the 

cost of living. 

49. Consumer Price Index is a measure of changes in the 

purchasing-power of currency and the rate of inflation. The consumer 

price index expresses the current prices of a basket of goods and services 

in terms of the prices during the same period in a previous year and 

indicate the effect of inflation on the purchasing power. It is determined 

on the expenditures of all the residents in urban or metropolitan areas, 

including the professionals, self-employed, poor, unemployed and retired 

persons, as well as urban wage earners and clerical workers. Consumer 

Price Index in common parlance is also called as cost-of-living index. A 

cost-of-living index would measure changes over a time, in the amount 

that consumers need to spend to reach a certain utility level or standard 

of living. 

50. Consumer Price Index represents all the goods and services, 


70 

purchased and consumed by the reference population in relation to food 

and beverages (milk, coffee and all the essential food items), housing 

(rent, furniture, etc.,), clothing, transportation (vehicles, bus, train and 

other modes of transport fares), medical care (drugs and medicines, 

doctor services and hospital services), recreation, education and 

communication (school or college fee, telephone services, computer 

software) etc., beside there are other goods and services (personal 

services). Consumer Price Index also includes government-charged fees, 

such as, electricity, water and sewerage charges, etc. In addition, 

Consumer Price Index also includes taxes (such as sales tax and excise 

duty) that are directly associated with the prices of specific goods and 

services. 

51. Inflation has been defined as a process of continuously rising 

prices or equivalently, of a continuously falling value of money. Various 

indexes have been devised to measure the different aspects of inflation. 

The Consumer Price Index measures the inflation as experienced by the 

consumers in their day-to-day living expenses; the Producer Price Index 

(PPI) measures inflation in the stages of production process; the 

Employment Cost Index (ECI) measures the labor market; and the Gross 

Domestic Product measures the inflation experienced by both consumers 


71 

themselves as well as the governments and other institutions providing 

goods and services to the consumers. It is well known that Consumer Price 

Index is the best factor, to understand and estimate, as to how much, one 

could purchase, with a fixed sum. Inflation is the rate at which the 

general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, 

the purchasing power of the consumers would be diminishing. Can 

anybody in this Country, claim that the cost of fuel, electricity, essential 

commodities, tax or fee, collected by Government or local bodies, as the 

case may, remain the same? The effects of inflation are the same for 

everyone, rich or raff, but the changes in the cost of living may vary from 

place to place and from person to person, depending upon the 

Consumption pattern of the goods or services, as the case may be. 

Needless to state that Consumer Price Index is primarily a measure of the 

cost of living. From the Government of India's Economic Survey 2014-15, 

this Court is inclined to extract the Gross National Income (Gross 

Domestic Product), Net National Income (Per Capita Income), Consumer 

Price Index and Inflation, for the period 2011-12 to 2014-15, as under:

Inflation is calculated as {( index of current year minus index of the 

previous year) / current year index} X 100. For 2014 and 2015, we have 

chosen the base year as 2012. So the index for 2013, April with base year 

2012 was 107.7. Consequently the inflation for 2014, April was {9.9 

/107.7} x 100 = 9.2. Similarly for 2015 April. We have taken the beginning 

of financial year for this calculation. 

52. Let us now consider, as to how, the wages are revised 


73 

periodically by the Central Government and State Government, in respect 

of certain employees. For every half-yearly, on the basis of average 

Consumer Price Index, the Chief Labour Commissioner, Ministry of Labour 

and Employment, Government of India, would revises the rates of 

Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA), for Agricultural Labourers, Industrial 

Workers, Workers engaged in Stone Mines for stone breaking & store 

crushing and employees engaged in "Employment of Sweeping and 

Cleaning" and "Employment of Watch and Ward". To compare the Cost 

Price Index, this Court deems it fit to consider the proceedings of the 

Chief Labour Commissioner, Ministry of Labour and Employment, 

Government of India, issued periodically, as follows: 

AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS:

Government vide Notification No.1520(E) dated 20 th October,

periodically, though not, in strict sense, be applied with the same 

percentage to those, engaged in unorganised sectors, but it cannot be 

contended that there will not be any change in the earning or income. 

55. The government servants have an expectation of periodical 

revision. So also, the employees working in Public Sector, Boards, 

Corporation, Companies owned and controlled by the Government. In 

respect of Private Limited Companies, it is more on the basis of terms and 

conditions of the contract, in which, they are governed. But in the case of 

self-employed or those, engaged in unorganised sectors, revision of wages 

or salary or in the case of self-employed, though may not be on par with 

the salaried structure in organised sectors or on the terms and conditions 

of the contracts in limited companies, still the important factor, 

Consumer Price Index, the deciding factor, would be the same, for a 

change in the earning of the self-employed or revision of salary or wage, 

even in unorganized sectors and that the expectation of a future event, 

ie., possibility of a change in wage or financial expectation, cannot be 

ruled out, for the simple reason that nothing has remained static, in this 

country. 

56. As tabulated in the foregoing paragraphs, it should be noted 


120 

that Consumer Price Index, Gross Domestic Product and Per Capita 

Income, have increased. One cannot disown the fact that the percentage 

of those in unorganized sectors is more than the organised sectors. While 

that be so, would it be appropriate for the Insurance Companies and 

Transport Corporations, to contend that there is absolutely no chance of 

any upward revision in wages or salary of those, employed in unorganised 

sectors or for that matter in the earnings of self-employed. If the 

contentions of the Insurance Companies and Transport Corporations have 

to be accepted, whether the self-employed or those engaged in 

unorganised sectors, can never have any expectation of an event in 

future, ie., increase in earnings or wages? With the basic study of the 

statistics, we are of the considered view that the answer should be a 

clear 'No'. When the Consumer Price Index is applicable uniformally to 

rich or raff, it cannot be contended that those who are engaged in 

unorganized sectors or self-employed, would continue to earn the same 

income, for years together. 

57. For the abovesaid reasons, we are of the considered view 

that the word, "prospects" should not be read and understood, only in 

plural sense, meaning thereby, its prospects or an apparent probability of 

advancement in employment, in organised sectors alone. Narrowing down 

the meaning of the words, "future prospects" only to the employment 


121 

prospects and consequently, more possibility of earning income, only in 

the case of organised sector and not in unorganised sector or self-

employed, would affect the majority and therefore, the meaning of the 

word, "prospect" used in singular, meaning thereby, expectation, 

possibility or probability, chances of earning more income in future, 

depending upon the factors, stated supra, should also be considered. 

58. Thus, from the above particulars, extracted supra, it is 

evident that both the Central and State Governments have periodically 

revised the minimum wages across the country. It has been raised taking 

into consideration the Consumer Price Index. In respect of scheduled 

employments, for skilled, semi-skilled, unskilled, construction workers, 

labourers, etc., wages, are fixed in various scheduled employments, right 

from Agarbathi Industry to Woolen Carpet and Shawl wearing machinery. 

59. While that be the position in organised sectors, it cannot be 

contended that insofar as unorganised sectors or self-employed, is 

concerned, there would not be any revision in the wages or salary or 

earning. When the minimum wages of an employee in the organised 

sector, is revised periodically, taking into consideration the Consumer 

Price Index and Variable Dearness Allowance, the living conditions, then 

the others, in a unorganised sector may expect more or less the same 


122 

wage, and if there are more number of persons, there may be chances of 

lesser wage, on account of surplus human resources and in such cases, the 

bargaining power of certain class of employees, depending upon the field, 

for revision of wages or earning, may be less. 

60. If a non-salaried domestic worker sells a piece of any article, 

which he or she manufacturers and if the customer bargains the rate, he 

or she would immediately reply, as to how much amount, he/she has to 

spend for buying the basic materials, other materials used, compare the 

erstwhile travel expenses and the cost of labour. Can anyone in this 

Country can say that the electricity charges, water charges, rent, fee 

received by the Government, cost of education, price of commodities, 

etc., have remained the same, without any change. Cost of tea sold in a 

ordinary tea stall is the same for any person, whether engaged in 

organised or unorganised. Contenting inter alia that there would not be 

any increase in wages or earning for those engaged in unorganised 

sectors, for years to come, can it be said that he would never take a cup 

of tea, outside? 

61. At this juncture, it should be borne in mind that Consumer 

Price Index is fixed, taking into consideration that the majority consumers 


123 

are from unorganised sectors. Thus, with reference to Gross Domestic 

Product, Per Capita Income, Consumer Price Index and such other 

economic factors, determined on the basis of participation and 

contribution of both organised and unorganised sectors, the classification 

that those engaged in unorganised sectors, should be totally denied of any 

addition of income under the head, future prospects, would in our humble 

view, would affect Article 14 of the Constitution of India. When the 

majority of persons, in unorganised sectors, also decide the economic 

factors, stated supra, it would be unjust and unreasonable to contend 

that there would not any prospect or addition in the earning of those 

engaged in unorganised sector, forever. If there is addition of Variable 

Dearness Allowance to the basic wages, in the case of organised sector, 

depending upon the Consumer Price Index, applicable for a particular 

period, one would reasonably expect the same factor of variable Dearness 

Allowance, to be a relevant factor, for determining the variation in the 

wage in case of unorganised sector also, as Consumer Price Index is 

common to all, whether engaged in organised or unorganised sector. 

62. At this juncture, we deem it fit to consider, what "Dearness 

Allowance" means? "Dearness Allowance" is a cost of living adjustment 

allowance paid to Government employees, Public sector employees 


124 

(PSU)and pensioners. Dearness Allowance is calculated as a percentage of 

an Indian's basic salary to mitigate the impact of inflation. Variable 

Dearness Allowance is always linked to Consumer Prince Index. The 

notifications of Minimum wages by the Central and State Government 

reflects how much is the Variable Dearness in each field. 

63. In the light of what we have tabulated above, judicial notice 

can also be taken that the cost of labour, whether it is in agricultural 

field or manufacturing or services, has increased. Thus, focusing on the 

increase in wages or earning, in almost all the fields of operation, right 

from agricultural or industrial or manual labourers, tea shop or road side 

vendor, the Consumer Price Index, being the same to rich or raff and 

therefore, correspondingly to meet out the living conditions, atleast for 

providing the basic amenities, like food, shelter and clothing, and not to 

add up the expenditure towards health, education, certainly, there would 

be revision of wages or earning, even in unorganised sectors also. Future 

is the period of time that will come after the present or things that will 

happen. Having regard to the consistent and periodical revision of wages 

by the Governments, it cannot be contended by the Insurers or Transport 

Corporations that a person in unorganised sector, has no future at all, in 

the matter of revision of wages or earning. 


125 

64. In R.K.Malik's case (cited supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

considered the quantum of compensation, payable to the legal 

representatives of the deceased children, aged between 10 and 18 years. 

Referring to the inflation, price rise, etc., the Hon'ble Supreme Court, by 

observing that the there would be a future prospects, for the children 

also, granted a sum of Rs.75,000/-under the head, future prospects, 

though as on the date of accident, they were children, studying in a 

school. In V.Mekala's case (cited supra), the injured was a student 

studying in 11th Standard. While determining the monthly income of the 

injured as Rs.10,000/-, the Hon'ble Supreme Court added 50% of the 

income, under the head, future prospects. In the recent decision in 

Munna Lal Jain's case (cited supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court added 

50% under the head, future prospects. 

65. Thus, from the line of judgments, it could be noticed that the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered the addition of a quantified sum, 

under the head, future prospects, in effect, indicating that there is a 

prospect or chance or possibility of earning more income, after a passage 

of time, though not periodically, as done in the case of Government or 

Public Sector Undertakings or Boards or Corporations, Companies owned 

and controlled by the Government or Limited Companies. 


126 

66. We have already extracted the orders of the Chief Labour 

Commissioner, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India, 

New Delhi and taken into consideration a sample case, City of Chennai. 

Wage revision may vary in rural or urban areas or metropolitan cities. At 

the risk of repetition, as observed earlier, the number of persons, 

engaged in unorganized sectors, agriculture or industrial, or home based 

or self-employment, etc., are more in number, than those employed in 

organised sectors. 

67. Income from the organised sector alone, is not the deciding 

factor, for determining Gross Domestic Product, Consumer Price Index or 

Per Capita Income. Thus, from a basic study of the factors, taken into 

consideration by the Governments for revision of wages, to the 

enumerated categories of employees, one cannot lose sight of the fact 

that the said factors, would also have an indeligible effect on those, 

engaged in unorganized sectors also. In the light of our discussion and the 

details considered, we are of the considered view that addition of certain 

percentage of income under the head, future prospects, has to be done in 

the case of those engaged in unorganized sector or self-employed also, 

otherwise, they would be deprived of just compensation. Addition of 


127 

income under the head,future prospects, should not be restricted to only 

salaried persons, with stable jobs. 

68. Though it is the case of the Insurance Companies and 

Transport Corporation that in the case of persons engaged in unorganised 

sector or salaried or persons, who do not have any permanent job, 

addition of certain percentage of income, under the head, "future 

prospects", to the income drawn, at the time of death, should not be 

made, for computation loss of dependency compensation, we are not 

inclined to accept the same, for the reason that the expression "future 

prospects" should not be confined only to the prospects of the deceased 

in the career, progress or upgradation of position, in which, he was 

engaged, prior to death, but the expression "future prospects" should 

also be extended to the likelihood of increase in wages/salary, earned by 

either a skilled or semi-skilled person, clerical and others, considering the 

upward increase in the cost price, inflation and such other factors. 

69. Just and reasonable compensation has to be awarded to the 

legal representatives of the deceased. Few decisions on this aspect are 

as follows: 

(i) In R.D.Hattangadi v. M/s.Pest Control (India) Pvt. Ltd., 


128 

reported in AIR 1995 SC 755, wherein, the Apex Court held as follows: 

"In its very nature whenever a Tribunal or a Court is 

required to fix the amount of compensation in cases of 

accident, it involves some guess work, some hypothetical 

consideration, some amount of sympathy linked with the 

nature of disability caused. But all the aforesaid elements 

have to be viewed with objective standards." 

(ii) In yet another decision in Divisonal Controller, KSRTC v. 

Mahadeva Shetty and another reported in (2003) 7 SCC 197, in 

Paragraph 12, the Supreme Court held that, 

"Broadly speaking, in the case of death the basis 

of compensation is loss of pecuniary benefits to the 

dependents of the deceased which includes pecuniary 

benefits to the dependents of the deceased which 

includes pecuniary loss, expenses etc. and loss to the 

estate. The object is to mitigate hardship that has 

been caused to the legal representatives due to the 

sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. 

Compensation awarded should not be inadequate and 

should neither be unreasonable, excessive, nor 

deficient. There can be no exact uniform rule for 

measuring the value of human life and the measure of 

damage cannot be arrived at by precise mathematical 

calculation; but amount recoverable depends on broad 

facts and circumstances of each case. It should neither 


129 

be punitive against whom claim is decreed nor should it 

be a source of profit for the person in whose favour it is 

awarded." 

At Paragraph 15 of the said judgment, the Supreme Court has held that, 

"Measure of damages cannot be arrived at by 

precise mathematical calculations. It would depend 

upon the particular facts and circumstances, and 

attending peculiar or special features, if any. Every 

method or mode adopted for assessing compensation 

has to be considered in the background of "just" 

compensation which is the pivotal consideration. 

Though by use of the expression "which appears to it to 

be just", a wide discretion is vested in the Tribunal, the 

determination has to be rational, to be done by a 

judicious approach and not the outcome of whims, wild 

guesses and arbitrariness, and non-arbitrariness. If it is 

not so, it cannot be just." 

(iii) In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences v. Prasanth 

S.Dhananka reported in (2009) 6 SCC 1 = 2010 ACJ 38 (SC), a Hon'ble 

three-Judge Bench was dealing with a case arising out of the complaint 

filed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. While enhancing the 

compensation awarded by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal 

Commission from Rs.15 lakhs to Rs.1 crore, the Hon'ble Bench made the 


130 

following observations which can appropriately be applied for deciding 

the petitions filed under Section 166 of the Act: 

"We must emphasise that the court has to strike a 

balance between the inflated and unreasonable demands of 

a victim and the equally untenable claim of the opposite 

party saying that nothing is payable. Sympathy for the victim 

does not, and should not, come in the way of making a 

correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the court must 

not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. The 

"adequate compensation" that we speak of, must to some 

extent, be a rule of thumb measure, and as a balance has to 

be struck, it would be difficult to satisfy all the parties 

concerned. ...At the same time we often find that a person 

injured in an accident leaves his family in greater distress 

vis-`-vis a family in a case of death. In the latter case, the 

initial shock gives way to a feeling of resignation and 

acceptance, and in time, compels the family to move on. 

The case of an injured and disabled person is, however, 

more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair 

and often destitution enures every day. The support that is 

needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an 

enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only 

on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants 

and the stress saps their energy and destroys their 

equanimity." (emphasis supplied) 


131 

70. Reverting to the case on hand, in some of the appeals before 

us, the quantum of compensation, awarded under the heads, loss of 

dependency, loss of consortium, funeral expenses, love and affection, is 

less. Though the respondents/claimants, in each of the appeals, have not 

filed any cross-objection or independent appeals, yet on the principles of 

just compensation and considering the decision in Nagappa v. Gurudayal 

Singh and others reported in 2003 ACJ 12: 2004 (2) TN MAC 398 (SC), 

wherein, the Apex Court has held that the Court/Tribunals can award 

compensation, more than what is claimed, depending upon the facts and 

circumstances of each case and exercising powers under Order 41, Rule 33 

CPC., we deem it fit to consider the merits of each case. On the aspect of 

suo-motu enhancement, we deem it fit to consider few decisions, 

(i) In National Insurance Co. Ltd., v. M.Jayagandhi reported in 

2008 (1) TNMAC 177, on the question as whether in the absence of any 

Cross Objection, the High Court could suo moto enhance the 

compensation, by exercising power under Order 41, Rule 33 CPC., this 

Court, at Paragraphs 37 and 38, held as follows: 

"37. The question arising for consideration is 

whether in the absence of any Cross Objection, the 

Appellate Court could suo motu enhance the 

compensation. The Appellate Court exercising power 

under Order 41, Rule 33, CPC could enhance the quantum 


132 

of compensation even without Cross-Objection. The 

Courts and Tribunals have a duty to weigh various factors 

and quantify the amount of compensation which should 

be just. Reference could be made to the decision of the 

Supreme Court in Sheikhupura Trans. Co. Ltd. v. 

Northern India Transporter's Ins. Co. Ltd. , 1971 ACJ 206 

(SC), wherein it is held that pecuniary loss to the 

aggrieved party would depend upon data which cannot be 

ascertained accurately, but must necessarily be an 

estimate or even partly a conjecture. The general 

principle is that the pecuniary loss can be ascertained 

only by balancing, on the one hand, the loss to the 

Claimants of future pecuniary benefits and on the other 

any pecuniary advantage which from what-ever sources 

come to them by reason of the death, i.e. the balance of 

loss and gain to a dependant by the death must be 

ascertained. The determination of the question of 

compensation depends on several imponderables. In the 

assessment of those imponderables, there is likely to be a 

margin of error. Broadly speaking, in the case of death, 

the basis of compensation is loss of pecuniary bene-fits to 

the dependants of the deceased which includes pecuniary 

loss, expenses, etc. and loss to estate. Object is to 

mitigate hardship that has been caused to the legal 

representatives due to sudden demise of the deceased in 

the accident. Compensation awarded should not be 

inadequate and should neither be un-reasonable, 


133 

excessive nor deficient. 

38. Of course, the Claimants who are widow, minor 

daughter and mother have not filed any Cross-Objection. 

Even without a Cross-Objection, questioning the 

quantum, the Court could suo motu enhance 

compensation under Or. 41, R. 33, CPC. In this context, 

reference could be made to 1999 ACJ 977 [Karnataka] 

wherein it has been held as follows: 

"(6) I am in general agreement with the basic 

proposition of law that has been canvassed by the 

appellant's learned advocate when he points out that it is 

a well settled principle that a party who suffers an order 

or a decree and does not Appeal against it or assail it 

would normally not be permitted at the hearing of the 

Appeal to try and take advantage of the situation by 

asking for enhancement. The issue is not that but really 

as to whether this situation prescribes an absolute and 

total bar to the Court granting a relief if in the interest of 

justice such a relief is an absolute must. One has to view 

the situation from a rather practical point of view the 

first of them being with regard to the very poor quality of 

legal assistance that is usually available in and around the 

M.A.C.T. and thereafter, the second aspect of the matter 

being that the status of the parties and their general 

condition themselves may be such that they are unable to 

agitate the matter further and the third aspect of the 

matter which is relevant having regard to the present 


134 

case, is the possibility of certain further tragic 

occurrences such as deaths that may have intervened, all 

of which may contribute to a situation wherein the Court 

finds that no Appeal or Cross-Objections have been filed. 

The essence of doing justice requires that compensation 

when awarded has got to be reasonable and fair and it 

has also got to be adequate having regard to the totality 

of the circumstances. The hearing of the Appeal involves 

a total review of the case and the Appeal is virtually an 

extension of the proceedings before the lower Court. The 

law is well settled with regard to one interesting aspect 

of the matter, namely, that the Courts do come across a 

few instances where instead of over-pitching the case 

before the Trial Court, a very modest amount is claimed 

and the Tribunals in these circumstances have been 

wrongly limiting the relief to the amount that has been 

claimed on the ground that even though the party is 

entitled to something higher, what was asked for is a 

lower figure. This Court had occasion to correct these 

orders and to lay down that the Tribunal is required to 

pass an order quantifying the compensation correctly 

irrespective of what has been claimed on the basis of the 

principle that it is not the amount that is claimed in that 

matter, insofar as if the Court has to the power to award 

a lesser amount, that it is equally equipped with the 

power to award a higher amount. It is that principle 

which applies with equal force to the Appeal Court and 


135 

though I do not dispute that a Court would normally not 

permit a party to ask for enhancement unless an Appeal 

or Cross-Objections have been filed but there could be a 

very small category of cases in which the Court would 

make an exception, the reason being that the essence of 

doing justice requires that a Court will not refuse a 

relief only because of a technical or a procedural bar. I 

need to amplify here that if the technicalities are 

upheld, the result would be doing injustice insofar as the 

party will be left with a compensation lesser than what a 

fair evaluation entitles the party to. Again, I do not on 

the basis of the law as enunciated by the Courts in the 

decisions set out by me above, subscribe to the view that 

there exists any bar in the way of this Court exercising 

such powers. The powers do exist under Order 41, Rule 

33, Civil Procedure Code and more importantly, such 

powers can certainly be exercised under section 151, 

Civil Procedure Code in the interest of justice." 

Applying the above decision, in Tamil Nadu State 

Transport Corporation v. Vasantha and Ors. , 2006 (3) 

ACJ 1917: 2006 (1) TN MAC 336 Justice Arumuga perumal 

Adithyan has enhanced compensation, exercising power 

under Or. 41, R. 33, CPC and Section 151, CPC." 

(ii) In Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation v. Saroja and Ors., 

reported in 2008 (1) TNMAC 352, this Court has considered the same 


136 

issue and answered as follows: 

"6. On point: 

The learned counsel for the respondents/claimants 

placing reliance on Order XLI, Rule 33 of C.P.C. and the 

various decisions emerged thereunder would pray that the 

compensation might be enhanced even though no cross-

objection has been filed by the claimants, whereas the 

learned counsel for the appellant -Transport Corporation 

would cite the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Oriental 

Insurance Co. Ltd. v. R. Swaminathan & Ors. , 2006 (2) 

ACC 701 (SC), and develop his arguments to the effect that 

unless there is a cross objection, the question of enhancing 

the compensation would not arise. Hence, it is just and 

necessary to refer to the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court 

in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. R. Swaminathan & Ors. , 

2006 (2)ACC 701 (SC). An excerpt from it would run thus: 

"Apparently the first respondent claimant was satisfied 

with the Tribunal's Award as he did not file any Appeal there 

against to the High Court. Nonetheless, being aggrieved by 

the Single Judge's judgment, the claimant filed a Letters 

Patent Appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court. 

This Appeal was allowed and by the impugned judgment the 

High Court has awarded total compensation amounting to 

Rs.7,44,000/-under different heads with a direction for 

payment of inte-rest at 18% from the date of Petition. The 

appellant-Insurance Company is aggrieved thereby and is in 

Appeal before us. 


137 

The issue that arises in this case is, whether the 

Division Bench of the High Court was justified in in-creasing 

the compensation amount beyond the amount awarded by the 

Tribunal despite the fact that the Award of the Tribunal was 

not at all challenged by the claimant. The only reason given 

by the Division Bench of the High Court for doing so is: 

"In this connection, we may observe that we are aware 

of the fact that we are enhancing the compensation even 

though the injured has not claimed it. But, the question is 

covered by catena of decisions justifying enhancement of 

compensation even if cases where the injured has not 

preferred an Appeal, provided the circumstances of the case 

warrants the same." 

To say the least, this was a very facial way of interfering with 

the award when no interference was called for. We called 

upon the learned Counsel on both sides to show us at least 

one case (out of the catena of judgments referred to in the 

impugned judgment) in support of this proposition. Learned 

counsel frankly confessed that there was none. On the other 

hand, the learned Counsel for the appellant drew our 

attention the judgment of this Court in Banarsi v. Ram Phal, 

2003 (2) SLT 258: 2003 (9) SCC 606, which supports the 

proposition that in an Appeal filed by the defendant laying 

challenge to the grant a smaller relief, the plaintiff as a 

respondent cannot seek a higher relief if he had not filed an 

Appeal on his own or had not taken any cross-objection. In 

the present Appeal it would appear that the claimant neither 


138 

Appealed against the award of compensation passed by the 

Tribunal, nor filed any cross-objection in the First Appeal 

filed by the Insurance Company. Thus, we are satisfied that 

the Division Bench of the High Court wholly erred in 

increasing the compensation amount beyond the amount 

awarded by the Tribunal in the Appeal filed by the Insurance 

Company." 

7. A mere perusal of the excerpt from the said decision 

would clearly indicate that the Hon'ble Apex Court in that 

decision has not laid down as a universal rule of 

interpretation of Order 41, Rule 33 of C.P.C. Taking into 

consideration, the method and manner in which the Division 

Bench of this Court in the Letters Patent Appeal, without 

citing adequate reasons and precedents, enhanced the 

compensation amount to an extent of Rs. 7,44,000/-with 18% 

interest from that of Rs. 3,00,000/-awarded by the Single 

Bench of the same Court, the Hon'ble Apex Court found fault 

with it. 

8. Furthermore, the above excerpt also would reveal 

that without even relying upon any precedent, the Division 

Bench of this Court, simply enhanced the compensation and 

that too to the extent of double that of what the Single Judge 

of this Court ordered. It is also clear that when the Hon'ble 

Apex Court wanted a precedent in that regard, the learned 

counsel for the appellant therein cited only the decision of 

the Hon'ble Apex Court in Banarsi v. Ram Phal , 2003 (2) 

SLT 258: 2003 (9) SCC 606. As such, in the peculiar facts and 


139 

circumstances of that case, the Hon'ble Apex Court felt that 

the power under order 41, Rule 33 of C.P.C. invoked by the 

High Court and that too in a case where such an enhancement 

was not at all warranted, looked askance at it. It is therefore 

explicite that the Hon'ble Apex Court in the cited decision has 

not laid down the law that even in a fit case, the High Court 

should not invoke Order 41, Rule 33 of C.P.C. in the absence 

of filing cross Appeal. Furthermore under Order 41, Rule 33, 

there are earlier decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court, which 

could be cited as under: 

(i) Municipal Board, Mount Abu v. Hari Lal , 1988 

ACJ 281. 

(ii) Dangir v. Madan Mohna , AIR 1988 SC. 54. 

(iii) M.D. Pallavan Transport Corporation Ltd., v. 

Kalavathi , 1998 (1) ACJ 151. 

(iv) State of Punjab v. Bakshish Singh , 1998 (8) 

S.C.C. 222. 

9. The perusal of the aforesaid Judgments of the 

Hon'ble Apex Court would clearly highlight that without filing 

cross Appeal, the respondents in the Appeal could pray for 

reliefs and that the High Court under Order 41, Rule 33 could 

grant such reliefs also. This Court in several cases adhering to 

the aforesaid decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court held that 

under Order 41, Rule 33 of C.P.C., this Court could enhance 

the compensation in appropriate cases. An excerpt from the 

decision of this Court in Managing Director, Thanthai 

Periyar Transport Corp., Villupuram v. Sundari Ammal 


140 

and four Others reported in 1999 (2) CTC 560 would run 

thus: 

"Unfortunately, in the instant case, there is no cross-

objection. Therefore, it would be essential, in this context, 

to consider whether this Court has got powers to enhance the 

amount of compensation, in the event of coming to the 

conclusion that the award was on the lower side, even though 

there is no cross-objection by the claimants. 

In Dangir v. Madan Mohan , AIR 1988 S.C. 54 and 

M.D., Pallavan Transport Corporation Ltd., v. Kalavathi , 

1998 (1) A.C.J 151, it is held that this Court has got power 

to enhance the compensation, even though the claimants had 

not filed any cross-objection against the award seeking for 

higher compensation, if this Court finds that the amount 

awarded by the Tribunal is not just and adequate. 

As pointed out by the Apex Court in State of Punjab v. 

Bakshish Singh , 1998 (8) S.C.C. 222, the reading of the 

provision would make it clear that the Appellate Court has 

got wide power to do complete justice between the parties 

and which enables this Court to pass such decree or order as 

ought to have been passed or as the nature of the case may 

require notwithstanding that the party in whose favour the 

power is sought to be exercised has not filed any Appeal or 

cross-objection. 

The Apex Court in Dhangir v. Madan Mohan, A.I.R. 

1988 S.C. 54, be referring Order 41, Rule 33, would make the 

following observation: 


141 

"The Appellate Court could exercise the power under 

Rule 33 even if the Appeal is only against a part of the decree 

of the lower Court. The Appellate Court could exercise that 

power in favour of all or any of the respondents although such 

respondent may not have filed any Appeal or objection. The 

sweep of the power under Rule 33 is wide enough to 

determine any question not only between the appellant and 

respondent, but also between respondent and co-

respondents. The Appellate Court could pass any decree or 

order which ought to have been passed in the circumstances 

of the case. The words ?as the case may be require? used in 

Rule 33, Order 41 have been put in wide terms to enable the 

Appellate Court to pass any order or decree to meet the ends 

of Justice. What then should be the constraint? We do not 

find many, we are giving any liberal interpretation. The rule 

itself is liberal enough. the only constraints that we could see 

may be these: That the parties before the lower Court should 

be there before the Appellate Court. The question raised 

must properly arise out of judgment of the lower Court. If 

these two requirements are there, the Appellate Court could 

consider any objection against any part of the judgment or 

decree of the lower Court. It is true that the power of the 

Appellate Court under S. 33 is discretionary. But, it is a 

proper exercise of judicial discretion to determine all 

questions urged in order to render complete justice between 

the parties. The Court should not refuse to exercise that 

discretion on mere technicalities." 


142 

10. And then the Division Bench of this Court in the 

decision in The Managing Director, Annai Sathya Transport 

Corporation Ltd., Dharmapuri v. Janardhanam and 7 

others , 2000 (2) CTC 272 placing reliance on the decision of 

the Hon'ble Apex Court held a similar view that without cross 

Appeal Order 41, Rule 33 of C.P.C. could be invoked in 

appropriate cases. An excerpt from it would run thus: 

"At this stage, learned counsel appearing for the 

respondent/claimants would submit that the Tribunal has 

awarded interest only from the date of the Judgment and not 

from the date of the petition. The learned counsel for the 

respondents/claimants would submit that even though no 

Appeal has been filed by the respondents/claimants or no 

cross-objections have been filed by them, this Court has 

discretionary power by virtue of Order 41, Rule 33 of Code of 

Civil Procedure and also in view of the rulings of the Supreme 

Court in Dhangir v. Madan Mohan , AIR 1988 SC 54 to grant 

the proper relief. Of course, the Apex Court has pointed out 

in clear and categorical terms and the power conferred under 

Order 41, Rule 33 on the Appellate Court is discre-tionary, 

and then it must be used in proper case using the judicial 

discretion to render justice. The Apex Court in United India 

Insurance Co., Ltd., v. Narendra Pandu-rang Kadam and 

others , 1995 (1) SCC 320 has clearly laid down that the rate 

of interest must be awarded from the date of the petition 

and not from the date of the Judgment." 

11. Over and above that the decision of the Hon'ble 


143 

Three Judges? Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, in Nagappa 

v. Gurudayal Singh and others , 2003 ACJ 12: 2004 (2) TN 

MAC 398 (SC), could be cited here. An excerpt from it would 

run thus: 

"Firstly, under the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 

1988 (hereinafter referred to as ?the M.V. Act?), there is no 

restriction that compensation could be awarded only up to 

the amount claimed by the claimant. In an appropriate case 

where from the evidence brought on record if Tribunal/Court 

considers that claimant is entitled to get more compensation 

than claimed, the Tribunal may pass such award. Only 

embargo is -it should be 'just' compensation, that is to say, it 

should be neither arbitrary, fanciful nor unjustifiable from 

the evidence. This would be clear by reference to the 

relevant provisions of the M.V. Act. Section 166 provides that 

an application for compensation arising out of an accident 

involving the death of, or bodily injury to, persons arising out 

of the use of motor vehicles, or damages to any property of a 

third party so arising, or both, could be made (a) by the 

person who has sustained the injury; or (b) by the owner of 

the property; or (c) where death has resulted from the 

accident, by all or any of the legal representatives of the 

deceased; or (d) by any agent duly authorised by the person 

injured or all or any of the legal representatives of the 

deceased, as the case may be. Under the proviso to 

subsection (1), all the legal representatives of the deceased 

who have not joined as the claimants are to be impleaded as 


144 

respondents to the application for compensation. Other 

important part of the said Section is subsection (4) which 

provides that ?the Claims Tribunal shall treat any report of 

accidents forwarded to it under subsection (6) of Section 158 

as an application for compensation under this Act?. Hence, 

Claims Tribunal in appropriate case can treat the report 

forwarded to it as an application for compensation even 

though no such claim is made or no specified amount is 

claimed." 

(iii) In Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation v. Pothumponnu 

reported in 2010 (1) CTC 104, this Court, held as follows: 

"17. Notice can be issued to the opposite 

parties/respondents only in case where their rights are 

going to be affected be way of variation/reduction. In 

this case, the claimants are going to be benefited. 

Hence, no notice is necessary in the appeal. When the 

Tribunal commits a mistake that too a material 

mistake, this Court cannot close its eyes and decide the 

matter mechanically. When the mistake is noticed by 

this Court, this Court has got power to do away with it, 

even while dismissing the appeal at the admission stage 

itself. The presence of the respondent is not a must. 

When there is a case for admission, the matter can be 

admitted and notice can be ordered. When there is no 

case made out for admission, the appeal deserved to be 


145 

dismissed. While dismissing, the material irregularity 

committed by the Tribunal can be set right by awarding 

suitable amounts to the respondents without notice to 

them. The presence of the claimants or absence does 

not make any difference. Even if they are present and 

they do not bring it to the notice of this Court about 

the irregularity, this Court can always remedy the same 

suo motu under Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil 

Procedure and Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act 

and invoking Articles 227 of the Constitution of India. 

Moreover, Sections 163 and 166 are beneficial 

provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act aimed at consoling 

and compensating the victims of the accident. This 

Court's approach should be humane in nature not 

whittled down by technicalities. The powers of the 

Court are wide enough to do complete justice." 

71. Reverting to the cases on hand, in C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, as 

Mr.Sathieseelan, learned counsel for the respondents/claimants himself 

has come forward to state that the income from the grocery shop be fixed 

as Rs.6,500/-, the same is accepted. In State of Haryana v. Jasbir Kaur 

reported in AIR 2003 SC 3696, the accident had occurred on 03.02.1999. 

The deceased therein had 4 acres of land. Though no document was filed, 

the Apex Court fixed the monthly income as Rs.3,000/-and then, 

computed the compensation. In the case on hand, the accident has 

occurred on 20.02.2012. The deceased had four acres of land. After 


146 

death, there would not be a total loss of income from agriculture, as 

somebody in the family, may still engage in agricultural activity. 

Therefore, income from agriculture is not added for the purpose of 

computation of dependency. Thus, fixing the monthly income as 

Rs.6,500/-, and considering the escalation of prices, possibility of earning 

more in future, we deem it fit to add 50% towards future prospects and 

accordingly, fix the monthly income as Rs.9,750/-(Rs.6,500 + Rs.3,250) 

for the purpose of computing the loss of dependency, which works out to 

Rs.14,04,000/-(Rs.9,750 x 12 x 16 x ¼). The accident has occurred on 

17.11.2012. The income ceiling for the year 2012 is Rs.2,00,000/-. The 

annual income works out to Rs.1,17,000/-. It is less than the statutory 

limit for levy of Income-Tax. 

72. On the aspect of compensation for pain and suffering, prior 

to death, during hospitalisation, the same cannot be granted on the 

principle of Actio Personalis Moritur-cum-personna. Some of the case laws 

decided by various High Courts on this issue are hereunder: 

"(i) The plain meaning of the maxim "Actio 

Personalis Moritur-cum-personna" is that "a personal action 

dies with the parties to the cause of action". The above said 

maxim is an invention of English Lawyers. In AIR 1967 SC 

1124 [Girija Nandini Devi v. Bijendra Narain], the Supreme 

Court observed as hereunder, 


147 

"The maxim "Actio Personalis Moritur-cum-personna" 

means a personal action dies with the person has a limited 

application. It operates in a limited class of actions ex 

delicto such as actions for damages, assault or other 

personal injuries not causing the death of the party, and in 

other actions where after the death of the party the relief 

granted could not be enjoyed or granting it would be 

nugatory. An action for account is not an action for 

damages ex delicto, and does not fall with the enumerated 

classes. Nor is such that the relief claimed being personal 

could not be enjoyed after death, or granting it would be 

nugatory". 

(ii) However, the maxim "Actio Personalis Moritur-

cum-personna" relates only to the personal injury, pain and 

suffering experienced by the deceased on account of injuries 

and it cannot be extended to the loss of estate of the 

deceased. Reference can be had to the decision of this 

Court in Thailammai V. A.V.Mallayya Pillai reported in 

1975 ACJ 448, wherein, this Court held that the cause of 

action in respect of damages to the estate of the deceased 

survives and it is passed over to the legal 

representatives/dependants. 

(iii) Explaining the maxim "Actio Personalis Moritur-

cum-personna" and its applicability to the Motor Accident 

cases with reference to Section 306 of the Indian Succession 


148 

Act, the Gujarat High Court in Jennabai V. Gujarat State 

Road Transport Corporation [1991 ACJ 585], at Paragraph 

10, 16 and 18, held as follows: 

"10. Tort, frequently, involves a non-pecuniary loss. 

Even pecuniary loss of the deceased, being personal to him 

has no proper entitlement to a place in the assessment of 

the damages which goes to his estate. But for the pecuniary 

loss suffered by the deceased on account of such injuries, an 

action would lie or action would survive for the benefit of 

the estate of the deceased. The claim, on account of loss to 

the estate of the deceased, would, undoubtedly, survive and 

would pass over to his heirs or legal representatives. Section 

306 of the Indian Succession Act does not exclude right to 

recover claim on the basis of proprietary right. In a case of 

personal injuries, arising out of vehicular accident, it may 

include pecuniary loss as well. This pecuniary loss or any loss 

which referable to the loss to estate would be a proprietary 

or right pertaining to property. Therefore, the right to 

maintain the action or to continue the action for recovery of 

pecuniary and proprietary loss which are referable or 

attributable to the loss to the estate, cannot be said to have 

been taken away by the provisions of Section 306 of the 

Indian Succession Act. If the provisions of Section 306 of the 

Indian Succession Act are extended to all causes of action, 

including those affecting proprietary or property, i.e., to the 

estate, it would be to stultify to a great extent the 

provisions of Section 212 (2). If it is stretched to that, it 


149 

would be nugatory, which empowers a Hindu, Mohammadan, 

Buddhist, Sikh, Jain, Indian Christian or Parsi for applying for 

letters of administration in case of intestacy. Such a 

construction of section 306 of the Indian Succession Act 

would raise a direct conflict with the provisions of Order 22, 

Rule 3(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. Moreover, the 

liability to pay compensation is created immediately on the 

occurrence of the accident to the person suffering the injury 

and must amount to a debt payable to him and pass over to 

the heirs of the workman on his death and does not abate. 

Thus, provisions of Section 306 of the Indian Succession Act 

have no application of such cases. Therefore, the maxim 

Actio Personalis Moritur-cum-personna on which Section 306 

of the Indian Succession Act is based, cannot have a blanket 

applicability in all actions even in a case of personal injuries 

wherein the damages flow from the head or under the head 

of loss to the estate. It may be mentioned that in England, 

the said maxim has been criticised as harsh, unconscionable 

and unjust. The rightful claim falling in the realm of 

pecuniary or proprietary or loss to the deceased's estate 

would survive, which is not personal to the deceased. It may 

also be mentioned that the words 'personal injury' occurring 

in Section 306 mean bodily or physical injury as opposed to 

the injury to the proprietary right. Therefore, a cause of 

action in respect of injury to the property or loss referable 

to the deceased's estate flowing from the personal injury 

would not fall within the exception, but would, undoubtedly, 


150 

survive. But, if interpreted otherwise, as held by the 

Tribunal, would mean unjust enrichment and benefit to the 

wrongdoer's estate and unjustifiable injury to the estate of 

the deceased. Unfortunately, the Tribunal has failed to 

address itself to such a vital and important aspect while 

considering and examining the provisions of Section 306 of 

the Indian Succession Act. 

16. It is very clear from para 7 of the impugned 

judgment that the deceased had claimed Rs.2,200/-for 

Medical expenses and Rs.575/-for Miscellaneous expenses, 

etc. The claim under such heads would, undoubtedly, fall 

within the field of loss to the estate. If such amount would 

not have been spent by the deceased it was to go to the 

hands of the appellants or legal representatives of the 

deceased. Likewise, loss of past income awardable to the 

deceased on account of wrong done to him subject to 

reasonable expenses which would have been incurred by the 

deceased for himself would also be a loss to the estate. It 

can safely be concluded that had the deceased not sustained 

the injuries, there would not have been loss of income and 

consequently there would not have been any detrimental 

effect on the estate of the deceased. If the unfortunate 

accident had not occurred the income or expenses falling 

within the head of loss to the estate would have augmented 

the estate and same would have gone in the hands of the 

heirs and legal representatives of the deceased. The loss of 

past income for the period from the date of accident till the 


151 

inability on the part of the deceased to earn on account of 

the injuries, subject to reasonable expenses for himself, 

would also form a part of estate of the deceased. No doubt, 

the loss of income occurring after the death of the deceased 

would not be a loss to the estate. The action for amount of 

claim which is not attributable to the loss of estate of the 

deceased could not survive to the appellants. In other words, 

the heirs and legal representatives of the deceased would 

not be entitled to and eligible to claim the amount of claim 

which is not referable to or not attributable to the loss of 

the estate. Unfortunately, the Tribunal applied the doctrine 

of actio personalis moritur cum personna along with the 

provisions of Section 306 of the Indian Succession Act in 

respect of the entire claim without taking into account the 

separate claim under the head of loss to the estate of the 

deceased, Abdul Karim Musa. This proposition of law, 

unfortunately, could not be brought to the notice of the 

Tribunal. With the result, the approach of the Tribunal in so 

far as it related to the dismissal of the claim in respect of 

loss to the estate of the deceased cannot be sustained. 

18. Incidentally, it may also be mentioned that could 

inability to compensate under the Workmen's Compensation 

Act, 1923, in case of an employment injury to the workman 

abate or die on account of demise of the workman 

unconnected with the employment? Suppose, in a given case, 

the workman files an application for compensation under 

Section 3 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923, and 


152 

during the pendency of the proceedings he dies otherwise 

than as a result of the employment injuries. Would that right 

be lost in view of the provisions of Section 306 of the Indian 

Succession Act? If the interpretation made by the Tribunal in 

the present case is accepted then the liability to compensate 

him under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923, would 

abate. Of course, the language in Section 306 of the Indian 

Succession Act, no doubt, appears to be general. But it is 

not always that a general import must necessarily receive a 

general and wide meaning divorced from the material facts 

of the case. The expression "other personal injuries not 

causing the death of the party" is preceded by the words, 

'defamation, assault' as defined in the Penal Code. The words 

'other personal injuries..... must, therefore, receive colour 

from the earlier words and ought to be construed with the 

words preceding. It is also settled proposition of law that 

benevolent legislation is required to be construed liberally so 

as to advance the underlying object and purpose of the 

provision. It is also well stated that if interpretation of a 

welfare legislation or any provision of the statute is capable 

of two constructions, that construction should be preferred 

which furthers the policy of the Act or provision concerned 

and which is more beneficiary for the class in whose interest 

the law has been made." 

(iv) In V.Mepherson v. Shiv Charan Singh & Ors., 

reported in I(1998) ACC 6, the Delhi High Court, while 


153 

testing the correctness of the award passed by the Motor 

Accident Claims Tribunal, considered as to whether personal 

damages awarded to the claimant/injured are inheritable or 

not. In the said case, the death was not due to the accident. 

The main contention was that the claim for enhancement for 

general damages after the death of the objector does not 

survive. Answering the issue, the Court at Paragraph 3, 

observed as follows: 

"3. So far as the contention of Mr.Tarun Johri that 

claim for damages which was on account of suffering and 

pain suffered by the deceased, to my mind, it would abet on 

the death of the injured. But so far as other claims under 

other heads those would not come to an end on the death of 

the objector. The right to sue would survive even on the 

death of the objector. As a matter of fact claim on account 

of special diet, medicine, conveyance etc., are such which 

related to the loss of the property, therefore, right to sue 

would not abet on the death of the objector. It would 

survive to his legal heirs as held by the High Court of Punjab 

and Haryana in the case of Joti Ram & Ors. v. Chaman Lal & 

Ors., AIR 1985 Punjab & Haryana page 2=I (1986) ACC 

550." 

(v) In Kartar Kaur v. Dayal Singh reported in II (1999) 

ACC 372 (DB), one of the issues raised before the Division 

Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court was about the 

continuance of the appeal by the Legal Representatives of 


154 

the injures/claimant (sons of the deceased) based on the 

Doctrine "Actio Personalis Moritur cum Persona", ie., a 

personal claim dies with the person (claimant). Answering 

the issue, at Paragraph 13, the Division Bench held as 

follows: 

"13. In view of the above, we are of the view that 

where the injured claimant dies as a result of the injuries 

during the pendency of his claim for compensation, the legal 

representatives would be entitled to pursue the claim as in 

case of death caused in an accident by the use of motor 

vehicle. Where the injured dies his natural death and not 

because of injuries suffered in motor accident, the legal 

representatives would be entitled to pursue the claim to the 

extent as recognised by Section 306 of the Indian Succession 

Act, that is, the claim on account of loss to the estate of the 

deceased. Where in a case, the compensation has been 

awarded to the injured and an appeal is preferred and during 

the pendency of the appeal, claimant/injured dies, his legal 

representatives can continue the appeal for enhancement of 

compensation." 

(vi) A similar issue came up for consideration before 

the Division Bench of Karnataka High Court in Sridevi v. 

Mastak Ahamad reported in I (2002) ACC 262 (DB). In the 

above reported judgment, a minor, aged about four years, 

sustained injures. On the claim made by her father, 

Rs.72,000/-was awarded. Aggrieved by the inadequacy of 


155 

compensation, an appeal was preferred by the injured 

through her father and during the pendency of the appeal, 

she died. Legal Representatives were brought on record. It 

was submitted that the compensation for Medical Expenses, 

Pain and Suffering, Loss of Amenities and general damages 

was on the lower side. Following the decision in 

V.Mepherson's case, the Division Bench held that the appeal 

is abated in so far as the claim for damages for pain and 

suffering is concerned and on the question of expenses on 

medicines, special diet, conveyance etc., as the expenses 

relate to loss of estate, they would not abate. 

(vii) Similar view was taken by the Himachal High 

Court in Ram Ashari v. H.R.T.C., reported in IV (2005) ACC 

379. At paragraph 6 to 8 of the judgment, it is held as 

follows: 

"6. It is well settled law that an action in torts for 

claim of compensation for damages on account of injuries 

suffered by an injured is a right personal to the injured. This 

right cannot be continued by the legal heirs or legal 

representatives. It is no doubt true that the legal heirs or 

the legal representatives can continue the proceedings 

insofar as they relate to the loss to the estate such as 

medical expenses, amount spent on treatment etc. However, 

the claim with regard to pain and suffering, future loss of 

income and such related matters is an action which is 

personal to the injured alone and cannot be continued after 


156 

his death unless it is proved that the death is the result of 

the injuries suffered in the accident. 

7. A Division Bench of this Court in Narinder Kaur v. 

State of H.P., II (1991) ACC 206 = (1991) 2 ACJ 767, held 

as follows: 

"(8) We have heard the learned counsel for the parties 

and gone through the records. The principle of actio 

personalis moritur cum persona relates only to the personal 

or bodily injuries and not to the loss caused to the estate of 

the deceased by the tort-feasor. In its applicability, the 

principle stands considerably modified by the provisions of 

Section 306 of the Indian Succession Act, which clearly lays 

down that all demands whatsoever and all rights to 

prosecute or defend any action or special proceedings 

existing in favour of or against a person at the time of his 

death survive except causes of action for defamation, assault 

and other personal injuries not causing death of the party 

etc., which come to an end with the death of the injured. 

The loss of the estate is thus not covered by the exceptions 

contained in Section 306 of the Indian Succession Act. While 

taking this view, we are fortified by the decisions of the 

Supreme Court in Melepurath Sankunni Ezhuthassan v. 

Thekittil Geopalankutty Nair, 1986 (1) ACJ 440 : AIR 

1986 SC 411 : 1986 (2) TAC 216, and M.Veerappa v. 

Evelyn Sequeria, AIR 1988 SC 506. The claimants as legal 

representatives of the original claimant were, as such, 

entitled to be substituted in his place with a view to 


157 

continue the proceedings in the case and to have a decision 

on the claim in respect of the loss caused to the estate of 

the deceased." 

8. Keeping in view of the settled position of law and 

the fact that in the present case there is no claim for loss to 

the estate and the entire claim is based on the personal 

claim of the deceased Karam Chand, the appeal cannot be 

continued and prosecuted by the legal representatives." 

(viii) A Full Bench of the Karnataka High Court in 

Uttam Kumar (deceased) v. Madhav and another, 2002 

ACJ 1828, had an occasion to consider an appeal filed by the 

legal representatives of the deceased for enhancement of 

the compensation. Short facts of the reported case are as 

follows: 

"In an accident that occurred on 07.01.1995, where 

the Uttam Kumar sustained injuries. He was admitted in the 

hospital for his treatment and he incurred expenses. He 

claimed compensation. The Tribunal awarded Rs.36,250/-

with costs and interest. Not satisfied with the compensation, 

he preferred an appeal for an enhancement. Pending 

disposal of the appeal, he died and his aged parents were 

brought on record. The Division Bench of the Karnataka High 

Court found that the cause of action will not survive and 

Lrs., of the deceased claimant will not be entitled to 

compensation. However, the Division Bench observed that in 

view of the amended provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 


158 

1988 and the decision of the Supreme Court in Kannamma v. 

Deputy General Manager, Karnataka State Road Transport 

Corporation reported in 1991 ACJ 707 (Karnataka), 

referred this matter to a Larger Bench. The Full Bench which 

examined the issue with reference to the provisions of the 

Motor Vehicles Act and Indian Succession Act, 1925 and 

answered as follows:-

(i) A claim petition presented under Section 110-A of 

the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, by the person sustaining bodily 

injuries in a motor accident, claiming compensation for 

personal injuries as also for compensation towards expenses, 

loss of income, etc. (loss to the estate) cannot, on such 

person's death occurring not as a result or consequence of 

bodily injuries sustained from a motor accident, be 

prosecuted by his/her legal representatives; but 

(ii) A claim petition presented under Section 110-A of 

the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, by the person sustaining bodily 

injuries in a motor accident, claiming compensation for 

personal injuries as also for compensation towards expenses, 

loss of income, etc. (loss to the estate) can, on such person's 

death occurring as a result or consequence of bodily injuries 

sustained in the motor accident, be prosecuted by his/her 

legal representatives only insofar as the claim for 

compensation in that claim petition relates to loss of estate 

of the deceased person due to bodily injuries sustained in 

the motor accident." 


159 

73. In the case on hand, the deceased was survived by wife, son, 

daughter and parents. At the time of claim, children were aged about 12 

and 10 years respectively. In Rajesh's case, cited supra, the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court has awarded Rs.1,00,000/-as compensation under the 

head, loss of love and affection to each child. Therefore, following the 

said decision, children are awarded compensation of Rs.1,00,000/-each. 

Parents are awarded compensation of Rs.50,000/-each. Total 

compensation awarded under the head, loss of love and affection, is 

Rs.3,00,000/-. Rs.1,000/-is awarded under the head, damage to clothes 

and articles. The other amounts are sustained. 

74. The Claims Tribunal, after adjudication, has awarded 

Rs.18,82,600/-. Having regard to the reworking of compensation under 

various heads, stated supra, the total compensation, due and payable to 

the legal representatives of the deceased/respondents in C.M.A.No.723 of 

2015, is determined as Rs.18,40,000/-and it is apportioned as follows: 

Loss of Dependency 
: Rs.14,04,000/-

Loss of Love and Affection 
: Rs. 3,00,000/-

Loss of Consortium 
: Rs. 1,00,000/-

Transportation 
: Rs. 
10,000/-


160 

Funeral Expenses 
: Rs. 
25,000/-

Damages to clothes & Articles : Rs. 
1,000/-
---------------------
Total : Rs.18,40,000/-
---------------------

75. In C.M.A.No.3273 of 2014, the legal representatives of the 

deceased/claimants have produced sufficient evidence to prove that the 

deceased owned a lorry. Ex.P11 is the Transfer of National Permit in the 

name of the deceased and he had a driving licence. While that be so, the 

contention of the appellant-Insurance Company that the Tribunal has 

erred in accepting the avocation and monthly income of Rs.15,000/-, 

from operating the lorry, cannot be accepted. On the claim of the legal 

representatives of the deceased/claimants, to add 50% under the head, 

future prospects, it is also to be considered, as to whether, there was no 

possibility of earning any further income from operating the lorry. Still 

the vehicle can be let out for earning. Unless there is proof of sale of the 

vehicle, after the accident and that it was not fetching any income, it 

cannot be said that the family of the bereaved, has lost the entire income 

in future. However, there could be some reduction. Considering the said 

aspect, addition of 30% under the head, future prospects, would be 

reasonable. Therefore, the claim to enhance the percentage to 50% is 

answered in the negative. But at the same time, the plea of the legal 


161 

representatives of the deceased/claimants that the compensation under 

the heads, consortium of Rs.25,000/-, loss of love and affection of 

Rs.30,000/-and funeral expenses of Rs.5,000/-is less and therefore, 

requires to be enhanced. 

76. On the aspect of awarding compensation for funeral 

expenses, in Rajesh and others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others reported in 

2013(3) CTC 883, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows: 

"21. We may also take judicial notice of the fact that 

the Tribunals have been quite frugal with regard to award of 

compensation under the head 'Funeral Expenses'. The 'Price 

Index', it is a fact has gone up in that regard also. The head 

'Funeral Expenses' does not mean the fee paid in the 

crematorium or fee paid for the use of space in the cemetery. 

There are many other expenses in connection with funeral 

and, if the deceased is follower of any particular religion, 

there are several religious practices and conventions pursuant 

to death in a family. All those are quite expensive. Therefore, 

we are of the view that it will be just, fair and equitable, 

under the head of 'Funeral Expenses', in the absence of 

evidence to the contrary for higher expenses, to award at 

least an amount of Rs.25,000/-." 

Therefore, funeral expenses awarded is enhanced to Rs.25,000/-. 


162 

77. The issue as to whether, brother and sister of the deceased 

can maintain a claim petition for compensation has been considered by 

this Court in Oriental Insurance Company v. Rangamal reported in 2011 

(1) TCJ 7 = 2011 AAC 1168 and Managing Director, Tamil Nadu State 

Transport Corporation Ltd., v. M.Shanthi reported in 2010 CIJ 374 Mad 

(2). In the former case, it was the contention of the appellant-Insurance 

Company that brother/sister is entitled to claim compensation only under 

'No Fault Liability'. Following the decisions of the Apex Court in Gujarat 

State Road Transport Corporation, Ahmedabad v. Ramanbhai 

Prabhatbhai and another reported in 1987 ACJ 561, Vidya Dhar Dubey 

and others v. U.P.State Road Transport Corporation reported in 1997 

ACJ 1388, Oriental Insurance Company Ltd., v. Naresh Chandra 

Agarwal and others reported in 2000 ACJ 931, Govindasamy v. Ravi 

and others, reported in 2003 (1) MLJ 253, Kishan Lal v. Bharosi Lal 

reported in II (2003) ACC 225, Managing Director, K.S.R.T.C., v. 

Venkataramappa K.S., reported in III (2003) ACC 457 (DB), New India 

Assurance Co. Ltd., v. Ashwin Vrajlal Rajgor reported in 2005 ACJ 

1618, A.Manavalagan v. A.Krishnamurthy reported in I (2005) ACC 304 

(DB), this Court held that brother and sister of the deceased are entitled 

to maintain a claim for loss of estate and accordingly, rejected the said 

contention. However, in the case on hand, apportionment of 


163 

compensation among the claimants, has not been questioned by them. 

But no compensation is awarded to Sisters, under the head, loss of love 

and affection. A sum of Rs.50,000/-each, is awarded to the sisters and 

parents of the deceased. Altogether, a sum of Rs.2,00,000/-is awarded 

under the head, loss of love and affection. 

78. 
'Consortium' as per the Best v. Samuel Fox reported in 1952 

AC 716 means, "Duty owned by a wife to her husband and vice versa, 

companionship, love and affection, comfort, mutual services, sexual 

intercourse, etc." Consortium is not a pecuniary loss. It is certainly a 

conventional damage awarded to a widow, who has lost her husband. In 

Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others reported in 2013(3) CTC 

883, the Apex Court, while observing that at least a sum of Rs.1 Lakh has 

to be awarded to the widow, for loss of consortium, held as follows: 

"In legal parlance, 'Consortium' is the right of the 

spouse to the company, care, help, comfort, guidance, 

society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or 

her mate. That non-pecuniary head of damages has not 

been properly understood by our Courts. The loss of 

companionship, love, care and protection, etc., the spouse 

is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. 

The concept of non-pecuniary damage for Loss of 

Consortium is one of the major heads of award of 


164 

compensation in other parts of the world more particularly 

in the United States of America, Australia, etc. English 

Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get 

compensation even during the period of temporary 

disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made 

an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, 

comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, 

protection, care and sexual relations during the future 

years. Unlike the compensation awarded in other countries 

and other jurisdictions, since the legal heirs are otherwise 

adequately compensated for the pecuniary loss, it would 

not be proper to award a major amount under this head. 

Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and 

reasonable that the Courts award atleast Rupees one lakh 

for Loss of Consortium." 

Following the same, a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-is awarded as loss of 

consortium. 

79. Now, let us come to the dependency compensation. If 30% is 

added to the income drawn at the time of death, under the future 

prospects, then it works out to Rs.19,500/-. The annual income works out 

to Rs.2,34,000/-. In Shyamwati Sharma v. Karam Singh reported in 2010 

(12) SCC 378, the Supreme Court at Paragraphs 8 and 9, held as follows: 

"7. The submission of the respondents that the 

deduction of 30% from the salary is not warranted in view of 


165 

the decision in Sarla Verma, is not sound. In Sarla Verma, the 

monthly salary of the deceased was only Rs.4004/-and the 

annual income even after taking note of future prospects was 

Rs.72072/-. The income was in a range which was exempt 

from tax, if the permissible deductions were applied. 

Therefore, this Court did not make any deduction towards 

income-tax. But this Court made it clear that where the 

annual income is in the taxable range, appropriate deduction 

should be made towards tax. 

9. In this case as the annual income has been worked 

out as Rs.2,48,292/-, appropriate deduction has to be made 

towards income-tax. The rate of income tax is a varying 

figure, with reference to taxable income after permissible 

deductions and the year of assessment. The High Court has 

assessed the deduction as 30% and on the facts, we do not 

propose to disturb it. We however make it clear that while 

ascertaining the income of the deceased, any deductions 

shown in the salary certificate as deductions towards GPF, 

life insurance premium, repayments of loans etc., should not 

be excluded from the income. The deduction towards income 

tax/surcharge alone should be considered to arrive at the net 

income of the deceased." 

The ratio laid down in Shyamwati Sharma's case, is reiterated in Manasvi 

Jain v. Delhi Transport Corporation reported in 2014 (1) TNMAC 647. 

80. The accident has occurred on 20.02.2012. For the financial 

year 2012, 10% of the income has to be deducted towards Income-Tax. 


166 

Thus, excluding the ceiling limit of Rs.2,00,000/-, Income-Tax has to be 

calculated for the remaining amount of Rs.34,000/-, which works out to 

Rs.3,400/-(10% of Rs.34,000/-). Thus, after deducting Income-Tax, the 

monthly income to be fixed for the purpose of computing the loss of 

dependency is Rs.2,30,600/-. There is no quarrel over multiplier '16' 

applied by the Claims Tribunal. After deducting 1/4 th towards the 

personal and living expenses of the deceased, loss of dependency works 

out to Rs.24,59,733/-. 
Transportation expenses of Rs.5,000/-is 

sustained. In addition, a sum of Rs.1000/-is awarded for damages to 

clothes and articles. After reworking, the total compensation due and 

payable to the legal representatives of the deceased/respondents in 

C.M.A.No.3273 of 2014, is Rs.27,90,733/-and it is apportioned as follows: 

Loss of Dependency 
: Rs.24,59,733/-

Loss of Love and Affection 
: Rs. 2,00,000/-

Loss of Consortium 
: Rs. 1,00,000/-

Funeral Expenses 
: Rs. 
25,000/-

Transportation 
: Rs. 
5,000/-

Damages to clothes & Articles : Rs. 
1,000/-
---------------------
Total : Rs.27,90,733/-
---------------------

81. In C.M.A.No.2386 of 2015, upon perusal of Ex.P6, Pay Slip for 


167 

the month of April, 2011, produced by the learned counsel for the 

respondents/claimants, we find that the deceased was a Senior Factory 

Assistant in Tamil Nadu Co-operative Milk Federation Limited and earned 

Rs.18,900.40 per month. Out of the said amount, the following deductions 

have been made by the employer, 

CD Amount 
: Rs.5,651/-

Provident Fund 
: Rs. 780/-

LIC 
: Rs. 209/-

Special Provident Fund 
: Rs. 70/-

Family Benefit Fund 
: Rs. 40/-

Festival Advance 
: Rs. 100/-
---------------
Total : Rs.6,950/-
---------------

82. Out of the deductions, General Provident Fund, Special 

Provident Fund and Family Benefit Fund were payments made by the 

deceased and that the same would be refunded in lumpsum, at the time 

of retirement or death. Premium collected towards LIC premium also 

would be refunded to the Government servant, on attaining the age of 

superannuation or at the time of death. Therefore, the deductions made 

by the employer, under the above heads, in the salary slip, while arriving 

at net salary, under the above heads, should be added, while determining 


168 

the actual monthly income of any salaried servant, as decided by this 

Court in The Manager, National Insurance Co., Ltd., v. Padmavathy & 8 

others reported in 2007-2-L.W.182. 

83. The issue as to how, the claims tribunal/ courts should 

determine the monthly income of the deceased, for the purpose of 

computing the loss of contribution to the family, has been considered in 

National Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Indira Srivastava & Others, reported 

in 2008 (2) SCC 763, wherein, the Supreme Court held as follows: 

"9. The term 'income' has different connotations 

for different purposes. A court of law, having regard to the 

change in societal conditions must consider the question not 

only having regard to pay packet the employee carries home 

at the end of the month but also other perks which are 

beneficial to the members of the entire family. Loss caused 

to the family on a death of a near and dear one can hardly be 

compensated on monetary terms. 

10. Section 168 of the Act uses the word 'just 

compensation' which, in our opinion, should be assigned a 

broad meaning. We cannot, in determining the issue involved 

in the matter, lose sight of the fact that the private sector 

companies in place of introducing a pension scheme takes 

recourse to payment of contributory Provident Fund, Gratuity 

and other perks to attract the people who are efficient and 


169 

hard working. Different offers made to an officer by the 

employer, same may be either for the benefit of the 

employee himself or for the benefit of the entire family. If 

some facilities are being provided whereby the entire family 

stands to benefit, the same, in our opinion, must be held to 

be relevant for the purpose of computation of total income 

on the basis whereof the amount of compensation payable for 

the death of the kith and kin of the applicants is required to 

be determined. For the aforementioned purpose, we may 

notice the elements of pay, paid to the deceased : 

"BASIC : 63,400.00 

CONVEYANCE ALLOWANCE : 12,000.00 

RENT CO LEASE : 49,200.00 

BONUS (35% OF BASIC) : 21,840.00 

TOTAL : 1,45,440.00 

In addition to above, his other entitlements were : 

Con. to PF 10% Basic Rs. 6,240/-(p.a.) 

LTA reimbursement Rs. 7,000/-(p.a.) 

Medical reimbursement Rs. 6,000/-(p.a.) 

Superannuation 15% of Basic Rs. 9,360/-(p.a.) 

Gratuity Cont.5.34% of Basic Rs. 3,332/-(p.a.) 

Medical Policy-self & Family @ Rs.55,000/-(p.a.) 

Education Scholarship @ Rs.500 Rs.12,000/-(p.a.) 

Payable to his two children Directly" 

14. The question came for consideration before a 

learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court in The 

Manager, National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Padmavathy & Ors. 


170 

[CMA No.114 of 2006 decided on 29.1.2007], wherein it 

was held : 

"Income tax, Professional tax which are deducted 

from the salaried person goes to the coffers of the 

government under specific head and there is no return. 

Whereas, the General Provident Fund, Special Provident 

Fund, L.I.C., Contribution are amounts paid specific heads 

and the contribution is always repayable to an employee at 

the time of voluntary retirement, death or for any other 

reason. Such contribution made by the salaried person are 

deferred payments and they are savings. The Supreme Court 

as well as various High Courts have held that the 

compensation payable under the Motor Vehicles Act is 

statutory and that the deferred payments made to the 

employee are contractual. Courts have held that there cannot 

be any deductions in the statutory compensation, if the Legal 

Representatives are entitled to lumpsum payment under the 

contractual liability. If the contributions made by the 

employee which are otherwise savings from the salary are 

deducted from the gross income and only the net income is 

taken for computing the dependancy compensation, then the 

Legal Representatives of the victim would lose considerable 

portion of the income. In view of the settled proposition of 

law, I am of the view, the Tribunal can make only statutory 

deductions such as Income tax and professional tax and any 

other contribution, which is not repayable by the employer, 

from the salary of the deceased person while determining the 


171 

monthly 
income 
for 
computing 
the 
dependancy 

compensation. Any contribution made by the employee during 

his life time, form part of the salary and they should be 

included in the monthly income, while computing the 

dependency compensation." 

15. Similar view was expressed by a learned Single 

Judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court in S. Narayanamma & 

Ors. V. Secretary to Government of India, Ministry of 

Telecommunications and Ors. [2002 ACC 582], holding: 

"13. In this background, now we will examine the 

present deductions made by the tribunal from the salary of 

the deceased in fixing the monthly contribution of the 

deceased to his family. The tribunal has not even taken 

proper care while deducting the amounts from the salary of 

the deceased, at least the very nature of deductions from the 

salary of the deceased. My view is that the deductions made 

by the tribunal from the salary such as recovery of housing 

loan, vehicle loan, festival advance and other deductions, if 

any, to the benefit of the estate of the deceased cannot be 

deducted while computing the net monthly earnings of the 

deceased. These advances or loans are part of his salary. So 

far as House Rent Allowance is concerned, it is beneficial to 

the entire family of the deceased during his tenure, but for 

his untimely death the claimants are deprived of such benefit 

which they would have enjoyed if the deceased is alive. On 

the other hand, allowances, like Travelling Allowance, 

allowance for newspapers/periodicals, telephone, servant, 


172 

club-fee, car maintenance etc., by virtue of his vocation 

need not be included in the salary while computing the net 

earnings of the deceased. The finding of the tribunal that the 

deceased was getting Rs.1,401/-as net income every month 

is unsustainable as the deductions made towards vehicle loan 

and other deductions were also taken into consideration 

while fixing the monthly income of the deceased. The above 

finding of the tribunal is contrary to the principle of 'just 

compensation' enunciated by the Supreme Court in the 

judgment in Helen's case (1 supra). The Supreme Court in 

Concord of India Insurance Co. v. Nirmaladevi and Ors., 

1980 ACJ 55 (SC) held that determination of quantum must 

be liberal and not niggardly since law values life and limb in a 

free country 'in generous scales'." 

......... 

19. The amounts, therefore, which were required 

to be paid to the deceased by his employer by way of perks, 

should be included for computation of his monthly income as 

that would have been added to his monthly income by way of 

contribution to the family as contradistinguished to the ones 

which were for his benefit. We may, however, hasten to add 

that from the said amount of income, the statutory amount 

of tax payable thereupon must be deducted. 

20. The term 'income' in P. Ramanatha Aiyar's 

Advanced Law Lexicon (3rd Ed.) has been defined as under: 

"The value of any benefit or perquisite whether 

convertible into money or not, obtained from a company 


173 

either by a director or a person who has substantial interest 

in the company, and any sum paid by such company in 

respect of any obligation, which but for such payment would 

have been payable by the director or other person aforesaid, 

occurring or arising to a person within the State from any 

profession, trade or calling other than agriculture." 

It has also been stated : 

'INCOME' signifies 'what comes in' (per Selborne, C., 

Jones v. Ogle, 42 LJ Ch.336). 'It is as large a word as can be 

used' to denote a person's receipts '(per Jessel, M.R. Re 

Huggins, 51 LJ Ch.938.) income is not confined to receipts 

from business only and means periodical receipts from one's 

work, lands, investments, etc. AIR 1921 Mad 427 (SB). Ref. 

124 IC 511 : 1930 MWN 29 : 31 MLW 438 AIR 1930 Mad 626 

: 58 MLJ 337." 

21. If the dictionary meaning of the word 'income' 

is taken to its logical conclusion, it should include those 

benefits, either in terms of money or otherwise, which are 

taken into consideration for the purpose of payment of 

income-tax or profession tax although some elements thereof 

may or may not be taxable or would have been otherwise 

taxable but for the exemption conferred thereupon under the 

statute. 

22. In N. Sivammal & Ors. v. Managing Director, 

Pandian Roadways Corporation & Ors. [(1985) 1 SCC 18], 

this Court took into consideration the pay packet of the 

deceased. 


174 

23. We may notice that in T.N. State Transport 

Corporation Ltd. v. S. Rajapriya & Ors. [(2005) 6 SCC 236], 

this Court held: 

"8. The assessment of damages to compensate the 

dependants is beset with difficulties because from the nature 

of things, it has to take into account many imponderables 

e.g. the life expectancy of the deceased and the dependants, 

the amount that the deceased would have earned during the 

remainder of his life, the amount that he would have 

contributed to the dependants during that period, the 

chances that the deceased may not have lived or the 

dependants may not live up to the estimated remaining 

period of their life expectancy, the chances that the 

deceased might have got better employment or income or 

might have lost his employment or income together. 

9. The manner of arriving at the damages is to 

ascertain the net income of the deceased available for the 

support of himself and his dependants, and to deduct 

therefrom such part of his income as the deceased was 

accustomed to spend upon himself, as regards both self-

maintenance and pleasure, and to ascertain what part of his 

net income the deceased was accustomed to spend for the 

benefit of the dependants. Then that should be capitalised by 

multiplying it by a figure representing the proper number of 

years' purchase. 

10. Much of the calculation necessarily remains in 

the realm of hypothesis "and in that region arithmetic is a 


175 

good servant but a bad master" since there are so often many 

imponderables. In every case "it is the overall picture that 

matters", and the court must try to assess as best as it can 

the loss suffered." 

24. Yet again in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. 

Charlie & Anr [(2005) 10 SCC 720], the same view was 

reiterated. However, therein although the words 'net income' 

has been used but the same itself would ordinarily mean 

gross income minus the statutory deductions. We must also 

notice that the said decision has been followed in New India 

Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Kalpana (Smt.) & Ors. [(2007) 3 SCC 

538]"." 

84. In Raghuvir Singh Matolya v. Hari Singh Malviya & Ors., 

reported in (2009) 15 SCC 363, the Apex Court, while observing that 

Dearness Allowance forms part of the income and House Rent Allowance 

is paid for the benefit of the family members and not for the employee 

alone, held that dearness allowance and house rent allowance should be 

included for computation of income of the deceased. 

85. Thus, in the case on hand, the calculation has to be made as 

follows: 

Income 
: Rs.13,259.40 

Addition 


176 

Provident Fund 
: Rs. 
780.00 

LIC 
: Rs. 
209.00 

Special Provident Fund : Rs. 
70.00 

Family Benefit Fund 
: Rs. 
40.00 
------------------
Total : Rs.14,358.40 
------------------
The monthly income of the deceased, works out to Rs.14,358.40, rounded 

off to Rs.14,360/-. As per the decision in Rajesh's case (cited supra), 

addition of 15% to the income fixed, at the time of death, towards future 

prospects has to be made. If 15% is added, the monthly income of the 

deceased works out to Rs.16,514/-. 

86. The accident has occurred on 28.07.2011. For the financial 

year 2011, 10% of the income has to be deducted towards Income-Tax. 

Thus, excluding the ceiling limit of Rs.1,90,000/-, Income-Tax has to be 

calculated for the remaining amount of Rs.8,168/-, which works out to 

Rs.817/-(10% of Rs.8,168/-). Thus, after deducting Income-Tax, the 

annual income to be fixed for the purpose of computing the loss of 

dependency is Rs.2,30,600/-. 

87. The proper multiplier as per Sarala Verma's case, for the age 

group between 50 and 55 years, is '11'. There are four dependents in this 


177 

case. As per Sarala Verma's case, if the number of dependents are four. 

Therefore, deduction towards personal and living expenses should be 

1/4th. After deducting 1/4 th towards the personal and living expenses of 

the deceased and applying '11' multiplier, the dependency compensation 

works to Rs.16,27,929/-(Rs.2,30,600/-x 11 x 1/4th). 

88. Compensation of Rs.1,00,000/-awarded under the head, loss 

of love and affection to the sons and daughters, is less. Claimants are 

married sons and daughters of the deceased. Hence, this Court is inclined 

to award Rs.50,000/-each towards loss of love and affection, which 

comes to Rs.2,00,000/-. Funeral Expenses of Rs.25,000/-is sustained. In 

addition, compensation of Rs.5,000/-and Rs.1,000/-is awarded for 

transportation and damages to clothes and articles respectively. After 

reworking, the total compensation due and payable to the legal 

representatives of the deceased/respondents in C.M.A.No.2386 of 2015, is 

Rs.18,58,929/-and it is apportioned as follows: 

Loss of Dependency 
: Rs.18,58,929/-

Loss of Love and Affection 
: Rs. 2,00,000/-

Funeral Expenses 
: Rs. 
25,000/-

Transportation 
: Rs. 
5,000/-

Damages to clothes & Articles : Rs. 
1,000/-


178 

---------------------
Total : Rs.18,58,929/-
---------------------

89. C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, is partly allowed. Subsequent to the 

above, there shall be a reduction of Rs.42,600/-. Record of proceedings 

shows that on 08.04.2015, this Court, in M.P.No.1 of 2015, granted 

interim stay of the operation of the impugned judgment in 

M.C.O.P.No.253 of 2014, dated 10.09.2014, on the file of the Motor 

Accident Claims Tribunal, Special District Court, Dharmapuri, subject to 

the condition that the appellant-Insurance Company deposits 75% of the 

award amount. Therefore, the appellant-Insurance Company is directed 

to deposit the balance amount, with proportionate interest, at the rate of

90. C.M.A.No.3273 of 2015 is dismissed. Subsequent to the 

above, there shall be an increase of compensation of Rs.2,29,733/-. 

Record of proceedings shows that on 26.11.2014, this Court, in M.P.No.1 

of 2014, granted interim stay of the operation of the impugned judgment 


179 

in M.C.O.P.No.549 of 2012, dated 31.10.2013, on the file of the Motor 

Accident Claims Tribunal, Additional District Court, Dharmapuri, subject 

to the condition that the appellant-Insurance Company deposits 75% of 

the award amount. Therefore, the appellant-Insurance Company is 

directed to deposit the balance amount, with proportionate interest, at 

the rate of 7.5% from the date of claim, till payment, to the credit of 

M.C.O.P.No.549 of 2012, on the file of the Motor Accident Claims 

Tribunal, Additional District Court, Dharmapuri, within a period of four 

weeks, from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. 

91. C.M.A.No.2386 of 2015 is dismissed. Subsequent to the 

above, there shall be an increase of compensation of Rs.2,48,929/-. 

Therefore, the appellant-Insurance Company is directed to deposit the 

amount, now determined by this Court, with proportionate interest, at 

the rate of 7.5% from the date of claim, till payment, to the credit of 

M.C.O.P.No.4193 of 2011, on the file of the Motor Accidents Claims 

Tribunal, (2 nd Court of Small Causes), Chennai, within a period of four
