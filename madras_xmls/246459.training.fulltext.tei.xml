	</head>

	<p>C.M.A.No.3273 of 2014 is preferred by M/s.Royal Sundaram Alliance<lb/>
 Insurance Co. Ltd., Salem, challenging the compensation of<lb/>
 Rs.25,61,000/-, awarded to legal representatives of the deceased, in<lb/>
 M.C.O.P.No.549 of 2012, dated 31.10.2013, on the file of the Motor<lb/>
 Accident Claims Tribunal, Additional District Court, Dharmapuri.<lb/>
</p>

<p>2.<lb/>
 In C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, M/s.Royal Sundaram Alliance<lb/>
 Insurance Co. Ltd., Salem, has challenged the award made in<lb/>
 M.C.O.P.No.253 of 2014, dated 10.09.2014, by which, the Motor Accident<lb/>
 Claims Tribunal, Special District Court, Dharmapuri, has awarded<lb/>
 Rs.18,82,600/-with interest, at the rate of 7.5% per annum, from the<lb/>
 date of claim, till the date of realisation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>3.<lb/>
 In C.M.A.No.2386 of 2015, the Managing Director,<lb/>
 Metropolitan Transport Corporation (Chennai) Ltd., Chennai, has filed an<lb/>
 appeal, with a delay of 20 days, challenging the award made in<lb/>
 M.C.O.P.No.4193 of 2011, dated 22.08.2014, on the file of the Motor<lb/>
 Accident Claims Tribunal (2 nd Court of Small Causes), Chennai, by which,<lb/>
 compensation of Rs.16,10,000/-has been awarded to the legal<lb/>
 representatives of the deceased.<lb/>
</p>

<p>4.<lb/>
 In all the appeals, the common issue, raised by the Insurance<lb/>
 Company as well as the Transport Corporation, is that the Tribunals,<lb/>
 while passing awards, as stated supra, have erred in fixing the monthly<lb/>
 income of the deceased, in each of the appeals and should not add up<lb/>
 income, under the head, future prospects, for the purpose of computing<lb/>
 compensation to be paid to the family of the deceased. Contentions have<lb/>
 been raised that except in the case of salaried persons, where there is a<lb/>
 permanent source of income, there should not be any addition, towards<lb/>
 future prospects, for computing the loss of contribution to the bereaved<lb/>
 family.<lb/>
</p>

<p>5.<lb/>
 On the contra, it is the contention of the learned counsel for<lb/>
 the respondents/claimants that considering the escalation in the price of<lb/>
 essential commodities, fuel, electricity and other factors, affecting the<lb/>
 living conditions, wages or salary or earning in the case of self-employed<lb/>
 has increased, and hence, the Tribunals/Courts should add up income,<lb/>
 under the head, future prospects, while computing compensation. On<lb/>
 merits, in respect of each of the appeals, arguments have been advanced<lb/>
 that there should be increase in the quantum of compensation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>6.<lb/>
 Reference has also been made to the judgments of the Apex<lb/>
 Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd., v. Pushpa [SLP(C)No.8058 of<lb/>
 2014, dated 31.10.2013] and Shashikala v. Gangalakshmamma reported<lb/>
 in 2015 (3) MLJ 373 (Decided on 13.03.2015), where a Hon&apos;ble Division<lb/>
 Bench of the Supreme Court has sought for reference, in the matter of<lb/>
 adding up a percentage of income, under the head, future prospects and<lb/>
 based on the above reference, contentions have been made. Per contra,<lb/>
 it is the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents/claimants,<lb/>
 future prospects have been considered in Kalpanaraj v. Tamil Nadu State<lb/>
 Transport Corporation reported in 2015 (2) SCC 764 (decided on<lb/>
 22.04.2014) and therefore, there is no error, in cases, where, future<lb/>
 prospects have been considered.<lb/>
 On the issue raised in the appeals, as to whether, the Tribunals can<lb/>
 award compensation, by adding up certain percentage of income under<lb/>
 the head, future prospects, we propose to dispose of the appeals, by a<lb/>
 common order, besides considering each case, on its merits.<lb/>
</p>

<p>7.<lb/>
 In C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, filed by M/s.Royal Sundaram<lb/>
 Alliance Insurance Co. Ltd., Salem, it is the version of the<lb/>
 respondents/claimants that in the accident, which occurred on<lb/>
 17.11.2012, Muthusamy, a 34 year old man, claimed to have owned a<lb/>
 grocery shop, besides engaged in Agriculture, sustained grievous injuries.<lb/>
 Initially, he was provided treatment in Government Hospital, Dharmapuri<lb/>
 and thereafter, referred to Mohan Kumaramangalam Hospital, Salem. He<lb/>
 was inpatient between 17.11.2012 and 23.11.2012. Despite intensive<lb/>
 treatment, he died. Wife, aged 27 years, minor son, aged 12 years, minor<lb/>
 daughter, aged 10 years and parents, aged 55 and 65 years, have<lb/>
 preferred a claim petition in M.C.O.P.No.131 of 2013, before the District<lb/>
 Court, Dharmapuri, claiming compensation of Rs.15,00,000/-. The said<lb/>
 claim petition has subsequently been transferred to the Motor Accident<lb/>
 Claims Tribunal (Special District Court), Dharmapuri and re-numbered as<lb/>
 M.C.O.P.No.253 of 2014.<lb/>
</p>

<p>8.<lb/>
 Before the Tribunal, the claim of the respondents/claimants<lb/>
 was that at the time of accident, Muthusamy was aged 34 years. He<lb/>
 owned a grocery shop, besides engaging in Agriculture and earned<lb/>
 Rs.8,000/-per month. There was no income proof. However, upon<lb/>
 perusal of the contents of Ex.P8, Notices (2) sent by the Syndicate Bank,<lb/>
 Mattalampati to the deceased, Muthusamy, the Tribunal has found that<lb/>
 the said loan had been obtained only for the grocery shop and as he had<lb/>
 defaulted, notices have been issued by the Bank. Upon perusal of Ex.P10,<lb/>
 Patta (2), the Tribunal has also noticed that the deceased owned<lb/>
 agricultural lands. Having regard to the number of dependants, viz., five<lb/>
 and the documents, Exs.P8 and P10, stated supra, the Tribunal came to<lb/>
 the conclusion that the deceased would have earned Rs.8,000/-per<lb/>
 month. Thus, the Tribunal has fixed the monthly income as Rs.8,000/-.<lb/>
</p>

<p>9.<lb/>
 Mr.M.B.Gopalan, learned counsel for the appellants in<lb/>
 C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, contended that the Tribunal has grossly erred in<lb/>
 fixing the monthly income of the deceased as Rs.8,000/-, when there was<lb/>
 no proof for the income and further contended that in such<lb/>
 circumstances, notional income alone ought to have been taken into<lb/>
 account, for the purpose of computing the loss of contribution of the<lb/>
 family.<lb/>
</p>

<p>10. Ex.P8, Notices (2) sent by the Syndicate Bank, Mattalampati<lb/>
 to the deceased, for recovery of the loan borrowed for the grocery shop,<lb/>
 support the case of the respondents/claimants, as regards the avocation<lb/>
 claimed. From the said business, one could reasonably expect that he<lb/>
 would have earned Rs.5,000/-to Rs.7,000/-per month. Ex.P10, Patta (2),<lb/>
 indicates that the deceased owned and possessed agricultural lands. The<lb/>
 accident occurred in Dharmapuri District.<lb/>
</p>

<p>11. During the course of hearing, Mr.S.Sathiaseelan, learned<lb/>
 counsel for the respondents/claimants submitted that the extent of land<lb/>
 covered under Ex.P10, was four acres. Even taking it for granted, there is<lb/>
 a diminution in agricultural income, considering the extent of land, stated<lb/>
 to have owned and possessed by the deceased and the agricultural<lb/>
 activity, the possibility of augmenting some more income, from the<lb/>
 agricultural lands, cannot be ruled out.<lb/>
</p>

<p>12. But placing reliance on a decisions in Syed Sadiq etc. Vs.<lb/>
 Division Manager, United India Insurance Company Limited reported in<lb/>
 2014(1) TNMAC 459, Mr.S.Sathiaseelan, learned counsel for the<lb/>
 respondents/claimants submitted that he has no objection, for the<lb/>
 income being fixed at Rs.6,500/-, as done by the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court, in<lb/>
 the above reported judgment, in the case of a vegetable vendor. In the<lb/>
 reported case, the accident occurred in the year 2008 and the Apex Court<lb/>
 fixed the monthly income as Rs.6,500/-. In the present case, the<lb/>
 accident occurred on 20.02.2012. At the time of accident, the deceased<lb/>
 was aged 34 years. There is no quarrel over the determination of the age,<lb/>
 done as per the entry in Ex.P3 -Post-Mortem Certificate and such<lb/>
 determination is also supported by declaration in the claim petition and<lb/>
 fortified by the decisions of the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in Fakeerappa v.<lb/>
 Karnataka Cement Pipe Factory reported in 2004 (4) LW 20 and The<lb/>
 Managing Director, Tamilnadu State Transport Corporation, Madurai v.<lb/>
 Mary [2005 (5) CTC 515].<lb/>
</p>

<p>13. By determining the monthly income as Rs.8,000/-and<lb/>
 thereafter, adding 30% of the monthly income, towards future prospects<lb/>
 and after deducting 1/4 th towards the personal and living expenses and by<lb/>
 application of &apos;16&apos; multiplier, the Tribunal has computed the loss of<lb/>
 contribution to the family as Rs.14,97,600/-. In addition to the above, the<lb/>
 Claims Tribunal has awarded Rs.50,000/-each, under the head, loss of<lb/>
 love and affection, to each of the claimants, which works out to<lb/>
 Rs.2,50,000/-. Under the head, loss of consortium, to the 1 st<lb/>
 respondent/claimant, the Claims Tribunal has awarded Rs.1,00,000/-. In<lb/>
 addition to the above, the Claims Tribunal has awarded Rs.10,000/-<lb/>
towards transportation and Rs.25,000/-towards Funeral Expenses. In all,<lb/>
 the Tribunal has awarded Rs.18,82,600/-as total compensation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>14. Though in C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, it is the objection of<lb/>
 M/s.Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Co. Ltd., Salem that the Tribunal<lb/>
 ought not to have added up 30% towards future prospects, considering the<lb/>
 age of the deceased, 34 years and the number of dependents, it is the<lb/>
 contrary contention of Mr.S.Sathieseelan, the learned counsel for the<lb/>
 respondents/claimants that the Tribunal ought to have added 50%<lb/>
 towards future prospects, while determining the monthly income. It is<lb/>
 also his contention that compensation awarded under the heads, loss of<lb/>
 love and affection and the loss of contribution to the family, should be<lb/>
 enhanced, as the compensation awarded by the Tribunal, under the above<lb/>
 heads, is not just. He also submitted that before the death, the deceased<lb/>
 was hospitalised in Mohan Kumaramangalam Hospital, Salem, between<lb/>
 17.11.2012 and 23.11.2012 and underwent surgery and therefore, the<lb/>
 Tribunal ought to have awarded compensation, under the head, pain and<lb/>
 suffering, to the respondents/claimants.<lb/>
</p>

<p>15. In C.M.A.No.3273 of 2014, the accident has occurred on<lb/>
 20.02.2015. Govindasamy, rider of a Motor Cycle (Hero Honda), bearing<lb/>
 Registration No.TN 29 AJ 0410, aged about 35 years, died. He was stated<lb/>
 to be a lorry owner cum driver. Wife, aged 22 years, parents, aged 58 and<lb/>
 60 years and daughters, aged 42 and 37 years, respectively, have<lb/>
 preferred a claim for compensation of Rs.15,00,000/-.<lb/>
</p>

<p>16. To support the contention that the deceased owned a lorry,<lb/>
 bearing Registration No.TN 30 S 5400, Ex.P10, document has been<lb/>
 marked. Upon perusal of the same, the Claims Tribunal has observed that<lb/>
 the deceased had purchased the said lorry from one Gomathi. Going<lb/>
 through Ex.P11, the Tribunal has also found that the permit in the name<lb/>
 of Gomathi had been transferred in the name of Govindasamy. Ex.P12 is<lb/>
 the driving licence of the deceased and Ex.P13 is the Pan Card. Thus,<lb/>
 after considering the abovesaid documents, marked on the side of the<lb/>
 respondents/claimants, the Claims Tribunal has arrived at the conclusion<lb/>
 that the deceased was a lorry owner cum driver.<lb/>
</p>

<p>17. PW.1, wife of the deceased, has deposed that the deceased<lb/>
 earned Rs.20,000/-per month. But the Tribunal, fixed the same, only as<lb/>
 Rs.15,000/-per month, and adding up 30% towards future prospects,<lb/>
 fixed the monthly income at Rs.19,500/-for computing the loss of<lb/>
 contribution to the family. Sisters were not awarded any compensation.<lb/>
 The number of dependants were reduced to three. The Tribunal applied<lb/>
 &apos;16&apos; multiplier, as per the 2 nd Schedule to Section 163-A of the Motor<lb/>
 Vehicles Act and deducted 1/3 rd towards the personal and living expenses<lb/>
 of the deceased and accordingly, computed the loss of contribution to the<lb/>
 family, as Rs.24,96,000/-(Rs.19,500 x 16 x 12 x 1/3).<lb/>
</p>

<p>18. In addition to the above, the Claims Tribunal has awarded<lb/>
 Rs.10,000/-each to the wife and parents, under the head loss of love and<lb/>
 affection. Rs.5,000/-is awarded towards Funeral Expenses and another<lb/>
 sum of Rs.5,000/-under the head, transportation. The Tribunal has<lb/>
 awarded Rs.25,000/-as loss of consortium. Altogether, the Claims<lb/>
 Tribunal has awarded Rs.25,61,000/-, with interest, and apportioned the<lb/>
 compensation, stating that the wife would be entitled to Rs.8,70,334/-<lb/>
and the parents would be entitled to Rs.8,45,333/-each.<lb/>
</p>

<p>19. Here again, the contention of M/s.Royal Sundaram Alliance<lb/>
 Insurance Co. Ltd., Salem, is that the Claims Tribunal has erred in fixing<lb/>
 the monthly income of the deceased, as Rs.15,000/-, without any<lb/>
 evidence and also erred in adding up 30% of the future prospects, which is<lb/>
 not warranted, when determination of the monthly income of the<lb/>
 deceased itself, is without proof and excessive.<lb/>
</p>

<p>20. On the determination of monthly income of Rs.15,000/-,<lb/>
 Mr.G.K.Sekar, learned counsel for the respondents/claimants submitted<lb/>
 that the monthly income of the deceased fixed by the Tribunal as<lb/>
 Rs.15,000/-, by operating a lorry with a national permit, by the owner-<lb/>
cum-driver, cannot be said to be without any basis and more so, when<lb/>
 Ex.P11 -Transfer of Permit, Ex.P12 -Driving Licence and Ex.P13 -Pan<lb/>
 Card, have been produced before the Tribunal, to support the contention<lb/>
 of avocation and income.<lb/>
</p>

<p>21. It is also the contention of the learned counsel for the<lb/>
 respondents/claimants that as the deceased was aged 35 years, the<lb/>
 Tribunal ought to have added 50% towards future prospects, for<lb/>
 determining the loss of dependency. He also prayed for suitable<lb/>
 enhancement of compensation, under the heads, loss of consortium, loss<lb/>
 of love and affection and funeral expenses. He pointed out that there is<lb/>
 no award for conventional damages. For the abovesaid reasons, he prayed<lb/>
 this Court to grant a reasonable compensation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>22. In C.M.A.No.2386 of 2015, that on 28.07.2011, about 05.20<lb/>
 P.M., the deceased, B.Yasodha, aged about 53 years, was waiting at<lb/>
 Thiruvotiyur bus stop, near Railway Gate, to go to her home and a bus,<lb/>
 bearing Registration No.TN 01 N 5614, owned by the appellant-Transport<lb/>
 Corporation, came from East to West direction, and stopped near the<lb/>
 Railway Gate. When the deceased was boarding the bus, without noticing<lb/>
 her, the driver suddenly started the bus, in a rash and negligent manner,<lb/>
 due to which, she fell down from the bus and sustained grievous injuries,<lb/>
 which resulted in death. In this regard, a case in Cr.No.144/H1/2011, has<lb/>
 been registered against the driver of the bus, on the file of H-1 Traffic<lb/>
 Investigation Washermenpet Range.<lb/>
</p>

<p>23. Though the appellant-Transport Corporation has defended<lb/>
 negligence, attributed against the driver of the bus, by stating that when<lb/>
 the driver stopped the bus, near the Railway Gate, the deceased<lb/>
 attempted to board the moving bus, through the front door, upon<lb/>
 evaluation of pleadings and evidence, the Claims Tribunal has rejected<lb/>
 the said defence and held that the driver of the bus, was negligent in<lb/>
 causing the accident.<lb/>
</p>

<p>24. Perusal of the impugned judgment shows that to prove the<lb/>
 manner of accident, PW.1, Mr.B.Thanga, has adduced evidence and<lb/>
 marked Ex.P1 -FIR in Cr.No.144/H1/2011, registered against the driver of<lb/>
 the bus, on the file of H-1 Traffic Investigation Washermenpet Range.<lb/>
 PW.2, Mr.Ramesh, stated to have witnessed the accident, has supported<lb/>
 the manner of accident. Though RW.1, driver of the bus, has deposed<lb/>
 that at the time of accident, the deceased, who attempted to board the<lb/>
 moving bus, lost her grip, fell down and succumbed to the fatal injuries<lb/>
 and that there was a case of contributory negligence, the Claims<lb/>
 Tribunal, by observing that the testimony of PW.2, eye-witness, was<lb/>
 cogent and nothing has been elicited, in his cross-examination to discredit<lb/>
 his reliability and held that it was RW.1, driver of the bus, was negligent<lb/>
 in causing the accident.<lb/>
</p>

<p>25. Though in the present appeal, the appellant-Transport<lb/>
 Corporation has contended that the Claims Tribunal has erred in fixing<lb/>
 negligence on the driver of the bus, when the accident occurred only due<lb/>
 to the negligence of the deceased, this Court is not inclined to accept the<lb/>
 same, for the reason that it is the fundamental duty of the crew viz.,<lb/>
 driver and conductor to see whether any passenger is getting into the bus<lb/>
 or getting down from the bus before moving the bus. It is also the duty of<lb/>
 the driver and conductor to caution the passengers when they attempt to<lb/>
 get down, irrespective of the fact whether that place is a bus stop or not.<lb/>
 Reference can be made to the decisions made in Venkataswami Motor<lb/>
 Service v. C.K.Chinnaswamy and others [1998 ACJ 371],<lb/>
 M.Jagannathan v. Pallavan Transport Corporation Ltd., [1999 ACJ 366]<lb/>
 and Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Madurai Division III) Ltd.<lb/>
 v. Saraswathi and four others [2000 (1) LW 318].<lb/>
</p>

<p>26. It is settled law that in matters relating to Motor Accidents<lb/>
 Claims, it is sufficient that there is preponderance of probability to the<lb/>
 manner of accident and strict proof of evidence is not required. In the<lb/>
 instant case, no concrete material is available to reverse the order of the<lb/>
 Tribunal. On the other hand, there is ample evidence to conclude that<lb/>
 the accident had occurred in the manner as detailed by the claimant.<lb/>
 Therefore, the finding of the Tribunal regarding negligence is confirmed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>27. On the quantum of compensation, it was the claimed by the<lb/>
 respondents/claimant that the deceased was aged 53 years, but there is<lb/>
 no documentary evidence. However, the Claims Tribunal, upon perusal of<lb/>
 the entires made in Ex.P2 -Post-Mortem Certificate, fixed the age of the<lb/>
 deceased as 54 years, at the time of accident. Before the Claims<lb/>
 Tribunal, the respondents/claimants have filed Ex.P4 -Legal Heirs<lb/>
 Certificate and upon perusal of the same, the Claims Tribunal satisfied<lb/>
 itself that the respondents/claimants are the sons and daughters of the<lb/>
 deceased. However, during the pendency of the claim petition, the 3 rd<lb/>
 claimant, B.Sathya, died on 29.10.2012 and his death certificate has been<lb/>
 marked as Ex.P7. Therefore, the Claims Tribunal has come to the<lb/>
 conclusion that the respondents 1, 2, 4 &amp; 5/claimants are entitled to<lb/>
 compensation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>28. Before the Claims Tribunal, it was the contention of the<lb/>
 respondents/claimants that the deceased was a Senior Factory Assistant<lb/>
 in Tamil Nadu Co-operative Milk Federation Limited and earned<lb/>
 Rs.18,900/-per month. As per Ex.P6 -Pay Slip, for the month of April,<lb/>
 2011, the gross income of the deceased was Rs.18,900.40ps. Upon perusal<lb/>
 of the same, the Claims Tribunal has noticed that deductions were not<lb/>
 mentioned clearly and no signature was there. To prove the income, no<lb/>
 employer was examined. Therefore, the Claims Tribunal has fixed the<lb/>
 monthly income at Rs.15,000/-. Having regard to the age of the<lb/>
 deceased, 54 years, as per Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation<lb/>
 Ltd., reported in 2009 (2) TNMAC 1, the Tribunal applied &apos;11&apos; multiplier<lb/>
 and computed the dependency compensation, by deducting 1/4 th towards<lb/>
 the personal and living expenses of the deceased. Thus, the Tribunal has<lb/>
 arrived the pecuniary loss at Rs.14,85,000/-.<lb/>
</p>

<p>29.<lb/>
 That apart, the Claims Tribunal has awarded Rs.1,00,000/-<lb/>
as compensation, under the head, loss of love and affection to the<lb/>
 respondents/claimants. A sum of Rs.25,000/-is awarded under the head,<lb/>
 funeral expenses. Altogether, the Claims Tribunal has awarded<lb/>
 Rs.16,10,000/-, with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum, from the<lb/>
 date of claim, till deposit.<lb/>
</p>

<p>30. It is the submission of the appellant-Transport Corporation<lb/>
 that even though the deceased had only four years of remaining service,<lb/>
 as per the decision in Sarla Verma&apos;s case (cited supra), the Tribunal has<lb/>
 applied a higher multiplier of &apos;11&apos; and computed the loss of contribution<lb/>
 to the family and therefore, no further addition of income is required.<lb/>
</p>

<p>31. Learned counsel for the respondents/claimants submitted<lb/>
 that 10% income ought to have been added, while computing the loss of<lb/>
 contribution to the family. He has sought for enhancement under the<lb/>
 head, loss of love and affection and prayed for a higher compensation,<lb/>
 towards transportation and damages to clothes and articles.<lb/>
</p>

<p>32. The main issue addressed in the present appeals, is whether,<lb/>
 the legal representatives of the deceased, self-employed, can seek for<lb/>
 determination of income, by adding up certain percentage of income,<lb/>
 under the head, future prospects, while computing the loss of<lb/>
 contribution of the bereaved family. There are other issues of awarding<lb/>
 lesser compensation under other heads.<lb/>
</p>

<p>33. Let us consider the line of the judgments, dealing with the<lb/>
 determination of income and the addition component, future prospects.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(i)<lb/>
 In Smt.Sarla Verma &amp; Ors. v. Delhi Transport Corporation<lb/>
 and another reported in 2009 (2) TNMAC 1 (SC), (Decided on<lb/>
 15.04.2009 by two Judges Bench) at Paragraphs 10 and 11, the Hon&apos;ble<lb/>
 Supreme Court held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;Question (i) -addition to income for future<lb/>
 prospects:<lb/>
</item>

<item>10. Generally the actual income of the deceased less<lb/>
 income tax should be the starting point for calculating the<lb/>
 compensation. The question is whether actual income at<lb/>
 the time of death should be taken as the income or<lb/>
 whether any addition should be made by taking note of<lb/>
 future prospects. In Susamma Thomas, this Court held that<lb/>
 the future prospects of advancement in life and career<lb/>
 should also be sounded in terms of money to augment the<lb/>
 multiplicand (annual contribution to the dependants); and<lb/>
 that where the deceased had a stable job, the court can<lb/>
 take note of the prospects of the future and it will be<lb/>
 unreasonable to estimate the loss of dependency on the<lb/>
 actual income of the deceased at the time of death. In<lb/>
 that case, the salary of the deceased, aged 39 years at the<lb/>
 time of death, was Rs.1032/-per month. Having regard to<lb/>
 the evidence in regard to future prospects, this Court was of<lb/>
 the view that the higher estimate of monthly income could<lb/>
 be made at Rs.2000/-as gross income before deducting the<lb/>
 personal living expenses. The decision in Susamma Thomas<lb/>
 was followed in Sarla Dixit v. Balwant Yadav [1996 (3) SCC<lb/>
 179], where the deceased was getting a gross salary of<lb/>
 Rs.1543/-per month. Having regard to the future prospects<lb/>
 of promotions and increases, this Court assumed that by the<lb/>
 time he retired, his earning would have nearly doubled, say<lb/>
 Rs.3000/-. This court took the average of the actual income<lb/>
 at the time of death and the projected income if he had<lb/>
 lived a normal life period, and determined the monthly<lb/>
 income as Rs.2200/-per month. In Abati Bezbaruah v. Dy.<lb/>
 Director General, Geologicial Survey of India [2003 (3) SCC<lb/>
 148], as against the actual salary income of Rs.42,000/-per<lb/>
 annum, (Rs.3500/-per month) at the time of accident, this<lb/>
 court assumed the income as Rs.45,000/-per annum, having<lb/>
 regard to the future prospects and career advancement of<lb/>
 the deceased who was 40 years of age.<lb/>
</item>

<item>11. In General Manager, Kerala State Road Transport<lb/>
 Corporation v. Susamma Thomas, [1994 (2) SCC 176], this<lb/>
 Court increased the income by nearly 100%, in Sarla Dixit,<lb/>
 the income was increased only by 50% and in Abati<lb/>
 Bezbaruah the income was increased by a mere 7%. In view<lb/>
 of imponderables and uncertainties, we are in favour of<lb/>
 adopting as a rule of thumb, an addition of 50% of actual<lb/>
 salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards<lb/>
 future prospects, where the deceased had a permanent<lb/>
 job and was below 40 years. [Where the annual income is<lb/>
 in the taxable range, the words `actual salary&apos; should be<lb/>
 read as `actual salary less tax&apos;]. The addition should be<lb/>
 only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years.<lb/>
 There should be no addition, where the age of deceased is<lb/>
 more than 50 years. Though the evidence may indicate a<lb/>
 different percentage of increase, it is necessary to<lb/>
 standardize the addition to avoid different yardsticks<lb/>
 being applied or different methods of calculations being<lb/>
 adopted. Where the deceased was self-employed or was<lb/>
 on a fixed salary (without provision for annual increments<lb/>
 etc.), the courts will usually take only the actual income<lb/>
 at the time of death. A departure therefrom should be<lb/>
 made only in rare and exceptional cases involving special<lb/>
 circumstances.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>(ii) The Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in R.K.Malik v. Kiran Pal reported in<lb/>
 2009 (1) TNMAC 593 (SC) (Decided on 15.05.2009 by two Judges Bench),<lb/>
 standardised the payment of compensation for the death of children, upto<lb/>
 the age of 18 years, by applying different multipliers, taking the notional<lb/>
 income of Rs.15,000/-per annum. The quantum of compensation towards<lb/>
 non-pecuniary loss of Rs.75,000/-and a further compensation of<lb/>
 Rs.75,000/-for future prospects, remain the same, irrespective of the<lb/>
 age group. In the reported case, the accident occurred on 18.11.1997,<lb/>
 when a School bus, carrying school children, breaking the railing, got<lb/>
 drowned in Yamuna river at Wazirabad Yamuna Bridge, killing 29 children.<lb/>
 Though all the legal representatives of the deceased filed separate claims,<lb/>
 under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the Tribunal, by its<lb/>
 common award, dated 06.12.2004, awarded a sum of Rs.1,55,000/-to the<lb/>
 dependents of children between the age group of 10 to 15 years and<lb/>
 Rs.1,65,000/-between 15 to 18 years. Three of the children, viz., Kailash<lb/>
 Rathi, Neena Jain and Jatish Sharma were less than 10 years. In the case of<lb/>
 Kailash Rathi, compensation of Rs.1,05,000/-was awarded and in the cases<lb/>
 of Neena Jain and Jatish Sharma, compensation of Rs.1,30,000/-and<lb/>
 Rs.1,31,000/-respectively was awarded. In addition to the above,<lb/>
 Rs.1,000/-was awarded in the case of Jatish Sharma, as in some other<lb/>
 cases, for loss of books. The Tribunal has awarded Rs.5,000/-each towards<lb/>
 funeral and last rites. While computing dependency compensation,<lb/>
 Rs.5,000/-was deducted towards personal living expenses, after applying<lb/>
 &apos;15&apos; multiplier for children, below 15 years and &apos;16&apos; multiplier for children,<lb/>
 between 16 and 18 years respectively. While considering the aspect, as to<lb/>
 how, the quantum of compensation to be arrived at, by the Claims<lb/>
 Tribunals/Courts, the Apex Court in R.K.Malik&apos;s case, at Paragraphs 10 to 12<lb/>
 and 14, held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;10. Undoubtedly, the compensation in law is paid<lb/>
 to restore the person, who has suffered damage or loss in<lb/>
 the same position, if the tortuous act or the breach of<lb/>
 contract had not been committed. The law requires that<lb/>
 the party suffering should be put in the same position, if<lb/>
 the contract had been performed or the wrong had not<lb/>
 been committed. The law in all such matters requires<lb/>
 payment of adequate, reasonable and just monetary<lb/>
 compensation.<lb/>
</item>

<item>11. In cases of motor accidents the endeavour is to<lb/>
 put the dependents/claimants in the pre-accidental<lb/>
 position. Compensation in cases of motor accidents, as in<lb/>
 other matters, is paid for reparation of damages. The<lb/>
 damages so awarded should be adequate sum of money<lb/>
 that would put the party, who has suffered, in the same<lb/>
 position if he had not suffered on account of the wrong.<lb/>
 Compensation is therefore required to be paid for<lb/>
 prospective pecuniary loss i.e. future loss of<lb/>
 income/dependency suffered on account of the<lb/>
 wrongful act.<lb/>
</item>

<item>12. However, no amount of compensation can<lb/>
 restore the lost limb or the experience of pain and<lb/>
 suffering due to loss of life. Loss of a child, life or a<lb/>
 limb can never be eliminated or ameliorated<lb/>
 completely. To put it simply -pecuniary damages<lb/>
 cannot replace a human life or limb lost. Therefore, in<lb/>
 addition to the pecuniary losses, the law recognises<lb/>
 that payment should also be made for non-pecuniary<lb/>
 losses on account of, loss of happiness, pain, suffering<lb/>
 and expectancy of life, etc. The Act provides f or<lb/>
 payment of &quot;just compensation&quot; vide Sections 166 and<lb/>
 168. It is left to the Courts to decide what would be<lb/>
 &quot;just compensation&quot; in facts of a case.<lb/>
</item>

<item>14. For calculating the yearly Loss of Dependency<lb/>
 the starting point is the wages being earned by the<lb/>
 deceased, less his personal and living expenses. This<lb/>
 provides a basic figure. Thereafter, effect is given to the<lb/>
 future prospects of the deceased, inflation and general<lb/>
 price rise that erodes value and the purchasing power<lb/>
 of money.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>Addressing the problem of quantifying the loss in the case of death of<lb/>
 children, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court, at Paragraph 15, observed as<lb/>
 follows:<lb/>
</p>


<item>
	&quot;15. The real problem that arises in the cases of<lb/>
 death of children is that they are not earning at the<lb/>
 time of the accident. In most of the cases they were<lb/>
 still studying and not working. However, under no<lb/>
 stretch of imagination it can be said that the parents,<lb/>
 who are appellants herein, have not suffered any<lb/>
 pecuniary loss. In fact, Loss of Dependency by its very<lb/>
 nature is awarded for prospective or future loss. In this<lb/>
 context, Lord Atkinson aptly observed in Taff Vale Rly.<lb/>
 Co. v. Jenkins , (1911-13) All E.R. 160 as follows:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;In case of the death of an infant, there may have<lb/>
 been no actual pecuniary benefit derived by its parents<lb/>
 during the child&apos;s lifetime. But this will not necessarily bar<lb/>
 the parents&apos; claim and prospective loss will found a valid<lb/>
 claim provided that the parents establish that they had a<lb/>
 reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit if the child<lb/>
 had lived.&quot;<lb/></item><p>
 As regards the assessment of non-pecuniary loss, the Supreme Court, at<lb/>
 Paragraphs 19 to 23, extracted the decisions, as hereunder:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;19.The other issue is with regard to non-pecuniary<lb/>
 compensation to the appellants-dependents on the loss of<lb/>
 human life, loss of company, companionship, happiness, pain<lb/>
 and suffering, loss of expectation of life etc.<lb/>
</item>

<item>20. In the Halsbury&apos;s Laws of England, 4th Edition, Vol.<lb/>
 12, page 446, it has been stated with regard to non-pecuniary<lb/>
 loss as follows:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;Non-pecuniary loss: the pattern.<lb/>
</item>

<p>Damages awarded for pain and suffering and loss of<lb/>
 amenity constitute a conventional sum which is taken to be<lb/>
 the sum which society deems fair, fairness being interpreted<lb/>
 by the Courts in the light of previous decisions. Thus there<lb/>
 has been evolved a set of conventional principles providing a<lb/>
 provisional guide to the comparative severity of different<lb/>
 injuries, and indicating a bracket of damages into which a<lb/>
 particular injury will currently fall. The particular<lb/>
 circumstance of the plaintiff, including his age and any<lb/>
 unusual deprivation he may suffer, is reflected in the actual<lb/>
 amount of the award.<lb/>
 The fall in the value of money leads to a continuing<lb/>
 reassessment of these awards and to periodic reassessments<lb/>
 of damages at certain key points in the pattern where the<lb/>
 disability is readily identifiable and not subject to large<lb/>
 variations in individual cases.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>21. In the case of Ward v. James, (1965) I All E R<lb/>
 563, it was observed:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;Although you cannot give a man so gravely injured<lb/>
 much for his `lost years&apos;, you can, however, compensate him<lb/>
 for his loss during his shortened, span, that is, during his<lb/>
 expected `years of survival&apos;. You can compensate him for his<lb/>
 loss of earnings during that time, and for the cost of<lb/>
 treatment, nursing and attendance. But how can you<lb/>
 compensate him for being rendered a helpless invalid? He<lb/>
 may, owing to brain injury, be rendered unconscious for the<lb/>
 rest of his days, or, owing to a back injury, be unable to rise<lb/>
 from his bed. He has lost everything that makes life<lb/>
 worthwhile. Money is no good to him. Yet Judges and juries<lb/>
 have to do the best they can and give him what they think is<lb/>
 fair. No wonder they find it well nigh insoluble. They are<lb/>
 being asked to calculable. The figure is bound to be for the<lb/>
 most part a conventional sum. The Judges have worked out a<lb/>
 pattern, and they keep it in line with the changes in the<lb/>
 value of money.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>22. The Supreme Court in the case of R.D.Hattangadi<lb/>
 v. Pest Control (India) (P) Ltd., (1995) 1 SCC 551, at page<lb/>
 556, has observed as follows in para 9:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;9. Broadly speaking while fixing an amount of<lb/>
 compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the<lb/>
 damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary<lb/>
 damages and special damages. Pecuniary damages are those<lb/>
 which the victim has actually incurred and which are capable<lb/>
 of being calculated in terms of money; whereas non-<lb/>
pecuniary damages are those which are incapable of being<lb/>
 assessed by arithmetical calculations. In order to appreciate<lb/>
 two concepts pecuniary damages may include expenses<lb/>
 incurred by the claimant: (i) medical attendance; (ii) loss of<lb/>
 earning of profit up to the date of trial; (iii) other material<lb/>
 loss. So far non-pecuniary damages are concerned, they may<lb/>
 include (i) damages for mental and physical shock, pain and<lb/>
 suffering, already suffered or likely to be suffered in future;<lb/>
 (ii) damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life<lb/>
 which may include a variety of matters i.e. on account of<lb/>
 injury the claimant may not be able to walk, run or sit; (iii)<lb/>
 damages for the loss of expectation of life, i.e., on account<lb/>
 of injury the normal longevity of the person concerned is<lb/>
 shortened; (iv) inconvenience, hardship, discomfort,<lb/>
 disappointment, frustration and mental stress in life.&quot;<lb/>
 In this case, the Court awarded non-pecuniary special<lb/>
 damages of Rs. 3, 00,000/-to the claimants.<lb/>
</p>

<p>23. In Common Cause, A Registered Society v. Union<lb/>
 of India (1999) 6 SCC 667 @ page 738, it was observed:<lb/>
 &quot;128. The object of an award of damages is to give the<lb/>
 plaintiff compensation for damage, loss or injury he has<lb/>
 suffered. The elements of damage recognised by law are<lb/>
 divisible into two main groups: pecuniary and non-pecuniary.<lb/>
 While the pecuniary loss is capable of being arithmetically<lb/>
 worked out, the non-pecuniary loss is not so calculable. Non-<lb/>
pecuniary loss is compensated in terms of money, not as a<lb/>
 substitute or replacement for other money, but as a<lb/>
 substitute, what McGregor says, is generally more important<lb/>
 than money: it is the best that a court can do. In Mediana,<lb/>
 Re87 Lord Halsbury, L.C. observed as under:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;How is anybody to measure pain and suffering in<lb/>
 moneys counted? Nobody can suggest that you can by<lb/>
 arithmetical calculation establish what is the exact sum of<lb/>
 money which would represent such a thing as the pain and<lb/>
 suffering which a person has undergone by reason of an<lb/>
 accident.... But nevertheless the law recognises that as a<lb/>
 topic upon which damages may be given.&quot;<lb/></p><p>
 After considering the judgment in Lata Wadwa v. State of Bihar reported<lb/>
 in 2001 ACJ 1735 and M.S. Grewal and another v. Deep Chand Sood<lb/>
 and others (2001) 8 SCC 151, at Paragraph 31, the Apex Court in<lb/>
 R.K.Malik&apos;s case (cited supra) held as follows:<lb/></p><item>
 &quot;31. A forceful submission has been made by the<lb/>
 learned counsels appearing for the claimants-appellants<lb/>
 that both the Tribunal as well as the High Court failed to<lb/>
 consider the claims of the appellants with regard to the<lb/>
 future prospects of the children. It has been submitted<lb/>
 that the evidence with regard to the same has been<lb/>
 ignored by the Courts below. On perusal of the evidence on<lb/>
 record, we find merit in such submission that the Courts<lb/>
 below have overlooked that aspect of the matter while<lb/>
 granting compensation. It is well settled legal principle<lb/>
 that in addition to awarding compensation for pecuniary<lb/>
 losses, compensation must also be granted with regard<lb/>
 to the future prospects of the children. It is incumbent<lb/>
 upon the Courts to consider the said aspect while<lb/>
 awarding compensation. Reliance in this regard may be<lb/>
 placed on the decisions rendered by this Court in General<lb/>
 Manager, Kerala S.R.T.C., v. Susamma Thomas, (1994) 2<lb/>
 SCC 176; Sarla Dixit v. Balwant Yadav, (1996) 3 SCC 179;<lb/>
</item>

<p>and Lata Wadhwa case (supra).&quot;<lb/>
 Ultimately, the Supreme Court in R.K.Malik&apos;s case, awarded Rs.75,000/-<lb/>
towards future prospects, holding that the legal representatives of the<lb/>
 deceased are entitled to be compensated, under the head, &quot;future<lb/>
 prospects&quot;.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(iii) In Reshma Kumar v. Madan Mohan reported in 2009 (2)<lb/>
 TNMAC 36 (SC) : 2009 (13) SCC 422, (Decided on 23.07.2009 by two<lb/>
 Judges&apos; Bench), the following questions have been referred to a Larger<lb/>
 Bench viz., (1) Whether the multiplier specified in the Second Schedule<lb/>
 appended to the Act should be scrupulously applied in all the cases? And<lb/>
 (2) Whether for determination of the multiplicand, the Act provides for<lb/>
 any criterion, particularly as regards determination of future prospects?.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(iv) The consideration in Sarla Verma&apos;s case, while adding a<lb/>
 percentage to the income earned, at the time of death, was, whether,<lb/>
 the deceased had a stable job, advancement in life and career. In Sarla<lb/>
 Verma&apos;s case, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court considered the case of salaried<lb/>
 persons. In the case of non-salaried or self employed or on a fixed salary<lb/>
 (without provision for annual increments etc.), or if he was employed in<lb/>
 unorganized sector, though paid salary or earned wages, whether the<lb/>
 same would be static forever, without any upward revision? In respect of<lb/>
 self-employed, what is the effect of rise in the cost price and the efforts<lb/>
 of the self-employed to generate more income, the above aspects have<lb/>
 been considered in Santhosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd.,<lb/>
 reported in 2012 (6) SCC 421.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(v) In Santhosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., reported in<lb/>
 2012 (6) SCC 421 (Decided on 23.04.2012 by two Judges Bench), the<lb/>
 Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court, held as follows:<lb/></p><item>
 &quot;14. We find it extremely difficult to fathom any<lb/>
 rationale for the observation made in paragraph 24 of the<lb/>
 judgment in Sarla Verma&apos;s case that where the deceased<lb/>
 was self-employed or was on a fixed salary without<lb/>
 provision for annual increment, etc., the Courts will<lb/>
 usually take only the actual income at the time of death<lb/>
 and a departure from this rule should be made only in rare<lb/>
 and exceptional cases involving special circumstances. In<lb/>
 our view, it will be naïve to say that the wages or total<lb/>
 emoluments/income of a person who is self-employed or<lb/>
 who is employed on a fixed salary without provision for<lb/>
 annual increment, etc., would remain the same<lb/>
 throughout his life. The rise in the cost of living affects<lb/>
 everyone across the board. It does not make any<lb/>
 distinction between rich and poor. As a matter of fact, the<lb/>
 effect of rise in prices which directly impacts the cost of<lb/>
 living is minimal on the rich and maximum on those who<lb/>
 are self-employed or who get fixed income/emoluments.<lb/>
 They are the worst affected people. Therefore, they put<lb/>
 extra efforts to generate additional income necessary for<lb/>
 sustaining their families. The salaries of those employed<lb/>
 under the Central and State Governments and their<lb/>
 agencies/instrumentalities have been revised from time to<lb/>
 time to provide a cushion against the rising prices and<lb/>
 provisions have been made for providing security to the<lb/>
 families of the deceased employees. The salaries of those<lb/>
 employed in private sectors have also increased manifold.<lb/>
 Till about two decades ago, nobody could have imagined<lb/>
 that salary of Class IV employee of the Government would<lb/>
 be in five figures and total emoluments of those in higher<lb/>
 echelons of service will cross the figure of rupees one lac.<lb/>
 Although, the wages/income of those employed in<lb/>
 unorganized sectors has not registered a corresponding<lb/>
 increase and has not kept pace with the increase in the<lb/>
 salaries of the Government employees and those<lb/>
 employed in private sectors but it cannot be denied that<lb/>
 there has been incremental enhancement in the income of<lb/>
 those who are self-employed and even those engaged on<lb/>
 daily basis, monthly basis or even seasonal basis. We can<lb/>
 take judicial notice of the fact that with a view to meet<lb/>
 the challenges posed by high cost of living, the persons<lb/>
 falling in the latter category periodically increase the cost<lb/>
 of their labour. In this context, it may be useful to give an<lb/>
 example of a tailor who earns his livelihood by stitching<lb/>
 cloths. If the cost of living increases and the prices of<lb/>
 essentials go up, it is but natural for him to increase the<lb/>
 cost of his labour. So will be the cases of ordinary skilled<lb/>
 and unskilled labour, like, barber, blacksmith, cobbler,<lb/>
 mason etc. Therefore, we do not think that while making<lb/>
 the observations in the last three lines of paragraph 24 of<lb/>
 Sarla Verma&apos;s judgment, the Court had intended to lay<lb/>
 down an absolute rule that there will be no addition in the<lb/>
 income of a person who is self-employed or who is paid<lb/>
 fixed wages. Rather, it would be reasonable to say that a<lb/>
 person who is self-employed or is engaged on fixed wages<lb/>
 will also get 30 per cent increase in his total income over<lb/>
 a period of time and if he / she becomes victim of accident<lb/>
 then the same formula deserves to be applied for<lb/>
 calculating the amount of compensation.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>(vi) In Reshma Kumar v. Madan Mohan reported in 2013 (9) SCC<lb/>
 65 (Decided on 02.04.2013 by three Judges&apos; Bench), while considering<lb/>
 the question, as to whether, for determination of the multiplicand, the<lb/>
 Motor Vehicles Act provides for any criterion, as regards determination of<lb/>
 income towards future prospects, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court, held as<lb/>
 follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;36. The standardization of addition to income for<lb/>
 future prospects shall help in achieving certainty in<lb/>
 arriving at appropriate compensation. We approve the<lb/>
 method that an addition of 50% of actual salary be made<lb/>
 to the actual salary income of the deceased towards<lb/>
 future prospects where the deceased had a permanent job<lb/>
 and was below 40 years and the addition should be only<lb/>
 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and no<lb/>
 addition should be made where the age of the deceased is<lb/>
 more than 50 years. Where the annual income is in the<lb/>
 taxable range, the actual salary shall mean actual salary<lb/>
 less tax. In the cases where the deceased was self-<lb/>
employed or was on a fixed salary without provision for<lb/>
 annual increments, the actual income at the time of death<lb/>
 without any addition to income for future prospects will<lb/>
 be appropriate. A departure from the above principle can<lb/>
 only be justified in extraordinary circumstances and very<lb/>
 exceptional cases.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>(vii) In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh reported in 2013 (9) SCC 54,<lb/>
 (Decided on 12.04.2013 by three Judges&apos; Bench) the Hon&apos;ble Supreme<lb/>
 Court, held that in case of self-employed persons or persons with fixed<lb/>
 wages, the actual income of the deceased must be enhanced for purpose<lb/>
 of computation of compensation: (i) by 50% where his age was below 40<lb/>
 years, (ii) by 30% where he belonged to age group of 40 to 50 years, and<lb/>
 (iii) by 15% where he was between age group of 50 to 60 years. However,<lb/>
 it is observed that no such addition/enhancement permissible where<lb/>
 deceased exceeded the age of 60 years. Relevant paragraph in Rajesh&apos;s<lb/>
 case (cited supra), is extracted hereunder:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;</p>

<item>11. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi&apos;s case (supra)<lb/>
 actually intended to follow the principle in the case of<lb/>
 salaried persons as laid in Sarla Verma&apos;s case (supra) and<lb/>
 to make it applicable also to the self-employed and<lb/>
 persons on fixed wages, it is clarified that the increase in<lb/>
 the case of those groups is not 30% always; it will also<lb/>
 have a reference to the age. In other words, in the case of<lb/>
 self-employed or persons with fixed wages, in case, the<lb/>
 deceased victim was below 40 years, there must be an<lb/>
 addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased<lb/>
 while computing future prospects. Needless to say that<lb/>
 the actual income should be income after paying the tax,<lb/>
 if any. Addition should be 30% in case the deceased was in<lb/>
 the age group of 40 to 50 years.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>(viii) In Syed Sadiq etc. Vs. Division Manager, United India<lb/>
 Insurance Company Limited reported in 2014(1) TNMAC 459 = 2014 (2)<lb/>
 SCC 735 (Decided on 16.01.2014 by two Judges Bench), in the case of a<lb/>
 vegetable vendor, aged 24 years, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court, added 50%<lb/>
 increment, under the head, future prospects. He was stated to have<lb/>
 suffered 85% disablement, due to amputation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(ix) In Sanjay Verma v. Haryana Roadways reported in 2014 (1)<lb/>
 CTC 745 (Decided on 29.01.2014 by three Judges&apos; Bench) the Supreme<lb/>
 Court held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;Though in Sarla Verma (Smt.) and Others vs. Delhi<lb/>
 Transport Corporation and Another [(2009) 6 SCC 121],<lb/>
 this Court had held that in case of a self employed person,<lb/>
 unless there are special and exceptional circumstances, the<lb/>
 annual income at the time of death is to be taken into<lb/>
 account, a Coordinate Bench in Santosh Devi vs. National<lb/>
 Insurance Company Ltd. and Others [(2012) 6 SCC 421] has<lb/>
 taken a different view which is to the following effect:<lb/>
 &quot;14. We find it extremely difficult to fathom any<lb/>
 rationale for the observation made in para 24 of the<lb/>
 judgment in Sarla Verma case that where the deceased was<lb/>
 self-employed or was on a fixed salary without provision for<lb/>
 annual increment, etc., the courts will usually take only the<lb/>
 actual income at the time of death and a departure from this<lb/>
 rule should be made only in rare and exceptional cases<lb/>
 involving special circumstances. In our view, it will be naive<lb/>
 to say that the wages or total emoluments/income of a<lb/>
 person who is self-employed or who is employed on a fixed<lb/>
 salary without provision for annual increment, etc., would<lb/>
 remain the same throughout his life.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>12. The view taken in Santosh Devi (supra) has been<lb/>
 reiterated by a Bench of three Judges in Rajesh and Others<lb/>
 vs. Rajbir Singh and Others [(2013) 9 SCC 54], by holding<lb/>
 as follows:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;8. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi case actually<lb/>
 intended to follow the principle in the case of salaried<lb/>
 persons as laid down in Sarla Verma case and to make it<lb/>
 applicable also to the self-employed and persons on fixed<lb/>
 wages, it is clarified that the increase in the case of those<lb/>
 groups is not 30% always; it will also have a reference to the<lb/>
 age. In other words, in the case of self-employed or persons<lb/>
 with fixed wages, in case, the deceased victim was below 40<lb/>
 years, there must be an addition of 50% to the actual income<lb/>
 of the deceased while computing future prospects. Needless<lb/>
 to say that the actual income should be income after paying<lb/>
 the tax, if any. Addition should be 30% in case the deceased<lb/>
 was in the age group of 40 to 50 years.<lb/>
</item>

<item>9. In Sarla Verma case, it has been stated that in the<lb/>
 case of those above 50 years, there shall be no addition.<lb/>
 Having regard to the fact that in the case of those self-<lb/>
employed or on fixed wages, where there is normally no age<lb/>
 of superannuation, we are of the view that it will only be<lb/>
 just and equitable to provide an addition of 15% in the case<lb/>
 where the victim is between the age group of 50 to 60 years<lb/>
 so as to make the compensation just, equitable, fair and<lb/>
 reasonable. There shall normally be no addition thereafter.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>13. Certain parallel developments will now have to be<lb/>
 taken note of. In Reshma Kumari and Others vs. Madan<lb/>
 Mohan and Another [(2009) 13 SCC 422], a two Judge<lb/>
 Bench of this Court while considering the following questions<lb/>
 took the view that the issue(s) needed resolution by a larger<lb/>
 Bench:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;(1) Whether the multiplier specified in the Second<lb/>
 Schedule appended to the Act should be scrupulously applied<lb/>
 in all the cases?<lb/>
</item>

<item>(2) Whether for determination of the multiplicand, the<lb/>
 Act provides for any criterion, particularly as regards<lb/>
 determination of future prospects?&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>14. Answering the above reference a three Judge<lb/>
 Bench of this Court in Reshma Kumari and Ors. vs. Madan<lb/>
 Mohan and Anr. [(2013) 9 SCC 65 (para 36)] reiterated the<lb/>
 view taken in Sarla Verma (supra) to the effect that in<lb/>
 respect of a person who was on a fixed salary without<lb/>
 provision for annual increments or who was self-employed<lb/>
 the actual income at the time of death should be taken into<lb/>
 account for determining the loss of income unless there are<lb/>
 extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. Though the<lb/>
 expression &quot;exceptional and extraordinary circumstances&quot; is<lb/>
 not capable of any precise definition, in Shakti Devi vs. New<lb/>
 India Insurance Company Limited and Another [(2010) 14<lb/>
 SCC 575] there is a practical application of the aforesaid<lb/>
 principle. The near certainty of the regular employment of<lb/>
 the deceased in a government department following the<lb/>
 retirement of his father was held to be a valid ground to<lb/>
 compute the loss of income by taking into account the<lb/>
 possible future earnings. The said loss of income,<lb/>
 accordingly, was quantified at double the amount that the<lb/>
 deceased was earning at the time of his death.<lb/>
</item>

<item>15. Undoubtedly, the same principle will apply for<lb/>
 determination of loss of income on account of an accident<lb/>
 resulting in the total disability of the victim as in the present<lb/>
 case. Therefore, taking into account the age of the claimant<lb/>
 (25 years) and the fact that he had a steady income, as<lb/>
 evidenced by the income-tax returns, we are of the view<lb/>
 that an addition of 50% to the income that the claimant was<lb/>
 earning at the time of the accident would be justified.&quot;<lb/>

<p>(x) In V.Mekala v. V.Malathi reported in 2014 ACJ 1441 (SC),<lb/>
 (Decided on 25.04.2014 by two Judges Bench), the injured was a<lb/>
 student studying in 11th Standard. While determining the monthly income<lb/>
 of the injured as Rs.10,000/-, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court added 50% of<lb/>
 the income, under the head, future prospects.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(xi) The Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in Shashikala v. Gangalakshmamma<lb/>
 reported in 2015 (3) MLJ 373 (SC) [Decided on 13.03.2015], the Hon&apos;ble<lb/>
 Mrs. Justice R.Banumathi, has considered the decision in In National<lb/>
 Insurance Co. Ltd., v. Pushpa [SLP(C)No.8058 of 2014, dated<lb/>
 31.10.2013] and at Paragraphs 7 to 16, held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;7. Learned counsel for the respondent-insurance<lb/>
 company submitted that in Reshma Kumari &amp; Ors., v. Madan<lb/>
 Mohan &amp; Anr., [2013 (9) SCC 65], this Court has held that<lb/>
 where the deceased was self-employed, it would be<lb/>
 appropriate not to make any addition to income for future<lb/>
 prospects and the High Court rightly declined to make<lb/>
 addition towards future prospects. It was submitted that the<lb/>
 deceased was engaged in the business and was not earning<lb/>
 fixed income and has filed returns for different years<lb/>
 showing different income viz., gross income of Rs.1,08,713/-<lb/>
for the assessment year 2005-06 and Rs.2,02,911/-for the<lb/>
 assessment year 2006-07 which only indicates the disparity in<lb/>
 income of the deceased. To strike a balance, High Court has<lb/>
 rightly taken the average and rightly deducted 10% towards<lb/>
 income tax and other deductions. It was submitted that the<lb/>
 compensation awarded by the High Court is just and<lb/>
 reasonable and no grounds have been made out by the<lb/>
 claimants for enhancement of the compensation whatsoever.<lb/>
</item>

<item>8. I have carefully considered the rival contentions and<lb/>
 perused the impugned judgment as also the award and the<lb/>
 materials on record.<lb/>
</item>

<item>9. The deceased was doing transport business of<lb/>
 supplying newspapers from the Head Office to the other<lb/>
 destinations as per the agreement entered into between the<lb/>
 group of newspapers and himself. It is also not in dispute<lb/>
 that the deceased was an income tax assessee and he has<lb/>
 filed income tax returns for the assessment years 2005-06<lb/>
 and 2006-07. The claimants had filed income tax returns of<lb/>
 the deceased for the assessment years 2005-06 and 2006-07<lb/>
 with gross total income of Rs.1,08,713/-and Rs.2,02,911/-<lb/>
respectively including the income from the house property.<lb/>
 Total income of both the years comes to Rs.3,11,624/-and<lb/>
 the High Court has taken the average of it which comes to<lb/>
 Rs.1,55,812/-. High Court deducted 10% of the said amount<lb/>
 towards income-tax and taken the balance amount to<lb/>
 Rs.1,40,231/-. The High Court had further deducted<lb/>
 Rs.2,400/-towards professional tax and income from the<lb/>
 house property shown as Rs.20,000/-and the net income was<lb/>
 calculated at Rs.1,17,831/-. Since the claimants are six in<lb/>
 numbers as per the decision in Sarla Verma &amp; Ors., v. Delhi<lb/>
 Transport Corporation &amp; Anr. [2009 (6) SCC 121], one-<lb/>
fourth(1/4th ) deduction was made towards personal<lb/>
 expenses. The loss of dependency was thus calculated at<lb/>
 Rs.88,373/-. Taking the age of deceased at 45 years, the<lb/>
 High Court adopted multiplier 14 and calculated the total<lb/>
 loss of dependency at Rs.12,37,222/-.<lb/>
</item>

<item>10. The deceased was aged 45 years and was doing<lb/>
 transport business. Though the claimants have filed income<lb/>
 tax returns for two assessment years 2005-06 and 2006-07, as<lb/>
 per the income tax returns for the year 2006-07, the income<lb/>
 of the assessee was Rs.2,02,911/-. Tribunal did not take the<lb/>
 income of the deceased for the assessment year 2006-07 on<lb/>
 the ground that only xerox copy was filed and the claimants<lb/>
 have failed to examine income-tax authorities to prove the<lb/>
 same. Instead of taking the income of the deceased as per<lb/>
 the assessment year 2006-07, the High Court has chosen to<lb/>
 calculate the average of the income for two assessment<lb/>
 years 2005-06 and 2006-07. Considering the age of the<lb/>
 deceased and the nature of business he was doing, in my<lb/>
 considered view, the High Court was not justified in so taking<lb/>
 the average of income of the two assessment years. The<lb/>
 deceased was aged 45 years and doing business. Admittedly,<lb/>
 he was also owning agricultural lands. Even though<lb/>
 agricultural income was not shown in the income tax return,<lb/>
 it emerges from the evidence that the deceased was also<lb/>
 doing agricultural work.<lb/>
</item>

<item>11. On behalf of the claimants, reliance was placed<lb/>
 upon Rajesh&apos;s case (supra) to contend that even in the case<lb/>
 of self-employed persons or persons with fixed wages, there<lb/>
 must be an addition to the income of the deceased towards<lb/>
 future prospects. In Sarla Verma&apos;s case (supra), this Court<lb/>
 held that in case of salaried persons additions have to be<lb/>
 made depending upon the age of the deceased to the actual<lb/>
 income of the deceased while computing future prospects. In<lb/>
 Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company Ltd., &amp; Ors.,<lb/>
 [2012 (6) SCC 421]. Sarla Verma was explained and it was<lb/>
 held that the benefit of making addition to total income of<lb/>
 persons who are self-employed or getting fixed wages was<lb/>
 permissible.<lb/>
</item>

<item>12. The principles laid down in Santosh Devi&apos;s case<lb/>
 (supra) were reiterated in Rajesh and Ors., v. Rajbit Singh<lb/>
 &amp; Ors., [2012 (6) SCC 421], wherein this Court held that the<lb/>
 case of self-employed persons or persons with fixed wages,<lb/>
 the actual income of the deceased must be enhanced for<lb/>
 purpose of computation viz.(i) by 50% where his age was<lb/>
 below 40 years; (ii) by 30% where he belonged to age group<lb/>
 of 40 to 50 years, and (iii) by 15% where he was between age<lb/>
 group of 50 to 60 years. However, it was observed that no<lb/>
 such addition/enhancement was permissible where deceased<lb/>
 exceeded the age of 60 years. Further, in Rajesh (supra), this<lb/>
 Court while reiterating the meaning of &quot;just compensation&quot;<lb/>
 with reference to settled principles observed that, at the<lb/>
 time of fixing such compensation, the court should not<lb/>
 succumb to the niceties or technicalities to grant just<lb/>
 compensation in favour of the claimant. It is the duty of the<lb/>
 court to equate, as far as possible, the misery on account of<lb/>
 the accident with the compensation so that the injured or<lb/>
 the dependants should not face the vagaries of life on<lb/>
 account of discontinuance of the income earned by the<lb/>
 victim, and the court&apos;s duty is to award just, equitable, fair<lb/>
 and reasonable compensation, irrespective of claim made.<lb/>
</item>

<item>13. Considering the question of making addition to the<lb/>
 income of the deceased towards the future prospects in<lb/>
 cases of salaried persons vis--vis in cases where the deceased<lb/>
 was self-employed or on a fixed wage/salary in Reshma<lb/>
 Kumari &amp; Ors., v. Madan Mohan &amp; Anr., [2013 (9) SCC 65],<lb/>
 this Court held as under :-<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;39. The standardization of addition to income for<lb/>
 future prospects shall help in achieving certainty in arriving<lb/>
 at appropriate compensation. We approve the method that<lb/>
 an addition of 50% of actual salary be made to the actual<lb/>
 salary income of the deceased towards future prospects<lb/>
 where the deceased had a permanent job and was below 40<lb/>
 years and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the<lb/>
 deceased was 40 to 50 years and no addition should be made<lb/>
 where the age of the deceased is more than 50 years. Where<lb/>
 the annual income is in the taxable range, the actual salary<lb/>
 shall mean actual salary less tax. In the cases where the<lb/>
 deceased was self-employed or was on a fixed salary without<lb/>
 provision for annual increments, the actual income at the<lb/>
 time of death without any addition to income for future<lb/>
 prospects will be appropriate. A departure from the above<lb/>
 principle can only be justified in extraordinary circumstances<lb/>
 and very exceptional cases.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>14. The decision in Reshma Kumari&apos;s case was<lb/>
 rendered at earlier point of time (2.04.2013) and Rajesh&apos;s<lb/>
 case was pronounced subsequently (12.04.2013). Pointing out<lb/>
 the divergent opinion expressed in the above cases and<lb/>
 expressing the view that regarding the manner of addition of<lb/>
 income for future prospects in case of self-employed or on<lb/>
 fixed<lb/>
 wages<lb/>
 there<lb/>
 should<lb/>
 be<lb/>
 an<lb/>
 authoritative<lb/>
 pronouncement, in National Insurance Co. Ltd., v. Pushpa<lb/>
 [SLP(C)No.16735 of 2014],, the matter has been referred to<lb/>
 a larger Bench by the order dated 2.07.2014, in which one of<lb/>
 us (Hon&apos;ble Mr. Justice V. Gopala Gowda) was a member,<lb/>
 which is pending consideration.<lb/>
</item>

<item>15. Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act enjoins the<lb/>
 courts/tribunals to make award determining the amount of<lb/>
 compensation which appears to be just and reasonable. The<lb/>
 wide amplitude of such power does not empower the tribunal<lb/>
 to determine the compensation arbitrarily, although the Act<lb/>
 is a beneficial legislation, it can neither be allowed as a<lb/>
 source of profit nor as a windfall to the persons affected.<lb/>
 Determination of compensation has to be fair and reasonable<lb/>
 and acceptable by the legal standards. In Nagappa v.<lb/>
 Gurudayal Singh &amp; Ors., [2003 (6) SCC 274], this Court held<lb/>
 as under:-<lb/>
&quot;10. Thereafter, Section 168 empowers the Claims<lb/>
 Tribunal to &quot;make an award determining the amount of<lb/>
 compensation which appears to it to be just&quot;. Therefore, the<lb/>
 only requirement for determining the compensation is that it<lb/>
 must be &quot;just&quot;. There is no other limitation or restriction on<lb/>
 its power for awarding just compensation&quot;.<lb/>
 The same principle was reiterated in the decisions of<lb/>
 Oriental Insurance Company Ltd., v. Mohd. Nasir [2009 (6)<lb/>
 SCC 280] and Ningamma and Anr., v. United India<lb/>
 Insurance Company Ltd., [2009 (13) SCC 710].<lb/>
</item>

<item>16. Without adverting to the issue whether additions<lb/>
 are to be made towards future prospects or not, as it is<lb/>
 obligatory on the part of the Court to award just<lb/>
 compensation, considering the age of the deceased and the<lb/>
 nature of business he was doing, in my view, the income of<lb/>
 the deceased as stated in the income tax return for the year<lb/>
</item>

<item>2006-07 i.e. Rs. 2,02,911/-may be taken as the income of<lb/>
 the deceased. Ten per cent of the said amount i.e.<lb/>
 Rs.20,290/-is to be deducted towards income tax and the<lb/>
 remaining comes to Rs.1,82,620/-. The amount to be<lb/>
 deducted for professional tax is Rs.2,400/-and after<lb/>
 deducting the same, the balance comes out to Rs.1,80,220/-.<lb/>
</item>

<item>The income from the house property for the year 2006-07 is<lb/>
 shown to be Rs.20,000/-and after deducting the same, the<lb/>
 net amount comes to Rs.1,60,220/-. Deducting 1/4th<lb/>
 (one/fourth) towards personal expenses which comes out to<lb/>
 Rs.40,055/-, the loss of dependency/loss of contribution is<lb/>
 arrived at Rs.1,20,165/-per annum.<lb/>
</item>

<p>(xii) In the above reported decision, one of the Hon&apos;ble Judges of<lb/>
 the Apex Court, by following the decision in Reshma Kumari&apos;s case, has<lb/>
 disallowed the claim of addition of a percentage of income, under the<lb/>
 head, &quot;future prospect&quot;. The other Hon&apos;ble Judge (Hon&apos;ble Mr. Justice<lb/>
 Gopala Gowda) in the said decision, has ordered as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;I have perused the judgment written by my learned<lb/>
 Sister Mrs.Justice R. Banumathi in the above-mentioned<lb/>
 matter. I am in respectful agreement with all the points<lb/>
 which are answered in favour of the appellants-claimants,<lb/>
 except for the non-consideration on the question of<lb/>
 making addition to the income of the deceased towards<lb/>
 the future prospects in the case of salaried persons vis-à-<lb/>
vis where the deceased was self employed or on fixed<lb/>
 wages after adverting to the judgments of this Court in<lb/>
 Reshma Kumari &amp; Ors. v. Madan Mohan &amp; Anr. (2013) 9 SCC<lb/>
 65), Rajesh &amp; Ors. v. Rajbir Singh &amp; Ors. ((2013) 9 SCC 54),<lb/>
 the relevant paragraphs of which are extracted hereinafter.<lb/>
</item>

<item>2. After considering the legal principles laid down by<lb/>
 this Court in the case of (1) General Manager, Kerala State<lb/>
 Road Transport Corporation, Trivandrum &amp; Ors. v.<lb/>
 Susamma Thomas &amp; Ors. ((1994) 2 SCC 176); (2) Sarla Dixit<lb/>
 &amp; Anr. v. Balwant Yadav &amp; Ors. ((1996) 3 SCC 179)and (3)<lb/>
 Abati Bezbaruah v. Dy. Director General, Geological<lb/>
 Survey of India &amp; Anr. (2003) 3SCC 148), this Court, on the<lb/>
 question of future prospects in the case of Sarla Verma &amp;<lb/>
 Ors. v. Delhi Transport Corporation &amp; Anr. ((2009) 6 SCC<lb/>
 121)has held as follows:-<lb/>
&quot;24. In Susamma Thomas, this Court increased the<lb/>
 income by nearly 100%, in Sarla Dixit the income was<lb/>
 increased only by 50% and in Abati Bezbaruah the income<lb/>
 was increased by a mere 7%. In view of the imponderables<lb/>
 and uncertainties, we are in favour of adopting as a rule of<lb/>
 thumb, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual<lb/>
 salary income of the deceased towards future prospects,<lb/>
 where the deceased had a permanent job and was below 40<lb/>
 years. (Where the annual income is in the taxable range, the<lb/>
 words &quot;actual salary&quot; should be read as &quot;actual salary less<lb/>
 tax&quot;). The addition should be only 30% if the age of the<lb/>
 deceased was 40 to 50 years. There should be no addition,<lb/>
 where the age of the deceased is more than 50 years.<lb/>
 Though the evidence may indicate a different percentage of<lb/>
 increase, it is necessary to standardise the addition to avoid<lb/>
 different yardsticks being applied or different methods of<lb/>
 calculation being adopted. Where the deceased was self-<lb/>
employed or was on a fixed salary (without provision for<lb/>
 annual increments, etc.), the courts will usually take only<lb/>
 the actual income at the time of death. A departure<lb/>
 therefrom should be made only in rare and exceptional cases<lb/>
 involving special circumstances.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>3. Interestingly, in Reshma Kumari &amp; Ors. (supra),<lb/>
 which was ultimately decided in 2.4.2013 by a three judge<lb/>
 Bench, which arose out of the matter referred by the order<lb/>
 of two judge Bench dated 23.7.2009. That order had<lb/>
 referred two questions:-<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;(1) Whether multiplier specified in the Second<lb/>
 Schedule appended to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for<lb/>
 short &quot;the 1988 Act&quot;) should be scrupulously applied in all<lb/>
 cases? And<lb/>
</item>

<item>(2) Whether for determination of the multiplicand, the<lb/>
 1988 Act provides for any criterion, particularly as regards<lb/>
 determination of future prospect.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>4. The referring Bench (in Reshma Kumari &amp; Ors.-<lb/>
supra) had in fact, envisioned a situation where future<lb/>
 prospects in private employment too, were to be taken into<lb/>
 consideration (although in a slightly different context).<lb/>
 The relevant paragraph of the referring Bench of this<lb/>
 Court in the case of Reshma Kumari &amp; Ors. is extracted<lb/>
 hereunder:-<lb/>
&quot;46. In the Indian context several other factors should<lb/>
 be taken into consideration including education of the<lb/>
 dependants and the nature of job. In the wake of changed<lb/>
 societal conditions and global scenario, future prospects may<lb/>
 have to be taken into consideration not only having regard to<lb/>
 the status of the employee, his educational qualification; his<lb/>
 past performance but also other relevant factors, namely,<lb/>
 the higher salaries and perks which are being offered by the<lb/>
 private companies these days…&quot;<lb/>
 Ultimately, the question of future prospects was decided in<lb/>
 the Larger Bench judgment of this Court in Reshma Kumari&apos;s<lb/>
 case. The relevant paragraph is extracted hereunder:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;39. The standardisation of addition to income for<lb/>
 future prospects shall help in achieving certainty in arriving<lb/>
 at appropriate compensation. We approve the method that<lb/>
 an addition of 50% of actual salary be made to the actual<lb/>
 salary income of the deceased towards future prospects<lb/>
 where the deceased had a permanent job and was below 40<lb/>
 years and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the<lb/>
 deceased was 40 to 50 years and no addition should be made<lb/>
 where the age of the deceased is more than 50 years. Where<lb/>
 the annual income is in the taxable range, the actual salary<lb/>
 shall mean actual salary less tax. In the cases where the<lb/>
 deceased was self-employed or was on a fixed salary without<lb/>
 provision for annual increments, the actual income at the<lb/>
 time of death without any addition to income for future<lb/>
 prospects will be appropriate. A departure from the above<lb/>
 principle can only be justified in extraordinary circumstances<lb/>
 and very exceptional cases.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>5. In Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. &amp;<lb/>
 Ors. ((2012) 6 SCC 421), a two judge Bench of this Court had<lb/>
 earlier doubted the decision with respect to future prospects<lb/>
 in Sarla Verma (supra) and interpreted the limiting of grant<lb/>
 of compensation amount to a person who is self-employed,<lb/>
 privately employed or is engaged on fixed wages if he /she<lb/>
 becomes victim of an accident. The relevant paragraphs as<lb/>
 discussed by this Court in Santosh Devi&apos;s case is extracted<lb/>
 hereunder:-<lb/>
&quot;14. We find it extremely difficult to fathom any<lb/>
 rationale for the observation made in para 24 of the<lb/>
 judgment in Sarla Verma case that where the deceased was<lb/>
 self-employed or was on a fixed salary without provision for<lb/>
 annual increment, etc., the courts will usually take only the<lb/>
 actual income at the time of death and a departure from this<lb/>
 rule should be made only in rare and exceptional cases<lb/>
 involving special circumstances. In our view, it will be naïve<lb/>
 to say that the wages or total emoluments/income of a<lb/>
 person who is self-employed or who is employed on a<lb/>
 fixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc.,<lb/>
 would remain the same throughout his life.<lb/>
</item>

<item>15. The rise in the cost of living affects everyone<lb/>
 across the board. It does not make any distinction<lb/>
 between rich and poor. As a matter of fact, the effect of<lb/>
 rise in prices which directly impacts the cost of living is<lb/>
 minimal on the rich and maximum on those who are self-<lb/>
employed or who get fixed income/emoluments. They are<lb/>
 the worst affected people. Therefore, they put in extra<lb/>
 efforts to generate additional income necessary for<lb/>
 sustaining their families.<lb/>
</item>

<item>16. The salaries of those employed under the Central<lb/>
 and State Governments and their agencies/instrumentalities<lb/>
 have been revised from time to time to provide a cushion<lb/>
 against the rising prices and provisions have been made for<lb/>
 providing security to the families of the deceased<lb/>
 employees. The salaries of those employed in private sectors<lb/>
 have also increased manifold. Till about two decades ago,<lb/>
 nobody could have imagined that salary of Class IV employee<lb/>
 of the Government would be in five figures and total<lb/>
 emoluments of those in higher echelons of service will cross<lb/>
 the figure of rupees one lakh.<lb/>
</item>

<item>17. Although the wages/income of those employed<lb/>
 in unorganised sectors has not registered a corresponding<lb/>
 increase and has not kept pace with the increase in the<lb/>
 salaries of the government employees and those employed<lb/>
 in private sectors, but it cannot be denied that there has<lb/>
 been incremental enhancement in the income of those<lb/>
 who are self-employed and even those engaged on daily<lb/>
 basis, monthly basis or even seasonal basis. We can take<lb/>
 judicial notice of the fact that with a view to meet the<lb/>
 challenges posed by high cost of living, the persons falling<lb/>
 in the latter category periodically increase the cost of<lb/>
 their labour. In this context, it may be useful to give an<lb/>
 example of a tailor who earns his livelihood by stitching<lb/>
 clothes. If the cost of living increases and the prices of<lb/>
 essentials go up, it is but natural for him to increase the<lb/>
 cost of his labour. So will be the cases of ordinary skilled<lb/>
 and unskilled labour, like, barber, blacksmith, cobbler,<lb/>
 mason, etc.<lb/>
</item>

<item>18. Therefore, we do not think that while making the<lb/>
 observations in the last three lines of para 24 of Sarla Verma<lb/>
 judgment, the Court had intended to lay down an absolute<lb/>
 rule that there will be no addition in the income of a person<lb/>
 who is self-employed or who is paid fixed wages. Rather, it<lb/>
 would be reasonable to say that a person who is self-<lb/>
employed or is engaged on fixed wages will also get 30%<lb/>
 increase in his total income over a period of time and if<lb/>
 he/she becomes the victim of an accident then the same<lb/>
 formula deserves to be applied for calculating the amount of<lb/>
 compensation.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>6. In Rajesh &amp; Ors. (supra), a three judge Bench<lb/>
 decision of this Court, which took into consideration the<lb/>
 decisions of this Court in the case of Sarla Verma &amp; Ors. and<lb/>
 Santosh Devi (supra) held thus:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;8. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi case actually<lb/>
 intended to follow the principle in the case of salaried<lb/>
 persons as laid down in Sarla Verma case and to make it<lb/>
 applicable also to the self-employed and persons on fixed<lb/>
 wages, it is clarified that the increase in the case of those<lb/>
 groups is not 30% always; it will also have a reference to the<lb/>
 age. In other words, in the case of self-employed or persons<lb/>
 with fixed wages, in case, the deceased victim was below 40<lb/>
 years, there must be an addition of 50% to the actual income<lb/>
 of the deceased while computing future prospects. Needless<lb/>
 to say that the actual income should be income after paying<lb/>
 the tax, if any. Addition should be 30% in case the deceased<lb/>
 was in the age group of 40 to 50 years.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>7. Further, in National Insurance Company Ltd. v.<lb/>
 Pushpa, this Court in SLP No. 16735 of 2014 (arising out of<lb/>
 CC No. 8058 of 2014) vide order dated 2.7.2014 made a<lb/>
 reference to a larger Bench in view of the seeming conflict<lb/>
 between the legal principles with respect to future prospects<lb/>
 laid down by this Court in the cases of Reshma Kumari &amp;<lb/>
 Ors. and Rajesh &amp; Ors. (supra). The relevant para from the<lb/>
 National Insurance Company case (supra) is extracted<lb/>
 hereunder:-<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;Be it noted, though the decision in Reshma (supra)<lb/>
 was rendered at earlier of time, as is clear, the same has not<lb/>
 been noticed in Rajesh (supra) and that is why divergent<lb/>
 opinions have been expressed. We are of the considered<lb/>
 opinion that as regards the manner of addition of income of<lb/>
 future prospects there should be an authoritative<lb/>
 pronouncement. Therefore, we think it appropriate to refer<lb/>
 the matter to a larger Bench.&quot;<lb/>
 Though, I am a party to the above reference, at the<lb/>
 same time, it is worth mentioning that the reference even in<lb/>
 the case of a perceived conflict or disagreement with the<lb/>
 views of a two judge (or even a three judge) Bench does not<lb/>
 permit a lower Bench formation to refer the matter<lb/>
 straightway to a five Judge Bench. This principle was stated<lb/>
 in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. Mumbai Shramik<lb/>
 Sangha &amp; Ors. ((2001) 4 SCC 448). In that judgment, the<lb/>
 Constitution Bench held that a decision of a Constitution<lb/>
 Bench binds Benches of two and three learned Judges of this<lb/>
 Court and that judicial discipline obliges them to follow it,<lb/>
 regardless of their doubts about its correctness. At the most,<lb/>
 they can direct that the matter to be heard by a Bench of<lb/>
 three learned Judges. In Pradip Chandra Parija &amp; Ors. v.<lb/>
 Pramod Chandra Patnaik &amp; Ors. ((2002) 1 SCC 1), a Bench<lb/>
 of two learned judges expressed reservations with the<lb/>
 judgment of a three judge Bench and directed the matter to<lb/>
 be placed before a larger Bench of five judges. The<lb/>
 Constitution Bench held that the rule of &apos;judicial discipline<lb/>
 and propriety&apos; as well as the theory of precedents permitted<lb/>
 only a Bench of the same quorum to question the correctness<lb/>
 of the decision by another Bench of co-ordinate strength<lb/>
 upon which the matter can be placed for consideration by a<lb/>
 Bench of larger quorum. A Bench of lesser quorum cannot<lb/>
 thus, express disagreement with, or question the correctness<lb/>
 of, the view of a Bench of a larger quorum. Central Board of<lb/>
 Dawoodi Bohra Community &amp; Anr. v. State of Maharashtra<lb/>
 &amp; Anr. ((2005) 2 SCC 673)summarized, for future guidance,<lb/>
 the correct approach in such matters. The relevant para of<lb/>
 the said case is extracted hereunder:-<lb/>
&quot;12. Having carefully considered the submissions made<lb/>
 by the learned Senior Counsel for the parties and having<lb/>
 examined the law laid down by the Constitution Benches in<lb/>
 the abovesaid decisions, we would like to sum up the legal<lb/>
 position in the following terms:<lb/>
</item>

<item>(1) The law laid down by this Court in a decision<lb/>
 delivered by a Bench of larger strength is binding on any<lb/>
 subsequent Bench of lesser or coequal strength.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(2) A Bench of lesser quorum cannot disagree or<lb/>
 dissent from the view of the law taken by a Bench of larger<lb/>
 quorum.<lb/>
 In case of doubt all that the Bench of lesser quorum<lb/>
 can do is to invite the attention of the Chief Justice and<lb/>
 request for the matter being placed for hearing before a<lb/>
 Bench of larger quorum than the Bench whose decision has<lb/>
 come up for consideration. It will be open only for a Bench<lb/>
 of coequal strength to express an opinion doubting the<lb/>
 correctness of the view taken by the earlier Bench of<lb/>
 coequal strength, whereupon the matter may be placed for<lb/>
 hearing before a Bench consisting of a quorum larger than<lb/>
 the one which pronounced the decision laying down the law<lb/>
 the correctness of which is doubted.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(3) The above rules are subject to two exceptions:<lb/>
</item>

<item>(i) the abovesaid rules do not bind the discretion of<lb/>
 the Chief Justice in whom vests the power of framing the<lb/>
 roster and who can direct any particular matter to be placed<lb/>
 for hearing before any particular Bench of any strength; and<lb/>
</item>

<item>(ii) in spite of the rules laid down hereinabove, if the<lb/>
 matter has already come up for hearing before a Bench of<lb/>
 larger quorum and that Bench itself feels that the view of<lb/>
 the law taken by a Bench of lesser quorum, which view is in<lb/>
 doubt, needs correction or reconsideration then by way of<lb/>
 exception (and not as a rule) and for reasons given by it, it<lb/>
 may proceed to hear the case and examine the correctness<lb/>
 of the previous decision in question dispensing with the need<lb/>
 of a specific reference or the order of the Chief Justice<lb/>
 constituting the Bench and such listing. Such was the<lb/>
 situation in Raghubir Singh and Hansoli Devi.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>8. Hence, I am of the opinion that the Rajesh &amp; Ors.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(supra) itself applied the Santosh Devi (supra) case, even<lb/>
 while clarifying that for self employed individuals, age is<lb/>
 also a determining factor, as is seen in the observation in<lb/>
 the case of Rajesh &amp; Ors. (supra) that in the case of self-<lb/>
employed or persons with fixed wages, in case, the<lb/>
 deceased victim was below 40 years, there must be an<lb/>
 addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased<lb/>
 while computing future prospects. In fact, this gives shape<lb/>
 to the view that future prospects are to be taken into<lb/>
 account even in case of self employment and also that<lb/>
 there cannot be a set formula for determining such<lb/>
 compensation. The best application of this view may be<lb/>
 seen in Sanjay Verma v. Haryana Roadways ( ((2014) 3 SCC<lb/>
</item>

<p>210)where the facts were noticed as follows :<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;12. The appellant was a self-employed person.<lb/>
</item>

<item>Though he had claimed a monthly income of Rs.5000/-,<lb/>
 the income tax returns filed by him demonstrate that he<lb/>
 had paid income tax on an annual income of Rs.41,300/-.<lb/>
 No fault, therefore, can be found in the order of the High<lb/>
 Court which proceeds on the basis that the annual income<lb/>
 of the claimant at the time of the accident was<lb/>
 Rs.41,300/-...&quot;<lb/>
 Then, this Court after noticing the decisions of this Court in<lb/>
 the cases of Sarla Verma &amp; Ors., Santosh Devi, and the<lb/>
 three Judge Bench of this Court in Reshma Kumari &amp; Ors.<lb/>
 And Rajesh &amp; Ors. (supra) applied the law in the following<lb/>
 manner in Sanjay Verma&apos;s case (supra):-<lb/>
&quot;16. Undoubtedly, the same principle will apply for<lb/>
 determination of loss of income on account of an accident<lb/>
 resulting in the total disability of the victim as in the present<lb/>
 case. Therefore, taking into account the age of the claimant<lb/>
 (25 years) and the fact that he had a steady income, as<lb/>
 evidenced by the income tax returns, we are of the view<lb/>
 that an addition of 50% to the income that the claimant was<lb/>
 earning at the time of the accident would be justified.<lb/>
</item>

<item>17. Insofar as the multiplier is concerned, as held in<lb/>
 Sarla Verma or as prescribed under the Second Schedule to<lb/>
 the Act, the correct multiplier in the present case cannot be<lb/>
 15 as held by the High Court. We are of the view that the<lb/>
 adoption of the multiplier of 17 would be appropriate.<lb/>
 Accordingly, taking into account the addition to the income<lb/>
 and the higher multiplier the total amount of compensation<lb/>
 payable to the claimant under the head &quot;loss of income&quot; is<lb/>
 Rs.10,53,150/-(Rs.41,300/-+ Rs.20,650/-= Rs.61,950/-×<lb/>
</item>

<item>17).&quot;<lb/>
 The clarification of the position, by a three judge<lb/>
 Bench, in Rajesh &amp; Ors., ipso facto could not have led to the<lb/>
 conclusion that there was a conflict between the views of<lb/>
 various Benches, since Santosh Devi itself had noticed Sarla<lb/>
 Verma, the logic of which in respect of limiting<lb/>
 compensation for non-permanent employment was clarified.<lb/>
</item>

<item>9. The above facts recount the position as emerging<lb/>
 from a combined reading of various orders and judgments.<lb/>
 What is clear is that a two judge Bench as was the formation<lb/>
 in the case of National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Pushpa<lb/>
 (supra) could not, having regard to the settled legal principle<lb/>
 outlined in the decision of this Court in Central Board of<lb/>
 Dawoodi Bohar Community (supra) have referred the matter<lb/>
 to a larger Bench. The correct view would have been to<lb/>
 place the matter before a Bench of co-ordinate strength<lb/>
 which decided Reshma Kumari &amp; Ors. and Rajesh &amp; Ors.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(supra), i.e. three judges.<lb/>
</item>

<item>10. However, I agree that the matter in relation to<lb/>
 future prospects to be added to the annual income to<lb/>
 determine the compensation towards loss of dependency<lb/>
 cannot be finally decided by us and has to be ultimately<lb/>
 referred to a larger Bench -because I was a party to the<lb/>
 reference in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pushpa (supra)<lb/>
 and more importantly, cannot in propriety recall that<lb/>
 reference while I am part of another Bench presently. In<lb/>
 view of the observations, the matter has to be placed before<lb/>
 the Hon&apos;ble Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders<lb/>
 towards the constitution of a suitable larger Bench in<lb/>
 accordance with law.<lb/>
 ORDER:<lb/>
 Since we have disagreed only insofar as the addition<lb/>
 towards the future prospects in case of self-employed or<lb/>
 fixed wages to be added to the compensation towards the<lb/>
 dependency, the matter may be placed before the Hon&apos;ble<lb/>
 the Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders towards the<lb/>
 constitution of a suitable larger Bench to decide the said<lb/>
 issue.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>(xiii) In Munna Lal Jain v. Vipin Kumar Sharma reported in 2015<lb/>
 (6) SCC 347 (Decided on 15.05.2015 by three Judges Bench), the<lb/>
 deceased was a pandit and bachelor. He was aged 30 years. The accident<lb/>
 occurred on 12.07.2008. Income at Rs.12,000/-per month, was<lb/>
 determined by the High Court. Addition of 50% was made and thereafter,<lb/>
 compensation was quantified. Thus, in the recent judgment, a three<lb/>
 Judges Bench of the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court, has allowed addition of 50%<lb/>
 under the head future prospects.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(xiv) Shashikala&apos;s case has been decided on 13.03.2015 by two<lb/>
 Judges&apos; Bench of the Apex Court, out of which, one of the learned Judges<lb/>
 has expressed divergent views. In National Insurance Co. Ltd., v. Pushpa<lb/>
 [SLP(C)No.8058 of 2014, dated 31.10.2013] [Decided by two Judges&apos;<lb/>
 Bench], there is a reference to a larger Bench. Thus, the last of the<lb/>
 judgments decided by the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in Munna Lal Jain&apos;s case<lb/>
 (cited supra), dated 15.05.2015, 50% of the income has been taken into<lb/>
 consideration under the head, future prospects.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(xv) In Sarla Verma&apos;s case (cited supra) (Decided by two Judges<lb/>
 Bench) and Reshma Kumari&apos;s case (cited supra) (Decided by three Judges<lb/>
 Bench), the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court held that in respect of salaried persons in<lb/>
 unorganised sector or self-employed, there should not be any addition<lb/>
 towards future prospects, whereas, in Santhosh Devi&apos;s case (cited supra)<lb/>
 (Decided by two Judges Bench) and Rajesh&apos;s case (cited supra) (Decided<lb/>
 by three Judges Bench), the Hon&apos;ble Apx Court held addition can be made<lb/>
 towards future prospects, in respect of the above class also. We are the<lb/>
 conscious of the fact that a reference has been made on the above<lb/>
 subject. At the same time, we deem it fit to consider the decision of the<lb/>
 Hon&apos;ble Apex Court, as to how, the Courts should proceed till a reference<lb/>
 is answered.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(a) In State of Orissa v. Dandasi Sahu reported in 1988 (4) SCC 12,<lb/>
 the Supreme Court held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;Arbitration is resorted to as a speedy method of<lb/>
 adjudication of disputes. Stale and old adjudication should<lb/>
 not be set at naught or examination of that question kept<lb/>
 at bay on the plea that the point is pending determination<lb/>
 by a larger Bench of this Court. Even if it is held ultimately<lb/>
 that the unreasoned award per se is bad, it is not sure<lb/>
 whether such a decision would upset all the awards in this<lb/>
 country which have not been challenged so far.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(b) In Uma Shankar Singh v. State of Bihar reported in 2010 (9)<lb/>
 SCC 479, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court observed as follows:<lb/>
 &quot;.......for a decision in the facts of the case, it is not<lb/>
 necessary to wait for the outcome of the result of the<lb/>
 reference made to a larger Bench in Dharam Pal case.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(c) In Ashok Sadarangani v. Union of India reported in (2012) 11<lb/>
 SCC 321, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as follows:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;29. As was indicated in Harbhajan Singh case, the<lb/>
 pendency of a reference to a larger Bench, does not mean<lb/>
 that all other proceedings involving the same issue would<lb/>
 remain stayed till a decision was rendered in the<lb/>
 reference. The reference made in Gian Singh case need<lb/>
 not, therefore, detain us. Till such time as the decisions<lb/>
 cited at the Bar are not modified or altered in any way,<lb/>
 they continue to hold the field.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>(d) In National Insurance Co. Ltd., v. Saju P.Paul reported in 2013<lb/>
 (2) SCC 41, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court, held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;The pendency of consideration of the above<lb/>
 questions by a larger Bench does not mean that the<lb/>
 course that was followed in Baljit Kaur&apos;s case and Challa<lb/>
 Bharathamma&apos;s case should not be followed, more so in a<lb/>
 peculiar fact situation of this case.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>(e) In State of Maharashtra v. Sarva Shramik Sangh reported in<lb/>
 (2013) 16 SCC 16, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as follows:<lb/>
 &quot;</p>

<item>27. It is, however, contended on behalf of the<lb/>
 appellant that the said undertaking was being run by the<lb/>
 Irrigation Department of the first appellant, and the<lb/>
 activities of the Irrigation Department could not be<lb/>
 considered to be an &quot;industry&quot; within the definition of the<lb/>
 concept under Section 2(j) of the ID Act. As noted earlier,<lb/>
 the reconsideration of the wide interpretation of the<lb/>
 concept of &quot;industry&quot; in Bangalore Water Supply and<lb/>
 Sewerage Board is pending before a larger Bench of this<lb/>
 Court. However, as of now we will have to follow the<lb/>
 interpretation of law presently holding the field as per the<lb/>
 approach taken by this Court in State of Orissa v. Dandasi<lb/>
 Sahu, referred to above. The determination of the present<lb/>
 pending industrial dispute cannot be kept undecided until<lb/>
 the judgment of the larger Bench is received.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>34. In the light of the above decisions, we deem it fit to<lb/>
 consider, as to how, the monthly income of a victim has to be<lb/>
 determined, while computing the loss of contribution to the family of the<lb/>
 deceased or in the case of an injured, if there is a loss of earning capacity<lb/>
 on account of disability suffered.<lb/>
</p>

<p>35. Future prospects, depends upon education, skill and<lb/>
 experience gained in the skilled jobs, managerial, supervisory or<lb/>
 administrative positions in organised or unorganised sectors, or self-<lb/>
employed. Prospects can be, with reference to employment, co-relating<lb/>
 to income. The word, &quot;future&quot; needs, no explanation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>36. As per R.Ramanatha Iyer&apos;s Concise Law Dictionary, prospects,<lb/>
 means &quot;expectation for something to come&quot;.<lb/>
</p>

<p>37. As per Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English,<lb/>
 &quot;prospect&quot; means, &quot;possibility that something will happen; a particular<lb/>
 event, which will probably or definitely happen in the future.<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;Prospects&quot; means, &quot;chances of future success&quot;.<lb/>
</p>

<p>38. &quot;Prospect&quot;, as per Chambers Dictionary, inter alia, means,<lb/>
 &quot;an outlook on the probable future; an expectation; a chance of success<lb/>
 or advancement.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>39. &quot;Prospect&quot; as per Encarta World English Dictionary, means<lb/>
 &quot;possibility of happening soon; a chance or likelihood that will happen in<lb/>
 future, (esp.) desirable; vision of future that is expected or certain to<lb/>
 happen in future. &quot;Prospects&quot; means, &quot;expectation of success; likelihood<lb/>
 of successful or prosperous in future, especially in job or career.<lb/>
</p>

<p>40. As per Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus, &quot;Prospect&quot; (noun),<lb/>
 means, &quot;(1) There is a little prospect of success, likelihood, hope,<lb/>
 expectation, anticipation (good/poor), chance, odds, probability,<lb/>
 possibility, promise, lookout, fear and danger.&quot; (2) &quot;Potential,<lb/>
 expectations, outlook&quot;. &quot;Prospect&quot;(Noun), means, possibility or likelihood<lb/>
 of some future event occurring. &quot;Prospects&quot; means, &quot;Chances or promise<lb/>
 or opportunity for success.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>41. In American Heritage Dictionary, &quot;Prospect&quot;, means,<lb/>
 &quot;something expected, possibility&quot;.<lb/>
</p>

<p>42. As per Webster&apos;s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the<lb/>
 English Language (Deluxe Edition), &quot;Prospect&quot; means, (1) Usually,<lb/>
</p>

<note type="other">&quot;prospects&quot;. (a) an apparent probability of advancement, success, profit,<lb/>
 etc., (b) good business prospects. (2) anticipation; expectation; a looking<lb/>
 forward.<lb/>
</note>

<p>43. Extract of the dictionary meaning of the words &quot;Prospect&quot; or<lb/>
 &quot;Prospects&quot;, would indicate that it is closely related to the probability or<lb/>
 possibility of an event, expected in future. Thus, in the matter of<lb/>
 awarding compensation to the accident victims, the expression, &quot;future<lb/>
 prospects&quot; is more or less used and meant, with reference to the plurality<lb/>
 of the word &quot;prospect&quot;, in relation to employment or career prospects<lb/>
 and consequently, the expected increase in income, after a passage of<lb/>
 time. At this juncture, it should be noticed that the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in<lb/>
 Sarla Verma&apos;s case (cited supra), has used the expression, advancement<lb/>
 in life and career, but with reference to a stable job. In the said case, the<lb/>
 Apex Court held that no amount need be added under the head, future<lb/>
 prospects to others.<lb/>
</p>

<p>44. In Sarla Verma&apos;s case (cited supra), the case of persons,<lb/>
 employed in a permanent job, in salaried structure and while considering<lb/>
 the prospects of earning more income, consequent to periodical revision<lb/>
 of salary of those employed in organised sectors. Subsequently in<lb/>
 Santhosh Devi&apos;s case, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court, has extended addition<lb/>
 of certain percentage to the income drawn by the victim, at the time of<lb/>
 accident, towards future prospects and in Rajesh&apos;s case (cited supra), it<lb/>
 has been clarified. But in Reshma Kumari&apos;s case (cited supra), it is held<lb/>
 otherwise.<lb/>
</p>

<p>45. At this juncture, we wish to consider the difference between<lb/>
 organised and unorganised sector. What is meant by &quot;organised sector&quot;?<lb/>
 In common parlance, it would be service in Government, Government<lb/>
 Undertaking, Companies owned and controlled by the Government,<lb/>
 Corporation or Boards. The unorganized sector consists of all individuals<lb/>
 or households engaged in production or sale of goods and services,<lb/>
 operated as a proprietor or on partnership or self employed. They can be<lb/>
 said to be unorganised sectors.<lb/>
</p>

<p>46. Who is there in the unorganised sector? Right from a roadside<lb/>
 tea shop owner or tiffin vendor or a pushcart vendor, a vegetable vendor<lb/>
 on road or in a market and many more home based self employment.<lb/>
 Wages or earning of self-employed correlates the subsistence level to<lb/>
 meet out the basic needs of living standards. At home or outside, there<lb/>
 are thousands and thousands of self-employed persons, who do not have<lb/>
 adequate employment opportunities in the organised sector.<lb/>
</p>

<p>47. Those engaged in unorganised sectors are self-employed or<lb/>
 unregistered, carry on their avocations or activities, say for instance, a<lb/>
 roadside tea stall vendor, a vegetable vendor or engaged in skilled, like a<lb/>
 fitter, carpenter, plumber, etc., or unskilled work, either employed or on<lb/>
 his own. This type of classification as unorganised sector, may be broadly<lb/>
 classified on occupations, including skilled or semi-skilled, landless<lb/>
 labourers, either in the field of agriculture or industry or small traders or<lb/>
 self-employed, construction workers, weavers, artisans, those engaged in<lb/>
 stone quarries, migrant workers, labourers engaged by private<lb/>
 contractors, drivers, domestic workers and many more. They are in rural,<lb/>
 urban and metropolitan cities. They are engaged in unorganised sectors,<lb/>
 in manufacturing, trading and services oriented.<lb/>
</p>

<p>48. Before adverting to the issue, taken up for consideration, let<lb/>
 us have a cursory look at some of the factors, which decide the economy<lb/>
 of any Country. General meaning of the words, &quot;Gross Domestic Product&quot;,<lb/>
 &quot;Per Capita Income&quot; and &quot;Consumer Price Index&quot; are as follows:<lb/></p><item>
 &quot;Gross domestic product (GDP) is the monetary<lb/>
 value of all the finished goods and services produced<lb/>
 within a country&apos;s borders in a specific time period.<lb/>
 Though GDP is usually calculated on an annual basis, it<lb/>
 can be calculated on a quarterly basis as well. GDP<lb/>
 includes all private and public consumption,<lb/>
 government outlays, investments and exports minus<lb/>
 imports that occur within a defined territory. Put<lb/>
 simply, GDP is a broad measurement of a nation&apos;s<lb/>
 overall economic activity. Gross domestic product can<lb/>
 be calculated using the following formula:<lb/>
</item>

<item>GDP = C + G + I + NX (where &apos;C&apos; is equal to all<lb/>
 private consumption, or consumer spending, in a<lb/>
 nation&apos;s economy, G is the sum of government<lb/>
 spending, &apos;I&apos; is the sum of all the country&apos;s investment,<lb/>
 including businesses capital expenditures and NX is the<lb/>
 nation&apos;s total net exports, calculated as total exports<lb/>
 minus total imports (NX = Exports -Imports)).<lb/></item><item>
 Per Capita Income (PCI) is a measure of the<lb/>
 amount of money that is being earned per person in a<lb/>
 certain area. Income per capita can apply to the<lb/>
 average per-person income for a city, region or country<lb/>
 and is used as a means of evaluating the living<lb/>
 conditions and quality of life in different areas. It can<lb/>
 be calculated for a country by dividing the country&apos;s<lb/>
 national income by its population.<lb/>
 Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that<lb/>
 examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of<lb/>
 consumer goods and services, such as transportation,<lb/>
 food and medical care. The CPI is calculated by taking<lb/>
 price changes for each item in the predetermined<lb/>
 basket of goods and averaging them; the goods are<lb/>
 weighted according to their importance. Changes in CPI<lb/>
 are used to assess price changes associated with the<lb/>
 cost of living.<lb/>
</item>

<p>49. Consumer Price Index is a measure of changes in the<lb/>
 purchasing-power of currency and the rate of inflation. The consumer<lb/>
 price index expresses the current prices of a basket of goods and services<lb/>
 in terms of the prices during the same period in a previous year and<lb/>
 indicate the effect of inflation on the purchasing power. It is determined<lb/>
 on the expenditures of all the residents in urban or metropolitan areas,<lb/>
 including the professionals, self-employed, poor, unemployed and retired<lb/>
 persons, as well as urban wage earners and clerical workers. Consumer<lb/>
 Price Index in common parlance is also called as cost-of-living index. A<lb/>
 cost-of-living index would measure changes over a time, in the amount<lb/>
 that consumers need to spend to reach a certain utility level or standard<lb/>
 of living.<lb/>
</p>

<p>50. Consumer Price Index represents all the goods and services,<lb/>
 purchased and consumed by the reference population in relation to food<lb/>
 and beverages (milk, coffee and all the essential food items), housing<lb/>
 (rent, furniture, etc.,), clothing, transportation (vehicles, bus, train and<lb/>
 other modes of transport fares), medical care (drugs and medicines,<lb/>
 doctor services and hospital services), recreation, education and<lb/>
 communication (school or college fee, telephone services, computer<lb/>
 software) etc., beside there are other goods and services (personal<lb/>
 services). Consumer Price Index also includes government-charged fees,<lb/>
 such as, electricity, water and sewerage charges, etc. In addition,<lb/>
 Consumer Price Index also includes taxes (such as sales tax and excise<lb/>
 duty) that are directly associated with the prices of specific goods and<lb/>
 services.<lb/>
</p>

<p>51. Inflation has been defined as a process of continuously rising<lb/>
 prices or equivalently, of a continuously falling value of money. Various<lb/>
 indexes have been devised to measure the different aspects of inflation.<lb/>
 The Consumer Price Index measures the inflation as experienced by the<lb/>
 consumers in their day-to-day living expenses; the Producer Price Index<lb/>
 (PPI) measures inflation in the stages of production process; the<lb/>
 Employment Cost Index (ECI) measures the labor market; and the Gross<lb/>
 Domestic Product measures the inflation experienced by both consumers<lb/>
 themselves as well as the governments and other institutions providing<lb/>
 goods and services to the consumers. It is well known that Consumer Price<lb/>
 Index is the best factor, to understand and estimate, as to how much, one<lb/>
 could purchase, with a fixed sum. Inflation is the rate at which the<lb/>
 general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently,<lb/>
 the purchasing power of the consumers would be diminishing. Can<lb/>
 anybody in this Country, claim that the cost of fuel, electricity, essential<lb/>
 commodities, tax or fee, collected by Government or local bodies, as the<lb/>
 case may, remain the same? The effects of inflation are the same for<lb/>
 everyone, rich or raff, but the changes in the cost of living may vary from<lb/>
 place to place and from person to person, depending upon the<lb/>
 Consumption pattern of the goods or services, as the case may be.<lb/>
 Needless to state that Consumer Price Index is primarily a measure of the<lb/>
 cost of living. From the Government of India&apos;s Economic Survey 2014-15,<lb/>
 this Court is inclined to extract the Gross National Income (Gross<lb/>
 Domestic Product), Net National Income (Per Capita Income), Consumer<lb/>
 Price Index and Inflation, for the period 2011-12 to 2014-15, as under:<lb/>
 Gross National Income and Net National Income<lb/>

 Inflation is calculated as {( index of current year minus index of the<lb/>
 previous year) / current year index} X 100. For 2014 and 2015, we have<lb/>
 chosen the base year as 2012. So the index for 2013, April with base year<lb/>
 2012 was 107.7. Consequently the inflation for 2014, April was {9.9<lb/>
 /107.7} x 100 = 9.2. Similarly for 2015 April. We have taken the beginning<lb/>
 of financial year for this calculation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>52. Let us now consider, as to how, the wages are revised<lb/>
 periodically by the Central Government and State Government, in respect<lb/>
 of certain employees. For every half-yearly, on the basis of average<lb/>
 Consumer Price Index, the Chief Labour Commissioner, Ministry of Labour<lb/>
 and Employment, Government of India, would revises the rates of<lb/>
 Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA), for Agricultural Labourers, Industrial<lb/>
 Workers, Workers engaged in Stone Mines for stone breaking &amp; store<lb/>
 crushing and employees engaged in &quot;Employment of Sweeping and<lb/>
 Cleaning&quot; and &quot;Employment of Watch and Ward&quot;. To compare the Cost<lb/>
 Price Index, this Court deems it fit to consider the proceedings of the<lb/>
 Chief Labour Commissioner, Ministry of Labour and Employment,<lb/>
 Government of India, issued periodically, as follows:<lb/></p><p>
 AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;In exercise of the powers conferred by Central<lb/>

 54. Taking into consideration the above illustrative cases of some<lb/>
 of the employees, engaged by the Government, on daily rated basis and<lb/>
 being revised periodically, we wish to state that the factors taken into<lb/>
 consideration or the reasons stated by the Central Government or the<lb/>
 District Collector, as the case may be, while revising the wages, from<lb/>
 time to time, whether a person is employed in an organised or<lb/>
 unorganised sector, would remain the same and consequently, decide the<lb/>
 living conditions of different classes of persons, whether engaged in<lb/>
 organised or unorganised sectors, as the case may be, to meet out the<lb/>
 day to day expenditure and basic amenities. The difference in the rates<lb/>
 of wages between the persons employed in a salaried structure, revisable<lb/>
 periodically, though not, in strict sense, be applied with the same<lb/>
 percentage to those, engaged in unorganised sectors, but it cannot be<lb/>
 contended that there will not be any change in the earning or income.<lb/>
</p>

<p>55. The government servants have an expectation of periodical<lb/>
 revision. So also, the employees working in Public Sector, Boards,<lb/>
 Corporation, Companies owned and controlled by the Government. In<lb/>
 respect of Private Limited Companies, it is more on the basis of terms and<lb/>
 conditions of the contract, in which, they are governed. But in the case of<lb/>
 self-employed or those, engaged in unorganised sectors, revision of wages<lb/>
 or salary or in the case of self-employed, though may not be on par with<lb/>
 the salaried structure in organised sectors or on the terms and conditions<lb/>
 of the contracts in limited companies, still the important factor,<lb/>
 Consumer Price Index, the deciding factor, would be the same, for a<lb/>
 change in the earning of the self-employed or revision of salary or wage,<lb/>
 even in unorganized sectors and that the expectation of a future event,<lb/>
 ie., possibility of a change in wage or financial expectation, cannot be<lb/>
 ruled out, for the simple reason that nothing has remained static, in this<lb/>
 country.<lb/>
</p>

<p>56. As tabulated in the foregoing paragraphs, it should be noted<lb/>
 that Consumer Price Index, Gross Domestic Product and Per Capita<lb/>
 Income, have increased. One cannot disown the fact that the percentage<lb/>
 of those in unorganized sectors is more than the organised sectors. While<lb/>
 that be so, would it be appropriate for the Insurance Companies and<lb/>
 Transport Corporations, to contend that there is absolutely no chance of<lb/>
 any upward revision in wages or salary of those, employed in unorganised<lb/>
 sectors or for that matter in the earnings of self-employed. If the<lb/>
 contentions of the Insurance Companies and Transport Corporations have<lb/>
 to be accepted, whether the self-employed or those engaged in<lb/>
 unorganised sectors, can never have any expectation of an event in<lb/>
 future, ie., increase in earnings or wages? With the basic study of the<lb/>
 statistics, we are of the considered view that the answer should be a<lb/>
 clear &apos;No&apos;. When the Consumer Price Index is applicable uniformally to<lb/>
 rich or raff, it cannot be contended that those who are engaged in<lb/>
 unorganized sectors or self-employed, would continue to earn the same<lb/>
 income, for years together.<lb/>
</p>

<p>57. For the abovesaid reasons, we are of the considered view<lb/>
 that the word, &quot;prospects&quot; should not be read and understood, only in<lb/>
 plural sense, meaning thereby, its prospects or an apparent probability of<lb/>
 advancement in employment, in organised sectors alone. Narrowing down<lb/>
 the meaning of the words, &quot;future prospects&quot; only to the employment<lb/>
 prospects and consequently, more possibility of earning income, only in<lb/>
 the case of organised sector and not in unorganised sector or self-<lb/>
employed, would affect the majority and therefore, the meaning of the<lb/>
 word, &quot;prospect&quot; used in singular, meaning thereby, expectation,<lb/>
 possibility or probability, chances of earning more income in future,<lb/>
 depending upon the factors, stated supra, should also be considered.<lb/>
</p>

<p>58. Thus, from the above particulars, extracted supra, it is<lb/>
 evident that both the Central and State Governments have periodically<lb/>
 revised the minimum wages across the country. It has been raised taking<lb/>
 into consideration the Consumer Price Index. In respect of scheduled<lb/>
 employments, for skilled, semi-skilled, unskilled, construction workers,<lb/>
 labourers, etc., wages, are fixed in various scheduled employments, right<lb/>
 from Agarbathi Industry to Woolen Carpet and Shawl wearing machinery.<lb/>
</p>

<p>59. While that be the position in organised sectors, it cannot be<lb/>
 contended that insofar as unorganised sectors or self-employed, is<lb/>
 concerned, there would not be any revision in the wages or salary or<lb/>
 earning. When the minimum wages of an employee in the organised<lb/>
 sector, is revised periodically, taking into consideration the Consumer<lb/>
 Price Index and Variable Dearness Allowance, the living conditions, then<lb/>
 the others, in a unorganised sector may expect more or less the same<lb/>
 wage, and if there are more number of persons, there may be chances of<lb/>
 lesser wage, on account of surplus human resources and in such cases, the<lb/>
 bargaining power of certain class of employees, depending upon the field,<lb/>
 for revision of wages or earning, may be less.<lb/>
</p>

<p>60. If a non-salaried domestic worker sells a piece of any article,<lb/>
 which he or she manufacturers and if the customer bargains the rate, he<lb/>
 or she would immediately reply, as to how much amount, he/she has to<lb/>
 spend for buying the basic materials, other materials used, compare the<lb/>
 erstwhile travel expenses and the cost of labour. Can anyone in this<lb/>
 Country can say that the electricity charges, water charges, rent, fee<lb/>
 received by the Government, cost of education, price of commodities,<lb/>
 etc., have remained the same, without any change. Cost of tea sold in a<lb/>
 ordinary tea stall is the same for any person, whether engaged in<lb/>
 organised or unorganised. Contenting inter alia that there would not be<lb/>
 any increase in wages or earning for those engaged in unorganised<lb/>
 sectors, for years to come, can it be said that he would never take a cup<lb/>
 of tea, outside?<lb/>
</p>

<p>61. At this juncture, it should be borne in mind that Consumer<lb/>
 Price Index is fixed, taking into consideration that the majority consumers<lb/>
 are from unorganised sectors. Thus, with reference to Gross Domestic<lb/>
 Product, Per Capita Income, Consumer Price Index and such other<lb/>
 economic factors, determined on the basis of participation and<lb/>
 contribution of both organised and unorganised sectors, the classification<lb/>
 that those engaged in unorganised sectors, should be totally denied of any<lb/>
 addition of income under the head, future prospects, would in our humble<lb/>
 view, would affect Article 14 of the Constitution of India. When the<lb/>
 majority of persons, in unorganised sectors, also decide the economic<lb/>
 factors, stated supra, it would be unjust and unreasonable to contend<lb/>
 that there would not any prospect or addition in the earning of those<lb/>
 engaged in unorganised sector, forever. If there is addition of Variable<lb/>
 Dearness Allowance to the basic wages, in the case of organised sector,<lb/>
 depending upon the Consumer Price Index, applicable for a particular<lb/>
 period, one would reasonably expect the same factor of variable Dearness<lb/>
 Allowance, to be a relevant factor, for determining the variation in the<lb/>
 wage in case of unorganised sector also, as Consumer Price Index is<lb/>
 common to all, whether engaged in organised or unorganised sector.<lb/>
</p>

<p>62. At this juncture, we deem it fit to consider, what &quot;Dearness<lb/>
 Allowance&quot; means? &quot;Dearness Allowance&quot; is a cost of living adjustment<lb/>
 allowance paid to Government employees, Public sector employees<lb/>
 (PSU)and pensioners. Dearness Allowance is calculated as a percentage of<lb/>
 an Indian&apos;s basic salary to mitigate the impact of inflation. Variable<lb/>
 Dearness Allowance is always linked to Consumer Prince Index. The<lb/>
 notifications of Minimum wages by the Central and State Government<lb/>
 reflects how much is the Variable Dearness in each field.<lb/>
</p>

<p>63. In the light of what we have tabulated above, judicial notice<lb/>
 can also be taken that the cost of labour, whether it is in agricultural<lb/>
 field or manufacturing or services, has increased. Thus, focusing on the<lb/>
 increase in wages or earning, in almost all the fields of operation, right<lb/>
 from agricultural or industrial or manual labourers, tea shop or road side<lb/>
 vendor, the Consumer Price Index, being the same to rich or raff and<lb/>
 therefore, correspondingly to meet out the living conditions, atleast for<lb/>
 providing the basic amenities, like food, shelter and clothing, and not to<lb/>
 add up the expenditure towards health, education, certainly, there would<lb/>
 be revision of wages or earning, even in unorganised sectors also. Future<lb/>
 is the period of time that will come after the present or things that will<lb/>
 happen. Having regard to the consistent and periodical revision of wages<lb/>
 by the Governments, it cannot be contended by the Insurers or Transport<lb/>
 Corporations that a person in unorganised sector, has no future at all, in<lb/>
 the matter of revision of wages or earning.<lb/>
</p>

<p>64. In R.K.Malik&apos;s case (cited supra), the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court<lb/>
 considered the quantum of compensation, payable to the legal<lb/>
 representatives of the deceased children, aged between 10 and 18 years.<lb/>
 Referring to the inflation, price rise, etc., the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court, by<lb/>
 observing that the there would be a future prospects, for the children<lb/>
 also, granted a sum of Rs.75,000/-under the head, future prospects,<lb/>
 though as on the date of accident, they were children, studying in a<lb/>
 school. In V.Mekala&apos;s case (cited supra), the injured was a student<lb/>
 studying in 11th Standard. While determining the monthly income of the<lb/>
 injured as Rs.10,000/-, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court added 50% of the<lb/>
 income, under the head, future prospects. In the recent decision in<lb/>
 Munna Lal Jain&apos;s case (cited supra), the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court added<lb/>
 50% under the head, future prospects.<lb/>
</p>

<p>65. Thus, from the line of judgments, it could be noticed that the<lb/>
 Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court has considered the addition of a quantified sum,<lb/>
 under the head, future prospects, in effect, indicating that there is a<lb/>
 prospect or chance or possibility of earning more income, after a passage<lb/>
 of time, though not periodically, as done in the case of Government or<lb/>
 Public Sector Undertakings or Boards or Corporations, Companies owned<lb/>
 and controlled by the Government or Limited Companies.<lb/>
</p>

<p>66. We have already extracted the orders of the Chief Labour<lb/>
 Commissioner, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India,<lb/>
 New Delhi and taken into consideration a sample case, City of Chennai.<lb/>
 Wage revision may vary in rural or urban areas or metropolitan cities. At<lb/>
 the risk of repetition, as observed earlier, the number of persons,<lb/>
 engaged in unorganized sectors, agriculture or industrial, or home based<lb/>
 or self-employment, etc., are more in number, than those employed in<lb/>
 organised sectors.<lb/>
</p>

<p>67. Income from the organised sector alone, is not the deciding<lb/>
 factor, for determining Gross Domestic Product, Consumer Price Index or<lb/>
 Per Capita Income. Thus, from a basic study of the factors, taken into<lb/>
 consideration by the Governments for revision of wages, to the<lb/>
 enumerated categories of employees, one cannot lose sight of the fact<lb/>
 that the said factors, would also have an indeligible effect on those,<lb/>
 engaged in unorganized sectors also. In the light of our discussion and the<lb/>
 details considered, we are of the considered view that addition of certain<lb/>
 percentage of income under the head, future prospects, has to be done in<lb/>
 the case of those engaged in unorganized sector or self-employed also,<lb/>
 otherwise, they would be deprived of just compensation. Addition of<lb/>
 income under the head,future prospects, should not be restricted to only<lb/>
 salaried persons, with stable jobs.<lb/>
</p>

<p>68. Though it is the case of the Insurance Companies and<lb/>
 Transport Corporation that in the case of persons engaged in unorganised<lb/>
 sector or salaried or persons, who do not have any permanent job,<lb/>
 addition of certain percentage of income, under the head, &quot;future<lb/>
 prospects&quot;, to the income drawn, at the time of death, should not be<lb/>
 made, for computation loss of dependency compensation, we are not<lb/>
 inclined to accept the same, for the reason that the expression &quot;future<lb/>
 prospects&quot; should not be confined only to the prospects of the deceased<lb/>
 in the career, progress or upgradation of position, in which, he was<lb/>
 engaged, prior to death, but the expression &quot;future prospects&quot; should<lb/>
 also be extended to the likelihood of increase in wages/salary, earned by<lb/>
 either a skilled or semi-skilled person, clerical and others, considering the<lb/>
 upward increase in the cost price, inflation and such other factors.<lb/>
</p>

<p>69. Just and reasonable compensation has to be awarded to the<lb/>
 legal representatives of the deceased. Few decisions on this aspect are<lb/>
 as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>(i) In R.D.Hattangadi v. M/s.Pest Control (India) Pvt. Ltd.,<lb/>
 reported in AIR 1995 SC 755, wherein, the Apex Court held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;In its very nature whenever a Tribunal or a Court is<lb/>
 required to fix the amount of compensation in cases of<lb/>
 accident, it involves some guess work, some hypothetical<lb/>
 consideration, some amount of sympathy linked with the<lb/>
 nature of disability caused. But all the aforesaid elements<lb/>
 have to be viewed with objective standards.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>(ii) In yet another decision in Divisonal Controller, KSRTC v.<lb/>
 Mahadeva Shetty and another reported in (2003) 7 SCC 197, in<lb/>
 Paragraph 12, the Supreme Court held that,<lb/>
 &quot;Broadly speaking, in the case of death the basis<lb/>
 of compensation is loss of pecuniary benefits to the<lb/>
 dependents of the deceased which includes pecuniary<lb/>
 benefits to the dependents of the deceased which<lb/>
 includes pecuniary loss, expenses etc. and loss to the<lb/>
 estate. The object is to mitigate hardship that has<lb/>
 been caused to the legal representatives due to the<lb/>
 sudden demise of the deceased in the accident.<lb/>
 Compensation awarded should not be inadequate and<lb/>
 should neither be unreasonable, excessive, nor<lb/>
 deficient. There can be no exact uniform rule for<lb/>
 measuring the value of human life and the measure of<lb/>
 damage cannot be arrived at by precise mathematical<lb/>
 calculation; but amount recoverable depends on broad<lb/>
 facts and circumstances of each case. It should neither<lb/>
 be punitive against whom claim is decreed nor should it<lb/>
 be a source of profit for the person in whose favour it is<lb/>
 awarded.&quot;<lb/>
 At Paragraph 15 of the said judgment, the Supreme Court has held that,<lb/>
 &quot;Measure of damages cannot be arrived at by<lb/>
 precise mathematical calculations. It would depend<lb/>
 upon the particular facts and circumstances, and<lb/>
 attending peculiar or special features, if any. Every<lb/>
 method or mode adopted for assessing compensation<lb/>
 has to be considered in the background of &quot;just&quot;<lb/>
 compensation which is the pivotal consideration.<lb/>
 Though by use of the expression &quot;which appears to it to<lb/>
 be just&quot;, a wide discretion is vested in the Tribunal, the<lb/>
 determination has to be rational, to be done by a<lb/>
 judicious approach and not the outcome of whims, wild<lb/>
 guesses and arbitrariness, and non-arbitrariness. If it is<lb/>
 not so, it cannot be just.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>(iii) In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences v. Prasanth<lb/>
 S.Dhananka reported in (2009) 6 SCC 1 = 2010 ACJ 38 (SC), a Hon&apos;ble<lb/>
 three-Judge Bench was dealing with a case arising out of the complaint<lb/>
 filed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. While enhancing the<lb/>
 compensation awarded by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal<lb/>
 Commission from Rs.15 lakhs to Rs.1 crore, the Hon&apos;ble Bench made the<lb/>
 following observations which can appropriately be applied for deciding<lb/>
 the petitions filed under Section 166 of the Act:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;We must emphasise that the court has to strike a<lb/>
 balance between the inflated and unreasonable demands of<lb/>
 a victim and the equally untenable claim of the opposite<lb/>
 party saying that nothing is payable. Sympathy for the victim<lb/>
 does not, and should not, come in the way of making a<lb/>
 correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the court must<lb/>
 not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. The<lb/>
 &quot;adequate compensation&quot; that we speak of, must to some<lb/>
 extent, be a rule of thumb measure, and as a balance has to<lb/>
 be struck, it would be difficult to satisfy all the parties<lb/>
 concerned. ...At the same time we often find that a person<lb/>
 injured in an accident leaves his family in greater distress<lb/>
 vis-`-vis a family in a case of death. In the latter case, the<lb/>
 initial shock gives way to a feeling of resignation and<lb/>
 acceptance, and in time, compels the family to move on.<lb/>
 The case of an injured and disabled person is, however,<lb/>
 more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair<lb/>
 and often destitution enures every day. The support that is<lb/>
 needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an<lb/>
 enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only<lb/>
 on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants<lb/>
 and the stress saps their energy and destroys their<lb/>
 equanimity.&quot; (emphasis supplied)<lb/>
</p>

<p>70. Reverting to the case on hand, in some of the appeals before<lb/>
 us, the quantum of compensation, awarded under the heads, loss of<lb/>
 dependency, loss of consortium, funeral expenses, love and affection, is<lb/>
 less. Though the respondents/claimants, in each of the appeals, have not<lb/>
 filed any cross-objection or independent appeals, yet on the principles of<lb/>
 just compensation and considering the decision in Nagappa v. Gurudayal<lb/>
 Singh and others reported in 2003 ACJ 12: 2004 (2) TN MAC 398 (SC),<lb/>
 wherein, the Apex Court has held that the Court/Tribunals can award<lb/>
 compensation, more than what is claimed, depending upon the facts and<lb/>
 circumstances of each case and exercising powers under Order 41, Rule 33<lb/>
 CPC., we deem it fit to consider the merits of each case. On the aspect of<lb/>
 suo-motu enhancement, we deem it fit to consider few decisions,<lb/>
 (i) In National Insurance Co. Ltd., v. M.Jayagandhi reported in<lb/>
 2008 (1) TNMAC 177, on the question as whether in the absence of any<lb/>
 Cross Objection, the High Court could suo moto enhance the<lb/>
 compensation, by exercising power under Order 41, Rule 33 CPC., this<lb/>
 Court, at Paragraphs 37 and 38, held as follows:<lb/>
 &quot;37. The question arising for consideration is<lb/>
 whether in the absence of any Cross Objection, the<lb/>
 Appellate Court could suo motu enhance the<lb/>
 compensation. The Appellate Court exercising power<lb/>
 under Order 41, Rule 33, CPC could enhance the quantum<lb/>
 of compensation even without Cross-Objection. The<lb/>
 Courts and Tribunals have a duty to weigh various factors<lb/>
 and quantify the amount of compensation which should<lb/>
 be just. Reference could be made to the decision of the<lb/>
 Supreme Court in Sheikhupura Trans. Co. Ltd. v.<lb/>
 Northern India Transporter&apos;s Ins. Co. Ltd. , 1971 ACJ 206<lb/>
 (SC), wherein it is held that pecuniary loss to the<lb/>
 aggrieved party would depend upon data which cannot be<lb/>
 ascertained accurately, but must necessarily be an<lb/>
 estimate or even partly a conjecture. The general<lb/>
 principle is that the pecuniary loss can be ascertained<lb/>
 only by balancing, on the one hand, the loss to the<lb/>
 Claimants of future pecuniary benefits and on the other<lb/>
 any pecuniary advantage which from what-ever sources<lb/>
 come to them by reason of the death, i.e. the balance of<lb/>
 loss and gain to a dependant by the death must be<lb/>
 ascertained. The determination of the question of<lb/>
 compensation depends on several imponderables. In the<lb/>
 assessment of those imponderables, there is likely to be a<lb/>
 margin of error. Broadly speaking, in the case of death,<lb/>
 the basis of compensation is loss of pecuniary bene-fits to<lb/>
 the dependants of the deceased which includes pecuniary<lb/>
 loss, expenses, etc. and loss to estate. Object is to<lb/>
 mitigate hardship that has been caused to the legal<lb/>
 representatives due to sudden demise of the deceased in<lb/>
 the accident. Compensation awarded should not be<lb/>
 inadequate and should neither be un-reasonable,<lb/>
 excessive nor deficient.<lb/>
</p>

<p>38. Of course, the Claimants who are widow, minor<lb/>
 daughter and mother have not filed any Cross-Objection.<lb/>
 Even without a Cross-Objection, questioning the<lb/>
 quantum, the Court could suo motu enhance<lb/>
 compensation under Or. 41, R. 33, CPC. In this context,<lb/>
 reference could be made to 1999 ACJ 977 [Karnataka]<lb/>
 wherein it has been held as follows:<lb/>
 &quot;(6) I am in general agreement with the basic<lb/>
 proposition of law that has been canvassed by the<lb/>
 appellant&apos;s learned advocate when he points out that it is<lb/>
 a well settled principle that a party who suffers an order<lb/>
 or a decree and does not Appeal against it or assail it<lb/>
 would normally not be permitted at the hearing of the<lb/>
 Appeal to try and take advantage of the situation by<lb/>
 asking for enhancement. The issue is not that but really<lb/>
 as to whether this situation prescribes an absolute and<lb/>
 total bar to the Court granting a relief if in the interest of<lb/>
 justice such a relief is an absolute must. One has to view<lb/>
 the situation from a rather practical point of view the<lb/>
 first of them being with regard to the very poor quality of<lb/>
 legal assistance that is usually available in and around the<lb/>
 M.A.C.T. and thereafter, the second aspect of the matter<lb/>
 being that the status of the parties and their general<lb/>
 condition themselves may be such that they are unable to<lb/>
 agitate the matter further and the third aspect of the<lb/>
 matter which is relevant having regard to the present<lb/>
 case, is the possibility of certain further tragic<lb/>
 occurrences such as deaths that may have intervened, all<lb/>
 of which may contribute to a situation wherein the Court<lb/>
 finds that no Appeal or Cross-Objections have been filed.<lb/>
 The essence of doing justice requires that compensation<lb/>
 when awarded has got to be reasonable and fair and it<lb/>
 has also got to be adequate having regard to the totality<lb/>
 of the circumstances. The hearing of the Appeal involves<lb/>
 a total review of the case and the Appeal is virtually an<lb/>
 extension of the proceedings before the lower Court. The<lb/>
 law is well settled with regard to one interesting aspect<lb/>
 of the matter, namely, that the Courts do come across a<lb/>
 few instances where instead of over-pitching the case<lb/>
 before the Trial Court, a very modest amount is claimed<lb/>
 and the Tribunals in these circumstances have been<lb/>
 wrongly limiting the relief to the amount that has been<lb/>
 claimed on the ground that even though the party is<lb/>
 entitled to something higher, what was asked for is a<lb/>
 lower figure. This Court had occasion to correct these<lb/>
 orders and to lay down that the Tribunal is required to<lb/>
 pass an order quantifying the compensation correctly<lb/>
 irrespective of what has been claimed on the basis of the<lb/>
 principle that it is not the amount that is claimed in that<lb/>
 matter, insofar as if the Court has to the power to award<lb/>
 a lesser amount, that it is equally equipped with the<lb/>
 power to award a higher amount. It is that principle<lb/>
 which applies with equal force to the Appeal Court and<lb/>
 though I do not dispute that a Court would normally not<lb/>
 permit a party to ask for enhancement unless an Appeal<lb/>
 or Cross-Objections have been filed but there could be a<lb/>
 very small category of cases in which the Court would<lb/>
 make an exception, the reason being that the essence of<lb/>
 doing justice requires that a Court will not refuse a<lb/>
 relief only because of a technical or a procedural bar. I<lb/>
 need to amplify here that if the technicalities are<lb/>
 upheld, the result would be doing injustice insofar as the<lb/>
 party will be left with a compensation lesser than what a<lb/>
 fair evaluation entitles the party to. Again, I do not on<lb/>
 the basis of the law as enunciated by the Courts in the<lb/>
 decisions set out by me above, subscribe to the view that<lb/>
 there exists any bar in the way of this Court exercising<lb/>
 such powers. The powers do exist under Order 41, Rule<lb/>
 33, Civil Procedure Code and more importantly, such<lb/>
 powers can certainly be exercised under section 151,<lb/>
 Civil Procedure Code in the interest of justice.&quot;<lb/>
 Applying the above decision, in Tamil Nadu State<lb/>
 Transport Corporation v. Vasantha and Ors. , 2006 (3)<lb/>
 ACJ 1917: 2006 (1) TN MAC 336 Justice Arumuga perumal<lb/>
 Adithyan has enhanced compensation, exercising power<lb/>
 under Or. 41, R. 33, CPC and Section 151, CPC.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>(ii) In Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation v. Saroja and Ors.,<lb/>
 reported in 2008 (1) TNMAC 352, this Court has considered the same<lb/>
 issue and answered as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;6. On point:<lb/>
</item>

<p>The learned counsel for the respondents/claimants<lb/>
 placing reliance on Order XLI, Rule 33 of C.P.C. and the<lb/>
 various decisions emerged thereunder would pray that the<lb/>
 compensation might be enhanced even though no cross-<lb/>
objection has been filed by the claimants, whereas the<lb/>
 learned counsel for the appellant -Transport Corporation<lb/>
 would cite the decision of the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in Oriental<lb/>
 Insurance Co. Ltd. v. R. Swaminathan &amp; Ors. , 2006 (2)<lb/>
 ACC 701 (SC), and develop his arguments to the effect that<lb/>
 unless there is a cross objection, the question of enhancing<lb/>
 the compensation would not arise. Hence, it is just and<lb/>
 necessary to refer to the decision of the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court<lb/>
 in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. R. Swaminathan &amp; Ors. ,<lb/>
 2006 (2)ACC 701 (SC). An excerpt from it would run thus:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;Apparently the first respondent claimant was satisfied<lb/>
 with the Tribunal&apos;s Award as he did not file any Appeal there<lb/>
 against to the High Court. Nonetheless, being aggrieved by<lb/>
 the Single Judge&apos;s judgment, the claimant filed a Letters<lb/>
 Patent Appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court.<lb/>
 This Appeal was allowed and by the impugned judgment the<lb/>
 High Court has awarded total compensation amounting to<lb/>
 Rs.7,44,000/-under different heads with a direction for<lb/>
 payment of inte-rest at 18% from the date of Petition. The<lb/>
 appellant-Insurance Company is aggrieved thereby and is in<lb/>
 Appeal before us.<lb/>
 The issue that arises in this case is, whether the<lb/>
 Division Bench of the High Court was justified in in-creasing<lb/>
 the compensation amount beyond the amount awarded by the<lb/>
 Tribunal despite the fact that the Award of the Tribunal was<lb/>
 not at all challenged by the claimant. The only reason given<lb/>
 by the Division Bench of the High Court for doing so is:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;In this connection, we may observe that we are aware<lb/>
 of the fact that we are enhancing the compensation even<lb/>
 though the injured has not claimed it. But, the question is<lb/>
 covered by catena of decisions justifying enhancement of<lb/>
 compensation even if cases where the injured has not<lb/>
 preferred an Appeal, provided the circumstances of the case<lb/>
 warrants the same.&quot;<lb/>
 To say the least, this was a very facial way of interfering with<lb/>
 the award when no interference was called for. We called<lb/>
 upon the learned Counsel on both sides to show us at least<lb/>
 one case (out of the catena of judgments referred to in the<lb/>
 impugned judgment) in support of this proposition. Learned<lb/>
 counsel frankly confessed that there was none. On the other<lb/>
 hand, the learned Counsel for the appellant drew our<lb/>
 attention the judgment of this Court in Banarsi v. Ram Phal,<lb/>
 2003 (2) SLT 258: 2003 (9) SCC 606, which supports the<lb/>
 proposition that in an Appeal filed by the defendant laying<lb/>
 challenge to the grant a smaller relief, the plaintiff as a<lb/>
 respondent cannot seek a higher relief if he had not filed an<lb/>
 Appeal on his own or had not taken any cross-objection. In<lb/>
 the present Appeal it would appear that the claimant neither<lb/>
 Appealed against the award of compensation passed by the<lb/>
 Tribunal, nor filed any cross-objection in the First Appeal<lb/>
 filed by the Insurance Company. Thus, we are satisfied that<lb/>
 the Division Bench of the High Court wholly erred in<lb/>
 increasing the compensation amount beyond the amount<lb/>
 awarded by the Tribunal in the Appeal filed by the Insurance<lb/>
 Company.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>7. A mere perusal of the excerpt from the said decision<lb/>
 would clearly indicate that the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in that<lb/>
 decision has not laid down as a universal rule of<lb/>
 interpretation of Order 41, Rule 33 of C.P.C. Taking into<lb/>
 consideration, the method and manner in which the Division<lb/>
 Bench of this Court in the Letters Patent Appeal, without<lb/>
 citing adequate reasons and precedents, enhanced the<lb/>
 compensation amount to an extent of Rs. 7,44,000/-with 18%<lb/>
 interest from that of Rs. 3,00,000/-awarded by the Single<lb/>
 Bench of the same Court, the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court found fault<lb/>
 with it.<lb/>
</p>

<p>8. Furthermore, the above excerpt also would reveal<lb/>
 that without even relying upon any precedent, the Division<lb/>
 Bench of this Court, simply enhanced the compensation and<lb/>
 that too to the extent of double that of what the Single Judge<lb/>
 of this Court ordered. It is also clear that when the Hon&apos;ble<lb/>
 Apex Court wanted a precedent in that regard, the learned<lb/>
 counsel for the appellant therein cited only the decision of<lb/>
 the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in Banarsi v. Ram Phal , 2003 (2)<lb/>
 SLT 258: 2003 (9) SCC 606. As such, in the peculiar facts and<lb/>
 circumstances of that case, the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court felt that<lb/>
 the power under order 41, Rule 33 of C.P.C. invoked by the<lb/>
 High Court and that too in a case where such an enhancement<lb/>
 was not at all warranted, looked askance at it. It is therefore<lb/>
 explicite that the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in the cited decision has<lb/>
 not laid down the law that even in a fit case, the High Court<lb/>
 should not invoke Order 41, Rule 33 of C.P.C. in the absence<lb/>
 of filing cross Appeal. Furthermore under Order 41, Rule 33,<lb/>
 there are earlier decisions of the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court, which<lb/>
 could be cited as under:<lb/>
</p>

<p>(i) Municipal Board, Mount Abu v. Hari Lal , 1988<lb/>
 ACJ 281.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(ii) Dangir v. Madan Mohna , AIR 1988 SC. 54.<lb/>
 (iii) M.D. Pallavan Transport Corporation Ltd., v.<lb/>
 Kalavathi , 1998 (1) ACJ 151.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(iv) State of Punjab v. Bakshish Singh , 1998 (8)<lb/>
 S.C.C. 222.<lb/>
</p>

<p>9. The perusal of the aforesaid Judgments of the<lb/>
 Hon&apos;ble Apex Court would clearly highlight that without filing<lb/>
 cross Appeal, the respondents in the Appeal could pray for<lb/>
 reliefs and that the High Court under Order 41, Rule 33 could<lb/>
 grant such reliefs also. This Court in several cases adhering to<lb/>
 the aforesaid decisions of the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court held that<lb/>
 under Order 41, Rule 33 of C.P.C., this Court could enhance<lb/>
 the compensation in appropriate cases. An excerpt from the<lb/>
 decision of this Court in Managing Director, Thanthai<lb/>
 Periyar Transport Corp., Villupuram v. Sundari Ammal<lb/>
 and four Others reported in 1999 (2) CTC 560 would run<lb/>
 thus:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately, in the instant case, there is no cross-<lb/>
objection. Therefore, it would be essential, in this context,<lb/>
 to consider whether this Court has got powers to enhance the<lb/>
 amount of compensation, in the event of coming to the<lb/>
 conclusion that the award was on the lower side, even though<lb/>
 there is no cross-objection by the claimants.<lb/>
 In Dangir v. Madan Mohan , AIR 1988 S.C. 54 and<lb/>
 M.D., Pallavan Transport Corporation Ltd., v. Kalavathi ,<lb/>
 1998 (1) A.C.J 151, it is held that this Court has got power<lb/>
 to enhance the compensation, even though the claimants had<lb/>
 not filed any cross-objection against the award seeking for<lb/>
 higher compensation, if this Court finds that the amount<lb/>
 awarded by the Tribunal is not just and adequate.<lb/>
 As pointed out by the Apex Court in State of Punjab v.<lb/>
 Bakshish Singh , 1998 (8) S.C.C. 222, the reading of the<lb/>
 provision would make it clear that the Appellate Court has<lb/>
 got wide power to do complete justice between the parties<lb/>
 and which enables this Court to pass such decree or order as<lb/>
 ought to have been passed or as the nature of the case may<lb/>
 require notwithstanding that the party in whose favour the<lb/>
 power is sought to be exercised has not filed any Appeal or<lb/>
 cross-objection.<lb/>
 The Apex Court in Dhangir v. Madan Mohan, A.I.R.<lb/>
 1988 S.C. 54, be referring Order 41, Rule 33, would make the<lb/>
 following observation:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;The Appellate Court could exercise the power under<lb/>
 Rule 33 even if the Appeal is only against a part of the decree<lb/>
 of the lower Court. The Appellate Court could exercise that<lb/>
 power in favour of all or any of the respondents although such<lb/>
 respondent may not have filed any Appeal or objection. The<lb/>
 sweep of the power under Rule 33 is wide enough to<lb/>
 determine any question not only between the appellant and<lb/>
 respondent, but also between respondent and co-<lb/>
respondents. The Appellate Court could pass any decree or<lb/>
 order which ought to have been passed in the circumstances<lb/>
 of the case. The words ?as the case may be require? used in<lb/>
 Rule 33, Order 41 have been put in wide terms to enable the<lb/>
 Appellate Court to pass any order or decree to meet the ends<lb/>
 of Justice. What then should be the constraint? We do not<lb/>
 find many, we are giving any liberal interpretation. The rule<lb/>
 itself is liberal enough. the only constraints that we could see<lb/>
 may be these: That the parties before the lower Court should<lb/>
 be there before the Appellate Court. The question raised<lb/>
 must properly arise out of judgment of the lower Court. If<lb/>
 these two requirements are there, the Appellate Court could<lb/>
 consider any objection against any part of the judgment or<lb/>
 decree of the lower Court. It is true that the power of the<lb/>
 Appellate Court under S. 33 is discretionary. But, it is a<lb/>
 proper exercise of judicial discretion to determine all<lb/>
 questions urged in order to render complete justice between<lb/>
 the parties. The Court should not refuse to exercise that<lb/>
 discretion on mere technicalities.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>10. And then the Division Bench of this Court in the<lb/>
 decision in The Managing Director, Annai Sathya Transport<lb/>
 Corporation Ltd., Dharmapuri v. Janardhanam and 7<lb/>
 others , 2000 (2) CTC 272 placing reliance on the decision of<lb/>
 the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court held a similar view that without cross<lb/>
 Appeal Order 41, Rule 33 of C.P.C. could be invoked in<lb/>
 appropriate cases. An excerpt from it would run thus:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;At this stage, learned counsel appearing for the<lb/>
 respondent/claimants would submit that the Tribunal has<lb/>
 awarded interest only from the date of the Judgment and not<lb/>
 from the date of the petition. The learned counsel for the<lb/>
 respondents/claimants would submit that even though no<lb/>
 Appeal has been filed by the respondents/claimants or no<lb/>
 cross-objections have been filed by them, this Court has<lb/>
 discretionary power by virtue of Order 41, Rule 33 of Code of<lb/>
 Civil Procedure and also in view of the rulings of the Supreme<lb/>
 Court in Dhangir v. Madan Mohan , AIR 1988 SC 54 to grant<lb/>
 the proper relief. Of course, the Apex Court has pointed out<lb/>
 in clear and categorical terms and the power conferred under<lb/>
 Order 41, Rule 33 on the Appellate Court is discre-tionary,<lb/>
 and then it must be used in proper case using the judicial<lb/>
 discretion to render justice. The Apex Court in United India<lb/>
 Insurance Co., Ltd., v. Narendra Pandu-rang Kadam and<lb/>
 others , 1995 (1) SCC 320 has clearly laid down that the rate<lb/>
 of interest must be awarded from the date of the petition<lb/>
 and not from the date of the Judgment.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>11. Over and above that the decision of the Hon&apos;ble<lb/>
 Three Judges? Bench of the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court, in Nagappa<lb/>
 v. Gurudayal Singh and others , 2003 ACJ 12: 2004 (2) TN<lb/>
 MAC 398 (SC), could be cited here. An excerpt from it would<lb/>
 run thus:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;Firstly, under the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act,<lb/>
 1988 (hereinafter referred to as ?the M.V. Act?), there is no<lb/>
 restriction that compensation could be awarded only up to<lb/>
 the amount claimed by the claimant. In an appropriate case<lb/>
 where from the evidence brought on record if Tribunal/Court<lb/>
 considers that claimant is entitled to get more compensation<lb/>
 than claimed, the Tribunal may pass such award. Only<lb/>
 embargo is -it should be &apos;just&apos; compensation, that is to say, it<lb/>
 should be neither arbitrary, fanciful nor unjustifiable from<lb/>
 the evidence. This would be clear by reference to the<lb/>
 relevant provisions of the M.V. Act. Section 166 provides that<lb/>
 an application for compensation arising out of an accident<lb/>
 involving the death of, or bodily injury to, persons arising out<lb/>
 of the use of motor vehicles, or damages to any property of a<lb/>
 third party so arising, or both, could be made (a) by the<lb/>
 person who has sustained the injury; or (b) by the owner of<lb/>
 the property; or (c) where death has resulted from the<lb/>
 accident, by all or any of the legal representatives of the<lb/>
 deceased; or (d) by any agent duly authorised by the person<lb/>
 injured or all or any of the legal representatives of the<lb/>
 deceased, as the case may be. Under the proviso to<lb/>
 subsection (1), all the legal representatives of the deceased<lb/>
 who have not joined as the claimants are to be impleaded as<lb/>
 respondents to the application for compensation. Other<lb/>
 important part of the said Section is subsection (4) which<lb/>
 provides that ?the Claims Tribunal shall treat any report of<lb/>
 accidents forwarded to it under subsection (6) of Section 158<lb/>
 as an application for compensation under this Act?. Hence,<lb/>
 Claims Tribunal in appropriate case can treat the report<lb/>
 forwarded to it as an application for compensation even<lb/>
 though no such claim is made or no specified amount is<lb/>
 claimed.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>(iii) In Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation v. Pothumponnu<lb/>
 reported in 2010 (1) CTC 104, this Court, held as follows:<lb/>
 &quot;17. Notice can be issued to the opposite<lb/>
 parties/respondents only in case where their rights are<lb/>
 going to be affected be way of variation/reduction. In<lb/>
 this case, the claimants are going to be benefited.<lb/>
 Hence, no notice is necessary in the appeal. When the<lb/>
 Tribunal commits a mistake that too a material<lb/>
 mistake, this Court cannot close its eyes and decide the<lb/>
 matter mechanically. When the mistake is noticed by<lb/>
 this Court, this Court has got power to do away with it,<lb/>
 even while dismissing the appeal at the admission stage<lb/>
 itself. The presence of the respondent is not a must.<lb/>
 When there is a case for admission, the matter can be<lb/>
 admitted and notice can be ordered. When there is no<lb/>
 case made out for admission, the appeal deserved to be<lb/>
 dismissed. While dismissing, the material irregularity<lb/>
 committed by the Tribunal can be set right by awarding<lb/>
 suitable amounts to the respondents without notice to<lb/>
 them. The presence of the claimants or absence does<lb/>
 not make any difference. Even if they are present and<lb/>
 they do not bring it to the notice of this Court about<lb/>
 the irregularity, this Court can always remedy the same<lb/>
 suo motu under Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil<lb/>
 Procedure and Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act<lb/>
 and invoking Articles 227 of the Constitution of India.<lb/>
 Moreover, Sections 163 and 166 are beneficial<lb/>
 provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act aimed at consoling<lb/>
 and compensating the victims of the accident. This<lb/>
 Court&apos;s approach should be humane in nature not<lb/>
 whittled down by technicalities. The powers of the<lb/>
 Court are wide enough to do complete justice.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>71. Reverting to the cases on hand, in C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, as<lb/>
 Mr.Sathieseelan, learned counsel for the respondents/claimants himself<lb/>
 has come forward to state that the income from the grocery shop be fixed<lb/>
 as Rs.6,500/-, the same is accepted. In State of Haryana v. Jasbir Kaur<lb/>
 reported in AIR 2003 SC 3696, the accident had occurred on 03.02.1999.<lb/>
 The deceased therein had 4 acres of land. Though no document was filed,<lb/>
 the Apex Court fixed the monthly income as Rs.3,000/-and then,<lb/>
 computed the compensation. In the case on hand, the accident has<lb/>
 occurred on 20.02.2012. The deceased had four acres of land. After<lb/>
 death, there would not be a total loss of income from agriculture, as<lb/>
 somebody in the family, may still engage in agricultural activity.<lb/>
 Therefore, income from agriculture is not added for the purpose of<lb/>
 computation of dependency. Thus, fixing the monthly income as<lb/>
</p>

<item>Rs.6,500/-, and considering the escalation of prices, possibility of earning<lb/>
 more in future, we deem it fit to add 50% towards future prospects and<lb/>
 accordingly, fix the monthly income as Rs.9,750/-(Rs.6,500 + Rs.3,250)<lb/>
 for the purpose of computing the loss of dependency, which works out to<lb/>
 Rs.14,04,000/-(Rs.9,750 x 12 x 16 x ¼). The accident has occurred on<lb/>
 17.11.2012. The income ceiling for the year 2012 is Rs.2,00,000/-. The<lb/>
 annual income works out to Rs.1,17,000/-. It is less than the statutory<lb/>
 limit for levy of Income-Tax.<lb/>
</item>

<p>72. On the aspect of compensation for pain and suffering, prior<lb/>
 to death, during hospitalisation, the same cannot be granted on the<lb/>
 principle of Actio Personalis Moritur-cum-personna. Some of the case laws<lb/>
 decided by various High Courts on this issue are hereunder:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;(i) The plain meaning of the maxim &quot;Actio<lb/>
 Personalis Moritur-cum-personna&quot; is that &quot;a personal action<lb/>
 dies with the parties to the cause of action&quot;. The above said<lb/>
 maxim is an invention of English Lawyers. In AIR 1967 SC<lb/>
 1124 [Girija Nandini Devi v. Bijendra Narain], the Supreme<lb/>
 Court observed as hereunder,<lb/>
 &quot;The maxim &quot;Actio Personalis Moritur-cum-personna&quot;<lb/>
 means a personal action dies with the person has a limited<lb/>
 application. It operates in a limited class of actions ex<lb/>
 delicto such as actions for damages, assault or other<lb/>
 personal injuries not causing the death of the party, and in<lb/>
 other actions where after the death of the party the relief<lb/>
 granted could not be enjoyed or granting it would be<lb/>
 nugatory. An action for account is not an action for<lb/>
 damages ex delicto, and does not fall with the enumerated<lb/>
 classes. Nor is such that the relief claimed being personal<lb/>
 could not be enjoyed after death, or granting it would be<lb/>
 nugatory&quot;.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(ii) However, the maxim &quot;Actio Personalis Moritur-<lb/>
cum-personna&quot; relates only to the personal injury, pain and<lb/>
 suffering experienced by the deceased on account of injuries<lb/>
 and it cannot be extended to the loss of estate of the<lb/>
 deceased. Reference can be had to the decision of this<lb/>
 Court in Thailammai V. A.V.Mallayya Pillai reported in<lb/>
 1975 ACJ 448, wherein, this Court held that the cause of<lb/>
 action in respect of damages to the estate of the deceased<lb/>
 survives and it is passed over to the legal<lb/>
 representatives/dependants.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(iii) Explaining the maxim &quot;Actio Personalis Moritur-<lb/>
cum-personna&quot; and its applicability to the Motor Accident<lb/>
 cases with reference to Section 306 of the Indian Succession<lb/>
 Act, the Gujarat High Court in Jennabai V. Gujarat State<lb/>
 Road Transport Corporation [1991 ACJ 585], at Paragraph<lb/>
 10, 16 and 18, held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;10. Tort, frequently, involves a non-pecuniary loss.<lb/>
</item>

<p>Even pecuniary loss of the deceased, being personal to him<lb/>
 has no proper entitlement to a place in the assessment of<lb/>
 the damages which goes to his estate. But for the pecuniary<lb/>
 loss suffered by the deceased on account of such injuries, an<lb/>
 action would lie or action would survive for the benefit of<lb/>
 the estate of the deceased. The claim, on account of loss to<lb/>
 the estate of the deceased, would, undoubtedly, survive and<lb/>
 would pass over to his heirs or legal representatives. Section<lb/>
 306 of the Indian Succession Act does not exclude right to<lb/>
 recover claim on the basis of proprietary right. In a case of<lb/>
 personal injuries, arising out of vehicular accident, it may<lb/>
 include pecuniary loss as well. This pecuniary loss or any loss<lb/>
 which referable to the loss to estate would be a proprietary<lb/>
 or right pertaining to property. Therefore, the right to<lb/>
 maintain the action or to continue the action for recovery of<lb/>
 pecuniary and proprietary loss which are referable or<lb/>
 attributable to the loss to the estate, cannot be said to have<lb/>
 been taken away by the provisions of Section 306 of the<lb/>
 Indian Succession Act. If the provisions of Section 306 of the<lb/>
 Indian Succession Act are extended to all causes of action,<lb/>
 including those affecting proprietary or property, i.e., to the<lb/>
 estate, it would be to stultify to a great extent the<lb/>
 provisions of Section 212 (2). If it is stretched to that, it<lb/>
 would be nugatory, which empowers a Hindu, Mohammadan,<lb/>
 Buddhist, Sikh, Jain, Indian Christian or Parsi for applying for<lb/>
 letters of administration in case of intestacy. Such a<lb/>
 construction of section 306 of the Indian Succession Act<lb/>
 would raise a direct conflict with the provisions of Order 22,<lb/>
 Rule 3(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. Moreover, the<lb/>
 liability to pay compensation is created immediately on the<lb/>
 occurrence of the accident to the person suffering the injury<lb/>
 and must amount to a debt payable to him and pass over to<lb/>
 the heirs of the workman on his death and does not abate.<lb/>
 Thus, provisions of Section 306 of the Indian Succession Act<lb/>
 have no application of such cases. Therefore, the maxim<lb/>
 Actio Personalis Moritur-cum-personna on which Section 306<lb/>
 of the Indian Succession Act is based, cannot have a blanket<lb/>
 applicability in all actions even in a case of personal injuries<lb/>
 wherein the damages flow from the head or under the head<lb/>
 of loss to the estate. It may be mentioned that in England,<lb/>
 the said maxim has been criticised as harsh, unconscionable<lb/>
 and unjust. The rightful claim falling in the realm of<lb/>
 pecuniary or proprietary or loss to the deceased&apos;s estate<lb/>
 would survive, which is not personal to the deceased. It may<lb/>
 also be mentioned that the words &apos;personal injury&apos; occurring<lb/>
 in Section 306 mean bodily or physical injury as opposed to<lb/>
 the injury to the proprietary right. Therefore, a cause of<lb/>
 action in respect of injury to the property or loss referable<lb/>
 to the deceased&apos;s estate flowing from the personal injury<lb/>
 would not fall within the exception, but would, undoubtedly,<lb/>
 survive. But, if interpreted otherwise, as held by the<lb/>
 Tribunal, would mean unjust enrichment and benefit to the<lb/>
 wrongdoer&apos;s estate and unjustifiable injury to the estate of<lb/>
 the deceased. Unfortunately, the Tribunal has failed to<lb/>
 address itself to such a vital and important aspect while<lb/>
 considering and examining the provisions of Section 306 of<lb/>
 the Indian Succession Act.<lb/>
</p>

<p>16. It is very clear from para 7 of the impugned<lb/>
 judgment that the deceased had claimed Rs.2,200/-for<lb/>
 Medical expenses and Rs.575/-for Miscellaneous expenses,<lb/>
 etc. The claim under such heads would, undoubtedly, fall<lb/>
 within the field of loss to the estate. If such amount would<lb/>
 not have been spent by the deceased it was to go to the<lb/>
 hands of the appellants or legal representatives of the<lb/>
 deceased. Likewise, loss of past income awardable to the<lb/>
 deceased on account of wrong done to him subject to<lb/>
 reasonable expenses which would have been incurred by the<lb/>
 deceased for himself would also be a loss to the estate. It<lb/>
 can safely be concluded that had the deceased not sustained<lb/>
 the injuries, there would not have been loss of income and<lb/>
 consequently there would not have been any detrimental<lb/>
 effect on the estate of the deceased. If the unfortunate<lb/>
 accident had not occurred the income or expenses falling<lb/>
 within the head of loss to the estate would have augmented<lb/>
 the estate and same would have gone in the hands of the<lb/>
 heirs and legal representatives of the deceased. The loss of<lb/>
 past income for the period from the date of accident till the<lb/>
 inability on the part of the deceased to earn on account of<lb/>
 the injuries, subject to reasonable expenses for himself,<lb/>
 would also form a part of estate of the deceased. No doubt,<lb/>
 the loss of income occurring after the death of the deceased<lb/>
 would not be a loss to the estate. The action for amount of<lb/>
 claim which is not attributable to the loss of estate of the<lb/>
 deceased could not survive to the appellants. In other words,<lb/>
 the heirs and legal representatives of the deceased would<lb/>
 not be entitled to and eligible to claim the amount of claim<lb/>
 which is not referable to or not attributable to the loss of<lb/>
 the estate. Unfortunately, the Tribunal applied the doctrine<lb/>
 of actio personalis moritur cum personna along with the<lb/>
 provisions of Section 306 of the Indian Succession Act in<lb/>
 respect of the entire claim without taking into account the<lb/>
 separate claim under the head of loss to the estate of the<lb/>
 deceased, Abdul Karim Musa. This proposition of law,<lb/>
 unfortunately, could not be brought to the notice of the<lb/>
 Tribunal. With the result, the approach of the Tribunal in so<lb/>
 far as it related to the dismissal of the claim in respect of<lb/>
 loss to the estate of the deceased cannot be sustained.<lb/>
</p>

<p>18. Incidentally, it may also be mentioned that could<lb/>
 inability to compensate under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation<lb/>
 Act, 1923, in case of an employment injury to the workman<lb/>
 abate or die on account of demise of the workman<lb/>
 unconnected with the employment? Suppose, in a given case,<lb/>
 the workman files an application for compensation under<lb/>
 Section 3 of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1923, and<lb/>
 during the pendency of the proceedings he dies otherwise<lb/>
 than as a result of the employment injuries. Would that right<lb/>
 be lost in view of the provisions of Section 306 of the Indian<lb/>
 Succession Act? If the interpretation made by the Tribunal in<lb/>
 the present case is accepted then the liability to compensate<lb/>
 him under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1923, would<lb/>
 abate. Of course, the language in Section 306 of the Indian<lb/>
 Succession Act, no doubt, appears to be general. But it is<lb/>
 not always that a general import must necessarily receive a<lb/>
 general and wide meaning divorced from the material facts<lb/>
 of the case. The expression &quot;other personal injuries not<lb/>
 causing the death of the party&quot; is preceded by the words,<lb/>
 &apos;defamation, assault&apos; as defined in the Penal Code. The words<lb/>
 &apos;other personal injuries..... must, therefore, receive colour<lb/>
 from the earlier words and ought to be construed with the<lb/>
 words preceding. It is also settled proposition of law that<lb/>
 benevolent legislation is required to be construed liberally so<lb/>
 as to advance the underlying object and purpose of the<lb/>
 provision. It is also well stated that if interpretation of a<lb/>
 welfare legislation or any provision of the statute is capable<lb/>
 of two constructions, that construction should be preferred<lb/>
 which furthers the policy of the Act or provision concerned<lb/>
 and which is more beneficiary for the class in whose interest<lb/>
 the law has been made.&quot;<lb/>

<p>(iv) In V.Mepherson v. Shiv Charan Singh &amp; Ors.,<lb/>
 reported in I(1998) ACC 6, the Delhi High Court, while<lb/>
 testing the correctness of the award passed by the Motor<lb/>
 Accident Claims Tribunal, considered as to whether personal<lb/>
 damages awarded to the claimant/injured are inheritable or<lb/>
 not. In the said case, the death was not due to the accident.<lb/>
 The main contention was that the claim for enhancement for<lb/>
 general damages after the death of the objector does not<lb/>
 survive. Answering the issue, the Court at Paragraph 3,<lb/>
 observed as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;3. So far as the contention of Mr.Tarun Johri that<lb/>
 claim for damages which was on account of suffering and<lb/>
 pain suffered by the deceased, to my mind, it would abet on<lb/>
 the death of the injured. But so far as other claims under<lb/>
 other heads those would not come to an end on the death of<lb/>
 the objector. The right to sue would survive even on the<lb/>
 death of the objector. As a matter of fact claim on account<lb/>
 of special diet, medicine, conveyance etc., are such which<lb/>
 related to the loss of the property, therefore, right to sue<lb/>
 would not abet on the death of the objector. It would<lb/>
 survive to his legal heirs as held by the High Court of Punjab<lb/>
 and Haryana in the case of Joti Ram &amp; Ors. v. Chaman Lal &amp;<lb/>
 Ors., AIR 1985 Punjab &amp; Haryana page 2=I (1986) ACC<lb/>
</p>

<p>550.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>(v) In Kartar Kaur v. Dayal Singh reported in II (1999)<lb/>
 ACC 372 (DB), one of the issues raised before the Division<lb/>
 Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court was about the<lb/>
 continuance of the appeal by the Legal Representatives of<lb/>
 the injures/claimant (sons of the deceased) based on the<lb/>
 Doctrine &quot;Actio Personalis Moritur cum Persona&quot;, ie., a<lb/>
 personal claim dies with the person (claimant). Answering<lb/>
 the issue, at Paragraph 13, the Division Bench held as<lb/>
 follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;13. In view of the above, we are of the view that<lb/>
 where the injured claimant dies as a result of the injuries<lb/>
 during the pendency of his claim for compensation, the legal<lb/>
 representatives would be entitled to pursue the claim as in<lb/>
 case of death caused in an accident by the use of motor<lb/>
 vehicle. Where the injured dies his natural death and not<lb/>
 because of injuries suffered in motor accident, the legal<lb/>
 representatives would be entitled to pursue the claim to the<lb/>
 extent as recognised by Section 306 of the Indian Succession<lb/>
 Act, that is, the claim on account of loss to the estate of the<lb/>
 deceased. Where in a case, the compensation has been<lb/>
 awarded to the injured and an appeal is preferred and during<lb/>
 the pendency of the appeal, claimant/injured dies, his legal<lb/>
 representatives can continue the appeal for enhancement of<lb/>
 compensation.&quot;<lb/>
 (vi) A similar issue came up for consideration before<lb/>
 the Division Bench of Karnataka High Court in Sridevi v.<lb/>
 Mastak Ahamad reported in I (2002) ACC 262 (DB). In the<lb/>
 above reported judgment, a minor, aged about four years,<lb/>
 sustained injures. On the claim made by her father,<lb/>
 Rs.72,000/-was awarded. Aggrieved by the inadequacy of<lb/>
 compensation, an appeal was preferred by the injured<lb/>
 through her father and during the pendency of the appeal,<lb/>
 she died. Legal Representatives were brought on record. It<lb/>
 was submitted that the compensation for Medical Expenses,<lb/>
 Pain and Suffering, Loss of Amenities and general damages<lb/>
 was on the lower side. Following the decision in<lb/>
 V.Mepherson&apos;s case, the Division Bench held that the appeal<lb/>
 is abated in so far as the claim for damages for pain and<lb/>
 suffering is concerned and on the question of expenses on<lb/>
 medicines, special diet, conveyance etc., as the expenses<lb/>
 relate to loss of estate, they would not abate.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(vii) Similar view was taken by the Himachal High<lb/>
 Court in Ram Ashari v. H.R.T.C., reported in IV (2005) ACC<lb/>
</p>

<p>379. At paragraph 6 to 8 of the judgment, it is held as<lb/>
 follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;</item>

<p>6. It is well settled law that an action in torts for<lb/>
 claim of compensation for damages on account of injuries<lb/>
 suffered by an injured is a right personal to the injured. This<lb/>
 right cannot be continued by the legal heirs or legal<lb/>
 representatives. It is no doubt true that the legal heirs or<lb/>
 the legal representatives can continue the proceedings<lb/>
 insofar as they relate to the loss to the estate such as<lb/>
 medical expenses, amount spent on treatment etc. However,<lb/>
 the claim with regard to pain and suffering, future loss of<lb/>
 income and such related matters is an action which is<lb/>
 personal to the injured alone and cannot be continued after<lb/>
 his death unless it is proved that the death is the result of<lb/>
 the injuries suffered in the accident.<lb/>
</p>

<p>7. A Division Bench of this Court in Narinder Kaur v.<lb/>
 State of H.P., II (1991) ACC 206 = (1991) 2 ACJ 767, held<lb/>
 as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;(8) We have heard the learned counsel for the parties<lb/>
 and gone through the records. The principle of actio<lb/>
 personalis moritur cum persona relates only to the personal<lb/>
 or bodily injuries and not to the loss caused to the estate of<lb/>
 the deceased by the tort-feasor. In its applicability, the<lb/>
 principle stands considerably modified by the provisions of<lb/>
 Section 306 of the Indian Succession Act, which clearly lays<lb/>
 down that all demands whatsoever and all rights to<lb/>
 prosecute or defend any action or special proceedings<lb/>
 existing in favour of or against a person at the time of his<lb/>
 death survive except causes of action for defamation, assault<lb/>
 and other personal injuries not causing death of the party<lb/>
 etc., which come to an end with the death of the injured.<lb/>
 The loss of the estate is thus not covered by the exceptions<lb/>
 contained in Section 306 of the Indian Succession Act. While<lb/>
 taking this view, we are fortified by the decisions of the<lb/>
 Supreme Court in Melepurath Sankunni Ezhuthassan v.<lb/>
 Thekittil Geopalankutty Nair, 1986 (1) ACJ 440 : AIR<lb/>
 1986 SC 411 : 1986 (2) TAC 216, and M.Veerappa v.<lb/>
 Evelyn Sequeria, AIR 1988 SC 506. The claimants as legal<lb/>
 representatives of the original claimant were, as such,<lb/>
 entitled to be substituted in his place with a view to<lb/>
 continue the proceedings in the case and to have a decision<lb/>
 on the claim in respect of the loss caused to the estate of<lb/>
 the deceased.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>8. Keeping in view of the settled position of law and<lb/>
 the fact that in the present case there is no claim for loss to<lb/>
 the estate and the entire claim is based on the personal<lb/>
 claim of the deceased Karam Chand, the appeal cannot be<lb/>
 continued and prosecuted by the legal representatives.&quot;<lb/>
 (viii) A Full Bench of the Karnataka High Court in<lb/>
 Uttam Kumar (deceased) v. Madhav and another, 2002<lb/>
 ACJ 1828, had an occasion to consider an appeal filed by the<lb/>
 legal representatives of the deceased for enhancement of<lb/>
 the compensation. Short facts of the reported case are as<lb/>
 follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;In an accident that occurred on 07.01.1995, where<lb/>
 the Uttam Kumar sustained injuries. He was admitted in the<lb/>
 hospital for his treatment and he incurred expenses. He<lb/>
 claimed compensation. The Tribunal awarded Rs.36,250/-<lb/>
with costs and interest. Not satisfied with the compensation,<lb/>
 he preferred an appeal for an enhancement. Pending<lb/>
 disposal of the appeal, he died and his aged parents were<lb/>
 brought on record. The Division Bench of the Karnataka High<lb/>
 Court found that the cause of action will not survive and<lb/>
 Lrs., of the deceased claimant will not be entitled to<lb/>
 compensation. However, the Division Bench observed that in<lb/>
 view of the amended provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act,<lb/>
 1988 and the decision of the Supreme Court in Kannamma v.<lb/>
 Deputy General Manager, Karnataka State Road Transport<lb/>
 Corporation reported in 1991 ACJ 707 (Karnataka),<lb/>
 referred this matter to a Larger Bench. The Full Bench which<lb/>
 examined the issue with reference to the provisions of the<lb/>
 Motor Vehicles Act and Indian Succession Act, 1925 and<lb/>
 answered as follows:-<lb/>
(i) A claim petition presented under Section 110-A of<lb/>
 the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, by the person sustaining bodily<lb/>
 injuries in a motor accident, claiming compensation for<lb/>
 personal injuries as also for compensation towards expenses,<lb/>
 loss of income, etc. (loss to the estate) cannot, on such<lb/>
 person&apos;s death occurring not as a result or consequence of<lb/>
 bodily injuries sustained from a motor accident, be<lb/>
 prosecuted by his/her legal representatives; but<lb/>
 (ii) A claim petition presented under Section 110-A of<lb/>
 the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, by the person sustaining bodily<lb/>
 injuries in a motor accident, claiming compensation for<lb/>
 personal injuries as also for compensation towards expenses,<lb/>
 loss of income, etc. (loss to the estate) can, on such person&apos;s<lb/>
 death occurring as a result or consequence of bodily injuries<lb/>
 sustained in the motor accident, be prosecuted by his/her<lb/>
 legal representatives only insofar as the claim for<lb/>
 compensation in that claim petition relates to loss of estate<lb/>
 of the deceased person due to bodily injuries sustained in<lb/>
 the motor accident.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>73. In the case on hand, the deceased was survived by wife, son,<lb/>
 daughter and parents. At the time of claim, children were aged about 12<lb/>
 and 10 years respectively. In Rajesh&apos;s case, cited supra, the Hon&apos;ble<lb/>
 Supreme Court has awarded Rs.1,00,000/-as compensation under the<lb/>
 head, loss of love and affection to each child. Therefore, following the<lb/>
 said decision, children are awarded compensation of Rs.1,00,000/-each.<lb/>
 Parents are awarded compensation of Rs.50,000/-each. Total<lb/>
 compensation awarded under the head, loss of love and affection, is<lb/>
 Rs.3,00,000/-. Rs.1,000/-is awarded under the head, damage to clothes<lb/>
 and articles. The other amounts are sustained.<lb/>
</p>

<p>74. The Claims Tribunal, after adjudication, has awarded<lb/>
 Rs.18,82,600/-. Having regard to the reworking of compensation under<lb/>
 various heads, stated supra, the total compensation, due and payable to<lb/>
 the legal representatives of the deceased/respondents in C.M.A.No.723 of<lb/>
 2015, is determined as Rs.18,40,000/-and it is apportioned as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>Loss of Dependency<lb/>
 : Rs.14,04,000/-<lb/>
Loss of Love and Affection<lb/>
 : Rs. 3,00,000/-<lb/>
Loss of Consortium<lb/>
 : Rs. 1,00,000/-<lb/>
Transportation<lb/>
 : Rs.<lb/>
 10,000/-<lb/>
Funeral Expenses<lb/>
 : Rs.<lb/>
 25,000/-<lb/>
Damages to clothes &amp; Articles : Rs.<lb/>
 1,000/-<lb/>
---------------------<lb/>
Total : Rs.18,40,000/-<lb/>
---------------------<lb/>
</item>

<p>75. In C.M.A.No.3273 of 2014, the legal representatives of the<lb/>
 deceased/claimants have produced sufficient evidence to prove that the<lb/>
 deceased owned a lorry. Ex.P11 is the Transfer of National Permit in the<lb/>
 name of the deceased and he had a driving licence. While that be so, the<lb/>
 contention of the appellant-Insurance Company that the Tribunal has<lb/>
 erred in accepting the avocation and monthly income of Rs.15,000/-,<lb/>
 from operating the lorry, cannot be accepted. On the claim of the legal<lb/>
 representatives of the deceased/claimants, to add 50% under the head,<lb/>
 future prospects, it is also to be considered, as to whether, there was no<lb/>
 possibility of earning any further income from operating the lorry. Still<lb/>
 the vehicle can be let out for earning. Unless there is proof of sale of the<lb/>
 vehicle, after the accident and that it was not fetching any income, it<lb/>
 cannot be said that the family of the bereaved, has lost the entire income<lb/>
 in future. However, there could be some reduction. Considering the said<lb/>
 aspect, addition of 30% under the head, future prospects, would be<lb/>
 reasonable. Therefore, the claim to enhance the percentage to 50% is<lb/>
 answered in the negative. But at the same time, the plea of the legal<lb/>
 representatives of the deceased/claimants that the compensation under<lb/>
 the heads, consortium of Rs.25,000/-, loss of love and affection of<lb/>
 Rs.30,000/-and funeral expenses of Rs.5,000/-is less and therefore,<lb/>
 requires to be enhanced.<lb/>
</p>

<p>76. On the aspect of awarding compensation for funeral<lb/>
 expenses, in Rajesh and others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others reported in<lb/>
 2013(3) CTC 883, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court held as follows:<lb/>
 &quot;21. We may also take judicial notice of the fact that<lb/>
 the Tribunals have been quite frugal with regard to award of<lb/>
 compensation under the head &apos;Funeral Expenses&apos;. The &apos;Price<lb/>
 Index&apos;, it is a fact has gone up in that regard also. The head<lb/>
 &apos;Funeral Expenses&apos; does not mean the fee paid in the<lb/>
 crematorium or fee paid for the use of space in the cemetery.<lb/>
 There are many other expenses in connection with funeral<lb/>
 and, if the deceased is follower of any particular religion,<lb/>
 there are several religious practices and conventions pursuant<lb/>
 to death in a family. All those are quite expensive. Therefore,<lb/>
 we are of the view that it will be just, fair and equitable,<lb/>
 under the head of &apos;Funeral Expenses&apos;, in the absence of<lb/>
 evidence to the contrary for higher expenses, to award at<lb/>
 least an amount of Rs.25,000/-.&quot;<lb/>
 Therefore, funeral expenses awarded is enhanced to Rs.25,000/-.<lb/>
</p>

<p>77. The issue as to whether, brother and sister of the deceased<lb/>
 can maintain a claim petition for compensation has been considered by<lb/>
 this Court in Oriental Insurance Company v. Rangamal reported in 2011<lb/>
 (1) TCJ 7 = 2011 AAC 1168 and Managing Director, Tamil Nadu State<lb/>
 Transport Corporation Ltd., v. M.Shanthi reported in 2010 CIJ 374 Mad<lb/>
 (2). In the former case, it was the contention of the appellant-Insurance<lb/>
 Company that brother/sister is entitled to claim compensation only under<lb/>
 &apos;No Fault Liability&apos;. Following the decisions of the Apex Court in Gujarat<lb/>
 State Road Transport Corporation, Ahmedabad v. Ramanbhai<lb/>
 Prabhatbhai and another reported in 1987 ACJ 561, Vidya Dhar Dubey<lb/>
 and others v. U.P.State Road Transport Corporation reported in 1997<lb/>
 ACJ 1388, Oriental Insurance Company Ltd., v. Naresh Chandra<lb/>
 Agarwal and others reported in 2000 ACJ 931, Govindasamy v. Ravi<lb/>
 and others, reported in 2003 (1) MLJ 253, Kishan Lal v. Bharosi Lal<lb/>
 reported in II (2003) ACC 225, Managing Director, K.S.R.T.C., v.<lb/>
 Venkataramappa K.S., reported in III (2003) ACC 457 (DB), New India<lb/>
 Assurance Co. Ltd., v. Ashwin Vrajlal Rajgor reported in 2005 ACJ<lb/>
 1618, A.Manavalagan v. A.Krishnamurthy reported in I (2005) ACC 304<lb/>
 (DB), this Court held that brother and sister of the deceased are entitled<lb/>
 to maintain a claim for loss of estate and accordingly, rejected the said<lb/>
 contention. However, in the case on hand, apportionment of<lb/>
 compensation among the claimants, has not been questioned by them.<lb/>
 But no compensation is awarded to Sisters, under the head, loss of love<lb/>
 and affection. A sum of Rs.50,000/-each, is awarded to the sisters and<lb/>
 parents of the deceased. Altogether, a sum of Rs.2,00,000/-is awarded<lb/>
 under the head, loss of love and affection.<lb/>
</p>

<p>78.<lb/>
 &apos;Consortium&apos; as per the Best v. Samuel Fox reported in 1952<lb/>
 AC 716 means, &quot;Duty owned by a wife to her husband and vice versa,<lb/>
 companionship, love and affection, comfort, mutual services, sexual<lb/>
 intercourse, etc.&quot; Consortium is not a pecuniary loss. It is certainly a<lb/>
 conventional damage awarded to a widow, who has lost her husband. In<lb/>
 Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others reported in 2013(3) CTC<lb/>
 883, the Apex Court, while observing that at least a sum of Rs.1 Lakh has<lb/>
 to be awarded to the widow, for loss of consortium, held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;In legal parlance, &apos;Consortium&apos; is the right of the<lb/>
 spouse to the company, care, help, comfort, guidance,<lb/>
 society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or<lb/>
 her mate. That non-pecuniary head of damages has not<lb/>
 been properly understood by our Courts. The loss of<lb/>
 companionship, love, care and protection, etc., the spouse<lb/>
 is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately.<lb/>
 The concept of non-pecuniary damage for Loss of<lb/>
 Consortium is one of the major heads of award of<lb/>
 compensation in other parts of the world more particularly<lb/>
 in the United States of America, Australia, etc. English<lb/>
 Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get<lb/>
 compensation even during the period of temporary<lb/>
 disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made<lb/>
 an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse&apos;s affection,<lb/>
 comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance,<lb/>
 protection, care and sexual relations during the future<lb/>
 years. Unlike the compensation awarded in other countries<lb/>
 and other jurisdictions, since the legal heirs are otherwise<lb/>
 adequately compensated for the pecuniary loss, it would<lb/>
 not be proper to award a major amount under this head.<lb/>
 Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and<lb/>
 reasonable that the Courts award atleast Rupees one lakh<lb/>
 for Loss of Consortium.&quot;<lb/>
 Following the same, a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-is awarded as loss of<lb/>
 consortium.<lb/>
</p>

<p>79. Now, let us come to the dependency compensation. If 30% is<lb/>
 added to the income drawn at the time of death, under the future<lb/>
 prospects, then it works out to Rs.19,500/-. The annual income works out<lb/>
 to Rs.2,34,000/-. In Shyamwati Sharma v. Karam Singh reported in 2010<lb/>
 (12) SCC 378, the Supreme Court at Paragraphs 8 and 9, held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;</item>

<p>7. The submission of the respondents that the<lb/>
 deduction of 30% from the salary is not warranted in view of<lb/>
 the decision in Sarla Verma, is not sound. In Sarla Verma, the<lb/>
 monthly salary of the deceased was only Rs.4004/-and the<lb/>
 annual income even after taking note of future prospects was<lb/>
 Rs.72072/-. The income was in a range which was exempt<lb/>
 from tax, if the permissible deductions were applied.<lb/>
 Therefore, this Court did not make any deduction towards<lb/>
 income-tax. But this Court made it clear that where the<lb/>
 annual income is in the taxable range, appropriate deduction<lb/>
 should be made towards tax.<lb/>
</p>

<p>9. In this case as the annual income has been worked<lb/>
 out as Rs.2,48,292/-, appropriate deduction has to be made<lb/>
 towards income-tax. The rate of income tax is a varying<lb/>
 figure, with reference to taxable income after permissible<lb/>
 deductions and the year of assessment. The High Court has<lb/>
 assessed the deduction as 30% and on the facts, we do not<lb/>
 propose to disturb it. We however make it clear that while<lb/>
 ascertaining the income of the deceased, any deductions<lb/>
 shown in the salary certificate as deductions towards GPF,<lb/>
 life insurance premium, repayments of loans etc., should not<lb/>
 be excluded from the income. The deduction towards income<lb/>
 tax/surcharge alone should be considered to arrive at the net<lb/>
 income of the deceased.&quot;<lb/>
 The ratio laid down in Shyamwati Sharma&apos;s case, is reiterated in Manasvi<lb/>
 Jain v. Delhi Transport Corporation reported in 2014 (1) TNMAC 647.<lb/>
</p>

<p>80. The accident has occurred on 20.02.2012. For the financial<lb/>
 year 2012, 10% of the income has to be deducted towards Income-Tax.<lb/>
 Thus, excluding the ceiling limit of Rs.2,00,000/-, Income-Tax has to be<lb/>
 calculated for the remaining amount of Rs.34,000/-, which works out to<lb/>
 Rs.3,400/-(10% of Rs.34,000/-). Thus, after deducting Income-Tax, the<lb/>
 monthly income to be fixed for the purpose of computing the loss of<lb/>
 dependency is Rs.2,30,600/-. There is no quarrel over multiplier &apos;16&apos;<lb/>
 applied by the Claims Tribunal. After deducting 1/4 th towards the<lb/>
 personal and living expenses of the deceased, loss of dependency works<lb/>
 out to Rs.24,59,733/-.<lb/>
 Transportation expenses of Rs.5,000/-is<lb/>
 sustained. In addition, a sum of Rs.1000/-is awarded for damages to<lb/>
 clothes and articles. After reworking, the total compensation due and<lb/>
 payable to the legal representatives of the deceased/respondents in<lb/>
 C.M.A.No.3273 of 2014, is Rs.27,90,733/-and it is apportioned as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>Loss of Dependency<lb/>
 : Rs.24,59,733/-<lb/>
Loss of Love and Affection<lb/>
 : Rs. 2,00,000/-<lb/>
Loss of Consortium<lb/>
 : Rs. 1,00,000/-<lb/>
Funeral Expenses<lb/>
 : Rs.<lb/>
 25,000/-<lb/>
Transportation<lb/>
 : Rs.<lb/>
 5,000/-<lb/>
Damages to clothes &amp; Articles : Rs.<lb/>
 1,000/-<lb/>
---------------------<lb/>
Total : Rs.27,90,733/-<lb/>
---------------------<lb/>
</item>

<item>81. In C.M.A.No.2386 of 2015, upon perusal of Ex.P6, Pay Slip for<lb/>
 the month of April, 2011, produced by the learned counsel for the<lb/>
 respondents/claimants, we find that the deceased was a Senior Factory<lb/>
 Assistant in Tamil Nadu Co-operative Milk Federation Limited and earned<lb/>
 Rs.18,900.40 per month. Out of the said amount, the following deductions<lb/>
 have been made by the employer,<lb/>
 CD Amount<lb/>
 : Rs.5,651/-<lb/>
Provident Fund<lb/>
 : Rs. 780/-<lb/>
LIC<lb/>
 : Rs. 209/-<lb/>
Special Provident Fund<lb/>
 : Rs. 70/-<lb/>
</item>

<item>Family Benefit Fund<lb/>
 : Rs. 40/-<lb/>
Festival Advance<lb/>
 : Rs. 100/-<lb/>
---------------<lb/>
Total : Rs.6,950/-<lb/>
---------------<lb/>
</item>

<p>82. Out of the deductions, General Provident Fund, Special<lb/>
 Provident Fund and Family Benefit Fund were payments made by the<lb/>
 deceased and that the same would be refunded in lumpsum, at the time<lb/>
 of retirement or death. Premium collected towards LIC premium also<lb/>
 would be refunded to the Government servant, on attaining the age of<lb/>
 superannuation or at the time of death. Therefore, the deductions made<lb/>
 by the employer, under the above heads, in the salary slip, while arriving<lb/>
 at net salary, under the above heads, should be added, while determining<lb/>
 the actual monthly income of any salaried servant, as decided by this<lb/>
 Court in The Manager, National Insurance Co., Ltd., v. Padmavathy &amp; 8<lb/>
 others reported in 2007-2-L.W.182.<lb/>
</p>

<p>83. The issue as to how, the claims tribunal/ courts should<lb/>
 determine the monthly income of the deceased, for the purpose of<lb/>
 computing the loss of contribution to the family, has been considered in<lb/>
 National Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Indira Srivastava &amp; Others, reported<lb/>
 in 2008 (2) SCC 763, wherein, the Supreme Court held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;</p>

<p>9. The term &apos;income&apos; has different connotations<lb/>
 for different purposes. A court of law, having regard to the<lb/>
 change in societal conditions must consider the question not<lb/>
 only having regard to pay packet the employee carries home<lb/>
 at the end of the month but also other perks which are<lb/>
 beneficial to the members of the entire family. Loss caused<lb/>
 to the family on a death of a near and dear one can hardly be<lb/>
 compensated on monetary terms.<lb/>
</p>

<p>10. Section 168 of the Act uses the word &apos;just<lb/>
 compensation&apos; which, in our opinion, should be assigned a<lb/>
 broad meaning. We cannot, in determining the issue involved<lb/>
 in the matter, lose sight of the fact that the private sector<lb/>
 companies in place of introducing a pension scheme takes<lb/>
 recourse to payment of contributory Provident Fund, Gratuity<lb/>
 and other perks to attract the people who are efficient and<lb/>
 hard working. Different offers made to an officer by the<lb/>
 employer, same may be either for the benefit of the<lb/>
 employee himself or for the benefit of the entire family. If<lb/>
 some facilities are being provided whereby the entire family<lb/>
 stands to benefit, the same, in our opinion, must be held to<lb/>
 be relevant for the purpose of computation of total income<lb/>
 on the basis whereof the amount of compensation payable for<lb/>
 the death of the kith and kin of the applicants is required to<lb/>
 be determined. For the aforementioned purpose, we may<lb/>
 notice the elements of pay, paid to the deceased :<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;BASIC : 63,400.00<lb/>
 CONVEYANCE ALLOWANCE : 12,000.00<lb/>
 RENT CO LEASE : 49,200.00<lb/>
 BONUS (35% OF BASIC) : 21,840.00<lb/>
</item>

<item>TOTAL : 1,45,440.00<lb/>
 In addition to above, his other entitlements were :<lb/>
</item>

<item>Con. to PF 10% Basic Rs. 6,240/-(p.a.)<lb/>
</item>

<item>LTA reimbursement Rs. 7,000/-(p.a.)<lb/>
</item>

<item>Medical reimbursement Rs. 6,000/-(p.a.)<lb/>
</item>

<item>Superannuation 15% of Basic Rs. 9,360/-(p.a.)<lb/>
</item>

<item>Gratuity Cont.5.34% of Basic Rs. 3,332/-(p.a.)<lb/>
</item>

<item>Medical Policy-self &amp; Family @ Rs.55,000/-(p.a.)<lb/>
</item>

<item>Education Scholarship @ Rs.500 Rs.12,000/-(p.a.)<lb/>
</item>

<item>Payable to his two children Directly&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>14. The question came for consideration before a<lb/>
 learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court in The<lb/>
 Manager, National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Padmavathy &amp; Ors.<lb/>
 [CMA No.114 of 2006 decided on 29.1.2007], wherein it<lb/>
 was held :<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;Income tax, Professional tax which are deducted<lb/>
 from the salaried person goes to the coffers of the<lb/>
 government under specific head and there is no return.<lb/>
 Whereas, the General Provident Fund, Special Provident<lb/>
 Fund, L.I.C., Contribution are amounts paid specific heads<lb/>
 and the contribution is always repayable to an employee at<lb/>
 the time of voluntary retirement, death or for any other<lb/>
 reason. Such contribution made by the salaried person are<lb/>
 deferred payments and they are savings. The Supreme Court<lb/>
 as well as various High Courts have held that the<lb/>
 compensation payable under the Motor Vehicles Act is<lb/>
 statutory and that the deferred payments made to the<lb/>
 employee are contractual. Courts have held that there cannot<lb/>
 be any deductions in the statutory compensation, if the Legal<lb/>
 Representatives are entitled to lumpsum payment under the<lb/>
 contractual liability. If the contributions made by the<lb/>
 employee which are otherwise savings from the salary are<lb/>
 deducted from the gross income and only the net income is<lb/>
 taken for computing the dependancy compensation, then the<lb/>
 Legal Representatives of the victim would lose considerable<lb/>
 portion of the income. In view of the settled proposition of<lb/>
 law, I am of the view, the Tribunal can make only statutory<lb/>
 deductions such as Income tax and professional tax and any<lb/>
 other contribution, which is not repayable by the employer,<lb/>
 from the salary of the deceased person while determining the<lb/>
 monthly<lb/>
 income<lb/>
 for<lb/>
 computing<lb/>
 the<lb/>
 dependancy<lb/>
 compensation. Any contribution made by the employee during<lb/>
 his life time, form part of the salary and they should be<lb/>
 included in the monthly income, while computing the<lb/>
 dependency compensation.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>15. Similar view was expressed by a learned Single<lb/>
 Judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court in S. Narayanamma &amp;<lb/>
 Ors. V. Secretary to Government of India, Ministry of<lb/>
 Telecommunications and Ors. [2002 ACC 582], holding:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;13. In this background, now we will examine the<lb/>
 present deductions made by the tribunal from the salary of<lb/>
 the deceased in fixing the monthly contribution of the<lb/>
 deceased to his family. The tribunal has not even taken<lb/>
 proper care while deducting the amounts from the salary of<lb/>
 the deceased, at least the very nature of deductions from the<lb/>
 salary of the deceased. My view is that the deductions made<lb/>
 by the tribunal from the salary such as recovery of housing<lb/>
 loan, vehicle loan, festival advance and other deductions, if<lb/>
 any, to the benefit of the estate of the deceased cannot be<lb/>
 deducted while computing the net monthly earnings of the<lb/>
 deceased. These advances or loans are part of his salary. So<lb/>
 far as House Rent Allowance is concerned, it is beneficial to<lb/>
 the entire family of the deceased during his tenure, but for<lb/>
 his untimely death the claimants are deprived of such benefit<lb/>
 which they would have enjoyed if the deceased is alive. On<lb/>
 the other hand, allowances, like Travelling Allowance,<lb/>
 allowance for newspapers/periodicals, telephone, servant,<lb/>
 club-fee, car maintenance etc., by virtue of his vocation<lb/>
 need not be included in the salary while computing the net<lb/>
 earnings of the deceased. The finding of the tribunal that the<lb/>
 deceased was getting Rs.1,401/-as net income every month<lb/>
 is unsustainable as the deductions made towards vehicle loan<lb/>
 and other deductions were also taken into consideration<lb/>
 while fixing the monthly income of the deceased. The above<lb/>
 finding of the tribunal is contrary to the principle of &apos;just<lb/>
 compensation&apos; enunciated by the Supreme Court in the<lb/>
 judgment in Helen&apos;s case (1 supra). The Supreme Court in<lb/>
 Concord of India Insurance Co. v. Nirmaladevi and Ors.,<lb/>
 1980 ACJ 55 (SC) held that determination of quantum must<lb/>
 be liberal and not niggardly since law values life and limb in a<lb/>
 free country &apos;in generous scales&apos;.&quot;<lb/>
 .........<lb/>
</p>

<p>19. The amounts, therefore, which were required<lb/>
 to be paid to the deceased by his employer by way of perks,<lb/>
 should be included for computation of his monthly income as<lb/>
 that would have been added to his monthly income by way of<lb/>
 contribution to the family as contradistinguished to the ones<lb/>
 which were for his benefit. We may, however, hasten to add<lb/>
 that from the said amount of income, the statutory amount<lb/>
 of tax payable thereupon must be deducted.<lb/>
</p>

<p>20. The term &apos;income&apos; in P. Ramanatha Aiyar&apos;s<lb/>
 Advanced Law Lexicon (3rd Ed.) has been defined as under:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;The value of any benefit or perquisite whether<lb/>
 convertible into money or not, obtained from a company<lb/>
 either by a director or a person who has substantial interest<lb/>
 in the company, and any sum paid by such company in<lb/>
 respect of any obligation, which but for such payment would<lb/>
 have been payable by the director or other person aforesaid,<lb/>
 occurring or arising to a person within the State from any<lb/>
 profession, trade or calling other than agriculture.&quot;<lb/>
 It has also been stated :<lb/>
 &apos;INCOME&apos; signifies &apos;what comes in&apos; (per Selborne, C.,<lb/>
 Jones v. Ogle, 42 LJ Ch.336). &apos;It is as large a word as can be<lb/>
 used&apos; to denote a person&apos;s receipts &apos;(per Jessel, M.R. Re<lb/>
 Huggins, 51 LJ Ch.938.) income is not confined to receipts<lb/>
 from business only and means periodical receipts from one&apos;s<lb/>
 work, lands, investments, etc. AIR 1921 Mad 427 (SB). Ref.<lb/>
 124 IC 511 : 1930 MWN 29 : 31 MLW 438 AIR 1930 Mad 626<lb/>
 : 58 MLJ 337.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>21. If the dictionary meaning of the word &apos;income&apos;<lb/>
 is taken to its logical conclusion, it should include those<lb/>
 benefits, either in terms of money or otherwise, which are<lb/>
 taken into consideration for the purpose of payment of<lb/>
 income-tax or profession tax although some elements thereof<lb/>
 may or may not be taxable or would have been otherwise<lb/>
 taxable but for the exemption conferred thereupon under the<lb/>
 statute.<lb/>
</p>

<p>22. In N. Sivammal &amp; Ors. v. Managing Director,<lb/>
 Pandian Roadways Corporation &amp; Ors. [(1985) 1 SCC 18],<lb/>
 this Court took into consideration the pay packet of the<lb/>
 deceased.<lb/>
</p>

<p>23. We may notice that in T.N. State Transport<lb/>
 Corporation Ltd. v. S. Rajapriya &amp; Ors. [(2005) 6 SCC 236],<lb/>
 this Court held:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;8. The assessment of damages to compensate the<lb/>
 dependants is beset with difficulties because from the nature<lb/>
 of things, it has to take into account many imponderables<lb/>
 e.g. the life expectancy of the deceased and the dependants,<lb/>
 the amount that the deceased would have earned during the<lb/>
 remainder of his life, the amount that he would have<lb/>
 contributed to the dependants during that period, the<lb/>
 chances that the deceased may not have lived or the<lb/>
 dependants may not live up to the estimated remaining<lb/>
 period of their life expectancy, the chances that the<lb/>
 deceased might have got better employment or income or<lb/>
 might have lost his employment or income together.<lb/>
</p>

<p>9. The manner of arriving at the damages is to<lb/>
 ascertain the net income of the deceased available for the<lb/>
 support of himself and his dependants, and to deduct<lb/>
 therefrom such part of his income as the deceased was<lb/>
 accustomed to spend upon himself, as regards both self-<lb/>
maintenance and pleasure, and to ascertain what part of his<lb/>
 net income the deceased was accustomed to spend for the<lb/>
 benefit of the dependants. Then that should be capitalised by<lb/>
 multiplying it by a figure representing the proper number of<lb/>
 years&apos; purchase.<lb/>
</p>

<p>10. Much of the calculation necessarily remains in<lb/>
 the realm of hypothesis &quot;and in that region arithmetic is a<lb/>
 good servant but a bad master&quot; since there are so often many<lb/>
 imponderables. In every case &quot;it is the overall picture that<lb/>
 matters&quot;, and the court must try to assess as best as it can<lb/>
 the loss suffered.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>24. Yet again in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v.<lb/>
 Charlie &amp; Anr [(2005) 10 SCC 720], the same view was<lb/>
 reiterated. However, therein although the words &apos;net income&apos;<lb/>
 has been used but the same itself would ordinarily mean<lb/>
 gross income minus the statutory deductions. We must also<lb/>
 notice that the said decision has been followed in New India<lb/>
 Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Kalpana (Smt.) &amp; Ors. [(2007) 3 SCC<lb/>
 538]&quot;.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>84. In Raghuvir Singh Matolya v. Hari Singh Malviya &amp; Ors.,<lb/>
 reported in (2009) 15 SCC 363, the Apex Court, while observing that<lb/>
 Dearness Allowance forms part of the income and House Rent Allowance<lb/>
 is paid for the benefit of the family members and not for the employee<lb/>
 alone, held that dearness allowance and house rent allowance should be<lb/>
 included for computation of income of the deceased.<lb/>
</p>

<p>85. Thus, in the case on hand, the calculation has to be made as<lb/>
 follows:<lb/>
 Income<lb/>
</p>

<item>: Rs.13,259.40<lb/>
 Addition<lb/>
 Provident Fund<lb/>
 : Rs.<lb/>
</item>

<item>780.00<lb/>
 LIC<lb/>
 : Rs.<lb/>
 209.00<lb/>
 Special Provident Fund : Rs.<lb/>
</item>

<item>70.00<lb/>
</item>

<item>Family Benefit Fund<lb/>
 : Rs.<lb/>
</item>

<item>40.00<lb/>
 ------------------<lb/>
Total : Rs.14,358.40<lb/>
 ------------------<lb/>
The monthly income of the deceased, works out to Rs.14,358.</item>

<p>40, rounded<lb/>
 off to Rs.14,360/-. As per the decision in Rajesh&apos;s case (cited supra),<lb/>
 addition of 15% to the income fixed, at the time of death, towards future<lb/>
 prospects has to be made. If 15% is added, the monthly income of the<lb/>
 deceased works out to Rs.16,514/-.<lb/>
</p>

<p>86. The accident has occurred on 28.07.2011. For the financial<lb/>
 year 2011, 10% of the income has to be deducted towards Income-Tax.<lb/>
</p>

<item>Thus, excluding the ceiling limit of Rs.1,90,000/-, Income-Tax has to be<lb/>
 calculated for the remaining amount of Rs.8,168/-, which works out to<lb/>
 Rs.817/-(10% of Rs.8,168/-). Thus, after deducting Income-Tax, the<lb/>
 annual income to be fixed for the purpose of computing the loss of<lb/>
 dependency is Rs.2,30,600/-.<lb/>
</item>

<p>87. The proper multiplier as per Sarala Verma&apos;s case, for the age<lb/>
 group between 50 and 55 years, is &apos;11&apos;. There are four dependents in this<lb/>
 case. As per Sarala Verma&apos;s case, if the number of dependents are four.<lb/>
 Therefore, deduction towards personal and living expenses should be<lb/>
 1/4th. After deducting 1/4 th towards the personal and living expenses of<lb/>
 the deceased and applying &apos;11&apos; multiplier, the dependency compensation<lb/>
 works to Rs.16,27,929/-(Rs.2,30,600/-x 11 x 1/4th).<lb/>
</p>

<p>88. Compensation of Rs.1,00,000/-awarded under the head, loss<lb/>
 of love and affection to the sons and daughters, is less. Claimants are<lb/>
 married sons and daughters of the deceased. Hence, this Court is inclined<lb/>
 to award Rs.50,000/-each towards loss of love and affection, which<lb/>
 comes to Rs.2,00,000/-. Funeral Expenses of Rs.25,000/-is sustained. In<lb/>
 addition, compensation of Rs.5,000/-and Rs.1,000/-is awarded for<lb/>
 transportation and damages to clothes and articles respectively. After<lb/>
 reworking, the total compensation due and payable to the legal<lb/>
 representatives of the deceased/respondents in C.M.A.No.2386 of 2015, is<lb/>
 Rs.18,58,929/-and it is apportioned as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>Loss of Dependency<lb/>
 : Rs.18,58,929/-<lb/>
Loss of Love and Affection<lb/>
 : Rs. 2,00,000/-<lb/>
Funeral Expenses<lb/>
 : Rs.<lb/>
 25,000/-<lb/>
Transportation<lb/>
 : Rs.<lb/>
 5,000/-<lb/>
Damages to clothes &amp; Articles : Rs.<lb/>
 1,000/-<lb/>
---------------------<lb/>
Total : Rs.18,58,929/-<lb/>
---------------------<lb/>
</item>

<p>89. C.M.A.No.723 of 2015, is partly allowed. Subsequent to the<lb/>
 above, there shall be a reduction of Rs.42,600/-. Record of proceedings<lb/>
 shows that on 08.04.2015, this Court, in M.P.No.1 of 2015, granted<lb/>
 interim stay of the operation of the impugned judgment in<lb/>
 M.C.O.P.No.253 of 2014, dated 10.09.2014, on the file of the Motor<lb/>
 Accident Claims Tribunal, Special District Court, Dharmapuri, subject to<lb/>
 the condition that the appellant-Insurance Company deposits 75% of the<lb/>
 award amount. Therefore, the appellant-Insurance Company is directed<lb/>
 to deposit the balance amount, with proportionate interest, at the rate of<lb/>
</p>

<p>7.5% from the date of claim, till payment, to the credit of<lb/>
 M.C.O.P.No.253 of 2014, on the file of the Motor Accident Claims<lb/>
 Tribunal, Special District Court, Dharmapuri, within a period of four<lb/>
 weeks, from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.<lb/>
</p>

<p>90. C.M.A.No.3273 of 2015 is dismissed. Subsequent to the<lb/>
 above, there shall be an increase of compensation of Rs.2,29,733/-.<lb/>
 Record of proceedings shows that on 26.11.2014, this Court, in M.P.No.1<lb/>
 of 2014, granted interim stay of the operation of the impugned judgment<lb/>
 in M.C.O.P.No.549 of 2012, dated 31.10.2013, on the file of the Motor<lb/>
 Accident Claims Tribunal, Additional District Court, Dharmapuri, subject<lb/>
 to the condition that the appellant-Insurance Company deposits 75% of<lb/>
 the award amount. Therefore, the appellant-Insurance Company is<lb/>
 directed to deposit the balance amount, with proportionate interest, at<lb/>
 the rate of 7.5% from the date of claim, till payment, to the credit of<lb/>
 M.C.O.P.No.549 of 2012, on the file of the Motor Accident Claims<lb/>
 Tribunal, Additional District Court, Dharmapuri, within a period of four<lb/>
 weeks, from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.<lb/>
</p>

<p>91. C.M.A.No.2386 of 2015 is dismissed. Subsequent to the<lb/>
 above, there shall be an increase of compensation of Rs.2,48,929/-.<lb/>
 Therefore, the appellant-Insurance Company is directed to deposit the<lb/>
 amount, now determined by this Court, with proportionate interest, at<lb/>
 the rate of 7.5% from the date of claim, till payment, to the credit of<lb/>
 M.C.O.P.No.4193 of 2011, on the file of the Motor Accidents Claims<lb/>
 Tribunal, (2 nd Court of Small Causes), Chennai, within a period of four<lb/>
 weeks, from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.<lb/>
</p>

<p>92. In each of the claim petitions, the compensation claimed is<lb/>
 only Rs.15,00,000/-. As the award amount in each case is more than the<lb/>
 amount claimed, the claimants in each petition, have to pay necessary<lb/>
 Court Fee. Registry is directed to draft the decrees, on payment of<lb/>
 necessary Court Fees, for the amount awarded by this Court, less the<lb/>
 Court Fee already paid in the respective Claims Tribunals, for the claim<lb/>
 amount. Time for payment of Court Fee, is four weeks, from the date of<lb/>
 receipt of the copy of this order. If necessary Court Fee is paid earlier,<lb/>
 Registry may draft the decree, at the earliest.<lb/>
</p>

<p>93. With the above directions, the Civil Miscellaneous Appeals are<lb/>
 disposed of, as indicated in the forgoing paragraphs. Consequently, all the<lb/>
 Miscellaneous Petitions are closed. No costs.<lb/>
