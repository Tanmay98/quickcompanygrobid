COMMON JUDGMENT 
V.Dhanapalan,J. 

All these appeals have been filed against the common order of a learned 

single Judge of this Court, dated 19.12.2013, dismissing the Writ Petitions, 

challenging G.O.Ms.No.380 Revenue [LD1 (1)] Department, dated 28.09.2013, 

which culminated in the orders of the District Collector, Chennai, dated 

30.09.2013, directing the appellants to vacate the land and hand over 

possession of the premises to the Tahsildar, Fort-Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai. 

2. 
Case of the appellants before the writ court was that they were the 

lessees/sub-lessees/tenants of the building constructed by a Trust, namely, 

Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar Choultry, situated opposite to the Central 

Railway Station, Chennai, and when they are in possession and enjoyment of 

the same, the Government of Tamil Nadu passed a Government Order in 

G.O.Ms.No.380, Revenue, [LD1 (1)] Department, dated 28.09.2013, pursuant 

to which the District Collector, Chennai, by his orders, dated 30.09.2013, 

directing them to vacate the land and hand over possession of the premises to 

the Tahsildar, Fort-Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai, on the ground that the land was 

required for Chennai Metro Rail Project with larger public interest to Chennai 

Metro Rail Limited (in short CMRL), for implementing the project, which 

action, according to the appellants, was illegal and unjustified. 


4 

3. According to the appellant in W.A.No.2510 of 2013, namely, 

S.V.R.Ramprasad, he was appointed as a co-trustee of Rajah Sir Ramasamy 

Mudaliar Choultry by an order of this Court in O.S.A.Nos.66 & 67 of 2000, 

dated 05.06.2000; Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar had submitted a proposal to 

construct a choultry in Chennai at the cost of about Rs.30,000/-before the 

Government on 10.03.1888 and sought a piece of land for that purpose and in 

consideration of that laudable objective and upon taking into account the 

various charitable activities of Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar rendered to the 

society, the Government had come forward to allot a piece of land measuring an 

extent of 1.33 acres, now comprised in T.S.No.41, Vepery Village, Fort-

Tondiarpet Taluk, valued at Rs.3,638/-at free of cost for the purpose of 

construction of the choultry in that piece of land with a condition that the said 

piece of land shall be used for construction of choultry and on failure of 

fulfillment of the conditions and that the said grant of land would be liable for 

resumption; the choultry building so constructed by the founder Rajah Sir 

Ramasamy Mudaliar way back in the year 1888 has been classified as a 

historical and heritage building by the High Power Heritage Committee so 

constituted under the orders of this Court; after considering the reports 

submitted by the heritage committee, this Court directed the Heritage 

Conservation Committee to issue notice to all the buildings shown in Sl.Nos.1 

to 467 in the Committee Report for preserving and maintaining such buildings 

without causing any damage to them; in compliance of the directions of a 


5 

Division Bench of this Court, the Heritage Conservation Committee, under the 

management and control of CMDA, issued a notice to the appellant, by 

proceedings dated 21.09.2010, thereby cautioning him to ensure safety of the 

said heritage building and, presently, the said heritage building is under 

occupation of Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation. His further case 

is that the right to property is a constitutional right safeguarded under Article 

300-A of the Constitution of India and that the Government has intruded and 

invaded the right of the founder trustee and there is an encumbrance existing in 

T.S.No.41, which cannot be ignored by the State and, hence, he prayed to allow 

the appeal. 

4. The facts are that originally the Government of Tamil Nadu issued an 

order in G.O.Ms.No.168, Revenue, dated 21 May 2012, resuming the land in 

T.S.No.41, alleging the violation of the terms of original Grant and also on 

account of a larger public purpose and to hand it over to Chennai Metro Rail 

Limiteid, in connection with the introduction of Metro Rail at Chennai. The 

said Government Order and the consequential order passed by Administrator 

General and Official Trustee (AGOT) were challenged in W.P.No.19269 of 

2012 and its batch. The Writ Petitions were allowed by a learned single Judge 

by his common order, dated 26.11.2012, with a direction to the Government to 

issue notice to the lesseees, AGOT and Co-Trustee and thereafter to pass fresh 

orders, taking into consideration their objections. The common order, dated 

26.11.2012, was taken on appeal in W.A.Nos.70 to 88 of 2013 and 91 to 106 of 


6 

2013 before a Division Bench and the said Division Bench, by its judgment, 

dated 12.07.2013, allowed the appeals. The unsuccessful writ petitioners filed 

Special Leave Petitions before the Supreme Court, which granted leave and 

after recording the undertaking given by the learned Solicitor General, directed 

that all the affected parties should be given notices and an opportunity to 

respond and, accordingly, disposed of the Petitions, by an order dated 

25.07.2013. Thereafter, the District Collector, Chennai, issued individual 

notices to the affected parties and received their response. The District 

Collector, after examining the objections, submitted a report to the Government 

with a recommendation to resume the land in T.S.No.41. The Government has 

examined the proposal in the light of the earlier proceedings and the objections 

raised by the affected parties and resolved to resume the land by an order, dated 

28.09.2013, in G.O.Ms.No.380, Revenue (LD1(1)) Department. The District 

Collector, pursuant to the said order dated 28.09.2013, issued notices, dated 

30.09.2013, directing the petitioners to vacate and hand over the premises to 

the Tahsildar, Fort Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai, on 15.10.2013. The Government 

Order in G.O.Ms.No.380, dated 28.09.2013, and the consequential eviction 

notices, dated 30.09.2013, were under challenge in the Writ Petitions before the 

learned single Judge. 

5. Resumption of the land in question vide G.O.Ms.No.380, dated 

28.09.2013, as well as the subsequent order of the District Collector, Chennai, 

was justified by the Government, stating that the purpose for which the grant 


7 

was given was no more in existence and that the land belonged to the 

Government; hence, there was no need to take recourse to acquisiton of the 

land and, as such, the appellants, being the lessees/sub-lessees/tenants, were not 

entitled to challenge the process of resumption. 

6. The stand of Chennai Metro Rail Limited was that Chennai Metro Rail 

Project was managed by the Government of India and the State Government by 

way of equal equity contribution and suordinate debt; CMRL received loan 

from Japan International Cooperation Agency; CMRL required the subject land 

for railways in public interest and, therefore, any delay of the project would 

escalate the cost and defeat the public purpose. 

7. 
Upon hearing the rival submissions made by the parties, the 

learned single Judge dismissed all the writ petitions, challenging the legality 

and correctness of the orders, directing resumption of land, on the ground that 

the benefit to public would outweigh the loss to the petitioners. By dismissing 

the writ petitions, the single Judge directed Chennai Metro Rail Limited to 

assess the reasonable compensation payable to the petitioners, with the 

assistance of the District Collector, Chennai, and the Chief Engineer, Public 

Works Department, and pay the same to the petitioners on or before 10th 

January,2014. Aggrieved over the said dismissal, these appeals are filed by 

some of the writ petitioners. 

8. Mr.A.Vijay Narayan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 

appellant in W.A.No.2508/2013, would contend that resumption of subject 


8 

lands on the ground of violation of conditions of the grant was wholly illegal. 

According to him, should there be a requirement of the lands for a public 

purpose, the initiation of proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act is a sine 

qua non and, therefore, the action of the respondents in resuming the lands by 

way of government orders is non est in law and a violation of the provisions of 

Article 300-A of the Constitution of India and Sections 10,25 and 29 of the 

Official Trustees Act,1913. 

9. 
The learned Senior Counsel, in support of his submissions, has 

relied on the following decisions : 

(i) Bishan Das and others vs. State of Punjab and others, reported in AIR 

1961 SC 1570 : 

"(11) We consider that both these contentions are 
unsound and the petitioners have made out a clear case of the 
violation of their fundamental rights. There has been some 
argument before us as to the true legal effect of the sanction 
granted in 1909 to Ramji Das subject to the conditions 
adverted to earlier: whether it was a lease in favour of the 
firm Faquir Chand Bhagwan Das; whether it was a licence 
coupled with a grant or an irrevocable licence within the 
meaning of s. 60(b) of the Easements Act, 1882. These are 
disputed questions which we do not think that we are called 
upon to decide in the present proceeding. The admitted 
position, so far as the present proceeding is concerned, is that 
the land belonged to the State; with the permission of the 
State Ramji Das, on behalf of the joint family firm of Faquir 
Chand Bhagwan Das, built the dharmasala, temple and shops 
and managed the same during his life time. After his death the 
petitioners, other members of the joint family, continued the 
management. On this admitted position the petitioners cannot 
be held to be trespassers in respect of the dharmasala, temple 
and shops; nor can it be held that the dharmasala, temple and 
shops belonged to the State, irrespective of the question 
whether the trust created was of a public or private nature. A 
trustee even of a public trust can be removed only by 
procedure known to law. He cannot be removed by an 


9 

executive fiat. It is by now well settled that the maxim, what 
is annexed to the soil goes with the soil, has not been 
accepted as an absolute rule of law of this country; see 
Thakoor Chunder Parmanick v. Ramdhone Bhuttacharjee, 6 
Suth WR 228; Beni Ram v. Kundan Lall, 26 Ind App 58 and 
Narayan Das Khettry v. Jatindranath, 54 Ind App 218; (AIR 
1927 PC 135). These decisions show that a person who bona 
fide puts up constructions on land belonging to others with 
their permission would not be a trespasser, nor would the 
buildings so constructed vest in the owner of the land by the 
application of the maxim quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit. 
It is, therefore, impossible to hold that in respect of the 
dharmasala, temples and shops, the State has acquired any 
rights whatsoever merely by reason of their being on the land 
belonging to the State. If the State thought that the 
constructions should be removed or that the condition as to 
resumption of the land should be invoked, it was open to the 
State to take appropriate legal action for the purpose. Even if 
the State proceeded on the footing that the trust was a public 
trust it should have taken appropriate legal action for the 
removal of the trustee as was opined by the State's Legal 
Remembrancer. It is well recognised that a suit under s. 92, 
Civil Procedure Code, may be brought against persons in 
possession of the trust property even if they claim adversely 
to the trust, that is, claim to be owners of the property, or 
against persons who deny the validity of the trust. 

(14) Before we part with this case, we feel it our duty 
to say that the executive action taken in this case by the State 
and its officers is destructive of the basic principle of the rule 
of law. The facts and the position in law thus clearly are (1) 
that the buildings constructed on this piece of Government 
land did not belong to Government, (2) that the petitioners 
were in possession and occupation of the buildings and (3) 
that by virtue of enactments binding on the Government, the 
petitioners could be dispossessed, if at all, only in pursuance 
of a decree of a Civil Court obtained in proceedings properly 
initiated. In these circumstances the action of the Government 
in taking the law into their hands and dispossessing the 
petitioners by the display of force, exhibits a callous disregard 
of the normal requirements of the rule of law apart from what 
might legitimately and reasonably be expected from a 
Government functioning in a society governed by a 
Constitution which guarantees to its citizens against arbitrary 


10 

invasion by the executive of peaceful possession of property. 
As pointed out by this Court in Wazir Chand v. The State of 
Himachal Pradesh (1), the State or its executive officers 
cannot in-terfere with the rights of others unless they can 
point to some specific rule of law which authorises their acts. 
In Ram Prasad Narayan Sahi v. The State of Bihar (2) this 
Court said that nothing is more likely to drain the vitality 
from the rule of law than legislation which singles out a 
particular individual from his fellow subjects and visits him 
with a disability which is not imposed upon the others. We 
have here a highly discriminatory and autocratic act which 
deprives a person of the possession of property without 
reference to any law or legal authority. Even if the property 
was trust property it is difficult to see how the Municipal 
Committee, Barnala, can step in as trustee on an executive 
determination only. The reasons given for this extraordinary 
action are, to quote what we said in Sahi's case (supra), 
remarkable for their disturbing implications. 

(15) For these reasons, we allow the application with 
costs and a writ will now issue as directed." 

(ii) Smt. Chandra Kali vs. Managing Committee Aryasamaj, Meerut 

and others, reported in AIR 1987 Allahabad 341 : 

"17. There is, however, one aspect of the matter which 
has to be clarified in this order. Although the Official Trustee 
is the sole trustee of the property vested in the Official 
Trustee, yet he has to seek order from the Court. Section 25 of 
the Official Trustees Act makes it clear that the High Court 
may make such orders as it thinks fit respecting, any Trust 
property vested in the Official Trustee or the income or 
produce thereof. Even in the matter of the income or the 
produce of vested property the High Court has power to make 
order or give directions. The sale of a Trust property is 
certainly the sale of the corpus and it is all the more necessary 
that the High Court's permission ought to be obtained by the 
Official Trustee before he disposes of any immovable 
property. 

18. Section 29 also says that nothing in this Act shall be 
deemed to prevent the transfer by the Official Trustee of any 
property vested in him to any other person if the Court so 


11 

directs. Since the transfer by auction sale in the present case 
is in favour of a person other than original transferee or any 
other lawfully appointed trustee it can only take place if the 
Court so directs. It is, therefore, evident that to effect a valid 
transfer of a trust property which has vested in the Official 
Trustee the latter has to seek direction from the Court for its 
transfer. If .the Official Trustee feels that it is in the interest 
of the Trust to dispose of any immovable property of the 
Trust he can always seek direction from the Court. My 
attention has not been drawn to any paper by which Court's 
direction was sought for the transfer of the aforesaid 
immovable property. I am of the opinion that unless there is a 
direction by the Court or an order by the Court within the 
meaning of Sections 29 and 25 of the Official Trustees Act, 
1913, no Trust property can be transferred by the Official 
Trustee." 

(iii) K.T.Plantation Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. State of Karnataka, 

reported in AIR 2011 SC 3430: 

"115. Principles of eminent domain, as such, is not 
seen incorporated in Article 300A, as we see, in Article 
30(1A), as well as in the 2nd proviso to Article 31A(1) 
though we can infer those principles in Article 300A. 
Provision for payment of compensation has been specifically 
incorporated in Article 30(1A) as well as in the 2nd proviso to 
Article 31A(1) for achieving specific objectives. 
Constitution's 44th Amendment Act, 1978 while omitting 
Article 31 brought in a substantive provision Clause (1A) to 
Article 30. Resultantly, though no individual or even 
educational institution belonging to majority community shall 
have any fundamental right to compensation in case of 
compulsory acquisition of his property by the State, an 
educational institution belonging to a minority community 
shall have such fundamental right to claim compensation in 
case State enacts a law providing for compulsory acquisition 
of any property of an educational institution established and 
administered by a minority community. Further, the second 
proviso to Article 31A(1) prohibits the Legislature from 
making a law which does not contain a provision for payment 
of compensation at a rate not less than the market value which 
follows that a law which does not contain such provision shall 
be invalid and the acquisition proceedings would be rendered 


12 

void. 

116. Looking at the history of the various 
constitutional amendments, judicial pronouncements and the 
statement of objects and reasons contained in the 44th 
Amendment Bill which led to the 44th Amendment Act we 
have no doubt that the intention of the Parliament was to do 
away with the fundamental right to acquire, hold and dispose 
of the property. But the question is whether the principles of 
eminent domain are completely obliterated when a person is 
deprived of his property by the authority of law under Article 
300A of the Constitution. 

PUBLIC PURPOSE 

117. Deprivation of property within the meaning of 
Art.300A, generally speaking, must take place for public 
purpose or public interest. The concept of eminent domain 
which applies when a person is deprived of his property 
postulates that the purpose must be primarily public and not 
primarily of private interest and merely incidentally beneficial 
to the public. Any law, which deprives a person of his private 
property for private interest, will be unlawful and unfair and 
undermines the rule of law and can be subjected to judicial 
review. But the question as to whether the purpose is 
primarily public or private, has to be decided by the 
legislature, which of course should be made known. The 
concept of public purpose has been given fairly expansive 
meaning which has to be justified upon the purpose and 
object of statute and the policy of the legislation. Public 
purpose is, therefore, a condition precedent, for invoking 
Article 300A. 

COMPENSATION 

118. We have found that the requirement of public 
purpose is invariably the rule for depriving a person of his 
property, violation of which is amenable to judicial review. 
Let us now examine whether the requirement of payment of 
compensation is the rule after the deletion of Article 31(2). 
Payment of compensation amount is a constitutional 
requirement under Article 30(1A) and under the 2nd proviso 
to Article 31A(1), unlike Article 300A. After the 44th 
Amendment Act, 1978, the constitutional obligation to pay 
compensation to a person who is deprived of his property 
primarily depends upon the terms of the statute and the 


13 

legislative policy. Article 300A, however, does not prohibit 
the payment of just compensation when a person is deprived 
of his property, but the question is whether a person is 
entitled to get compensation, as a matter of right, in the 
absence of any stipulation in the statute, depriving him of his 
property. 

121. We find no apparent conflict with the words used 
in Entry 42, List III so as to infer that the payment of 
compensation is inbuilt or inherent either in the words 
"acquisition and requisitioning" under Entry 42, List III. 
Right to claim compensation is, therefore, cannot be read into 
the legislative Entry 42 List III. Requirement of public 
purpose, for deprivation of a person of his property under 
Article 300-A, is a pre-condition, but no compensation or nil 
compensation or its illusiveness has to be justified by the 
State on judicially justiciable standards. Measures designed 
to achieve greater social justice, may call for lesser 
compensation and such a limitation by itself will not make 
legislation invalid or unconstitutional or confiscatory. In 
other words, the right to claim compensation or the obligation 
to pay, though not expressly included in Article 300-A, it can 
be inferred in that Article and it is for the State to justify its 
stand on justifiable grounds which may depend upon the 
legislative policy, object and purpose of the statute and host 
of other factors. 

122. Article 300-A would be equally violated if the 
provisions of law authorizing deprivation of property have 
not been complied with. While enacting Article 300-A, 
Parliament has only borrowed Article 31(1) [the "Rule of 
law" doctrine] and not Article 31(2) [which had embodied the 
doctrine of Eminent Domain]. Article 300-A enables the 
State to put restrictions on the right to property by law. That 
law has to be reasonable. It must comply with other 
provisions of the Constitution. The limitation or restriction 
should not be arbitrary or excessive. The legislation 
providing for deprivation of property under Article 300-A 
must be "just, fair and reasonable" as understood in terms of 
Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 26(b), 301, etc. Thus, in each case, 
courts will have to examine the scheme of the impugned Act, 
its object, purpose as also the question whether payment of nil 
compensation or nominal compensation would make the 
impugned law unjust, unfair or unreasonable in terms of other 


14 

provisions of the Constitution as indicated above. At this 
stage, we may clarify that there is a difference between "no 
compensation shall be paid". However, there could be a law 
awarding "nil"compensation in cases where the State 
undertakes to discharge the liabilities charged on the property 
under acquisition and onus is on the government to establish 
validity of such law. In the latter case, the court in exercise of 
judicial review will test such a law keeping in mind the above 
parameters.'' 

10. Mr.A.R.L.Sundaresan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 

appellants in W.A.Nos.2511 and 2512 of 2013, would submit that there is no 

breach of conditions of the lease or grant by the appellants and, therefore, the 

impugned order is vitiated in law. He would further submit that the 

respondents have failed to take note of the provisions of Sections 10 and 25 

and 29 of the Official Trustees Act and to follow the rule of law and, in the 

absence of any order from AGOT Court, the respondents ought not to have 

proceeded with the matter for resumption of the land. He finally contends that 

no personal hearing or opportunity is provided to the appellants before 

initiating the impugned action, as directed by the Supreme Court. In support of 

his contentions, the learned Senior Counsel has relied upon a decision in the 

case of Azim Ahmed Kazmi and others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and another, 

reported in (2012) 7 SCC 278, wherein it is held as under : 

"17. The questions which requires consideration are (i) 
whether the order passed by the State Government on 15th 
December, 2000 for cancellation of lease and resumption of 
possession is legally valid and (i) whether the State 
Government can dispossess the lessee in accordance with the 
Government Grants Act, 1895 without resorting to other 
procedure established by any other law. 


15 

18. There is clear recital in the lease deed executed in 
favour of the appellants by the Government of U.P. on 19th 
March, 1996 that the same is being done under the 
Government Grants Act, 1895. Clause 3 (C) of the deed reads 
as follows: 

"3(C) That if the demised premises are at any 
time required by the lessor for his or for any public 
purpose he shall have the right to give one month's clear 
notice in writing to the lessees to remove any building 
standing at the time of the demised premises and within 
two months of the receipt of the notice to take 
possession thereof on the expiry of that period subject 
however to the condition that if the lessor is willing to 
purchase the building on the demised premises, the 
lessees shall be paid for such building such amount as 
may be determined by the Secretary to Government of 
U.P. in the Nagar Awas Department." 

27. For taking possession, the State Government is 
required to follow the law, if any, prescribed. In the absence 
of any specific law, the State Government may take 
possession by filing a suit. 

28. Under the Provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 
1894, if the State Government decides to acquire the property 
in accordance with the provisions of the said Act, no separate 
proceedings have to be taken for getting possession of the 
land. It may even invoke the urgency provisions contained in 
Section 17 of the said Act and the Collector may take 
possession of the land immediately after the publication of 
the notice under Section 9. In such a case, the person in 
possession of the land acquired would be dispossessed 
forthwith. 

29. However, if the Government proceeds under the 
terms of the Government Grants Act, 1895 then what 
procedure is to be followed. Section 3 of Government Grants 
Act, 1895, stipulates that the lease made by or on behalf of 
the Government to take effect according to their tenor -All 
provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations contained 
in any such creation, conferment or grant referred to any 
Section 2, shall be valid and take effect according to their 
tenor; any decree or direction of a Court of Law or any rule 
of law, statute or enactments of the Legislature, to the 
contrary.

11. Mr.M.Abdul Nazeer, learned counsel appearing for the appellants 

in W.A.Nos.2509 of 2013 and 275 and 276 of 2014, would submit that the 

appellants are in lawful possession of the property and the finding of the 

Supreme Court in this regard would fortify the stand that these appellants are in 

continuous possession in terms of the lease and there is no violation of the 

terms of lease by the appellants. It is his contention that the land alone belongs 

to the State and the superstructure thereon is built by the appellants by 

incurring huge expenditure, but, till-date, no compensation is paid and also no 

procedure has been bollowed by the respondents before taking the action to 

oust the appellants from their possession. He has relied on the following 

decisions: 

(i) Virendra Singh and others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, reported in AIR 

1954 SC 447: 

"29. Now what effect did the Constitution have on 
that? In our opinion, the Constitution, by reason of the 
authority derived from, and conferred by, the peoples of this 
land, blotted out in one magnificent sweep all vestiges of 
arbitrary and despotic power in the territories of India and over 
its citizens and lands and prohibited just such acts of arbitrary 
power as the State now seeks to uphold. 
Let it be conceded (without admitting or deciding the 
point) that the Dominion of India once had the powers for 
which the Union Government now contends. The self-same 
authorities which appear to concede that power also admit that 
it can be waived or relinquished. What then was the attitude of 
the Dominion towards those States which it sought to draw 
into the Republic of India which was yet to be free, sovereign, 
democratic, as its Constitution later proclaimed it to be? We 
quote from the mouthpiece of that Government as disclosed in 
the White Paper on Indian States published by official 
authority. 


17 

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's statement (he was then in 
charge of the States Department) 5th July, 1947, is reproduced 
at page 157. He said at page 158:-"This country with its 
institutions is the proud heritage of the people who inhabit it, It 
is an accident that some live in the States and some in British 
India but all alike partake of its culture and character. We are 
all knit together by bonds of blood and feeling. no less than of 
self-interest' None can segregate us into segments; no 
impassable barriers can be set up between us. I suggest that it 
is therefore better for us to make laws sitting together as 
friends than to make treaties as aliens. I invite my friends,the 
Rulers of States and their people to the Councils of Constituent 
Assembly in this spirit of friendliness and co-operation in a 
joint endeavour, inspired by common allegiance to our 
motherland for the common good of us all." 

This invitation was accepted on 19th May, 1949. Page 
109 of the White Paper says 

"As the States came closer to the Centre it 
became clear that the idea of separate Constitutions 
being framed for different constituent units of the 
Indian Union was a legacy from the Rulers' polity 
which could have no place in a democratic set-up. The 
matter was, therefore, further discussed by the Ministry 
of States with the Premiers of Unions and States on 
May 19, 1949, and it was decided, with their 
concurrence, that the Constitution of the States should 
also be framed by the Constituent Assembly of India 
and should form part of the Constitution of India." 

It is impossible to think of those who -sat down together 
-in the Constituent Assembly, and of those who sent 
representatives there, as conqueror and conquered, as those 
who ceded and as those who absorbed, as sovereigns or their 
plenipotentiaries, contracting alliances and entering into 
treaties as high contracting parties to an act of State. They were 
not there as sovereign and subject as citizen and alien, but as 
the sovereign peoples of India, free democratic equals, forging 
the pattern of a new life for the common weal. 

Every vestige of sovereignty was abandoned by the 
Dominion of India and by the States and surrendered to the 
peoples of the land who through their representatives in the 
Constituent Assembly hammered out for themselves a new 


18 

Constitution in which all were citizens in a new order having 
but one ie, and owing but one allegiance: devotion, loyalty, 
idelity, to the Sovereign Democratic Republic that is India. At 
one stroke all other territorial allegiances were wiped out and 
the past was obliterated except where expressly preserved; at 
one moment of time the new order was born with its new 
allegiance springing from the same source for all, grounded on 
the same basis: the sovereign will of the, peoples of India with 
no class, no caste, no race, no creed, no distinction, no 
reservation." 

(ii) State of Bihar vs. Rani Sonabati Kumari, reported in AIR 1961 SC 221: 

"It was urged that the Subordinate Judge by his order 
directed the State " not to issue any notification for taking 
possession "-and as the notification under s. 3(1) does not 
proprio vigore affect or interfere with the possession of the 
proprietor or tenure-holder, the issue of such a notification was 
not within the prohibition. The same argument was addressed 
to the High Court and was repelled by the learned Judges and 
in our opinion correctly. In the first place, the only 
"notification" contemplated by the provisions of the Act 
immediately relevant to the suit, was a notification under s. 
3(1). Such a notification has the statutory effect of divesting 
the owner of the notified estate of his or her title to the 
property and of trans-ferring it to and vesting it in the State. 
The State is enabled to take possession of the estate and the 
properties comprised in it by acting under s. 4, but the latter 
provision does not contemplate any notification, only 
executive acts by authorized officers of the State. Of course, if 
action had been taken under s. 4, and the possession of the 
respondent had been interfered with, there would have been a 
further breach of the order which directed the State. not to 
interfere with or disturb in any manner, the plaintiff's 
possession. What we desire to point out is that the order of the 
Court really consisted of two parts-the earlier directed against 
the defendant publishing a notification which in the context of 
the relevant statutory provisions could only mean a notification 
under s. 3(1) and that which followed, against interfering with 
the plaintiff's possession and the fact that-the second part of 
the order was not contravened is no ground for holding that 
there had been no breach of the first part. In the next place, the 
matter is put beyond the pale of controversy, if the order were 
read, as it has to be read, in conjunction with the plaint and the 


19 

application for a temporary injunction. Mr. Sinha did not 
seriously contend that if the order of the Court were 
understood in the light of the allegations and prayers in these 
two documents, the reference to the " notification " in it was 
only to one under s. 3(1) of the Act, and that the injunction 
therefore was meant to cover and covered such a notification. 
We, therefore, hold that this objection must fail. " 

(iii) The Special Land Acquisition Officer, Hosanagar vs. K.S. 

Ramachandra Rao and others, reported in AIR 1972 SC 2224: 

"2. Mr.M.Veerappa, the learned counsel for the State of 
Mysore, contends that the Land Acquisition Officer had not 
assessed the compensation payable for the rights of the 
respondents in the lands acquired. According to him, the Land 
Acquisition Officer merely estimated the value of the lands 
acquired. He contends that the respondents are not entitled to 
the entire value of the lands acquired, but that they are entitled 
only to the value of their rights into those lands as held by this 
Court in Seshagiri Rao's case (1964) 2 Mys LJ 287 (supra). 
We have gone through the Award made by the Land 
Acquisition Officer. The Land Acquisition Officer appears to 
have valued the rights of the respondents in the lands acquired. 
Whether the valuation made by him is correct or not cannot be 
gone into these proceedings. The appellants is bound by the 
valuation made by the Land Acquisition Officer. The view 
taken by the Land Acquisition Officer that the respondents are 
not entitled to any compensation in respect of the lands 
acquired cannot be sustained in view of this Court's decision in 
Seshagiri Rao's case (supra). " 

(iv) The State of U.P. And Zahoor Ahmad and another, reported in (1973) 

2 SCC 547: 

"16. Section 3 of the Government Grants Act declares 
the unfettered discretion of the Government to impose such 
conditions and limitations as it thinks fit, no matter what the 
general law of the land be. The meaning of sections 2 and 3 of 
the Government Grants is that the scope of that Act is not 
limited to affecting the provisions of the Transfer of Property 
Act only. The Government has unfettered discretion to impose 
any conditions, limitations, or restrictions in its grants, and the 
right, privileges and obligations of the grantee would be 
regulated according to the terms of the grant, notwithstanding 


20 

any provisions of any statutory or common law." 

(v) Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Gurnam Kaur, reported in AIR 

1989 SC 38: 

"13. At the end of the day, we must make a mention 
that Shri Verghese, learned counsel for the respondent made a 
valiant effort to bring into play the principles laid down by this 
Court in Olga Tellis & Ors. v. Bombay Municipal Corporation 
& Ors., [1985] 3 SCC 545 and Bombay Hawkers' Union & 
Ors. v. Bombay Municipal Corporation & Ors., [1985] 3 SCC 
528. We are afraid, we cannot permit the question to be raised 
for two reasons. In the first place, no such point was taken in 
the writ petition nor any contention advanced before the High 
Court that the removal of the illegal encroachment by the 
Municipal Corporation constitutes a threat to life and liberty 
guaranteed under Art. 21 of the Constitution or that the right to 
life includes a right to livelihood. Secondly, the rights of the 
parties now stand crystallized by the aforementioned judgment 
of the learned Subordinate Judge in the suit brought by the 
respondent, and the rights have to be worked out in terms of 
the decree passed by him which has since become final. 
Besides, the decision in Olga Tellis is of little avail. 
Chandrachud, CJ. speaking for the Constitution Bench 
observed that the word 'life' in Art. 21 included livelihood, but 
upheld the validity of ss. 313(1) and 314 of the Bombay 
Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 which provided that the 
Commissioner may 'without notice, cause to be removed' 
obstructions as an encroachment on footpaths could not be 
regarded as unreasonable, unfair or unjust. The learned Chief 
Justice however said that the section conferred a discretionary 
power which like all power must be exercised reasonably and 
in conformity with the provisions of our Constitution. In 
Bombay Hawkers' Union, Chandrachud, CJ. speaking for 
himself and one of us (Sen, J.) held that the impugned 
provision was in the nature of a reasonable restriction in the 
interests of the general public, on the exercise of the right of 
hawkers to carry on their trade or business. ..." 

(vi) State of U.P. and another vs. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and 

another, reported in (1991) 4 SCC 139 : 


21 

"41.... In Lancaster Motor Company (London) Ltd. v. 
Bremith Ltd., [1941] IKB 675 the Court did not feel bound by 
earlier decision as it was rendered 'without any argument, 
without reference to the crucial words of the rule and without 
any citation of the authority'. It was approved by this Court in 
Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Gumam Kaur, [1989] 1 
SCC 101. The Bench held that, 'precedents sub-silentio and 
without argument are of no moment'. The Courts thus have 
taken recourse to this principle for relieving from injustice 
perperated by unjust precedents. A decision which is not 
express and is not founded on reasons nor it proceeds on 
consideration of issue cannot be deemed to be a law declared 
to have a binding effect as is contem-plated by Article 141. 
Uniformity and consistency are core of judicial discipline. But 
that which escapes in the judg-ment without any occasion is 
not ratio decedendi. In Shama Rao v. State of Pondicherry, 
AIR 1967 SC 1680 it was ob-served, 'it is trite to say that a 
decision is binding not because of its conclusions but in regard 
to its ratio and the principles, laid down therein'. Any 
declaration or conclusion arrived without application of mind 
or preceded without any reason cannot be deemed to be 
declaration of law or authority of a general nature binding as a 
precedent. Restraint in dissenting or overruling is for sake of 
stabil-ity and uniformity but rigidity beyond reasonable limits 
is inimical to the growth of law." 

(vii) R.Abdul Jabbar and 5 others vs. The State of Tamil Nadu and 4 

others, reported in 1996 (II) CTC 719 : 

"15. It is plain that the Government need not acquire its 
own lands, and the Government was not competent in the 
proceedings under the Land acquired, denying compensation 
to the persons entitled, having issued notifications specifying 
the lands and the names of owners/occupiers/persons 
interested. 
Thus, under the circumstances, I have not 
hesitation to hold that whenever the Government waives to 
avail or invoke the condition of the grant or assignment, that a 
grantee or asignee will surrender lands whenever required by 
the Government without claiming compensation, and initiates 
proceedings for compulsory acquisition of such lands under 
the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, treating such lands 
as not belonging to itself, but to others, is under an obligation 
to pay compensation as provided in the Act. Viewed in any 


22 

way, the petitioners are entitled to succeed." 

(viii) Amit Das vs. State of Bihar, reported in AIR 2000 SC 2264 (1) : 

"13. Under Section 18, when any person accused of a 
bailable or non-bailable offence and apparently a juvenile is 
arrested or detained or appears or is brought before a Juvenile 
Court, such person shall, notwithstanding anything contained 
in the Code of Criminal Procedure, or in any other law for the 
time being in force, be released on bail with or without surety 
unless there appears reasonable grounds for believing that the 
release is likely to bring him in association with any known 
criminal or expose him to moral danger or that his release 
would defeat the ends of justice. In the latter case, the person 
has to be kept in an observation home or a place of safety until 
he can be brought before a Juvenile Court. The Juvenile Court 
if not releasing the person on bail must not commit him to 
prison but send him to an observation home or a place of safety 
during the pendency of the enquiry before him. Under Section 
20, where a juvenile charged with an offence appears or is 
produced before a Juvenile Court, the Juvenile Court shall hold 
an enquiry in accordance with the provisions of Section 39. A 
reading of all these provisions referred to herein above makes 
it very clear that an enquiry as to the age of the juvenile has to 
be made only when he is brought or appears before the 
competent authority. A Police Officer or a Magistrate who is 
not empowered to act or cannot act as a competent authority 
has to merely form an opinion guided by the apparent age of 
the person and in the event of forming an opinion that he is a 
juvenile, he has to forward him to the competent authority at 
the earliest subject to arrangements for keeping in custody and 
safety of the person having been made for the duration of time 
elapsing in between. The competent authority shall proceed to 
hold enquiry as to the age of that person for determining the 
same by reference to the date of the appearance of the person 
before it or by reference to the date when person was brought 
before it under any of the provisions of the Act. It is irrelevant 
what was the age of the person on the date of commission of 
the offence. Any other interpretation would not fit in the 
scheme and phraseology employed by the Parliament in 
drafting the Act." 

(ix) M/s.A-One Granites vs. State of U.P. and others, reported in AIR 


23 

2001 SC 1203: 

"10. The first question which falls for consideration of 
this Court is as to whether the question regarding applicability 
of rule 72 of the Rules in relation to the present lease is 
concluded by the earlier decision of this Court rendered in 
Prem Nath Sharma vs. State of U.P. & Anr., (1997) 4 SCC 

552. From a bare perusal of the said judgment of this 
Court it would be clear that the question as to whether rule 72 
was applicable or not was never canvassed before this Court 
and the only question which was considered was whether there 
was violation of the said rule. 

11. This question was considered by the Court of Appeal in 
Lancaster Motor Co. (London) Ltd. vs. Bremith Ltd., (1941) 1 
KB 675, and it was laid down that when no consideration was 
given to the question, the decision cannot be said to be binding 
and precedents sub silentio and without arguments are of no 
moment. Following the said decision, this Court in the case of 
Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Gurnam Kaur, 1989 (1) 
SCC 101 observed thus:-

In Gerard v. Worth of Paris Ltd.(k), (1936) 2 All ER 905 
(CA), the only point argued was on the question of priority of 
the claimants debt, and, on this argument being heard, the 
court granted the order. No consideration was given to the 
question whether a garnishee order could properly be made on 
an account standing in the name of the liquidator. When, 
therefore, this very point was argued in a subsequent case 
before the Court of Appeal in Lancaster Motor Co. (London) 
Ltd. v. Bremith Ltd., (1941) 1 KB 675, the court held itself not 
bound by its previous decision. Sir Wilfrid Greene, M.R., said 
that he could not help thinking that the point now raised had 
been deliberately passed sub silentio by counsel in order that 
the point of substance might be decided. He went on to say that 
the point had to be decided by the earlier court before it could 
make the order which it did; nevertheless, since it was decided 
without argument, without reference to the crucial words of the 
rule, and without any citation of authority, it was not binding 
and would not be followed. Precedents sub silentio and 
without argument are of no moment. This rule has ever since 
been followed. 

In State of U.P. & Anr. vs. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. & 


24 

Anr., (1991) 4 SCC 139, reiterating the same view, this Court 
laid down that such a decision cannot be deemed to be a law 
declared to have binding effect as is contemplated by Article 
141 of the Constitution of India and observed thus: 

A decision which is not express and is not founded on reasons 
nor it proceeds on consideration of issue cannot be deemed to 
be a law declared to have a binding effect as is contemplated 
by Article 141. 

In the case of Arnit Das vs. State of Bihar, 2000 (5) SCC 488, 
while examining the binding effect of such a decision, this 
Court observed thus:-

A decision not expressed, not accompanied by reasons and not 
proceeding on a conscious consideration of an issue cannot be 
deemed to be a law declared to have a binding effect as is 
contemplated by Article 141. That which has escaped in the 
judgment is not the ratio decidendi. This is the rule of sub 
silentio, in the technical sense when a particular point of law 
was not consciously determined. 

12. Thus we have no difficulty in holding that as the 
question regarding applicability of rule 72 of the Rules having 
not been even referred to, much less considered by this Court 
in the earlier appeals, it cannot be said that the point is 
concluded by the same and no longer res integra and 
accordingly this Court is called upon to decide the same." 

(x) Achaldas Durgaji Oswal (dead) through L.Rs. vs. Ramvilas 

Gangabisan Hoda (dead) through L.Rs. And others, reported in (2003) 2 MLJ 1 

(SC): 

"Order XXXIV Rules 7 and 8 do not confer any right 
upon the usufructuary mortgagee to apply for final decree 
which is conferred on mortgagee on other types of mortgages. 
By reason of sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of Order XXXIV, a 
mortgagor is entitled to make an application for final decree at 
any time before a final decree debarring the plaintiff from all 
right to redeem the mortgaged property has been passed or 


25 

before the confirmation of a sale held in pursuance of a final 
decree passed under sub-rule (3) of this rule. No such 
application is again contemplated at the instance of the 
usufructuary mortgagee. By reason of sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of 
Order XXXIV, a right of redemption is conferred upon the 
mortgagor of a usufructuary mortgage. Such a provision has 
been made evidently having regard to the right of redemption 
of a mortgagor in terms of Section 60 of the Transfer of 
Property Act and further having regard to the fact that a 
usufructuary mortgagee would be entitled to possess the 
property in question till a final decree of redemption is passed. 
25. A bare perusal of the provisions of Order XXXIV 
Rule 7 & 8 would show that despite failure to pay the amount 
found or declared due by the preliminary decree on or before 
the date fixed by the Court, the mortgagee-defendant shall be 
entitled to apply for a final decree under clause c(ii) of rule 7 
of Order XXXIV. In a case of a mortgage by conditional sale 
or anomalous mortgage, the mortgagee can pray for passing of 
a final decree debaring the mortgagor from claiming his right 
to redeem the properly. In a case of a usufructuary mortgage, 
however, the mortgagee is not entitled to apply for a final 
decree. The right of mortgagee to apply for a final decree is 
provided in sub-clause (3) of rule 8 of Order XXXIV. His 
application for a final decree must be confined to for 
declaration that the plaintiff and all persons claiming under 
him are debarred from all right to redeem the property in the 
case of a mortgage by a conditional sale or of an anomalous 
mortgage the terms whereof provide for foreclosure only and 
not for sale. In the case of the mortgage other than 
usufructuary mortgage, the mortgagee can file an application to 
pass a final decree that the mortgaged property or a sufficient 
part thereof be sold, and the proceeds thereof be paid into 
Court and applied in payment of what is found due to the 
defendant, and the balance, if any, be paid to the plaintiff or 
other persons entitled to receive the same. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 
8 shows that only a mortgagor can apply to the Court to pass a 
final decree on payment of the amount found or declared due 
under the preliminary decree on making this deposit and upon 
filing the application as provided for in sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 
the mortgagor can request the Court to order the mortgagee to 
put him in possession of the properties which were the subject 
matter of the mortgage. The amount determined by the Court 
which the mortgagor is liable to pay to the mortgagee can be 
deposited before the right of redeem is lost. It may be noticed 


26 

that even sub-rule (2) of Rule 7 of Order XXXIV does not 
apply to the usufructuary mortgage. It may be noticed that by 
reason of the amendment introduced in 1929 the right 
conferred earlier on a usufructuary mortgage to bring the 
property to sale in case of the mortgagor not making the 
payment within the time fixed in the decree was taken away; 
As sub-rule (2) of Rule 7 is applicable only in a case of 
mortgages other than the usufructuary mortgages, a 
usufructuary mortgagor is not entitled to seek extension of 
time and in that view of the matter the fact that such an 
application made by the First Respondent herein was rejected 
becomes irrelevant. 
43. In the said case, the contentions raised herein had not 
been raised obviously because no such question arose for 
consideration and any passing observation made therein 
without any argument and without any precedent cannot be 
treated to be a declaration of law in terms of Article 141 of the 
Constitution of India. 

44. Any observation made therein contrary to what we 
have held above cannot be said to be good law and is hereby 
overruled." 

(xi) Land Acquisition Officer-cum-R.D.O., Chevella Division, 

Hyderabad and others, reported in 2004 (3) CTC 19 : 

"100. The deprivation of the assignee's right to 
payment of just compensation equivalent to the market value 
of the assigned land may amount to deprivation of right to 
livelihood. The denial of constitutional claim to receive just 
compensation after depriving the assignee of his land is 
impermissible except pursuant to a constitutionally valid rule 
or law. 

104. Therefore, notwithstanding the fact that the 
recipients had accepted the assignment subject to 'no 
compensation clause' and that they will not object to the 
resumption of the assigned lands for a "public purpose, they 
are entitled to assert that any such action on the part of the 
authorities will be in violation of their guaranteed fundamental 
rights. How far the argument regarding the existence and scope 
of the right claimed by the recipients is well-founded is another 
matter. But, the argument has to be examined despite the 
concession. 


27 

105. In the matter of distribution of material resources of 
the community to the vulnerable sections of the society by the 
State in furtherance of its constitutional obligations no 
argument can be heard from the State contending that the 
recipient of the benefit may either accept with the restrictions 
or not to accept the benefit at all. The whole idea of 
distributive justice is to empower the weaker sections of the 
society and to provide them their share of cake in the material 
resources of the community of which they were deprived from 
times immemorial for no fault of theirs. Having resolved to 
extend the benefits as a welfare measure, no unconstitutional 
condition can be imposed depriving the recipients of the 
benefits of their legitimate right to get compensation in case of 
taking over of the benefit even for a valid public purpose. The 
recipients cannot be at the mercy of the State forever. 

108. Be it noted, the land by way of assignment is let for 
purposes of agriculture or for purposes ancillary thereto, for 
personal occupation and cultivation by the agricultural 
labourers and others belonging to weaker sections of the 
society. It may be lawful for the State to acquire any portion of 
such land as is within the ceiling limit but not without 
providing for compensation at a rate which shall not be less 
than the market value thereof. The acquisition of such land 
even for a public purpose without payment of compensation 
shall be in the teeth of Article 31-A of the Constitution of 
India. 

110. In the result, we hold that 'no compensation' clause, 
restricting the right of the assignees to claim full compensation 
in respect of the land resumed equivalent to the market value 
of the land, is unconstitutional. The 'no compensation clause' 
infringes the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14 and 
31-A of the Constitution. We are conscious that Article 21 
essentially deals with personal liberty. But in cases where 
deprivation of property would lead to deprivation of life or 
liberty or livelihood, Article 21 springs into action and any 
such deprivation without just payment of compensation 
amounts to infringement of the right guaranteed thereunder. 
The doctrine of 'unconstitutional conditions' applies in all its 
force. 

111. In the circumstances, we hold that the assignees of 


28 

the Government lands are entitled to payment of compensation 
equivalent to the full market value of the land and other 
benefits on par with full owners of the land even in cases 
where the assigned lands are taken possession of by the State 
in accordance with the terms of grant or patta, though such 
resumption is for a public purpose. We further hold that even 
in cases where the State does not invoke the covenant of the 
grant or patta to resume the land for such public purpose and 
resorts to acquisition of the land under the provisions of the 
Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the assignees shall be entitled to 
compensation as owners of the land and for all other 
consequential benefits under the provisions of the Land 
Acquisition Act, 1894. No condition incorporated in patta/deed 
of assignment shall operate as a clog putting any restriction on 
the right of the assignee to claim full compensation as owner 
of the land. 

112. In such view of ours, the view taken by this Court in 
Bondapalli Sanyasi (supra) that whenever the land is taken 
possession of by the State invoking the terms of the grant, the 
right of an assignee to any compensation may have to be 
determined in accordance with the conditions in patta itself is 
unsustainable. With due respect, we are unable to agree with 
the view taken in this regard. We are also unable to agree with 
the view taken that the assignee shall be entitled to 
compensation in terms of the Land Acquisition Act not as 
owner but as an interested person for the interest he held in the 
property." 

(xii) Chairman, Indore Vikas Pradhikaran vs. M/s. Pure Industrial Cock 

& Chemicals Ltd. & Others, reported in AIR 2007 SC 2458 : 

"114. The question again came up for consideration in 
Howrah Municipal Corpn. v. Ganges Rope Co. Ltd. [(2004) 1 
SCC 663], wherein this Court categorically held : 

"The context in which the respondent Company claims a 
vested right for sanction and which has been accepted by the 
Division Bench of the High Court, is not a right in relation to 
ownership or possession of any property for which the 
expression vest is generally used. What we can understand 
from the claim of a vested right set up by the respondent 


29 

Company is that on the basis of the Building Rules, as 
applicable to their case on the date of making an application 
for sanction and the fixed period allotted by the Court for its 
consideration, it had a legitimate or settled expectation to 
obtain the sanction. In our considered opinion, such settled 
expectation, if any, did not create any vested right to obtain 
sanction. True it is, that the respondent Company which can 
have no control over the manner of processing of application 
for sanction by the Corporation cannot be blamed for delay but 
during pendency of its application for sanction, if the State 
Government, in exercise of its rule-making power, amended 
the Building Rules and imposed restrictions on the heights of 
buildings on G.T. Road and other wards, such settled 
expectation has been rendered impossible of fulfilment due to 
change in law. The claim based on the alleged vested right or 
settled expectation cannot be set up against statutory 
provisions which were brought into force by the State 
Government by amending the Building Rules and not by the 
Corporation against whom such vested right or settled 
expectation is being sought to be enforced. The vested right or 
settled expectation has been nullified not only by the 
Corporation but also by the State by amending the Building 
Rules. Besides this, such a settled expectation or the so-called 
vested right cannot be countenanced against public interest and 
convenience which are sought to be served by amendment of 
the Building Rules and the resolution of the Corporation issued 
thereupon." 

(xiii) Pradeep Oil Corporation vs. Municipal Corporation of Delhi and 

another, reported in (2011) 5 SCC 270: 

"41. It is well settled legal position that a license can be 
revoked at any time at the pleasure of the licensor. Even 
otherwise, unless the parties to the agreement had an intention 
to enter into a deed of lease the Administration would not have 
agreed to demise the premises on payment of rent in lieu of 
grant of exclusive possession of the demised land and further 
stipulated service of three months' notice calling upon either 
party to terminate the agreement. In view of the same, the 
argument advanced by the learned counsel of the appellant that 
a stipulation having been made in the agreement itself that by 
reasons thereof the grantee shall not be a tenant and thus the 
deed must be construed to be a license cannot be accepted. In 


30 

our considered view, such a clause may at best be one of the 
factors for construction of the document in question but the 
same by itself certainly be a decisive factor." 

(xiv) Azim Ahmad Kazmi and others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and 

another, reported in (2012) 7 SCC 278 : 

"30. In State of U.P. vs. Zahoor Ahmad, this Court held 
that Section 3 of the Act declares the unfettered discretion of 
the Government to impose such conditions and limitations as it 
thinks fit, no matter what the general law of the land be. From 
Clause 3(C) of the deed, it is clear that the State of U.P. While 
granting lease made it clear that if the demised premises are at 
any time required by the lessor for his or for any public 
purpose, he shall have the right to give one month's clear 
notice to the lessee to remove any building standing at the time 
on the demised property and within two months of the receipt 
of the notice to take possession thereof on the expiry of that 
period subject to the condition that if the lessor is willing to 
purchase the property on the demises premises, the lessees 
shall be paid for such building such amount as may be 
determined by the Secretary to the Government of U.P. In the 
Nagar Awas Department." 

12. Mr.R.Natarajan, learned counsel appearing for the appellant in 

W.A.No.2510 of 2013, would submit that the appellant is one of the 

descendants in the family of Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar and was appointed 

as a co-Trustee by this Hon'ble Court vide order dated 05.06.2000 in 

O.S.A.Nos.66 and 67 of 2000. The Government, vide G.O.Ms.No.534 dated 

06.08.1888, had allotted a piece of land measuring an extent of 1.33 acres, 

comprised in T.S.No.41, Vepery Village, Fort-Tondiarpet Taluk valued at 

Rs.3,638/-at free of cost solely for the purpose of construction of choultry, 

failing which, the said grant of land would be liable for resumption. The 

choultry building so constructed has been classified as a historical and heritage 


31 

building by the High Power Heritage Committee under orders of this Court and 

subsequently, a direction was issued by this Court to the Heritage Conservation 

Committee to issue notice to all occupants of the building so as to preserve and 

maintain such buildings without causing any damage to them, thereby also 

cautioning the appellant to ensure safety of the heritage building. He would 

further submit that the protection of ancient monuments has to be necessarily 

kept in mind while carrying out developmental activities. The need for ensuring 

protection and preservation of ancient monuments for the benefit of future 

generations has to be balanced with benefits which may accrue from mining 

and other development-related activities. The appellant has also submitted a 

claim to the Government for maintenance and preservation of temples and the 

statue of Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar, but there was no direct consideration 

of the claim of the appellant, instead, it was simply stated that CMRL has 

committed to preserve the heritage building as per the meeting of Heritage 

Committee held on 17.02.2012. It is indeed regrettable to note that the 

Heritage Committee has only directed CMRL to ensure as to the non-hindrance 

of the view of Central Railway Station, which falls in the proximity of the 

proposed station area. The learned counsel would also argue that on an earlier 

occasion, CMRL filed an affidavit before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 

O.S.A.Nos.100 and 101 of 2011, stating its inability to plan setting up of 

underground metro station in lands, where Hotel Picnic was situated thereon. 

Therefore, it is crystal clear that there was no discussion regarding resumption 


32 

of Rajah Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar Choultry located in T.S.No.41. Moreover, 

the founder Trustee had invested a sum of Rs.30,000/-in the year 1888 itself 

towards construction of choultry in the grant land, which is under the 

management and control of this Court as per the Official Trustee Act, 1913. 

According to Section 10 (2) of the said Act, the Official Trustee has to take 

periodical directions and orders from this Court as required under Section 25 

thereof. 

13. Further, according to the learned counsel, even in matters of transfer 

of Trust property, as per the mandate of Section 29 of the Official Trustee Act, 

this Court alone is vested with the authority of ordering transfer of the Trust 

property. All these provisions of law have been completely breached and 

smashed by the Government under the arbitrary assumption to the effect that, it 

has its own authority and power to resume the Trust property of Rajah Sir 

Ramasamy Mudaliar without reference to this Court. Hence, the only course 

available to the State is to either move this Court under Section 25 of the 

Official Trustees Act or under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, that 

the Government has no power to intrude or invade the right of the founder 

Trustee and that the encumbrance existing in T.S.No.41 cannot be ignored by 

the State. Thus, it is prayed by the learned counsel for the appellant that the 

impugned order passed in W.P.No.28461 of 2013 is liable to be set aside in 

view of the reason that encumbrance exists in the subject property, which 

debars the 1 st respondent from adopting the measure of resumption and the legal 


33 

encumbrance confers possessory rights and title upon Rajah Sir Ramasamy 

Mudaliar Choultry, which has to be addressed and redressed in the manner 

specified under the scheme of Land Acquisition Act. 

14. In support of his case, Mr.R.Natarajan, learned counsel, has relied on 

the following decisions: 

(i) Bachan Singh vs. State of Punjab etc Batch, reported in (1982) 3 SCC 

24 : 

"18. It will thus be seen that the rule of law has much 
greater vitality under our Constitution than it has in other 
countries like the United Kingdom which has no 
constitutionally enacted fundamental rights. The rule of law has 
really three basic and fundamental assumptions; one is that law 
law-making must be essentially in the hands of a 
democratically elected legislature, subject of course to any 
power in the executive in an emergent situation to promulgate 
ordinances effective for a short duration while the legislature is 
not in session as also to enact delegated legislation in 
accordance with the guidelines laid down by the legislature; the 
other is that, even in the hands of a democratically elected 
legislature, there should not be unfettered legislative power, 
for, as Jefferson said: "Let no man be trusted with power but tie 
him down from making mischief by the chains of the 
Constitution"; and lastly there must be an independent judiciary 
to protect the citizen against excesses of executive and 
legislative power. Fortunately, whatever uncharitable and 
irresponsible critics might say when they find a decision of the 
court going against the view held by them, we can confidently 
assert that we have in our country all these three elements 
essential to the rule of law. It is plain and indisputable that 
under our Constitution law cannot be arbitrary or irrational and 
if it is, it would be clearly invalid, whether under Article 14 or 
Article 19 or Article 21, whichever be applicable." 

(ii) Amba Bai and Others vs. Gopal and other, reported in (2001) 5 SCC 

570 : 


34 

"11. If the Judgement or order of an inferior Court is 
subjected to an appeal or revision by the superior court and in 
such proceeedings the order or judgment is passed by the 
superior court determining the rights of parties, it would 
supersede the order or judgment passed by the inferior court. 
The juristic justification for such doctrine of merger is based 
on the common law principle that there cannot be, at one and 
the same time, more than one operative order governing the 
subject matter and the judgment of the inferior court is deemed 
to lose its identity and merges with the judgment of the 
superior court. In the course of time, this concept which was 
originally restricted to appellate decrees on the ground that an 
appeal is continuation of the suit, came to be gradually 
extended to other proceedings like Revisions and even the 
proceedings before quasi-judicial and executive authorities. 

(iii) Saraswati Devi (Dead) By Lr. vs. Delhi Development Authority and 

others, reported in (2013) 3 SCC 571: 

"34. What is the effect of provisional possession 
which was given to the appellants husband in 1960 on 
approval of his highest bid? Does it amount to creation of 
an encumbrance in the property? If the provisional 
possession given to the appellant's husband amounted to 
creation of an encumbrance, whether the said property could 
have been acquired under the LA Act although the 
ownership vested in the central government? The fate of the 
appeal significantly will depend upon answer to these 
questions. 

39. In M. Ratanchand Chordia & Ors. v. Kasim 
Khaleeli, a Division Bench of the Madras High Court had 
an occasion to consider the meaning of the word 
"encumbrances" with reference to the 1954 Act and the LA 
Act in the context of the easemantary right of way. The 
Division Bench considered the word "encumbrances" thus : 
(AIR p.215, para 18) 

"18. The word "Encumbrances" in regard to a 
person or an estate denotes a burden which 
ordinarily consists of debts, obligations and 
responsibilities. In the sphere of law it connotes a 


35 

liability attached to the property arising out of a 
claim or lien subsisting in favour of a person who is 
not the owner of the property. Thus a mortgage, a 
charge and vendor's lien are all instances of 
encumbrances. The essence of an encumbrance is 
that it must bear upon the property directly and in-
directly and not remotely or circuitously. It is a right 
in realiena circumscribing and subtracting from the 
general proprietary right of another person. An 
encumbered right, that is a right subject to a 
limitation, is called servient while the encumbrance 
itself is designated as dominant" 

41. It is well known in law that a person in 
possession of the property though not owner -is entitled to 
certain rights by virtue of his possession alone. We are in 
agreement with the view of the Punjab High Court in 
Roshan Lal Goswami that an auction-purchaser on 
provisional possession being given to him possesses 
possessory rights, though he does not have proprietary 
rights in the auctioned property. Thus, there remains no 
doubt that in October, 1960 or near about encumbrance in 
the subject property came to be created. 

42. The next question is whether on creation of an 
encumbrance, the subject property could have been acquired 
under the LA Act although the ownership in the land vested 
in the central government. Ordinarily, when the government 
possesses an interest in land, which is the subject of 
acquisition under the LA Act, that interest is outside such 
acquisition because there can be no question of the 
government acquiring what is its own. This is what this 
Court said in Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri13 but this rule is 
not without an exception. There is no impediment in 
acquisition of land owned by the central government by 
invoking the provisions of the LA Act where such land is 
encumbered or where in respect of the land owned by the 
government some private interest has been created. As a 
matter of fact, Sharda Devi11 does not hold to the contrary. 
It is so because what Sharda Devi holds is this : the 
acquisition of land wherein the ownership or the entirety of 
rights already vested in the State on which there are no 
private rights or encumbrance such land is beyond the 


36 

purview of the LA Act. In other words, if the government 
has complete ownership or the entirety of rights in the 
property with it, such land cannot be acquired by the 
government by invoking its power of acquisition under the 
LA Act but if some private rights have been created in such 
property or the property has encumbrance(s), the acquisition 
of such land is not beyond the pale of the LA Act. 

43. Madan Lal Nangia has been relied upon by the 
Division Bench in the impugned order in upsetting the 
decision of the Single Judge. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned 
senior counsel for the appellant sought to distinguish this 
judgment. He submitted that Madan Lal Nangia was a case 
where this Court was concerned with the properties which 
vested in the custodian and having regard to this aspect, this 
Court said that merely because the properties vest in the 
custodian as an evacuee property it does not mean that the 
same cannot be acquired for some other purpose. 

44. It is true that facts in Madan Lal Nangia were 
little different but, in our view, the legal position 
highlighted therein does not become inapplicable to the 
present case on that ground. In paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 of 
the Report (Pgs. 334-335), this Court observed as follows: 
(SCC pp.334-35) 

"16. A property is a composite property 
because a private party has an interest in that 
property. The scheme of separation, to be framed 
under Section 10 of the Evacuee Interest 
(Separation) Act, is for the purpose of separating the 
interest of the evacuee from that of the private party. 
Therefore, even if the evacuee's interest was 
acquired under Section 12, the interest of the private 
person could have been acquired under the Land 
Acquisition Act. Further, if the land stood acquired 
by the notification dated 7-7-1955 then the question 
would arise as to how the respondents acquired title 
to these lands. If they purchased after the date of 
notification dated 7-7-1955, they would get no title. 
They then would not be able to maintain the writ 
petition. Dr Dhavan submitted that the appellants 
had admitted the title of the respondents and thus 
this question would not arise. We are unable to 


37 

accept the submission. It is only a person who has 
an interest in the land who can challenge 
acquisition. When a challenge is made to an 
acquisition at a belated stage, then even if the court 
is inclined to allow such a belated challenge, it must 
first satisfy itself that the person challenging 
acquisition has title to the land. Very significantly, 
in their writ petition the respondents do not state 
when they acquired title. 

17. Undoubtedly, the evacuee properties 
vested in the Custodian for the purposes of 
distribution as per the provisions of the various 
Acts. However, it is to be noted that under the 
various Acts in lieu of properties, compensation in 
terms of money can also be paid. Thus, merely 
because the properties vest in the Custodian as 
evacuee properties does not mean that the same 
cannot be acquired for some other public purpose.... 

18. It would be open to the Government to 
acquire evacuee property and give to the Custodian 
compensation for such acquisition. Section 4 
notification dated 23-1-1965 not having excluded 
evacuee properties the respondents can get no 
benefit from the fact that in the 1959 notification 
evacuee properties had been excluded." 

45.1.(i) At the time of acquisition of evacuee property 
under Section 12 of the 1954 Act if such property has 
interest of a private person, the interest of private person 
can be acquired under the LA Act even though the land is 
owned by the government. 

46. What follows from proposition (i) is also this that 
after the acquisition of evacuee property under Section 12, 
if any encumbrance is created or interest of a private person 
intervenes therein, such land even if owned by the 
government can be acquired under the LA Act. This is in 
congruity and consonance with Sharda Devi as well." 

(iv) K.Guruprasad Rao vs. State of Karnataka and others, reported in 

(2013) 8 SCC 418 : 

"94. In our view, the detailed reasons recorded by the 


38 

Committee, which have been extracted hereinabove, for not 
accepting the recommendations of the expert bodies about 
the distance up to which mining should not be allowed are 
correct and those recommendations cannot be relied upon 
for accepting the argument of the learned counsel for the 
State and the private respondents that the recommendations 
made by the Committee should be rejected. We may hasten 
to add that the Committee's recommendations are not in 
conflict with the provisions of the 1957 Act and the Rules 
framed thereunder. The 1959 Rules and the Karnataka 
Rules provide for grant of permission/licence for mining in 
the prohibited/regulated/protected area but the documents 
produced before this Court do not show that the competent 
authority had granted permission/licence to any of the 
private respondents for undertaking mining operations 
which have the effect of damaging the temple in question. 
That apart, the distance criteria prescribed in the 1958 Act, 
the Karnataka Act and the Rules framed thereunder has 
little or no bearing on deciding the question of restricting 
the mining operations near the protected monument which 
has already suffered extensive damage due to such 
operations. 

98. When seen in this light, the protection of ancient 
monuments has necessarily to be kept in mind while 
carrying out development activities. The need for ensuring 
protection and preservation of the ancient monuments for 
the benefit of future generations has to be balanced with the 
benefits which may accrue from mining and other 
development related activities. In our view, the 
recommendations and suggestions made by the Committee 
for creation of Core Zone and Buffer Zone appropriately 
create this balance. While mining activity is sure to create 
financial wealth for the leaseholders and also the State, the 
immense cultural and historic wealth, not to mention the 
wealth of information which the temple provides cannot be 
ignored and every effort has to be made to protect the 
temple. 

99. Before concluding, we may deal with the 
submission of Shri Lalit that mining can be permitted 
beyond the distance of 300 meters from the temple by using 
Ripper Dozer and Rock Breaker machines. According to the 
learned senior counsel, the use of Ripper Dozer and Rock 


39 

Breaker will not produce vibration which may cause harm 
to the temple. In our view, this submission does not merit 
acceptance because in paragraph 6 of the suggestions made 
by it, the Committee appointed by the Court has already 
indicated that mining in the Buffer Zone may be permitted 
with controlled blasting or without blasting by using Ripper 
Dozer/Rock Breaker or any other machinery and taking 
adequate measures towards generation, propagation, 
suppression and deposition of airborne dust to be closely 
monitored by experts from IBM etc. 

100. In the result, the appeal is allowed and the 
impugned order is set aside. The report of the Committee is 
accepted and the State Government is directed to implement 
the recommendations contained in Part V thereof including 
the recommendation relating to creation of Corpus Fund of 
Rs.3,43,19,160 which shall be utilized for implementing the 
conservation plan for Jambunatheswara temple. However, it 
is made clear that respondent No.18 shall be free to operate 
the Beneficiation plant subject to the condition that it shall 
procure raw material only through E-auction mode. 

101. With a view to ensure that other protected 
monuments in the State do not suffer the fate of 
Jambunatheswara temple, we direct that the Committee 
appointed by this Court vide order dated 26.4.2011 shall 
undertake similar exercise in respect of other protected 
monuments in the State in whose vicinity mining operations 
are being undertaken and submit report to the State 
Government within a maximum period of nine months. The 
State Government shall release a sum of Rs.30 lacs in 
favour of the Committee to meet the expenses of survey, 
investigation etc. The report submitted by the Committee 
shall be considered by the Government within next two 
months and appropriate order be passed. 

102. We hope and trust that the Government of India 
will also appoint an expert committee/group to examine the 
impact of mining on the monuments declared as protected 
monuments under the 1958 Act and take necessary remedial 
measures." 

15. Mr.Anirudh Krishnan, learned counsel appearing for the appellants in 


40 

W.A.Nos.2513 to 2517 of 2013, would vehemently contend that resumption 

will be subject to the terms of the lease and the first respondent has to initiate 

appropriate legal proceedings to evict the lessees and any other method to evict 

the lessees would amount to extra-judicial dispossession, which is 

impermissible in law. The doctrine of sub-silentio has been practised in the 

present case, meaning thereby resumption was implied without expression or 

notice and directions issued by the Hon'ble Apex Court to the effect that 

objections of the appellants and the other lessees must be taken into account 

before passing an order, were not followed. Above all, it is evident from the 

map produced by CMRL that the area earmarked for CMRL project does not 

include appellants' lease-hold area and the lands required for the said project 

are situated on the northern side of Poonamallee High Road. Based on the 

source of information elicited under RTI Act, it is obvious that the appellants' 

lease-hold areas fall outside the lands earmarked for the purpose of Metro Rail 

Project. The appellants, as per the impugned orders, are to vacate their premises 

without claiming compensation for the amount spent on it, which is wholly 

arbitrary, illegal and violative of Articles 14 and 300(A) of the Constitution of 

India. He would submit that Section 25 of the Official Trustees Act clearly 

stipulates that any involvement of the Trust property should be dealt with only 

by the Hon'ble High Court and the Government has no business to interfere 

with the administration of the Trust. The learned counsel, by inter alia stating 

that the learned Single Judge, while allowing resumption of appellants' lands 


41 

without even determining the compensation amount has taken away the rights 

of appellants, would submit that pronouncements of law, which are not part of 

the ratio decidendi and are not authoritative and the same was delivered 

without reference to the relevant provisions of the Act and a decision which is 

not express and is not founded on reasons nor it proceeds on consideration of 

issue cannot be deemed to be a law declared to have a binding effect as is 

contemplated under Article 141. He would finally contend that issuance of 

impugned orders completely ignoring the fact that appellants are in possession 

of the schedule property under a valid and subsisting lease is against the terms 

of the lease and without recourse to law and, thus, dismissal of writ petitions 

has resulted in a jeopardy to the right of appellants to livelihood, which needs 

interference by this Court in entirety. The learned counsel has cited following 

judgments: 

(i) Lancaster Motor Company Limited vs. Bremith Limited, reported in 
1941 1 K.B. 675 : 

"I should have thought, as I have said, that the appeal 
could not succeed, but Mr.Mitchell refers us to the decision of 
this Court in Gerard vs. Worth of Paris Ltd. There a 
Company went into voluntary liquidation, the liquidator 
discharged the manageress, and she sued the company for 
wrongful dismissal and obtained judgment in default of 
defence. She then applied for a garnishee order on a bank 
account in the name of the liquidator. There was no evidence 
of anyother claims on the company. The Master refused to 
make the order absolute, but the judge in chambers reversed 
his decision. There were several points argued in the case, 
but the point on which the parties appeared to be anxious to 
have a decision was the question to the priority of the 
claimant's debt. So far as the report shows, no argument was 
addressed to the Court on the question whether or not, in view 


42 

of the fact that the account was in the name of the liquidator, a 
garnishee order could properly be made. I cannot help 
thinking, on reading the report, that that point was 
deliberately passed sub silentio by counsel in order that the 
point of substance might be decided. 

Neverthless, it is fair to say that the point had to be 
decided by the Court before it could make the order which it 
did, because it had to decide whether the order of the judge 
should stand or the order of the Master should be restored. 
There were two members of the Court sitting, Slesser L.J. And 
Romer L.J., and the only material passage in the judgment 
(which was the judgment of Slesser L.J., Romer L.J. Not 
delivering an independent judgment) is to the following 
effect: The Master appears to have taken the view that, in so 
far as the debt was owing to the company and the account was 
in the name of the liquidator, there was a difficulty in 
proceeding by garnishee order. In my view the learned 
Master, if that was his view, was mistaken. If all other 
requirements were satisfied and the lady was entitled to 
garnishee that account of the company, the mere fact that it 
stood in the name of the liquidator does not seem to me to 
effect any difference in her rights." With all respect to the 
learned Lord Judge who delivered that judgment, and to 
Romer L.J., who agreed with it, I cannot consider that this 
Court is bound to follow it. It was delivered without 
argument, without reference to the cruicial words of the rule, 
and without any citation of authority. Accordingly, I do not 
propose to follow these observations, because it seems to me 
that they are wrong in principle and are not to be justified 
when the language of the rule and the ordinary principles 
which govern the relationship of banker and customer are 
considered. 

It is worth noticing that in the later case of Hirschorn v. 
Evans Slesser L.J. Delivered a judgment, as one of a majority 
consisting of himself and Mackinnon L.J., the reasoning of 
which appears to me to be quite inconsistent with the previous 
decision to which he had been a party in Gerard vs. Worth of 
Paris Ld. In Hirschorn v. Evans, a husband and a wife had a 
bank account in their joint names and it was held by Slesser 
L.J. And Mackinnon L.J., Greer L.J. Dissenting that 
"inasmuch as the debt which the bank owed was not a debt 
due to the husband alone but to him jointly with his wife, it 


43 

could not be attached to answer the judgment against these 
matters. The crucial matter to be observed is what is the 
relationship of the alleged debtor. That relationship must be 
one of debtor and creditor and unless it falls within that 
description the rule does not apply. That aspect of the matter 
was fully gone into by Slesser L.J., and Mackinnnon L.J. Did 
not dissent from that view. In fact, he took the same view 
himself. 

In those circumstances, I feel that I am justified in the 
course which I propose to take and that is of saying that, in 
my opinion, this appeal must be dismissed. 

(ii) Anamallai Club vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and others, reported 

in AIR 1997 SCC 3650 : 

"5. The question is; whether the resumption of 
possession unilaterally, after determination of the grant in the 
manner provided under the grant itself, is valid in law as was 
held by the High Court? We think that the view taken by the 
High Court is not correct in law. In Bishan Das & Ors. vs. 
State of Punjab & Ors.[(1962 2 SCR 69], a Constitution 
Bench of this Court had considered the question whether the 
Government would unilaterally take possession of the land 
after termination of the lease. One Ramjidas had built a 
dharamasala, a temple and shops appurtenant thereto, after 
having a licence of land from the State Government. The lease 
was terminated and thereafter when the persons in possession 
were sought to be dispossessed, without taking any recourse 
to law, they filed writ petition under Article 226 but remained 
unsuccessful. When writ petition under Article 32 was filed, 
this Court had considered the question whether the 
Government is entitled to resume the land with a minimum 
use of force for ejectment without recourse to law. It was 
contended therein that there was no dispute as the question of 
the fact between the parties that the petitioners therein had no 
right and title to the subject matter in dispute. The writ 
petition under Article 226 was dismissed on the ground of the 
disputed question of fact which was upheld in appeal by the 
Division Bench. A writ petition under Article 32 was filed. 
The right to possession of land was a fundamental right at that 


44 

time. It was contended that the Government terminated the 
lease, as thereafter they were trespassers and so they had no 
right to resist the Government's power to resume the land. 
This Court had repelled both the contentions as unsound and 
has held that the Government violated the fundamental right 
to possession of lead since the petitioners therein were not 
trespassers. They remained in possession for long time. 
Pursuant to the lease, they had constructed dharamasala, 
temple and shops and managed them during the life time of 
the licencee. After his death, the petitioner and members of 
the family continued in possession of and in management of 
the properties which was an admitted possession. Therefore, 
they were not mere trespassers in respect of the said 
properties. It was held that on the admitted facts of the case, 
the petitioners therein could not said to be said in the 
trespassers in respect of the dharamasala, temple and shops 
not could the State could be said to be the owner of the 
property, irrespective of whether it was a trust, public or 
private having taking the possession unilaterally. It was open 
to the State to take appropriate legal action for the purpose. It 
was also held that the State could not remove them from 
possession except under the authority of law. The same view 
was reiterated by this Court inState of U.P. & Ors. vs. 
Maharaja Dharmander Pd. Singh & Ors.[(1989) 2 SCC 505 at 
516) thus: 

"A lessor, with the best of title, has no right to resume 
possession extra-judicially by use of force, from a lessee, even 
after the expiry of earlier termination of the lease by forfeiture 
or otherwise. The use of the expression `re-entry' in the lease 
deed does not authorise extra-judicial possession and forcible 
dispossession is prohibited; a lessee cannot be dispossessed 
otherwise than in due course of law. In the present case, the 
fact that the lessor is the State does not place it in any higher 
or better position. On the contrary, it is under an additional 
inhibition stemming from the requirement that all actions of 
Government and Governmental authorities should have a 
`legal' pedigree'. In Bishan Das vs. State of Punjab [(1962) 2 
SCR 69] this Court said: 

"We must, therefore, repel the argument based on the 
contention that the petitioners were trespassers and could be 
removed by an executive order. The argument is not only 
specious but highly dangerous by reason of its implications 


45 

and impact on law and order..." 

Before we part with this case, we feel it our duty to say that 
the executive action taken in this case by the State and its 
officers is destructive of the basic principle. 

Therefore, there is no question in the present case of the 
Government thinking of appropriating to itself an extra-
judicial right of re-entry. Possession can be resumed by 
Government only in a manner known to or recognised by law. 
It cannot resume possession otherwise than in accordance 
with law. Government is, accordingly, prohibited from taking 
possession otherwise than in due course of law." 

6. In Lallu Yeshwant Singh vs. Rao Jagdish Singh & 
Ors. [(1968) 2 SCR 203], a Bench of this Court had 
considered the same question after reviewing the case law in 
that behalf and held that the Government cannot take 
possession of the land except in accordance with the 
procedure prescribed under the Act. In that case, the recourse 
to the provisions under Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act 
(Section 6 of the present Specific Relief Act, 1963) was 
upheld. The question was also considered by this Court by 
one of us (K. Ramaswamy, J.) in East India Hotels Ltd. vs. 
Syndicate Bank [1992 Supp. (2) 29 at 44]. It was held in 
paragraph 29, 30 and 32 that: 

"They must obtain such possession as they are entitled 
to by proper course. In our jurisprudence governed by rule of 
law even an unauthorised occupant can beejected only in the 
manner provided by law. The remedy under Section 6 is 
summary and its object is to prevent self help and to 
discourage people in adopt any means fair or foul to 
dispossess a person unless dispossession was in due course of 
law or with consent. 

What is meant by due course of law? Due course of law 
in each particular case means such an exercise of the powers 
by duly constituted tribunal or court in accordance with the 
procedure established by law under such safeguards of the 
protection of individual rights. A course of legal proceedings 
according to the rules and principles which have been 
established in our system of jurisprudence for the enforcement 
and protection of private rights. To give such proceedings any 
validity, there must thus be a tribunal competent by its 
constitution, that is by law of its creation, to pass upon the 


46 

subject matter of the suit or proceeding; and, if that involves 
merely a determination of the personal liability of the 
defendant, it must be brought within its jurisdiction by service 
of process within the State, or his voluntary appearance. Due 
course of law implies the right of the person affected thereby 
to be present before the tribunal which pronounces judgment 
upon the question of life, liberty or property in its most 
comprehensive sense; to be heard, by testimony or otherwise 
and to have the right determination of the controversy 
byproof, every material fat which bears on the question of fact 
or liability be conclusively proved or presumed against him. 
This is the meaning of due course of law in a comprehensive 
sense. 

It is thus clear that the course have viewed with askance any 
process other than strict compliance of law as valid in 
dispossessing a person in occupation of immovable property 
against his consent. The reason is obvious that it aims to 
preserve the efficacy of law and peace and order in the society 
relegating the jurisprudential perspectives to a suit under 
Section 6 of the Act and restitute possession to the person 
dispossessed, irrespective of the fact wether the has any title 
to possession or not." 

(iii) The Collector of Bombay vs. Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri and 

others, reported in (1955) 1 SCR 1311 : 

"20. Then there remains the question whether the sale 
deed, Exhibit A, imposes any limitation on the right of the 
Crown to assess the lands. The deed conveys the lands to the 
purchasers absolutely "with all rights, easements and 
appurtenances whatsoever" to be held "for ever". It does not, 
however, recite that they are to be held revenue-free. But it is 
argued for the respondents that where there is an absolute 
sale by the Crown as here, that necessarily imports that the 
land is conveyed revenue-free; and section 3 of the Crown 
Grants Act No. XV of 1895 and certain observations in 
Dadoba v. Collector of Bombay(1) were relied on as 
supporting this contention. Section 3 of Act No. XV of 1895 
is as follows: 

"All provisions restrictions, conditions and limitations 
over contained in any such grant or transfer as aforesaid shall 
be valid and take effect according to their tenor any rule of 


47 

law, statute or enactment of the Legislature to the contrary 
notwithstanding". 

21. The contention is that as the grant is of a freehold 
estate without any reservation it must, to take effect 
according to its tenor, be construed as granting exemption 
from assessment to revenue. But that will be extending the 
bounds of section 3 beyond its contents. The object of the Act 
as declared in the preamble is to remove certain doubts "as to 
the extent and operation of the Transfer of Property Act, 
1882, and, as to the power of the Crown to impose limitations 
and restrictions upon grants and other transfers of land made 
by it or under its authority". Section 2 enacts that the 
provisions of the Transfer of Property Act do not apply to 
Crown grants. Then follows section 3 with a positive 
declaration that "all provisions, restrictions, conditions and 
limitations over" shall take effect according to their tenor. 

Reading the enactment as a whole, the scope of section 3 is 
that it saves "provisions, restrictions, conditions and 
limitations over" which would be bad under the provisions of 
the Transfer of Property Act, such as conditions in restraint of 
alienations or enjoyment repugnant to the nature of the estate, 
limitations offending the rule against perpetuities and the 
like. But no question arises here as to the validity of any 
provision, restriction, condition, or limitation over, contained 
in Exhibit A on the ground that it is in contravention of any 
of the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, and there is 
accordingly nothing on which section 3 could take effect. 

23. In this view, section 3 must also be construed in 
the light of the preamble, and so construed, it cannot, for the 
reasons already given, have any bearing on the rights of the 
parties. Moreover, that section only enacts that "all 
provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations over" shall 
take effect according to their tenor, and what is relied on is 
not any provision, restriction, condition or limitation over, in 
Exhibit A which according to its tenor entitles the 
respondents to hold the lands rent-free, but the absolute 
character of the interest conveyed under Exhibit A. 
Therefore, section 3 does not in terms apply."

1206 : 


48 

"23.The last provision has been made to make it clear 
that the management will not take away the money but 
immediately give it to the representative of the pujaris for 
distribution among them. The provisions of the Public Trusts 
Act will be satisfied in that the management will be in a 
position to know how much has gone to the pujaris including 
the amount spent on dhoop, deep and neivedya. This 
provision will also take away any objection about there being 
interference with the private rights of the pujaris under the 
agreement of 1872." 

(v) Ahmed Adam Sait and Others vs. Inayathullah Mekhri and others, 

reported in 1964 2 SCR 647 : 

"15. The first point which has been pressed before us 
by Mr. Setalvad is that the present suit is barred by reason of 
the fact that in the earlier suit instituted under s. 92 of the 
Code a scheme had already been framed by a court of 
competent jurisdiction and the decree by which the said 
scheme wAs ordered to be drawn binds all parties interested 
in the Trust. A suit under s. 92, it is urged, is a representative 
suit, and so, whether or not the present respondents actually 
appeared in that suit, they would be bound by the decree 
which had framed a scheme for the proper administration of 
the Trust. In support of this argument, reliance is placed on 
the decision of this Court in Raja Anandrao v. Shamrao (1), 
where it is observed that though the Pujaris were not parties to 
the suit under s. 92, the decision in that suit binds the pujaris 
as worshippers so far as the administration of the temple is 
concerned, because a suit under s. 92 is a representative suit 
and binds not only the parties thereto, but all those who are 
interested in the Trust. Mr. Setalvad has also relied on the two 
decisions of the Madras High Court, (1) in Ramados v. 
Hanumantha Rao (2) and (2) in Khaja Hassaanullah Khan v. 
Royal Mosque Trust Board (3) . The effect of those two 
decisions is that a decree passed in a suit filed under s. 92 
framing a scheme is binding on all and it prevents every 
person whether a party to the suit or not from asserting in a 
subsequent suit rights which conflict with or attack the 
scheme. 

16. In assessing the validity of this argument, it is 
necessary to consider the basis of the decisions that a decree 


49 

passed in a suit under s. 92 binds all parties. The basis of this 
view is that a suit under s . 92 is a representative suit and is 
brought with the necessary sanction required by it on behalf 
of all the beneficiaries interested in the Trust. The said section 
authorises two or more persons having an interest in the Trust 
to file a suit for claiming one or more of the reliefs specified 
in clauses (a) to (h) of sub-section (1) after consent in writing 
there prescribed has been obtained. Thus, when a suit is 
brought under s. 92, it is brought by two or more persons 
interested in the Trust who have taken upon themselves the 
responsi-bility of representing all the beneficiaries of the 
Trust. In such a suit, though all the beneficiaries may not be 
expressly impleaded, the action is instituted on their behalf 
and relief is claimed in a representative character. This 
position immediately attracts the provisions of explanation VI 
to s. 11 of the Code. Explanation VI provides that where 
persons litigate bona fide in respect of a public right 'or of a 
private right claimed in common for themselves and others, 
all persons interested in such right shall, for the purposes of 
this section, be deemed to claim under the persons so 
litigating. It is clear that s. 1 1 read with its explanation VI 
leads to the result that a decree passed in a suit instituted by 
persons to which explanation VI applies will bar further 
claims by persons interested in the same right in respect of 
which the prior suit had been instituted. Explanation VI thus 
illustrates one aspect of constructive res judicata. Where a 
representative suit is brought under s. 92 and a decree is 
passed in such a suit, law assumes that all persons who have 
the same interest as the plaintiffs in the representative suit 
were represented by the said plaintiffs and, therefore, are 
constructively barred by res judicata from reagitating the 
matters directly and substantially in issue in the, said earlier 
suit. 

17. A similar result follows if a suit is either brought or 
defended under O. I, r. 8. In that case, persons either suing or 
defending an action are doing so in a representative character, 
and so, the decree passed in such a suit binds all those whose 
interests were represented either by the plaintiffs or by the 
defendants. Thus, it is clear that in determining the question 
about the effect of a decree passed in a representative suit, it is 
essential to enquire which interests were represented by the 
plaintiffs or the defendants. If the decree was passed in a suit 
under s. 92, it will become necessary to examine the plaint in 


50 

order to decide in what character the plaintiffs had sued and 
what interests they had claimed. If a suit is brought under O. 1 
r. 8, the same process will have to be adopted and if a suit is 
defended under O. 1 r. 8, the plea taken by the defendants will 
have to be examined with a view to decide which interests the 
defendants purported to defend in common with others. The 
decision of this question would be material in determining the 
correctness of the argument urged by Mr. Setalvad before us. 

22. That takes us to the next question as to whether it 
would be appropriate to change the scheme in the present 
litigation even though the present suit may not be technically 
barred by res judicata. Mr. Setalvad contends that it is a well-
recognised principle of law that a scheme in regard to a public 
trust once framed should not be altered light-heartedly unless 
there are substantial reasons to do so and he has strenuously 
relied on the finding of the High Court that the Trustees 
appointed under the scheme ever since it was framed have, on 
the whole, managed the trust properties and its affairs in a 
reasonable and responsible manner and that the allegations of 
breach of trust which had been made against them in the 
present suit have been held not to be proved by both the 
courts below. There can be no doubt that if a scheme is 
framed in a suit brought under s. 92, it should not be changed 
unless there are strong and substantial reasons to do so. This 
position is well established and cannot and has not been 
disputed before us. As observed by Halsbury, when a scheme 
has been settled by the Charity Commissioners, the Court will 
not interfere with it unless the Commissioners have acted ultra 
vires, or the scheme contains something wrong in principle or 
in law, or by reason of changed circumstances, the 
continuance of the charity under the constitution established 
by the scheme has become impracticable. This principle was 
laid down as early as 1851 in the case of the Attorney-General 
v. The' Bishop of Worcester (1), where it was held that 
schemes which have been settled under the directions of the 
Court are not to be disturbed upon merely speculative view or 
in matters of discretion or regulation upon which judges or 
Attorneys-General may differ in opinion, or except upon 
substantial grounds and clear evidence, not only that the 
scheme does not operate beneficially, but that it can by 
alteration be made to do so consistently with the object of the 
foundation. The same principle was reiterated in 1872 in the 
case of Attorney-General v. Stewart (1872) L.R.14." 


51 

(vi) Bishambhar Dayal Chandra Mohan and others vs. State of Uttar 

Pradesh and others, reported in (1982) 1 SCC 39 : 

"46. The first and second contentions may conveniently 
be dealt with together. In order to appreciate these 
contentions, it is necessary to state a few facts: 

During the year 1979-80, the country was victim to a very 
serious drought which affected with Kharif as well as Rabi 
crops. The Government of India, therefore, fixed a target of 
9.5 million tonnes of wheat to be purchased in the summer 
months of 1981 for the national buffer stock. It fixed the 
procurement price at Rs. 130 per quintal as against the 
support price of Rs. 127 per quintal recommended by the 
Agricultural Price Commission to provide a better incentive to 
the farmers. The procurement was carried out as a measure of 
price support without any restriction on movement from one 
State to another. However, some of the States were 
implementing local laws with regard to ensuring that the 
private trade adhered to the stock limit restrictions on them 
and did not try to corner stocks for speculation purposes. The 
original target fixed for procurement was 9.5 million tonnes 
but at the end of June, only 6.5 million tonnes had been 
purchased, leaving a deficit of 3 million tonnes. The result 
was that the Government of India was thus forced to buy 1.5 
million tonnes of wheat in the world market. The 
Government's procurement drive was mainly frustrated by 
wholesale dealers of foodgrains cornering the stocks of wheat 
by paying a price higher than the procurement price to the 
farmers. 

47. The imperatives of the situation demanded that the 
speculative tendencies of the trade were curbed by strictly 
enforcing the stock limits of traders. Under original cl. 4 of 
the Uttar Pradesh Foodgrains (Procurement and Regulation of 
Trade) Order, 1978, a wholesale dealer, commission agent or 
a retailer could have in stock wheat not more than 750 
quintals, 750 quintals and 100 quintals respectively, at any 
time. In view of the worsening situation in the national buffer 
stock and in the light of the experience gained during the past 
few years, the State Government was of the opinion that it 
was necessary and expedient to re-fix the stock limits of such 
dealers. This was expected to maximise procurement of wheat 
to meet the requirement of public distribution, as well as, the 


52 

buffer stock. 

48. It cannot be asserted that the restriction imposed by 
the State Government on wholesale dealers of wheat is either 
arbitrary or is of an excessive nature. The fixation of the stock 
limit of wheat to be possessed by wholesale dealers, at any 
time, at 250 quintals is an important step taken by the State 
Government to obviate hoarding and black-marketing in 
wheat which is in short supply. It is hardly necessary to 
emphasise the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be 
remedied thereby. Perhaps fixation of the minimum limit of 
wheat permitted to be possessed by a wholesale dealer at 250 
quintals, at a time, is too low, but the restriction so imposed 
cannot be treated to be arbitrary or of an excessive nature, 
beyond what is required in the national interest. It is a matter 
of common knowledge that wholesale dealers of foodgrains 
mainly operate in large cities and towns and have the means 
and capacity to manipulate the market by withholding stocks 
of a commodity. There was need to check such speculative 
tendencies in the trade. It was therefore felt expedient to re-fix 
the stock limit of wheat for wholesale dealers at 250 quintals 
at a time, as in the case of a commission agent. The 
underlying idea is that the wholesale dealers should be 
allowed to continue their trading activities within reasonable 
limits. The fixation of stock limit at 250 quintals implies that 
wholesale dealers can have at any time, in stock, a wagon-
load of wheat. In Krishan Lal Praveen Kumar & Ors. etc. v. 
The State of Rajasthan, this Court has interpreted the words 
'at any time' as meaning 'at any given time'. This means that a 
wholesale dealer should not have in stock more than 250 
quintals at a time. But there is nothing to prevent a wholesale 
dealer from entering into a series of transactions during the 
course of the day. This Court in Krishan Lal Parveen Kumar's 
case (supra) and Suraj Mal Kailash Chand & Ors. v. Union of 
India & Anr., has upheld the validity of a similar notification 
dated March 23, 1981, issued by the State Government of 
Rajasthan in exercise of the powers conferred by cl. 18 of the 
Rajasthan Trade Articles (Licensing and Control) Order, 
1980, fixing the maximum limit of wheat to be possessed by a 
dealer at any one time at 200 quintals, on the ground that it is 
a reasonable restriction by the State Government within the 
meaning of Art. 19(6) of the Constitution. In view of these 
decisions, it is difficult to conceive as to how the contention 
based on Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution can survive. 


53 

49. True it is, if the governmental action is arbitrary or 
there is no rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved 
it is liable to be struck down as violative of Art. 14 of the 
Constitution. The State Government has adopted various 
measures in the interest of the general public for the control of 
production, supply and distribution of, and trade and 
commerce in, essential commodities. To obviate hoarding and 
blackmarketing in foodstuffs, it has promulgated the Order. It 
introduces a system of checks and balances to achieve the 
object of the legislation, i.e., to ensure equitable distribution 
and availability of essential commodities at fair prices. It 
cannot be said that looking to the prevailing conditions, the 
imposition of such restrictions does not satisfy the test of 
reasonableness. Nor can it be said that the fixation of such 
stock limit is arbitrary or irrational having no nexus to the 
object sought to be achieved and is, therefore, violative of 
Art. 14. On the contrary, the limitation imposed fixing a stock 
limit for a wholesale dealer at 250 quintals is a reasonable 
restriction within the meaning of Art. 19(6) of the 
Constitution. 

50. One further point requires to be noticed. The 
contention that the action taken by the State Government in 
issuing the impugned teleprinter message amounts to an 
'intrusion' on the fundamental right to carry on trade or 
business under Art. 19(1)(g) or on the freedom of trade, 
commerce and intercourse under Art. 301 of the Constitution 
appears to be wholly misconceived. As already stated the 
instructions conveyed by the State Government by the 
impugned teleprinter message imposing the requirement for 
the making of an endorsement by the Deputy Marketing 
Officer or the Senior Marketing Officer or the physical 
verification of stocks of wheat during the course of transit, are 
not a 'restriction' on the fundamental right to carry on trade or 
business guaranteed under Art. 19(1)(g) or on the freedom of 
trade, commerce and intercourse under Art. 301. These are 
nothing but regulatory measures to ensure that the excess 
stock of wheat held by a wholesale dealer, commission agent 
or a retailer is not transported to a place outside the State or 
from one district to another. Even if these requirements are 
considered to be a 'restriction' on inter-State or intra-State 
trade, that is, across the State or from one part of the State to 
another, the limitation so imposed on the enjoyment of the 
right cannot be considered to be arbitrary or of an excessive 


54 

nature and thus violative of Art. 19(1)(g) or Art. 301 of the 
Constitution. The State Government in its return has stated 
that there is no ban on the export of wheat from the State of 
Uttar Pradesh to various other States or from one district to 
another within the State, subject to the making of an 
endorsement by the Deputy Marketing Officer or the Senior 
Marketing Officer concerned. The petitioners who are 
wholesale dealers of foodgrains in the State of Uttar Pradesh 
are, therefore, free to carry on their business within the 
permissible limits, i.e., they may carry on their trade or 
business or enter into inter-State or intra-State transactions of 
wheat subject to the stock limit of 250 quintals at a time. 

(vii) Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Gurnam Kaur, reported in AIR 

1989 1 SCC 101 : 

"11. Pronouncements of law, which are not part of the 
ratio decidendi are classed as obiter dicta and are not 
authoritative. With all respect to the learned Judge who passed 
the order in Jamna Das' case and to the learned Judge who 
agreed with him, we cannot concede that this Court is bound 
to follow it. It was delivered without argument, without 
reference to the relevant provisions of the Act conferring 
express power on the Municipal Corporation to direct removal 
of encroachments from any public place like pavement or 
public streets, and without any citation of authority. 
Accordingly, we do not propose to uphold the decision of the 
High Court because, it seems to us that it is wrong in principle 
and cannot be justified by the terms of the relevant provisions. 
A decision should be treated as given per incuriam when it is 
given in ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a rule having 
the force of a statute. So far as the order shows, no argument 
was addressed to the Court on the question or not whether any 
direction could properly be made compelling the Municipal 
Corporation to construct a stall at the pitching site of a 
pavement squatter. Professor P.J. Fitzgerald, editor of the 
Salmond on Jurisprudence, 12th edn. explains the concept of 
sub silentio at p. 153 in these words: 

"A decision passes sub silentio, in the technical sense that has 
come to be attached to that phrase, when the particular point 
of law involved in the decision is not perceived by the court or 
present to its mind. The Court may consciously decide in 
favour of one party because of point A, which it considers and 


55 

pronounces upon. It may be shown, however, that logically the 
court should not have decided in favour of the particular party 
unless it also decided point B in his favour; but point B was 
not argued or considered by the court. In such circumstances, 
although point B was logically involved in the facts and 
although the case had a specific outcome, the decision is not 
an authority on point B. Point B is said to pass sub silentio." 

(viii) R.Venugopala Naidu and others vs. Venkatarayulu Naidu Charities 
and others, reported in AIR 1990 SC 444 : 
"7. Mr. S. Padmanabhan, learned counsel for the 
appellants has vehemently argued that though the appellants 
were not shown as parties in suit-title but the suit under 
Section 92 of Civil Procedure Code being a representative suit 
the scheme-decree binds not only the parties thereto but all 
those who are interested in the trust. According to him 
"parties" in clause 14 of the scheme decree would include 
appellants and all those who are interested in the trust. He has 
relied on Raje Anandrao v. Shamrao and Others, [1961] 3 
SCR 930 wherein this Court held as under: 

" ..... It is true that the pujaris were not parties to the 
suit under s. 92 but the deci-sion in that suit binds the pujaris 
as wor-shipers so far as the administration of the temple is 
concerned, even though they were not parties to it, for a suit 
under s. 92 is a representative suit and binds not only the 
parties thereto but all those who are inter-ested in the trust." 

8. The learned counsel further relied on Ahmed Adam 
Sait and Others v. Inayathullah Mekhri and Others, [1964] 2 
SCR 647 wherein this Court observed as under: 

"A suit under s. 92, it is urged, is a repre-sentative suit, 
and so, whether or not the present respondents actually 
appeared in that suit, they would be bound by the decree, 
which had framed a scheme for the proper administra-tion of 
the Trust. In support of this argu-ment, reliance is placed on 
the decision of this Court in Raja Anandrao v. Shamrao, 
where it is observed that though the Pujaris were not parties to 
the suit under s. 92, the decision in that suit binds the pujaris 
as worshipers so far as the administration of the temple is 
concerned, because a suit under s. 92 is a representative suit 
and binds not only the parties thereto, but all those who are 
interested in the Trust....... " 


56 

" ..... In assessing the validity of this argument, it is necessary 
to consider the basis of the decisions that a decree passed in a 
suit under s. 92 binds all parties. The basis of this view is that 
a suit under s. 92 is a representative suit and is brought with 
the necessary sanction required by it on behalf of all the 
beneficiaries interested in the Trust. The said section 
authorises two or more persons having an interest in the Trust 
to file a suit for claiming one or more of the reliefs specified 
in clauses (a) to (h) of sub-section (1) after consent in writing 
there prescribed has been obtained. Thus, when a suit is 
brought under s. 92, it is brought by two or more persons 
interested in the Trust who have taken upon themselves the 
responsi-bility of representing all the beneficiaries of the 
Trust. In such a suit, though all the beneficiaries may not be 
expressly impleaded, the action is instituted on their behalf 
and relief is claimed in a representative character. This 
position immediately attracts the provisions of explanation VI 
to s. 11 of the Code. Explanation VI provides that where 
persons litigate bona fide in respect of a public right or of a 
private right claimed in common for themselves and others, 
all persons interested in such right shall, for the pur-poses of 
this section, be deemed to claim under the persons so 
litigating. It is clear that s. 11 read with its explanation VI 
leads to the result that a decree passed in a suit instituted by 
persons to which explanation VI applies will bar further 
claims by persons interested in the same right in respect of 
which the prior suit had been instituted. Explanation VI thus 
illustrates one aspect of constructive res judicata. Where a 
representa-tive suit is brought under s. 92 and a decree is 
passed in such a suit, law assumes that all persons who have 
the same interest as the plaintiffs in the representative suit 
were represented by the said plaintiffs and, there-fore, are 
constructively barred by res judica-ta from reagitating the 
matters directly and substantially in issue in the said earlier 
suit. 

A similar result follows if a suit is either brought or defended 
under 0.1., r. 8. In that case per-sons either suing or 
defending an action are doing so in a representative character, 
and so the decree passed in such a suit binds all those whose 
interests were represented either by the plaintiffs or by the 
defendants ....... " 

The legal position which emerges is that a suit under 


57 

Section 92 of the Code is a suit of a special nature for the 
protection of Public rights in the Public Trusts and chari-ties. 
The suit is fundamentally on behalf of the entire body of 
persons who are interested in the trust. It is for the vindication 
of public rights. The beneficiaries of the trust, which may 
consist of public at large, may choose two or more persons 
amongst themselves for the purpose of filing a suit under 
Section 92 of the Code and the suit-title in that event would 
show only their names as plaintiffs. Can we say that the 
persons whose names are on the suit-title are the only parties 
to the suit? The answer would be in the negative. The named 
plaintiffs being the representatives of the public at large 
which is interested in the trust all such interested persons 
would be considered in the eyes of law to be parties to the 
suit. A suit under Section 92 of the Code is thus a 
representative suit and as such binds only the parties named in 
the suit-title but all those who are interested in the trust. It is 
for that reason that explanation VI to Section II of the Code 
constructively bar by res judicata the entire body of interested 
persons from reagitating the matters directly and substantially 
in issue in an earlier suit under Section 92 of the Code." 

(ix) Krishena Kumar and others vs. Union of India and others, reported 

in 1990 4 SCC 207 : 

"59.The next question debated is that of financial 
implica-tions. It is submitted that given the fact that the 
budget for the year 1990-91 for disbursement of pension is 
Rs.900 crores (as per page 11 of the Budget of the Railway 
Revenue and Expenditure of the Central Government for 
1990-91), the additional liability which would arise by giving 
relief to the Petitioners would be insignificant in comparison. 
Ac-cording to the petitioners as per their affidavit dated 
15.9.88, the additional liability would come to Rs. 18 crores 
per annum and this figure would steadily decrease as the 
number of P.F. retirees diminishes every year due to the fact 
that this question arises only with respect to very old retirees, 
and a substantial number of them pass away every year. 

60. The Government in its affidavit dated 21.9.88 has 
stated that the additional liability as far as the Railway 
employ-ees are concerned, would be Rs.50 crores a year. 
This is based on the assumption that there are 79,000 


58 

surviving P.F. retirees. Apart from the fact that this number 
of 79,000 was based on calculations made in 1988, and 
would be greatly reduced by this time, the petitioners submit 
that the actual number of survivors would only be about 
38,000. Thus, the actual burden would be less than half. 
Further, even assuming that the figure of 79,000 put forth by 
the Government is correct, the aver-age annual expenditure 
per retiree for pension calculated by the Government is 
incorrect as the calculation includes the non-recurring arrear 
payments for the year 1987-88. Taking the correct figures of 
total pension outlay and total number of beneficiaries the per 
capita pension expenditure per annum works out to Rs.4521. 
Multiplying this by 79,000 (assuming the figures of the 
Railways to be correct) the annual expenditure comes to 
Rs.35.71 crores. This compared to the current budget of 
pensions of Rs.900 crores, is quite insignificant and can be 
easily awarded by this Court as was done in Nakara, it is 
urged. 

61. It is submitted in the alternative that if this Court 
feels that a positive direction cannot be made to the Gov-
ernment in this regard, it is prayed that at least an option 
should no given to the respondents either to withdraw the 
benefit of switching over to pension from every one or to 
give it to the petitioners as well, so that the discrimina-tion 
must go. 

62. We are not inclined to accept either of these 
submissions. The P.F. retirees and pension retirees having not 
belonged to a class, there is no discrimination. In the matter 
of expenditure includable in the Annual Financial Statement, 
this Court has to be loath to pass any order to give any 
direction, because of the division of functions between the 
three co-equal organs of the Government under the 
Constitution. 

63. Lastly, the question of feasibility of converting all 
living P.F. retirees to Pension retirees was debated from the 
point of view of records and adjustments. Because of the 
view we have taken in the matter, we do not consider it 
necessary to express any opinion. 

64. Mr. C.V. Francis in W.P. No. 1165 of 1989 argued 
the case more or less adopting the arguments of Mr. Shanti 
Bhushan. Mrs. Swaran Mahajan, in W.P. No. 1575 of 1986, 
submitted that the rule as to commuted portion of the pen-
sion reviving after 15 years should be applied to P.F. retirees 


59 

so that the corpus of Provident Fund dues received more than 
15 years ago should be treated as committed por-tion of 
pension and be allowed to revive for adjustments against 
pension. In the view we have taken in this case it is not 
necessary to express any opinion on this question." 

(x) State of U.P. and another vs. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and 

another, reported in 1991 4 SCC 139 : 

"5. Does this principle extend and apply to a 
conclusion of law, Which was neither raised nor preceded by 
any consideration. In other words can such conclusions be 
considered as declaration of law? Here again the English 
Courts and jurists have carved out an exception to the rule of 
precedents. It has been explained as rule of sub-silentio. A 
decision passed sub-silentio, in the technical sense that has 
come to be attached to that phrase, when the particular' point 
of law involved in the decision is not perceived by the Court 
or present to its mind' (Salmond 12th Edition). In Lancaster 
Motor Company (London) Ltd. v. Bremith Ltd., [1941] IKB 
675 the Court did not feel bound by earlier decision as it was 
rendered 'wit-hout any argument, without reference to the 
crucial words of the rule and without any citation of the 
authority'. It was approved by this Court inMunicipal 
Corporation of Delhi v. Gumam Kaur, [1989] 1 SCC 101. The 
Bench held that, 'prece-dents sub-silentio and without 
argument are of no moment'. The Courts thus have taken 
recourse to this principle for relieving from injustice 
perperated by unjust precedents. A decision which is not 
express and is not founded on reasons nor it proceeds on 
consideration of issue cannot be deemed to be a law declared 
to have a binding effect as is contem-plated by Article 141. 
Uniformity and consistency are core of judicial discipline. 
But that which escapes in the judg-ment without any 
occasion is not ratio decedendi.In Shama Rao v. State of 
Pondicherry, AIR 1967 SC 1680 it was ob-served, 'it is trite 
to say that a decision is binding not because of its conclusions 
but in regard to its ratio and the principles, laid down therein'. 
Any declaration or conclusion arrived without application of 
mind or preceded without any reason cannot be deemed to be 
declaration of law or authority of a general nature binding as 
a precedent. Restraint in dissenting or overruling is for sake 
of stability and uniformity but rigidity beyond reasonable 
limits is inimical to the growth of law."

(xi) Inder Parshad vs. Union of India, reported in (1994) 5 SCC 239 : 

"5. In this case admittedly the Government being the 
owner of the land, the appellant held the demised land as 
lessee with superstructure built thereon and was in 
possession and enjoyment of the same on the date of 
acquisition. The contents of the award extracted hereinbefore 
clearly indicate that the Land Acquisition Collector could not 
determine compensation payable towards the leasehold 
interest held by the appellant. Being an owner the 
Government is not enjoined to acquire its own interest in the 
land or land alone for public purpose. When its land is 
granted on lease in favour of a lessee its power to resume the 
land is subject to non-fulfilment of the terms and conditions 
of the lease by the lessee. So long as the lessee acts and 
complies with the covenants contained in the lease or the 
grant, the right to resumption in terms of the lease or grant 
would not arise. But when the land is required for public 
purpose, the Government should get absolute title thereof 
free from all encumbrances. Compensation becomes payable 
for the leasehold right or interest held by the lessee or grantee 
when the land is acquired. The point becomes clear from the 
following illustrations. Take a case where the Government 
granted lease of agricultural land on the annual payment of 
rent with a covenant that the Government is entitled to 
resume the land when needed for public purpose or as when 
the Government finds that the land is required for public 
purpose. In terms of the covenants, the Government is 
entitled to exercise its option to determine the lease though 
the lessee has been complying with the condition of payment 
of annual premium or rent and resume the land in accordance 
with terms of the grant. In that event the need to take 
recourse to acquisition and to make compensation does not 
arise. Take a case where the Government granted the lease of 
the open land with, permission to the lessee to construct a 
building for his quiet enjoyment with appropriate covenants 
and the lessee with permission constructed the building and 
by complying with the covenants of the lease was in quiet 
enjoyment. The self same property, when required for public 
purpose, the Government cannot unilaterally determine the 
lease and call upon the lessee to deliver the possession. 
Therefore, the Government is required to exercise the power 
of eminent domain by invoking the provisions under the 


61 

Land Acquisition Act for getting such land. The Collector 
shall have to determine the compensation towards the 
leasehold interest held by the lessee, if assessable separately 
and determine the compensation. The lessee being the owner 
of the superstructure and the Government being the owner of 
the land, if compensation is determined for both the 
components, then the same has to be apportioned between 
them. At what proportion the lessor and the lessee are 
entitled to receive the compensation has to be determined. In 
the absence of any covenant in the lease for payment and in 
the absence of any specific data available to him, the 
Collector has to determine the respective shares at which the 
compensation is to be apportioned between the Government 
and the lessee, the course open to the Land Acquisition 
Collector is to determine the total compensation, make an 
award and make a reference to the civil court under Section 
30 for decision on appointment. Exactly that is the situation 
on the facts of this case. Take another illustration. The 
Government grants a patta of its land subject to payment of 
land revenue. Later, the land is required for public purpose. 
The payment of land revenue is at par with the payment of 
land revenue payable by a private owner to the State. By 
grant of patta, the title has been vested in the grantee. 
Therefore, the grantee is entitled to the full compensation of 
the acquired land." 

(xi) Arnit Das vs. State of Bihar, reported in 2000 5 SCC 488 : 

"22. All this exercise would have been avoided if only 
the Legislature would have taken care not to leave an 
ambiguity in the definition of juvenile and would have 
clearly specified the point of time by reference to which the 
age was to be determined to find a person a juvenile. The 
ambiguity can be resolved by taking into consideration the 
Preamble and the Statement of Objects and Reasons. The 
Preamble suggests what the Act was intended to deal with. If 
the language used by Parliament is ambiguous the Court is 
permitted to look into the preamble for construing the 
provisions of an Act (M/s. Burrakur Coal Co. Ltd. & M/s. 
East Indian Coal Co. Ltd. Vs. The Union of India and others, 
AIR 1961 SC 954). A preamble of a statute has been said to 
be a good means of finding out its meaning and, as it were, 
the key of understanding of it, said this Court in A. Thangal 
Kunju Musaliar Vs. M. Venkatachalam Potti AIR 1958 SC 


62 

246. The Preamble is a key to un-lock the legislative intent. 
If the words employed in an enactment may spell a doubt as 
to their meaning it would be useful to so interpret the 
enactment as to harmonise it with the object which the 
Legislature had in its view. The Legislative aims and 
objectives set out in the earlier part of this judgment go to 
show that this Legislation has been made for taking care of 
the care and custody of a juvenile during investigation, 
inquiry and trial, i.e., from a point of time when the juvenile 
is available to the law administration and justice delivery 
system; it does not make any provision for a person involved 
in an offence by reference to the date of its commission by 
him. The long title of the Act too suggests that the content of 
the Act is the justice aspect relating to juveniles. 

23. We make it clear that we have not dealt with the 
provisions of Chapter VI dealing with special offences in 
respect of juveniles. Prima facie, we feel that the view which 
we have taken would create no difficulty even in assigning 
meaning to the term juvenile as occurring in Chapter 
VI(Sections 41 to 45) of the Act because a juvenile covered 
by any of these provisions is likely to fall within the 
definition of neglected juvenile as defined in clause (l) of 
Section 2 who shall also have to be dealt with by a Juvenile 
Board under Chapter III of the Act and the view taken by us 
would hold the field there as well. However, we express no 
opinion on the scope of Chapter VI of the Act and leave that 
aspect to be taken care of in a suitable case. At any rate in the 
present context we need not vex our mind on that aspect. 
Section 2 which defines juvenile and neglected juvenile itself 
begins by saying that the words defined therein would have 
the assigned meaning unless the context otherwise requires. 
So far as the present context is concerned we are clear in our 
mind that the crucial date for determining the question 
whether a person is juvenile is the date when he is brought 
before the competent authority. 

24. So far as the finding regarding the age of the 
appellant is concerned it is based on appreciation of evidence 
and arrived at after taking into consideration of the material 
available on record and valid reasons having been assigned 
for it. The finding arrived at by the learned A.C.J.M. has 
been maintained by the Sessions Court in appeal and the 
High Court in revision. We find no case having been made 


63 

out for interfering therewith." 

(xii) Shanmugavel Nadar vs. State of Tamilnadu and another, reported in 

2002 8 SCC 361 : 

"16. In the present case, the order dated 10.9.1986 
passed by this Court can be said to be declaration of law 
limited only to two points -(i) that in a petition putting in 
issue the constitutional validity of any State Legislation the 
State is a necessary party and in its absence the issue cannot 
be gone into, and (ii) that a belated prayer for impleading a 
necessary party may be declined by this Court exercising its 
jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution if the 
granting of the prayer is considered by the Court neither 
necessary nor proper to allow at the given distance of time. 
By no stretch of imagination can it be said that the reasoning 
or view of the law contained in the decision of the Division 
of the High Court in M. Varadaraja Pillai 's case had stood 
merged in the order of this court dated 10.9.1986 in such 
sense as to amount to declaration of law under Article 141 by 
this Court or that the order of this Court had affirmed the 
statement of law contained in the decision of High Court. 

17. We are clearly of the opinion that in spite of the 
dismissal of the appeals on 10.9.1986 by this Court on the 
ground of non-joinder of necessary party, though the 
operative part of the order of the Division Bench stood 
merged in the decision of this Court, the remaining part of 
the order of Division Bench of the High Court cannot be said 
to have merged in the order of this Court dated 10.9.1986 nor 
did the order of this Court make any declaration of law 
within the meaning of Article 141 of the Constitution either 
expressly or by necessary implication. The statement of law 
as contained in the Division Bench decision of the High 
Court in M. Varadaraja Pillai's case would therefore continue 
to remain the decision of the High Court, binding as a 
precedent on subsequent benches of coordinate or lesser 
strength but open to reconsideration by any bench of the 
same High Court with a coram of judges more than two. 

18. The Full Bench was not dealing with a prayer for 


64 

review of the earlier decision of the Division Bench in M. 
Varadaraja Pillai's case and for setting it aside. Had it been 
so, a different question would have arisen, namely, whether 
another Division Bench or a Full Bench had jurisdiction or 
competence to review an earlier Division Bench decision of 
that particular Court and whether it could be treated as 
affirmed, for whatsoever reasons, by the Supreme Court on a 
plea that in view of the decision having been dealt with by 
the Supreme Court the decision of the High Court was no 
longer available to be reviewed. We need not here go into the 
question, whether it was a case of review, or whether the 
review application should have been filed in the High Court 
or Supreme Court. Such a question is not arising before us. 

19. Under Article 141 of the Constitution, it is the law 
declared by the Supreme Court, which is binding on all 
Courts within the territory of India. Inasmuch as no law was 
declared by this Court, the Full Bench was not precluded 
from going into the question of law arising for decision 
before it and in that context entering into and examining the 
correctness or otherwise of the law stated by the Division 
Bench in M. Varadaraja Pillai's case and either affirming or 
overruling the view of law taken therein leaving the operative 
part untouched so as to remain binding on parties thereto. 

20. Inasmuch as in the impugned judgment, the Full 
Bench has not adjudicated upon the issues for decision before 
it, we do not deem it proper to enter into the merits of the 
controversy for the first time in exercise of the jurisdiction of 
this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. We must 
have the benefit of the opinion of the Full Bench of the High 
Court as to the vires of the State legislation involved. 

21. For the foregoing reason, the appeals are allowed. 
The impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside. All 
the appeals shall stand restored before the Full Bench of the 
High Court and shall be heard and decided in accordance 
with law. The Full Bench while doing so, shall not feel 
inhibited by the fact that the appeals against the decision in 
M. Varadaraja Pillai's case were dismissed by this Court 
which, as we have already stated, were dismissed only on the 
technical ground without any law being laid down by this 
Court. We also clarify that in view of the time that has 
already been lost, the Full Bench may proceed to hear and 
decide all the controversies arising for decision in the writ 


65 

petitions in the High Court, that is, the Full Bench may 
obviate the need of sending the matter bade to the Division 
Bench for hearing on such other issues as are not decided by 
it Instead it may decide all the issues raised in the writ 
petitions fully and finally so far as the High Court is 
concerned. The hearing before the Full Bench shall be 
expedited as there are a number of writ petitions and a large 
number of cases are likely to be affected by the view that the 
Full Bench may ultimately take. In view of the writ petitions 
having been restored for hearing on the file of the High 
Court, we also clarify that all the interim orders, which were 
passed by the High Court shall also stand restored. Needless 
to say the High Court shall have the liberty of reconsidering 
the interim orders passed by it if any such occasion arises." 

(xiii) Zee Telefilms Ltd., and another vs. Union of India and others, 

reported in 2005 4 SCC 649 : 

"282. Are we bound hands and feet by Pradeep Kumar 
Biswas (supra)? The answer to the question must be found in 
the law of precedent. A decision, it is trite, should not be 
read as a statute. A decision is an authority for the questions 
of law determined by it. Such a question is determined 
having regard to the fact situation obtaining therein. While 
applying the ratio, the court may not pick out a word or a 
sentence from the judgment divorced from the context in 
which the said question arose for consideration. A judgment, 
as is well-known, must be read in its entirety and the 
observations made therein should receive consideration in 
the light of the questions raised before it." 

(xiv) Tika Ram vs. State of U.P. and others, reported in 2009 10 SCC 

689: 

"59. It was reiterated by Shri Trivedi, Learned Senior 
Counsel, as also, Shri Qamar Ahmed, Learned Counsel that 
the question of constitutional validity of the Act was not 
considered by the High Court as the Act was held to be valid 
in GDA's case (cited supra) and in MDA's case (cited supra). 
It was, however, urged that the question of Constitutional 
validity was never considered in these cases. Reliance was 
placed on judgments reported as Arnit Das v. State of Bihar 


66 

reported in 2000 (5) SCC 488, State of UP & Anr. v. 
Synthetics & Chemicals Ltd. & Anr. reported in 1991 (4) 
SCC 139, Nirmal Jeet Kaur v. State of Madhya Pradesh & 
Anr. reported in 2004 (7) SCC 558, ICICI Bank & Anr. v. 
Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay & Ors. reported 
in 2005 (6) SCC 404, 7 A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Naik & Ors. 
reported in 1988 (2) SCC 602, Zee Telefilms Ltd. & Anr. v. 
Union of India & Ors. reported in 2005 (4) SCC 649, P. 
Ramachandra Rao v. State of Karnataka reported in 2002 (4) 
SCC 578, Nand Kishore v. State of Punjab reported in 1995 
(6) SCC 614, Isabella Johnson v. M.A. Susai reported in 
1991 (1) SCC 494. We do not think that the law laid down in 
these cases would apply to the present situation. In all these 
cases, it has been basically held that a Supreme Court 
decision does not become a precedent unless a question is 
directly raised and considered therein, so also it does not 
become a law declared unless the question is actually 
decided upon. We need not take stock of all these cases and 
we indeed have no quarrel with the propositions settled 
therein. However, we may point out that, firstly, the question 
of validity is settled in MDA's case (cited supra). This is 
apart from the fact that we are of the opinion that there is 
nothing wrong with the Amending Act insofar as its 
Constitutional validity is concerned. We have already 
rejected the argument that there was any discrimination 
between Ujariyaon Part II and Ujariyaon Part III schemes. 
We are convinced with the explanation given by the State 
Government as to why Ujariyaon Part III scheme was left out 
of the consideration of validation. Indeed the acquisition 
therein could not have been validated on account of the time 
having lapsed for doing so. Once Sections 2 and 3 and the 
proviso are read in the manner indicated in MDA's case 
(cited supra) as also in the light of observations made by us, 
no question remains of any Constitutional invalidity. We are 
not at all impressed by the contention raised that the 
Amending Act cannot pass the test of Article 14. We hold 
accordingly." 

(xv) Rajendra Gupta and others vs. The Corporation of Chenai, reported 

in Manu/TN/3722/2011 : 

"117. Even though, Appellants came into possession 
by virtue of deed of sublease infavour of their father 
N.D.Gupta, as discussed earlier, the main lease expired on 
30.4.1985, the sublease also came to an end and the 


67 

possession of Appellants is not lawful beyond 30.4.1985. As 
pointed out by the learned Judge under clause 6 of registered 
sub-lease dated 17.7.1968, Plaintiffs were obliged to 
surrender the superstructures to the Trust without claiming 
any compensation after the expiry of the initial period of 18 
years from 01.4.1968 to 31.3.1986 or atleast the period of 
extended term of 22 years viz., 31.3.2008. Viewed from any 
angle, possession of Appellants are not lawful one beyond 
30.4.1985. 

118. Considering all the aspects and observing that 
document dated 12.10.1973 is vitiated, learned Judge held 
that Appellants are not entitled to any compensation for the 
superstructures. When sublease dated 12.10.1973 is vitiated, 
and when the term of lease itself come to an end on 
30.4.1985, Appellants cannot claim any right beyond that 
and therefore, in our considered view, Appellants are not 
entitled to claim any compensation. 

119. Whether Plaintiffs are entitled to equitable relief 
of interim injunction:-

Learned Senior Counsel for Appellants contended that 
in an application for grant of temporary injunction, Court is 
concerned only with prima facie case and balance of 
convenience and while so, learned Judge has gone beyond 
the scope of the application and dealt with the matter as if 
Court is dealing with the main suit itself. Learned Senior 
Counsel would further contend that learned single Judge 
erred in dealing with all issues arising in the suit which need 
to be adjudicated only after trial. Learned Senior Counsel for 
Appellants would also contend that Appellants have put up 
multi-storied buildings and the Civil Engineers appointed by 
the Plaintiffs have arrived at the value of the buildings at 
Rs.5.73 crores and Rs.3.96 crores and Rs.6.08 crores 
respectively and if interim injunction is not granted, 
Appellants would be subjected to irreparable loss. 

120. The well settled principles for granting a 
temporary injunction, either under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 
C.P.C. or under Section 151 of C.P.C. in favour of a party, 
are:-(i) prima facie case, (ii) balance of convenience and (iii) 
irreparable loss. Apart from prima facie case, the party 
seeking injunction has to establish balance of convenience 
and irreparable injury also. A person who seeks aid of the 
Court must establish prima facie case in his favour though it 
is not necessary for him to show at that stage a clear legal 


68 

title; but must satisfy the Court that there is a fair question to 
be tried. 

121. Prima facie case means that there is a serious 
question to be tried and that the claim of the Plaintiffs is not 
frivolous or vexatious. It may not be necessary for the 
Plaintiff to make out a clear, legal title, but he has to satisfy 
the Court that he has fair question to be tried. A temporary 
injunction would justify only if it was based on good prima 
facie case made out by the Plaintiff showing that in all 
probability he is entitled to get permanent injunction sought 
before going through the evidence depending on the 
pleadings and documents placed before the Court. 

122. As discussed earlier, term of lease of the Trust 
expired on 30.04.1985. Even though, Trust had obtained 
decree in O.S.No.1349 of 1985, lease deed never came to be 
executed. In the mean while, Trust arrived at a compromise 
under which Trust had surrendered possession of Victoria 
Public Hall building and the demised land to the owner 
Corporation. Therefore, possession of Appellants beyond 
30.4.1985 is not lawful possession. Assuming the best 
possible for the Appellants as per the lease deed dated 
17.07.1968 for 18 years i.e. till 31.03.1986 and thereafter 
renewable for 22 years i.e. 31.03.2008. Even assuming the 
best possible for the Appellants, possession of the Appellants 
cannot be said to be lawful possession beyond 30.04.1985 
entitling them to obtain interim injunction from the Court as 
against the true owner Chennai Corporation. The object of 
interlocutory Application is to protect the Plaintiff against 
the injury by violation of his right for which he could not 
adequately be compensated for damages. Beyond 30.4.1985 
when the possession of the Appellants is not lawful 
possession, Appellants cannot be said to have established 
prima facie case to obtain an injunction against the lawful 
owner. A person in wrongful possession will not be entitled 
to protection by an injunction against the lawful owner. By 
the grant of interim injunction, 1st Defendant-Corporation 
would not be in a position to take possession and maintain 
the VP Hall and the surrounding land. 

123. Subsequent development is also relevant to be 
noted. Enormous amount of traffic congestion in and around 
the Chennai City has led both Central as well as State 
Government to contemplate viable solution to reduce the 
congestion in the traffic and to help the general public which 


69 

paved the way for Chennai Metro Rail. Chennai Metro Rail 
Limited (CMRL) aims to provide major railway inter-linking 
to the suburban railway station as MRTS. First phase of 
Chennai Metro Rail Project is being implemented by CMRL 
at an estimated cost of Rs.14,600 crores. In G.O.Ms.No.148, 
Planning, Development and Special Initiatives (SI) 
Department, dated 20.11.2009, Government constituted a 
High Power Committee (HPC) and discussed the proposal of 
Chennai Metro Rail for transfer of lands of State 
Government departments/Boards/Corporation of Chennai 
both on permanent and temporary basis. CMRL proposed to 
locate Central Metro Station [Corridor I & II] and other 
allied facilities in the land belonging to the Chennai 
Corporation which was leased out to V.P. Hall Trust and or 
Government lands. 

124. Most of the land proposed for Chennai Metro 
Rail Project is Government land. Government lands cater to 
75% of the project land requirement and only 25% of the 
project land requirement is proposed on private patta lands. 
Land in Block No.28 in T.S.No.1269/4 in Vepery village, 
Fort Tondiarpet Taluk belonging to the Chennai Corporation 
to an extent of 2187 sq. mts was directed to be transferred 
and alienated to CMRL in a meeting held by the HPC on 
22.07.2010 and a Government Order to that effect was 
passed by the Government in G.O.Ms.No.132, Planning 
Development & Special Initiatives (SI) Department dated 
27.08.2010 and under the said order, the Secretary to 
Government, Municipal Administration & Water Supply 
Department is directed to issue necessary order of alienation 
of the aforesaid land to CMRL. At the time of finalising the 
alignment of Corridors and design of the Metro Station, an 
additional requirement of 955 sq. mts in the Corporation land 
occupied by Picnic Hotel has been arrived at for locating 
station related structures above ground. The above said land 
shall be utilised for Central Metro Station, ventilation shaft, 
ancillary building, traffic integration etc. The said 
requirement was approved in the III High Power Committee 
held on 04.01.2011. Chennai Central underground Metro 
Station will be vital and key interchange between Metro Rail 
Corridor I & II where the transfer of passengers will take 
place between Corridor I & II at Chennai Central Metro 
Station which is stated to be the complex underground 
station with two levels (one for each corridor). This is to 
ensure inter modal integration for the public which will 


70 

substantially reduce the traffic congestion in the City. The 
subsequent events and the predominant public purpose is an 
important factor to be taken into consideration. If any 
injunction is granted infavour of Appellants that would also 
stall the Chennai Metro Rail Project which is aimed at 
developing the infrastructure of the City of Chennai. 

125. Upon consideration of all materials in issue, the 
learned Judge rightly dismissed the applications declining 
temporary injunction. Exercise of discretion by the trial 
Court should not be lightly interfered with by the Appellate 
Court. Only if the trial Court erroneously exercised its 
discretion and has acted perversely without taking into 
consideration the entire material on record, it is the duty of 
the Appellate Court to interfere with the order of the trial 
Court. In the instant case, Appellants are in occupation of the 
large extent of prime property on a meagre rent of Rs.4000/-
per month. Upon consideration of the facts and materials, the 
learned Judge has rightly held that Appellants are not 
entitled to get injunction and there is no improper exercise of 
discretion warranting interference." 

(xvi) Purbanchal Cables and Conductors Pvt. Ltd. vs. Assam State 

Electricity Board and another, reported in 2012 7 SCC 462 : 

"47) The learned Senior Counsel would rely on the 
decision of this Court in Municipal Corporation, Delhi Vs. 
Gurnam Kaur -(1989) 1 SCC 101. This Court has held: 

"11. Pronouncements of law, which are not part of the 
ratio decidendi are classed as obiter dicta and are not 
authoritative. With all respect to the learned Judge who passed 
the order in Jamna Das case and to the learned Judge who 
agreed with him, we cannot concede that this Court is bound to 
follow it. It was delivered without argument, without reference 
to the relevant provisions of the Act conferring express power 
on the Municipal Corporation to direct removal of 
encroachments from any public place like pavements or public 
streets, and without any citation of authority. Accordingly, we 
do not propose to uphold the decision of the High Court 
because, it seems to us that it is wrong in principle and cannot 
be justified by the terms of the relevant provisions. A decision 
should be treated as given per incuriam when it is given in 
ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a rule having the force 


71 

of a statute. So far as the order shows, no argument was 
addressed to the court on the question whether or not any 
direction could properly be made compelling the Municipal 
Corporation to construct a stall at the pitching site of a 
pavement squatter. Professor P.J. Fitzgerald, editor of the 
Salmond on Jurisprudence, 12th Edn. explains the concept of 
sub silentio at p. 153 in these words: 

"A decision passes sub silentio, in the technical sense 
that has come to be attached to that phrase, when the particular 
point of law involved in the decision is not perceived by the 
court or present to its mind. The court may consciously decide 
in favour of one party because of point A, which it considers 
and pronounces upon. It may be shown, however, that logically 
the court should not have decided in favour of the particular 
party unless it also decided point B in his favour; but point B 
was not argued or considered by the court. In such 
circumstances, although point B was logically involved in the 
facts and although the case had a specific outcome, the 
decision is not an authority on point B. Point B is said to pass 
sub silentio" 

12. In Gerard v. Worth of Paris Ltd. (k)., the only point 
argued was on the question of priority of the claimant's debt, 
and, on this argument being heard, the court granted the order. 
No consideration was given to the question whether a 
garnishee order could properly be made on an account standing 
in the name of the liquidator. When, therefore, this very point 
was argued in a subsequent case before the Court of Appeal in 
Lancaster Motor Co. (London) Ltd. v. Bremith Ltd., the court 
held itself not bound by its previous decision. Sir Wilfrid 
Greene, M.R., said that he could not help thinking that the 
point now raised had been deliberately passed sub silentio by 
counsel in order that the point of substance might be decided. 
He went on to say that the point had to be decided by the 
earlier court before it could make the order which it did; 
nevertheless, since it was decided "without argument, without 
reference to the crucial words of the rule, and without any 
citation of authority", it was not binding and would not be 
followed. Precedents sub silentio and without argument are of 
no moment. This rule has ever since been followed. One of the 
chief reasons for the doctrine of precedent is that a matter that 
has once been fully argued and decided should not be allowed 
to be reopened. The weight accorded to dicta varies with the 


72 

type of dictum. Mere casual expressions carry no weight at all. 
Not every passing expression of a judge, however eminent, can 
be treated as an ex cathedra statement, having the weight of 
authority" 

48) In the case of State of U.P. Vs. Synthetics and 
Chemicals Ltd. -(1991) 4 SCC 139, His Lordship R.M. Sahai. 
J., in his concurring judgment set out the principles of per 
incurium and sub silentio has held thus: 

"40. Incuria'' literally means "carelessness". In practice 
per incuriam appears to mean per ignoratium. English courts 
have developed this principle in relaxation of the rule of stare 
decisis. The "quotable in law" is avoided and ignored if it is 
rendered, "in ignoratium of a statute or other binding authority" 
(Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd.). Same has been 
accepted, approved and adopted by this Court while 
interpreting Article 141 of the Constitution which embodies the 
doctrine of precedents as a matter of law. In Jaisri Sahu v. 
Rajdewan Dubeythis Court while pointing out the procedure to 
be followed when conflicting decisions are placed before a 
bench extracted a passage from Halsbury's Laws of England 
incorporating one of the exceptions when the decision of an 
appellate court is not binding." 

41. Does this principle extend and apply to a conclusion 
of law, which was neither raised nor preceded by any 
consideration. In other words can such conclusions be 
considered as declaration of law? Here again the English courts 
and jurists have carved out an exception to the rule of 
precedents. It has been explained as rule of sub-silentio. â€oeA 
decision passes sub-silentio, in the technical sense that has 
come to be attached to that phrase, when the particular point of 
law involved in the decision is not perceived by the court or 
present to its mind. (Salmond on Jurisprudence 12th Edn., p. 
153). In Lancaster Motor Company (London) Ltd. v. Bremith 
Ltd. the Court did not feel bound by earlier decision as it was 
rendered without any argument, without reference to the crucial 
words of the rule and without any citation of the authority. It 
was approved by this Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi 
v. Gurnam Kaur. The bench held that, precedents sub-silentio 
and without argument are of no moment. The courts thus have 
taken recourse to this principle for relieving from injustice 
perpetrated by unjust precedents. A decision which is not 
express and is not founded on reasons nor it proceeds on 


73 

consideration of issue cannot be deemed to be a law declared to 
have a binding effect as is contemplated by Article 141. 
Uniformity and consistency are core of judicial discipline. But 
that which escapes in the judgment without any occasion is not 
ratio decidendi. In B. Shama Rao v. Union Territory of 
Pondicherry it was observed, â€˜it is trite to say that a decision 
is binding not because of its conclusions but in regard to its 
ratio and the principles, laid down therein. Any declaration or 
conclusion arrived without application of mind or preceded 
without any reason cannot be deemed to be declaration of law 
or authority of a general nature binding as a precedent. 
Restraint in dissenting or overruling is for sake of stability and 
uniformity but rigidity beyond reasonable limits is inimical to 
the growth of law." 

49) In the case of Arnit Das Vs. State of Bihar -(2000) 5 
SCC 488, this Court held: 

"A decision not expressed, not accompanied by reasons and not 
proceeding on a conscious consideration of an issue cannot be 
deemed to be a law declared to have a binding effect as is 
contemplated by Article 141. That which has escaped in the 
judgment is not the ratio decidendi. This is the rule of sub 
silentio, in the technical sense when a particular point of law 
was not consciously determined. (See State of U.P. v. 
Synthetics & Chemicals Ltd. SCC, para 41.)" 

50) In the case of Tika Ram Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh -
(2009) 10 SCC 689, it was held: 

"104. We do not think that the law laid down in these 
cases would apply to the present situation. In all these cases, it 
has been basically held that a Supreme Court decision does not 
become a precedent unless a question is directly raised and 
considered therein, so also it does not become a law declared 
unless the question is actually decided upon. We need not take 
stock of all these cases and we indeed have no quarrel with the 
propositions settled therein..." 

16. On the above contentions, we have heard the learned counsel for the 

respondents, who would submit that the subject land is the property of the 

State, which was leased out to the Trust with certain conditions, and, as there 


74 

was violation of conditoins, coupled with the need of the land for railways for a 

public purpose, the State has resumed the land after following the due 

procedure and, hence, the act of the State in resuming the land cannot be 

faulted with. 

17. Mr.P.H.Arvind Pandian, learned Additional Advocate General 

appearing for the State in all the Writ Appeals, would vehemently contend that 

there is a violation of terms and conditions of the lease and further the land in 

question has been required by CMRL for a public purpose and, therefore, for 

the welfare of the people of the State and in order to ease out the congestion, 

the State has taken immediate action to resume the land, which belongs to 

itself. He also submits that Section 3 of the Government Grants Act empowers 

the State to resume the land without any procedural impediment, as the land is 

immediately needed for the public purpos. Finally, he would contend that the 

ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in this regard is binding on the 

appellants, as their survey numbers have also been taken into consideration 

while rendering the finding, and the rules contemplated under the Government 

Grants Act have been rightly invoked by the State while proceeding with the 

impugned action and, therefore, there is no legal infirmity in the impugned 

order passed by the Government. The learned Additional Advocate General has 

relied upon the following authorities: 

(i) State of U.P. vs. Zahoor Ahmad, reported in (1973) 2 SCC 547 : 


75 

"16. Section 3 of the Government Grants Act declares 
the unfettered discretion of the Government to impose such 
conditions and limitations as it thinks fit, no matter what the 
general law of the land be. The meaning of sections 2 and 3 
of the Government Grants is that the scope of that Act is not 
limited to affecting the provisions of the Transfer of Property 
Act only. The Government has unfettered discretion to 
impose any conditions, limitations, or restrictions in its 
grants, and the right, privileges and obligations of the grantee 
would be regulated according to the terms of the grant, 
notwithstanding any provisions of any statutory or common 
law." 

(ii) Hajee S.V.M.Mohamed Jamaludeen Bros. & Co. vs. Govt. of TN, 

reported in (1997) 3 SCC 466 : 

"9. Section 2 of the Grants Act insulates all grants and 
all transfers of land or any interest therein made by the 
government from the checks of the provisions of Transfer of 
Property Act. Section 3 of the Grants act protects the terms of 
such grant from the provisions of any other law. We extract 
the above two provisions hereunder : 

"2. Transfer of property Act, 1882, not to 
apply to Government grants.-Nothing in the 
Transfer of Property act, 1882, contained shall 
apply or be deemed ever to have applied to any 
grant or other transfer of land or of any interest 
therein heretofore made or hereafter to be made by 
or on behalf of the Government to, or in favour of, 
any person whomsoever; but every such grant and 
transfer shall be construed and take effect as if the 
said Act had not been passed. 

3. Government grants to take effect 
according to their tenor:-All provisions, 
restrictions, conditions and limitations, contained 
in any such grant or transfer as aforesaid shall be 
valid and the effect according to their tenor, any 
rule of law, statute or enactment of the contrary 
notwithstanding." 


76 

10. The combined effect of the above two sections of 
the Grants Act is that terms of any grant or terms of any 
transfer of land made by a government would stand insulated 
from the tentacles of any statutory law. Section 3 places the 
terms of such grant beyond the reach of any restrictive 
provision contained in any enacted law or even the equitable 
principles of justice, equity and good conscience adumbrated 
by common law if such principles are inconsistent with such 
terms. The two provisions are so framed as to confer 
unfettered discretion on the government to enforce any 
condition or limitation or restriction in all types of grants 
made by the government to any person. In other words, the 
rights, privileges and obligations of any grantee of the 
government would be completely regulated by the terms of 
the grant, even if such terms are inconsistent with the 
provisions of any other law. 

11. The above legal position was recognised by the 
courts in India before the Constitution of India came into 
being. (Surja Kanta Roy Choudhary and Ors. v. Secretary of 
State and Raza Hussain Khan and Ors. v. Sayid Mohd. and 
Ors. AIR (1938) Oudh 175). The position continued to be so 
even after the Constitution came into force (State of U.P. v. 
Zahoor Ahmad." 

(iii) Chitra Kumar (Smt) vs. Union of India and others, reported in 

(2001) 3 SCC 208 : 

"32. We have considered the rival submission. In our 
view Mr. Rohtagi is quite right. It is now too late in the day 
for Mr. Andhyarujina's clients to take a contrary stand. Mr. 
Yogeshwar Prasad's clients have on facts lost in all Courts 
below. Notice to produce documents, given belatedly in some 
other case, is of no relevance so far as these Appeals are 
concerned. The practice of annexing irrelevant documents 
and trying to rely on them for the first time in the Appeal or 
in Review Petitions in the High Court should be deprecated. 

33. In Civil Appeal Nos. 917-918 of 1998 it is clear 
that, at all stages, the case has progressed on the basis that it 
was not disputed that the land was on old grant terms. Of 
course, in the Plaint, in Para. 4(b) it had been averred that the 
land was not on old grant terms. However, except for making 
such an averment that point has clearly not been pressed at 
any stage. In evidence given by the plaintiff and/or on his 


77 

behalf, there is no statement that the land was of plaintiff 
ownership and/or that the land did not belong to the 
Government. During trial the documents, now sought to be 
relied upon by Mr. Andhyarujina were neither produced nor 
tendered nor got marked as Exhibits. Were they produced 
Respondents would have had an opportunity to cross 
examine the witnesses and show that the averments in the 
documents were not correct and/or to explain how and why 
lease was taken by the Secretary of the State. It is clear that 
the averments in para 4(b) of the Plaint were not pressed. 
That they were not pressed is also clear from the Judgment of 
the Trial Court. It sets out all the arguments of the parties. No 
submission on the question of ownership of land by the 
Plaintiff and/or that the land was not on old grant terms has 
been recorded. If it was argued and their submissions were 
not recorded cross objections should have been filed 
particularly when in the last paragraph the Trial Court 
clarifies that the Government could resume the land after 
following due procedure of law. There could be no question 
of resumption if it was being disputed that the Government 
was the owner of the land. If Mr. Andhyarujina is right and 
the parties had not given up this contention, then it would be 
worse for the Appellants inasmuch as it would then mean that 
the trial Court had not accepted Plaintiffs/Appellants claim to 
ownership of land and had negatived it. 

34. The Appellants never went in Appeal against the 
Judgment of the Trial Court. Even when the Respondents 
went in Appeal no cross objections were filed. Even before 
the first Appellate Court it has not been stated that their 
submissions were not dealt with and/or that the portion of the 
Judgment permitting resumption, after due process of law, 
could not have been granted. On the contrary the first 
Appellate Court is also clarifying that the Government can 
resume after following due process of law. This shows that 
even before the first Appellate Court it was an admitted 
position that the Government was the owner of the land and 
that the land was on old grant terms. 

35. When the Respondents went in Second Appeal 
before the High Court, at this stage also, no cross objections 
were filed. Before the High Court it was not disputed that the 
land was on old grant terms. The High Court has so recorded 
in its Judgment. It is settled law that one has to proceed on 
basis of what has been recorded by the Court. If any party 
feels aggrieved of what has been recorded by the Courts a 


78 

clarification has to be sought from that same Court. In this 
case the clarification was sought, by way of Review Petition, 
to which as stated above, fresh documents were purported to 
be attached for the first time. The High Court has rejected the 
Review Petition. The High Court has thus confirmed that at 
the time the Second Appeal was argued it was not disputed 
that the land was on old grant terms. This Court has to go by 
what has been recorded in the Judgment. What is recorded in 
the Judgment is supported by the conduct of the parties 
inasmuch as no evidence was led to dispute the fact, no 
documents were tendered or marked as Exhibits and no 
submissions were made on this aspect. That it was not 
disputed that the land was on old grant terms is also 
supported by what has been recorded in the Judgments of the 
trial court and the First Appellate Court. There is no evidence 
that the written admissions were taken forcibly and/or that 
they were not binding or not correct. Admissions are relevant 
evidence if not explained away. Thus these cases have been 
fought over the last 17 years on an admitted position. Mr. 
Rohtagi is right that it would be a travesty of justice and 
would amount to permitting parties to misuse laws delays if 
at this stage they are permitted to change their stand and take 
contentions which are contrary to what has been the admitted 
position all these years. 

36. In Civil Appeals (arising out of SLP (C) Nos. 
22436-22437 of 1997) all the Courts below have given 
concurrent findings of fact. We see no infirmity in these 
findings. The findings of fact are based on evidence before 
the Trial Court and require no interference. 

37. Once it is admitted that land was on old grant 
terms it is irrelevant to argue that it is not shown that Ambala 
was under the Bengal Army. The same would be the position 
when on evidence Court has held that land is on old grant 
terms." 

(iv) Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar and others vs. State of Gujarat and 

another, reported in 1995 Supp. (1) SCC 596 : 

"32. In Subodh Copal's case Patanjali Sastri, CJ, held 
that the word 'deprived' in clause (1) of Art. 31 cannot be 
narrowly construed. No cut and dry test can be formulated as 
to whether in a given case the owner is deprived of his 
property within the meaning of Art. 31; each case must be 


79 

decided as it arises on its own facts. Broadly speaking it may 
be said that an abridgement would be so substantial as to 
amount to a deprivation within the meaning of Art. 31, if, in 
effect, if withheld the property from the posession and 
enjoyment by him or materially reduced its value. S.R. Das, 
J, as he then was, held that Clauses (1) and (2) of Art, 31 
dealt with the topic of 'eminent domain', the expressions 
'taken possession of or 'acquired' according to Clause (2) 
have the same meaning which the word 'deprived' used in 
clause (1). In other words, both the clauses are con-cerned 
with the deprivation of the property; taking possession of or 
ac-quired, used in Clause (2) is referable to deprivation of 
the property in Clause (1). Taking possession or acquisition 
should be in the connotation of the acquisition or requisition 
of the property for public purpose. Deprivation specifically 
referable to acquisition or requisition and not for any and 
every kind of deprivation. In Dwarka Das Srinivas of 
Bombay v. Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd., [1954] 
SCR 674, Mahajan, J., as he then was, similarly held that the 
word 'deprived' in clause (1) of Art. 31 and acquisition and 
taking possession in clause (2) have the same meaning 
delimting the field of eminent domain, namely, compulsory 
acquisition of the property and given protection to private 
owners against the State action. S.R. Das, J. reiterated his 
view laid in Subodh Gupal's case. Vivian Bose, J. held that 
the word 'taken possession of or 'acquired' in Art. 31(2) have 
to be read along with the word 'deprived' in clause (1). 
Taking possession or acquisition amounts to deprivation 
within the meaning of clause (1). No hard and fast rule can 
be laid down. Each case must depend on its own facts. The 
word "law" used in Art. 300A must be an Act of Parliament 
or of State Legislature, a rule or statutory order having force 
of law. The deprivation of the property shall be only by 
authority of law, be it an Act of Parliament or State 
Legislature, but not by executive fiat or an order. 
Deprivation of property is by acquisition or requisition or 
taking possession of for a public purpose. 

33. It is true as contended by Sri Javery that clause (2) 
of Art. 31 was not suitably incorporated in Art. 300A but the 
obligation to pay compen-sation to the deprived owner of his 
property was enjoined as an inherent incident of acquisition 
under law is equally untenable for the following reasons. 
Ramanatha Aiyar's 'The Law Lexicon' Reprint Edition 1987, 
p. 385, defined 'eminent demain' thus: 


80 

"The right of the State or the sovereign to its or his 
own property is absolute while that of the subject or citizen 
to his property is only paramount. The citizen holds his 
property subject always to the right of the soverign to take it 
for a public purpose. This right is called "eminent domain". 

At p. 386 it was further stated that: 

"The sovereign power vested in the State to take 
private property for the public use, providing first a just 
compensation therefore. A superior right to apply private 
property to public use. A superior right inherent in society, 
and exercised by the sovereign power, or upon delegation 
from it, whereby the subject matter of rights of property may 
be taken from the owner and appropriated for the general 
welfare. The right belonging to the society or to the 
sovereign, of disposing in cases of necessity, and for the 
public safety, of all the wealth contained in the state is called 
eminent domain. The right of every government to 
appropriate, otherwise than by taxation and its police 
authority, private property for public use. The ultimate right 
of sovereign power to appropriate not only the public 
property but the private property of all citizens within the 
territorial sovereignty, to public purpose. Eminent domain is 
in the nature of a compulsory purchase of the property of the 
citizen for the purpose of applying to the public use." 

In 'Black's Law Dictionary' 6th edition, at p. 523 'eminent 
domain' is defined as: 

"The power to take private property for 
public use by the state, municipalities and private 
persons or corporations authoritised to exercise 
functions of public character. in United States the 
power of eminent domain is founded in both the 
Federal 
(Fifth 
Amendment) 
and 
State 
Constitutions. The Constitution gives the power to 
take for public purpose and prohibits the exercise 
of the power of eminent domain without just 
compensation to the owners of the property which 
is taken. The process of exercising the power of 
eminent domain is commonly referred to as 
'condemnation' or 'expropriation'." 

36. In Bisambhar Dayal Chandra Mohan v. State of 
U.P., this Court had held that the State Govt. cannot while 


81 

taking recourse to the executive power of the State under 
Art. 162, deprive a person of his property. Such power can 
be exercised, only by authority of law and not by a mere 
executive fiat or order. It is, therefore, necessarily subject to 
Art. 300A. Eminent domain, therefore, is a right inherent in 
every sovereign State to expropriate private property for 
public purpose without its owner's consent which inheres in 
Art. 300A and it would be exercised by the authority of law 
and not by executive fiat or order." 

(v) Union of India and others vs. Harish Chand Anand (Dead) Through 

Lrs., reported in (2010) 15 SCC 591 : 

"12. We have carefully considered the contention. We 
are not persuaded to accept this contention raised by the 
appellant. As noted earlier the High Court accepted the 
contention raised by the respondent relying on the Division 
Bench decision in Bhagwati Devi. Subsequently, the 
Himachal Pradesh High Court took the same views as the 
Allahabad High Court, in Durga Dass Sud v. Union of India. 
We are of the view that the decision of the Delhi High Court 
in Raj Singh vs. Union of India is acceptable. Therein in para 
4 the learned Single Judge held that the determination of 
compensation was not a condition precedent to the 
resumption. The Division Bench concurred with the view 
taken by the learned Single Judge. The Division Bench in para 
21 of the judgment in Raj Singh case observed: 

"The question of compensation would have to be 
considered in an independent proceeding between the ex 
grantee and the Government in the light of the provisions of 
the first condition of Regulation 6 and the whole of 
Regulation 7 of Order 179 of 1836." 

The question whether the Government must pay compensation 
or whether they can take the stand that the grantee may 
remove the structure and the quantum of compensation 
payable would be considered in that proceeding." 

14. It is contended by the learned counsel for the 
respondent that in both the cases aforementioned this Court 
referred to and relied on the decision in this very case (Union 
of India v. Harish Chand Anand) and that the decision having 
been set aside and the appeal restored to file, they have no 
precedential value. We cannot agree. Apart from relying on 


82 

the decision in this case which was subsequently set aside, the 
learned Judges also approved the view taken by the Delhi 
High Court in Raj Singh case. In any case, we are also of the 
view that the process of resumption of land in terms of Clause 
(5) of the grant does not get indefinitely postponed till the 
dispute as to compensation is determined according to law. In 
other words the determination of compensation after hearing 
the affected parties, though mandatory, is not a condition 
precedent for the exercise of power of resumption. The 
resultant position that emerges is that the question formulated 
earlier has to be answered in the negative and the writ petition 
is liable to be dismissed." 

18. Mr.R.Thiagarajan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 

respondent/CMRL, would argue that viewing the importance of the project to 

ease out congestion in the city of Chennai and following the policy of the 

Central Government to go ahead with the project in coordination with the State, 

CMRL being the requisitioning body, resumption of the subject land is a sine 

qua non and any delay in handing over possession of the land would not only 

cause monetary loss but lead to the stalling of the project and, therefore, the 

land is required for a public purpose and there is every need for handing over 

the land at the earliest, in order to facilitate the project. It is his further 

contention that public purpose will prevail over the individual's interest and the 

appellants have exhausted all the remedies and the matter has been remanded 

by the Supreme Court only for a limited purpose to give the appellants an 

opportunity, which has been followed and any delay in completing the project 

would result in heavy financial implications and, as such, CMRL, being the 

requisitioning body, its interests should be protected. The learned Senior 


83 

Counsel has relied on the following rulings : 

(i) Gaya Prasad vs. Secretary of State, reported in AIR 1939 Allahabad 

263 : 

"... No limit of time applies to Government in its 
resumption of a grant. In the present case, the suit has been 
brought for resumption and there is no reason whatever why 
it should not be granted. It may be noted that the grant has 
been violated by the transfer by sale of 22 nd July 1928 and 
any sanction of the Municipal Board would not make that 
transfer valid. Secondly, the grant was violated by the 
appellant digging foundations with the intention of making a 
building. The grant is not for the purpose of making a 
building but for the purpose of planting a garden or grove. 
Thirdly, the grant was violated by Gaya Prasad, the present 
occupant, setting up title in himself which was in issue 
before the Assistant Collector and was the subject of a 
reference to the Munsif and was again the subject of a claim 
apparently before the lower Appellate Court where the 
appellant claimed to have heritable and transferable rights. 
As regards the power of Municipal Boards, the quotation of 
the Court below from the Municipal Manual, p.261, shows 
that "Nazul is at all times liable to resumption by the 
Government." Therefore, no matter what action is taken by 
the Municipal Board, the power of Government to resume the 
nazul remains. For these reasons, we consider that the Court 
below was correct in decreeing this suit for resumption and 
we dismiss this second appeal with costs." 

(ii) Collector of Bombay vs. Nusserwanji Rattanji Mistri and others, 

reported in AIR 1955 Supreme Court 298 : 

"15. Then there remains the question whether the 
sale deed, Exhibit A, imposes any limitation on the right 
of the Crown to assess the lands. The deed conveys the 
lands to the purchasers absolutely "with all rights, 
easements and appurtenances whatsoever" to be held "for 
ever". It does not, however, recite that they are to be held 
revenue-free. But it is argued for the respondents that 
where there is an absolute sale by the Crown as here, that 
necessarily imports that the land is conveyed revenue-
free; and section 3 of the Crown Grants Act No. XV of 


84 

1895 and certain observations in Dadoba v. Collector of 
Bombay(1) were relied on as supporting this contention. 
Section 3 of Act No. XV of 1895 is as follows: 

"All provisions restrictions, conditions 
and limitations over contained in any such 
grant or transfer as aforesaid shall be valid 
and take effect according to their tenor any 
rule of law, statute or enactment of the 
Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding". 

The contention is that as the grant is of a freehold 
estate without any reservation it must, to take effect 
according to its tenor, be construed as granting exemption 
from assessment to revenue. But that will be extending 
the bounds of section 3 beyond its contents. The object of 
the Act as declared in the preamble is to remove certain 
doubts "as to the extent and operation of the Transfer of 
Property Act, 1882, and, as to the power of the Crown to 
impose limitations and restrictions upon grants and other 
transfers of land made by it or under its authority". 
Section 2 enacts that the provisions of the Transfer of 
Property Act do not apply to Crown grants. Then follows 
section 3 with a positive declaration that "all provisions, 
restrictions, conditions and limitations over" shall take 
effect according to their tenor. Reading the enactment as a 
whole, the scope of section 3 is that it saves "provisions, 
restrictions, conditions and limitations over" which would 
be bad under the provisions of the Transfer of Property 
Act, such as conditions in restraint of alienations or 
enjoyment repugnant to the nature of the estate, 
limitations offending the rule against perpetuities and the 
like. But no question arises here as to the validity of any 
provision, restriction, condition, or limitation over, 
contained in Exhibit A on the ground that it is in 
contravention of any of the provisions of the Transfer of 
Property Act, and there is accordingly nothing on which 
section 3 could take effect. 

16. It is argued by the learned Attorney-General that 
this limitation on the scope of the Act applies in terms 
only to section 2, and that section 3 goes much further, 
and is general and unqualified in its operation. The scope 
of section 3 came up for consideration before the Privy 


85 

Council in Thakur Jagannath Baksh Singh v. The United 
Provinces(1). After setting out that section, Lord Wright 
observed: 

"These general words cannot be read in 
their apparent generality. The whole Act was 
intended to settle doubts which had arisen as to 
the effect of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, 
and must be read with reference to the general 
context......" 

In this view, section 3 must also be construed in the 
light of the preamble, and so construed, it cannot, for the 
reasons already given, have any bearing on the rights of 
the parties. Moreover, that section only enacts that "all 
provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations over" 
shall take effect according to their tenor, and what is 
relied on is not any provision, restriction, condition or 
limitation over, in Exhibit A which according to its tenor 
entitles the respondents to hold the lands rent-free, but the 
absolute character of the interest conveyed under Exhibit 
A. Therefore, section 3 does not in terms apply." 

(iii) Fruit & Vegetable Merchants Union, Subzi, Mandi, Delhi vs. Delhi 

Improvement Trust, Regal Buildings, Cannaught Place, New Delhi, reported in 

AIR 1957 SC 344 : 

"19. 
That the word "vest" is a word of variable 
import is shown by provisions of Indian statutes also. For 
example, s. 56 of the Provincial Insolvency Act (V of 
1920) empowers the court at the time of the making of the 
order of adjudication or thereafter to appoint a receiver for 
the property of the insolvent and further provides that " 
such property shall thereupon vest in the receiver." The 
property vests in the receiver for the purpose of 
administering the estate of the insolvent for the payment 
of his debts after realising his assets. The property of the 
insolvent vests in the receiver not for all purposes but 
only for the purpose of the Insolvency Act and the 
receiver has no interest of his own in the property. On the 
other hand, ss. 16 and 17 of the Land Acquisition Act. 
(Act I of 1894), provide that the property so acquired, 
upon the happening of certain events, shall ''vest" 


86 

absolutely in the Government free from all 
encumbrances'. In the cases contemplated by ss. 16 and 17 
the property acquired becomes. the property of 
Government without any conditions or limitations either 
as to title or possession. The legislature has made it clear 
that the vesting of the property is not for any limited 
purpose or limited duration. It would thus appear that the 
word "vest" has not got a fixed connotation, meaning in 
all cases that the property is owned by the person or the 
autho-rity in whom it vests. It may vest in title, or it may 
vest in possession, or it may vest in a limited sense, as 
indicated in the context in which it may have been used in 
a particular piece of legislation. The provisions of the 
Improvement Act, particularly ss. 45 to 49 and 54 and 
54A when they speak of a certain building or street or 
square or other land vesting in a municipality or other 
local body or in a trust, do not necessarily mean that 
ownership has passed to any of them. 
20. The question of the ownership of the structure 
built upon Government land by the Trust may be looked at 
from another point of view. We have already held that the 
Trust was in the position of a statutory agent of 
Government and had erected the structure with money 
belonging to Government but advanced at interest to the 
Trust. In such a situation the structure also would be the 
property of Government, though for the time being it may 
be at the disposal of the Trust for the purpose of managing 
it efficiently as a statutory body. Simply because the Trust 
erected the structure in question and later on paid up the 
amount advanced by Government for the purpose would 
not necessarily lead to the,legal inference that the structure 
was the property of the Trust. In this connection reference 
may be made to the decision of this Court in Bhatia Co-
operative Housing Society Ltd. v. D. C. Patel(1). The case 
is not on all fours with the facts of the present case. But 
the following observations of Das J. (as he then was) at p. 
195 of the report are pertinent:-

" It is true that the lessee erected the 
building at his own cost but he did so for the 
lessor and on the lessor's land on agreed terms. 
The fact that the lessee incurred expenses in 
putting up the building is precisely the 
consideration for the lessor granting him a lease, 
for 999 years not only of the building but of the 


87 

land as well at what may, for all we know, be a 
cheap rent which the lessor may not have 
otherwise agreed to do. By the agreement the 
building became the property of the lessor and 
the lessor demised the land and the building 
which, in the circumstances, in law and in fact 
belonged to the lessor. The law. of fixtures 
under s. 108 of the Transfer of Property Act may 
be different from the English law, but s. 108 is 
subject to any agreement that the parties may 
choose to make. Here, by the agreement the 
building became part of the land and the 
property of the lessor and the lessee took a lease 
on that footing." 

(iv) The Director of Rationing and Distribution vs. The Corporation of 

Calcutta, reported in AIR 1960 Supreme Court 1355 : 

"38.... There is nothing in the Act of 1923 or in the Act 
of 1951 exempting the State specifically from any of the 
provisions of the Calcutta Municipal Act. In this case the 
State is being prosecuted under s. 488 (or s. 537 now) and 
that section provides for fine for breach of s. 386 (or s. 437 
now). The provision is a penal provision' and immediately a 
question arises whether the State as such, apart from its 
individual officers as natural persons, is liable to prosecution 
under the criminal law or has to be exempted from the 
operation of the provisions of criminal statutes by necessary 
implication. A criminal proceeding generally ends with 
punishment which may be imprisonment, or fine, or both. 
Now it does not require any elaborate reason to realise that 
the State as such cannot be sentenced to imprisonment 
because there is no way of keeping it in prison; therefore, by 
necessary implication, the State is exempt from all penal 
statutes and provisions providing for sentences of 
imprisonment or death. Then come those penal provisions 
which impose fines, like the present case, and the question is 
whether in such a case also the State must be deemed by 
necessary implication to be exempt from the penal provision. 
Generally speaking fines when inflicted by courts are 
realised by the State and go to the coffers of the State. In 
effect, therefore if the State as such is to be prosecuted under 
a penal statute imposing fine the result is that the Court will 
sentence the State to fine which will go to the State itself. It 
is obvious that if such is the result of a prosecution, namely 


88 

that the accused gets the fine, the intention could never be 
that such a prosecution should be launched. Therefore where 
the penalty is fine and the fine goes to the State, it must be 
held that by necessary implication the law does not intend 
the State to be prosecuted for such an offence. In the present 
case I find that under s. 81 of the Act of 1923 (or the corres-
ponding s. 115 of the Act of 1951) the fines imposed by the 
Magistrate will not go to the Corporation but in the usual 
way to the State. Under the circumstances whatever other 
methods may be possible for enforcing the provisions of s. 
386 (or s. 437 now) against the State it cannot be intended to 
be enforced by prosecution resulting in fine which would go 
to the State itself. In these circumstances it must be held that 
by necessary implication the State is exempt from the penal 
provisions contained in s. 488 (now s. 537). I would 
therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the 
High Court and restore the order of acquittal by the 
Magistrate." 

(v) State of Orissa vs. Ram Chandra Dev and another, reported in AIR 

1964 Supreme Court 685 : 

"(4) When these petitions were argued before the High 
Court, the High Court took the view that it was impossible 
for it to decide the important question of title in writ 
proceedings under Art. 226. It expressed the opinion, and we 
think rightly, that such a question of title can be decided only 
in a properly constituted suit where both parties would get 
sufficient opportunity to adduce all material evidence 
bearing on the question in dispute. Having reached this 
conclusion, the High Court proceeded to examine the narrow 
question as to whether the ex-Zamindars should be 
maintained in their possession of the Maliahs until eviction 
in due course of law, or whether they should be driven to the 
civil court to establish their right after Government has 
successfully evicted them by use of force or show of force. 
In dealing with the petitions on this narrow ground the High 
Court recognised that the existence of a right is the very 
foundation of the exercise of its jurisdiction under Art. 226 
and it thought that possession of the lands for more than 80 
years with the ex-Zamindars afforded evidence of a right 
which could sustain their petitions under Art. 226. It was 
urged before the High Court that S. 9 of the Specific Relief 
Act which affords a speedy and summary remedy to a person 


89 

in possession who has been dispossessed is not applicable 
where dispossession of a person in possession is caused by 
the Central Government or any State Government, for that is 
the effect of the clear provision in that behalf under S. 9 
itself. The High Court, however, was inclined to take the 
view that the right to recover possession vesting in a person 
who had been in possession prior to such dispossession 
which is implicit in S. 9 can be enforced under Art. 226 by a 
party even against the Central Government or the State 
Government, and in that sense, the jurisdiction of the High 
Court under Art. 226 was not limited in the manner in which 
the jurisdiction of civil courts is limited under S. 9. The High 
Court then expressed itself somewhat strongly against the 
intention of the appellant to recover possession from the ex-
Zamindars merely be resuming the grants without taking 
recourse to a court of law and so, it held that the ex-
Zamindars who had moved it under Art. 226 were entitled to 
an appropriate writ under the said Article. The appellant then 
moved the High Court for a certificate and it is with the 
certificate issued by the High Court that it has come to this 
Court in the present two appeals. 

11. As we have already observed, the High Court did 
not embark upon the enquiry as to title in the present 
proceedings, because that is a question which may be 
appropriately tried in a regular suit. In proceeding to issue a 
writ in favour of the respondents, the High Court, however, 
appears to have assumed that the appellant was not entitled 
to seek to recover possession of the properties after resuming 
the grants in question. Whether or not the grants in question 
are resumable, and if they are, whether or not the appellant 
can recover possession without filing a suit, are questions on 
which we propose to express no opinion in the present 
appeals. Ordinarily, where property has been granted by the 
State on conditions which make the grant resumable, after 
resumption it is the grantee who moves the Court for 
appropriate relief, and that proceeds on the basis that the 
grantor State which has reserved to itself the right to resume 
may, after exercising its right, seek to recover possession of 
the property without filing a suit. But apart from this aspect 
of the matter, it is difficult to see how the High Court was 
justified in issuing the writ in the present appeals the 
inevitable consequence of which would be that the 
respondents would remain in possession of the property until 


90 

the appellant files a suit against them; and that, in our 
opinion, would not be justified unless questions of title are 
determined and it is held that the appellant must file a suit 
before the respondents can be dispossessed. It appears that in 
issuing the writ in favour of the respondents, the High Court 
failed to appreciate the legal effect of its conclusion that 
questions of title cannot be tried in writ proceedings. Once it 
is held that the question of title cannot be determined, it 
follows that no right can be postulated in favour of the 
respondents on the basis of which a writ can be issued in 
their favour under Article 226. 

12. Mr. Tatachari, however, has contended that the 
right on which the petitions of the respondents are founded is 
a right flowing from the respondents' continuous possession 
of the properties for many years, and he argues that if such a 
right is proved, the High Court would be justified in issuing 
a writ protecting that right. This argument is clearly 
fallacious. Mere possession of the property for however long 
a period it may be, will not clothe the possessor with any 
legal right if it is shown that the possession is under a grant 
from the State which is resumable. Such long possession 
may give him a legal right to protect his possession against 
third parties, but as between the State and the grantee, 
possession of the grantee under a resumable grant cannot be 
said to confer any right on the grantee which would justify a 
claim for a writ under Article 226 where the grant has been 
resumed. In dealing with this argument, we have assumed 
without deciding that though a suit under Section 9 of the 
Specific Relief Act would have been incompetent against the 
appellant, a similar relief can be claimed by the respondents 
against the appellant under Article 226. Even on that 
assumption, no right can be claimed by the respondents 
merely on the ground of their possession, unless their right to 
remain in possession is established against the appellant, and 
this can be done if the grant is held to be not resumable." 

(vi) State of Andhra vs. Gathala Abhishekam and others, reported in 

AIR 1964 Andhra Pradesh 450 : 

"24. It is profitable to refer to the Government Grants 
Act, XV of 1895 in this connection. That Act was enacted to 
remove certain doubts which had arisen as to the extent and 
operation of the Transfer of Property Act and as to the power 


91 

of the Government to impose limitations and restrictions 
upon grants and other transfers of land made by it or under 
its authority. Section 2 of the said Act categorically states 
that nothing in the Transfer of Property Act contained shall 
apply or be deemed ever to have applied to any grant or 
transfer of land or of interest therein and made by or on 
behalf of the Government to or in favour of any person 
whosoever, but every grant and transfer shall be construed 
and take effect as if the said Act had not been passed. 
Section 3 enjoins that all provisions, restrictions, conditions 
and limitations ever contained in any such grant or transfer 
as aforesaid shall be valid and take effect according to their 
tenor any rule of law, statutes or enactment of the 
Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding. It is thus evident 
that the ordinary rule applicable to a grant made by a subject 
does not apply to a grant made by the sovereign authority, 
and the giants made by the sovereign are to be construed 
most favourably for the sovereign. It is capable of important 
relaxations in favour of the subject. If the intention is 
obvious, a fair and liberal interpretation must be given to the 
grant to enable it to take effect; and the operative part, if 
plainly expressed, may take effect notwithstanding 
qualifications in the recitals. In cases where the grant is for 
valuable consideration, it is construed in favour of the 
grantee, for the honour of the sovereign; and where two 
constructions are possible, one valid and the other void, that 
which is valid ought to be preferred, for the honour of the 
sovereign's profit. 

According to the said Act however the Crown has 
unfettered discretion to impose any condition, limitation, or 
restriction in its grants. It is not only the Transfer of Property 
Act that is affected by the Crown Grants Act. Section 3 of 
the Government Grants Act declares the unfettered 
discretion of the Crown to impose such conditions and 
limitations as it thinks fit, no matter what the general law of 
the land is. The effect of Section 3 therefore is that when a 
grant has been made by the Crown, the Crown is not with 
reference to that grant, bound by any of the sections of either 
the Tenancy Act or the Transfer of Property Act or the 
Contract Act, or any other law for the time being in force. It 
therefore follows that any grant made has to be construed in 
accordance with the tenor of the grant, and the grant will 
certainly be regulated in accordance with such tenor. This is 


92 

the conclusion which is 'supported by the following 
decisions. 

(a) Ullattuthodi Choyi v. Secy, of State for India, 
14 Mad LW 386 at p. 387 : (AIR 1921 Mad 409). 

(b) Kallingal Moosa Kutti v. Secy, of Stale, ILR 
43 Mad 65 at p. 68 : (AIR 1920 Mad 413 at p. 414). 

(c) Janendra Nath v. Jadu Nath, AIR 1938 CaJ 211 
at p. 214; 

(d) Raja Rajinder Chand v. Sukhi, . 

(e) Namdeo Lokman v. Narmadabai, . 

(f) 
Haji Fasihuddin v. Mohd. Habib, . 

Applying these principles to the facts of the present 
case we experience no difficulty in reaching the conclusion 
that the tenor of the grant clearly indicates that the land was 
assigned on condition that the plaintiffs should pay the fond 
revenue on the prescribed dates. When they have failed to 
pay, it follows that the Government has the right to resume 
and re-enter and take 'possession of the land without paying 
any compensation. No notice therefore is contemplated 
under the tenor of the grant. Reference in this regard is 
specifically made to cited -above. That was a case in which 
the principal question which arose for decision was whether 
notice as contemplated by Section 111 (g) of the Transfer of 
Property Act was necessary for the determination of a lease 
for non-payment of rent even where such lease was executed 
before the corning into force of the Transfer of Property Act. 
Discussing elaborately the law and authorities their 
Lordships came to the conclusion that no such notice was 
necessary and that the defaulting lessee cannot claim the 
benefit of a notice in writing to complete the forfeiture he 
has incurred, and that the lessor has to simply express an 
intention that he is going to avail of the forfeiture and that 
can be done by the filing of the suit, as in English law, in all 
cases not governed by the Transfer of Property Act. 

In this case no notice to determine the grant was 
necessary. The Government by an overt act can indicate that 
they are determining the grant and resuming the land and re-
entering and taking possession of the land. Admittedly no 
such suit in such a case is necessary. We have therefore to go 


93 

by the words of the assignment made in this behalf. Nothing 
beyond what is contained in the assignment order is 
necessary to be looked into. It is also perhaps relevant to 
refer to . In that case it was held that a tenant of a service 
tenure who refuses to perform his services is liable to be 
eject-ed even without a notice to quit. It was found that it 
was an incident of a service tenure that the holder thereof is 
liable to ejectment upon refusal to perform service; as this 
incident would be materially affected, and practically 
destroyed, if the provisions of Section 155 of the Bengal 
Tenancy Act relating to relief against forfeiture were made 
applicable, service tenures must be held to be excepted from 
the operation of that Section." 

(vii) State of Madras, represented by the Collector of Madras vs. 

T.M.Oosman Haji & Co., Timber Merchants, Basin Bridge Road, Madras & 

Others, reported in 1969 (1) MLJ 433 : 

"14. The learned Government Pleader brought to our 
notice the unreported decision of Natesan, J., in Mallanna 
Gounder v. Muthuswami Gounder and Anr. S.A. No. 482 
of 1964, where a different view of Section 3 of the 
Government taken in deciding whether the State can claim 
immunity and exemption from the provisions of the Madras 
Cultivating Tenant Protection Act in respect of agricultural 
lands of the Government by virtue of Section 3 of the 
Government Grants agricultural Act. In the case before the 
learned Judge, a lessee of agriculture land government 
Grants sought to rely upon the provisions of the Madras 
Cultivating Act land from Govern-section Act and the State 
met by putting forward a claim to immunity and exemption 
from the provisions of that Act, by reason of the 
Government Grants Act. The learned Judge held, firstly, 
that the plaintiff's in the suit would be a cultivating tenant 
within the meaning of the Madras Cultivating tenant the 
Act should apply, he could not be evicted from his holding. 
The State was undoubtedly the landlord and but for the 
claim to immunity by reason of the Government Grants 
Act, Section 3 of the Madras Cultivating Tenants 
Protection act would afford protection to the tenant against 
eviction. The learned Judge examined the provisions of the 
Government Grants Act. He referred to the decisions 
already cited by us earlier in this judgment He cited the 


94 

observation to the Privy Council in Thakur Jagannath 
Baksh Singh v. The United Provinces (1946) F.C.R. in : 
(1946) F.L.J. 88 : L.R. 73 I.A. 123 : (1946) 2 M.L.J. 29 that 
the generality" and the observations of the Supreme Court 
in Collector of Bombay v. Nasserwanji . The learned Judge 
construed the observation that the general words in Section 
3 cannot be read in their apparent generality to mean that 
the scope of Section 3 of that Act was limited. It seems to 
us that the observations both of the they were made. In the 
Privy Council decision the validity of the Provinces which 
Tenancy Act, as enacted by the Provincial Legislature 
.United Provinces as it affected the rights conferred upon a 
grantee under a Sannad. The contention then was that since 
under the terms of the grant it was open to sannad. The 
contention to deal with the land and the tenancy as he liked, 
the impunged to the sannad-holder far as it interfered with 
his right to deal with his tenants in any impunged 
legislation , in so to the terms of the grant. The Judicial 
Committee pointed out that any way was contrary power 
could not be attacked and the Statute regulating the 
relations that the legislative landlord and the tenant, though 
it might affect or diminish the rights between the landlord 
possessed earlier, did not in any way run contrary to 
Section 3 of the Government Grants Act. By making a 
grant of that description, the legislature did not deprive 
itself of any power to legislate within the scope of its 
authority, and the contention that by reason of the sannad, 
the pre-existing relations between the sannad-holder and 
his tenants could not be interfered with by legislation of 
this kind was repelled, and it is in that context. Nor do the 
observations of the Supreme Court in the next case referred 
to above lead to a different conclusion. After quoting the 
passage from the Supreme Court decision, Natesan, J. 
proceeded to say that "the Government Grants Act thus 
being unavailable, the State sought to stand on the archaic 
prerogative and immunity of the Crown from the operation 
of the statutes..." and proceeded to consider whether under 
the general law the Crown was not bound by any statute, 
unless the statute expressly or by clear implication so 
bound it. We are unable to subscribe to the view taken by 
our learned brother that the Government Grants Act 
became 'unavailable' solely by reason of the observations of 
the Privy Council and the Supreme Court. We have already 
pointed out that under the law as it stands at present, the 


95 

State is bound by any legislation, unless it is expressly or 
by necessary implication excluded from the operation of 
that statutes in relation to certain matters covered by that 
piece of legislation. In effect, the view of Natesan, J., 
would appear to be that the two decision, that of the Privy 
Council and of the Supreme Court, have virtually destroyed 
the basis of the Government Grants Act, and that in so far 
as transactions dealt with by that Act are concerned, the 
Government by reason of the provisions contained in that 
Act cannot claim immunity from the operation of any other 
statute. We are unable to agree in the view taken by our 
learned brother that the earlier decisions of this Court in 
Murugesa Gramani v. Province of Madras (1946) 2 M.L.J. 
171, Ullattuthedi Chovi v. Secretary of State for India 
(1921) 41 M.L.J. 494 and Kallingal Moosa Kutty v. The 
Secretary of Stale for India (1920) I.L.R. 43 Mad. 65 : 37 
M.L.J. 332, may not be good law after the decisions of the 
Judicial Committee and the Supreme Court cited above. 
Neither expressly nor by necessary implication does the 
Government Grants Act either stand repealed or has fallen 
into obsolescence. We hold that it is open to the State to 
put forward successfully the contention that the express 
stipulation found in the terms of the grant, such as that of 
the lessee should surrender possession after the expiry of 
the term of demise etc. can take effect, notwithstanding the 
provisions of the Madras Cultivating Tenants Protection 
Act. It is also our view that it is not necessary for the 
Madras City Tenants Protection Act to contain any 
provision excluding the State from its operation, for such 
an exclusion from the operation of any particular enactment 
may be found in a different enactment covering the same 
field. In so far as the Madras City Tenants Protection Act 
provides for the control over the eviction of cultivating 
tenants, though the relevant section excluding its operation 
in the case of lands belonging to certain specified bodies 
are concerned does not expressly refer to the exclusion of 
lands belonging to the State, the Government Grants Act 
confers that exclusion." 

(viii) Maharaj Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others, reported in 

(1977) 1 SCC 155 : 

"15. 
In the instant case the Act contemplates 
taking over of all zamindari rights as part of land reform. 


96 

However, instead of centralising management of all 
estates at State level, to stimulate local self-government, 
the Act gives an ena-bling power--not obligatory duty--to 
make over these estates to Gaon Sabhas which, so long as 
they are in their hands, will look after them through 
management committees which will be under the statutory 
control of Government under s.126. Apart from 
management, no. power is expressly vested in the Sabhas 
to dispose of the estates absolutely. The fact that as a 
body corporate it can own and sell property does not mean 
that the estates vested in a Sabha can be finally sold away, 
in the teeth of the provisions striking a contrary note. For, 
under s.117(6), if, for any reasons of better management 
or other, the State (Government is but the operational arm 
of the State and cannot, as contended, be delinked as a 
separate entity, in this context) the. State thinks fit to 
amend or cancel the earlier vesting declara-tion or 
notification, it can totally deprive the Sabha of, and 
resume from it, any estate. This plenary power to 
emasculate or extinguish the Sabha's right to the estate is 
tell-tale. True, this cut-back on the amplitude of the 
vesting is not an incident of the estate created but is 
provided for by the Act itself. Even so, we have to envi-
sion, in terms of realty law, what are the nature and inci-
dents of the interest vested in the Sabha--full ownership 
divestible under no circumstances or partial estate with 
the paramount interest still surviving in praesenti in the 
State ?" 

(ix) State of U.P. and another vs. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and 

another, reported in (1991) 4 SCC 139 : 

"38. The dispute is about levy of purchase tax on 
industrial alcohol. The High Court held that the State 
legislature was competent to enact a law imposing 
purchase tax on it in exercise of power under Entry 54 of 
List II. But it struck down the levy as it would disturb 
price structure regulated by Central Government. It was 
held that control of alcohol industry having been taken 
over by the Parliament, for purpose of regulation and 
development the State stood denud-ed of its taxing 
power under Entry 54 of List II to the extent the field of 
price fixation was covered by the price control order 
issued by the Government. And the purchase price being 


97 

component of price fixation which squarely fell within 
the power of Central Government the imposition of 
purchase tax amounted to intrusion into the forbidden 
area of price fixation by Central Government. Support 
for this was drawn, principally, from the two 
Constitution Bench decision in Indian Cement Ltd. v. 
State of Tamil Nadu, [1990] 1 SCC 12 and Synthetic and 
Chemicals v. State of U.P., [1990] 1 SCC 1091. The first 
was relied for the prin-ciple that even a taxing 
legislation by the State could be invalid to the extent it 
trenched on Central legislation on the same subject. And 
the latter for the conclusion that, 'however, sales tax 
cannot be charged on industrial alcohol in the present 
case, because under the Ethyl Alcohol (Price Control) 
Orders sales tax cannot be charged by the State on 
industrial alcohol'. Reliance on Indian Cement Ltd. 
(supra) was under complete misapprehension. The State 
in that case attempted to levy cess on royalty. It was held 
to be in-valid. To save it the State attempted to justify it 
as a tax in exercise of power under Entry 50 of List II. 
The submission was negatived as the legislative power 
of State under Entry 50 of List II was 'subject to any 
limitation imposed by the Parliament by law relating to 
mineral development'. The Bench held that in view of 
the Parliamentary legislation under Entry 54 of List 'I 
and the declaration made under Section 2 and provisions 
of Section 9 of the Act the State legislation was 
overridden to that extent. No such restriction or 
limitation is placed under Entry 54 of List II except that 
the exercise of power has been made subject to the 
provisions of Entry 92 of List I. " 

(x) Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Sun Engineering Works (P) Ltd.), 

reported in (1992) 4 SCC 363 : 

"39.... It is neither desirable nor permissible to pick 
out a word or a sentence from the judgment of this Court, 
divorced from the context of the question under 
consideration and treat it to be the complete 'law' declared 
by this Court. The judgment must be read as a whole and 
the observations from the judgment have to be considered 
in the light of the questions which were before this Court. 
A decision of this Court takes its colour from the questions 
involved in the case in which it is rendered and while 


98 

applying the decision to a later case, the courts must 
carefully try to ascertain the true principle laid down by the 
decision of this Court and not to pick out words or 
sentences from the judgment, divorced from the context of 
the questions under consideration by this Court, to support 
their reasonings. In Madhav Rao Jiwaji Rao Scindia 
Bahadur and Ors. v. Union of India this Court cautioned: 
"It is not proper to regard a word, a 
clause or a sentence occurring in a judgment 
of the Supreme Court, divorced from its 
context, as containing a full exposition of the 
law on a question when the question did not 
even fall to be answered in that judgment. ..." 

(xi) Committee of Management of Pachaiyappa's Trust vs. Official 

Trustee of Madras and another, reported in (1994) 1 SCC 475 : 

"31. The learned Single Judge was also not right in 
holding that the appellant has no locus standi in the matter. 
Apart from being a tenant on the ground floor of the 
building adjacent to the vacant plot of land the appellant 
trust, is also the residuary legatee under the will and has a 
beneficial interest in the trust property sought to be leased. 
The appellant was, therefore, entitled to raise objections 
regarding grant of lease in favour of Respondent 2 on the 
ground that the said lease was not in the interest of the 
trust property and the said objections could not be brushed 
aside on the view that the appellant had no locus standi." 

(xii) The Government Grants Act, 1895 : 

"Statement of Objects and Reasons : The Transfer of 
Property Act, 1882, Sections 10-12 invalidate with certain 
exceptions all conditions for the forfeiture of the transferred 
property on alienation by the transferree and all limitations 
over consequent upon any such alienation or any 
insolvency of or attempted alienation by him. The Crown is 
not specifically mentioned in the Act, and it may be 
assumed that it was not designed to impose fetters of this 
description upon the discretion of the Crown, especially as 
to the creation of inalienable jahgirs in grants made for 
public services; but it has been thought better to set the 
question at rest by express legislation. 

Upon a late occasion the Government of India were 


99 

advised that it is not competent for the Crown to create an 
inalienable and impartible estate in the land comprised in 
any 
Crown grant, unless such land has heretofore 
descended by custom as an impartible Raj. The second sub-
section of the Bill is intended to obviate this inconvenience 
by providing that all Crown grants are to be construed 
according to their tenor, notwithstanding any rule of law 
which might otherwise affect their operation." 

1. Title and extent : (1) This Act may be called The 
[Government] Grants Act, 1895. 
(2) It extends to the whole of India except [the 
territories which, immediately before the 1 st November, 
1956, were comprised in Part B States]." 

3. Government grants to take effect according to their 
tenor: 

All provisions, restrictions, conditions and 
limitations over contained in any such grant or transfer as 
aforesaid shall be valid and take effect according to their 
tenor, any rule of law, statute or enactment of the 
Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding. " 

(xiii) Anamallai Club vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and others, 

reported in (1997) 3 SCC 169 : 

"8. Law makes a distinction between persons in 
juridical possession and rank trespassers. Law respects 
possession even if there is no valid title to support it. Law 
does not permit any person to take law into his hands and 
to dispossess a person in actual possession without having 
recourse to a court. The object thereby is to encourage 
compliance of the rule of law and to deprive the person 
who wanted, a person in lawful possession to have his 
removed from possession, according to proper from and to 
prevent them from going with a high band and eject such 
person. Undoubtedly, the true owner is entitled to retain 
possession even though he had obtain it by force or by 
other unlawful means but that would not be a ground to 
permit the owner to take law into his own hands and eject 
the person in juridical possession or settled possession 
without recourse to law. 

9. 
Thus, it could be seen that even after 


100 

determination of the licence under the Government Grants 
Act, the Government is entitled resume possession but 
resumption of possession does not mean unilaterally taking 
the possession without recourse to law. The Eviction Act 
contemplates such a procedure. "Premises" defined under 
Section 3(d) of the Act means and land or any building or 
a part of a building or but and enclosed etc. Section 4 
prescribes procedure of issuance of a notice of show cause 
before eviction giving an opportunity and thereafter taking 
action under Section 5 of the Act. Unfortunately, on the 
facts of the case on hand, the respondent, has not adopted 
the procedure prescribed under Sections 4 and 5 of the 
Eviction Act after determination of the licence granted 
under the Government Grants Act. The High Court, 
therefore, was not right in its conclusion that the procedure 
prescribed under PPE Act is not applicable to the grants 
made under the Government Grants Act since the 
appellants remained in settled possession since a long time 
pursuant to the grant. After determination of the grant, 
though they have no right to remain in possession, the 
State cannot take unilateral possession without taking 
recourse to the procedure, provided under the Act. It is, 
therefore, clear that it would have been open to the 
respondent to have a notice issued to the appellant and 
give time to vacate the premises within 10 days or 15 days 
and, therefore, could leave resumed possession with 
minimal use of police force. We cannot give and direction 
in this case since possession was already resumed. We 
have directed not to create third party right in the property. 
We are not inclined to interfere with the order. 

10. Shri Sorabjee contended that the appellant is 
entitled to notice before the order of termination of grant 
made and so the action is bad in law and so the appellant is 
entitled to restitution of the property. We are not inclined 
to agree with him. The recourse to Article 226 of the 
Constitution, to establish title would not be proper remedy. 
In this case, we are not inclined to go into the question for 
the reason that the High Court has held that the writ 
petition is not maintainable. After termination of the 
licence by the Government under the Government Grants 
Act, the Estate Officer appointed under Section 3 cannot 
go into its correctness and adjudicate in the proceedings 
under Section 3 thereof. In our view, the Division Bench 
of the High Court is right in its finding. The Government 


101 

having determined the licence, the Estate Officer cannot go 
into the question of legality of the termination of the 
licence under the Crown (Government) Grants Act to take 
further steps under Section 4 and 5 of the Act. In that view 
of the situation in this case, we think that it is not 
necessary for the State Government to nominate the Estate 
Officer and for the Estate Officer to give notice under 
Sections 4 and 5. There is not need for State to file a suit 
for eviction. But notice in compliance of principles of 
natural justice should have been given giving reasonable 
time of 10 or 15 days to vacate the premises and to deliver 
vacant and peaceful possession; thereafter, the 
Government would be free to resume possession. Since 
possession was already taken, through we are not 
approving of the manner in which the same was taken, we 
do not think that in this matter notice afresh need be given 
to the appellant. It may be open to the appellant to avail of 
any remedy available in law." 

(xiv) Hajee S.V.M. Mohamed Jamaludeen Bros. & Co. vs. Government 

of Tamil Nadu, reported in (1997) 3 SCC 466 : 

"7. 
When a Letters Patent Appeal was preferred b 
the Government a division bench of the Madras High 
Court set aside the side decree and dismissed the suit 
holding that clause 7 of the agreement is valid and 
enforceable in view of the provisions in the grants act and 
hence appellant is not entitled to claim damages for the 
action resorted to by a government. 
8. 
If clause 7 of the agreement is valid it is 
binding on both the parties to the contract and the corollary 
is that government had the power to revoke it unilaterally 
and hence termination of the contract is not liable to be 
questioned by the other party. As the division bench 
upheld the validity of clause 7 only on account of its 
protection as per the Grants Act we are mainly called upon 
to decide whether the impugned clause in the agreement 
has the said protection. 

9. Section 2 of the Grants Act insulates all grants 
and all transfers of land or any interest therein made by the 
government from the checks of the provisions of Transfer 
of Property Act. Section 3 of the Grants act protects the 


102 

terms of such grant from the provisions of any other law. 
we extract the above two provision hereunder: 

"2. "Transfer of Property Act, 1882, not to 
apply to Government grants. -Nothing in the 
Transfer of Property Act, 1882, contained shall 
apply or be deemed ever to have applied to any 
grant or other transfer of land or of any interest 
therein heretofore made or hereafter to be made 
by or on behalf of, any person whomsoever; but 
every such grant and transfer shall be construed 
and take effect as if the said Act had not been 
passed." 

3-"Government grants to take effect 
according to their tenor:-All provisions, 
restrictions, conditions and limitations, contained 
in any such grant or transfer as aforesaid shall be 
valid and the effect according to their tenor any 
rule of law, statute or enactment of the contrary 
notwithstanding." 

10. The combined effect of the above two sections 
of the Grants Act is that terms of any grant of terms of any 
transfer of land made by a government would stand 
insulted from the tentacles of any statutory law. Section 3 
places the terms of such grant beyond the reach of any 
restrictive provision contained n any enacted law or even 
the equitable principles of justice equity and good 
conscience adumbrated by common law if such principles 
are inconsistent with such terms. The to provisions are so 
framed as to confer unfettered discretion on the 
government to enforce any condition or limitation or 
restriction in all types of grants made by the government to 
any person. In other words, the rights, privileges and 
obligations of any grantee of the government would be 
completely regulated by the terms of the grant, even if such 
terms are inconsistent with the provisions of any other law. 

11. The above legal position was recognised by the 
courts in India before the Constitution of India came into 
being. (Surja Kanta Roy Choudhury and others vs. 
Secretary of State, Air 1938 cal. 229, and Raza Husain 
Khan & ors. vs. Sayid Mohd. & ors. , AIR 1938 Oudh 
178). The position continued to be so even after the 
Constitution came into force [State of U.P. vs. Zahoor 
Ahmad, 1974 (1) SCR 344 ]. 


103 

12. An attempt was made to show that the 
transaction evidenced by the agreement was not a grant but 
a lease of land. Though it is not now open to the appellant 
to raise such contention (in view of the clear finding of the 
learned single judge that it was not a lease but only a 
licence coupled with interest, which finding was not 
challenged by the appellant before the division bench ) 
assuming the it was lease of land still appellant cannot 
succeed because lease made by the government is also 
covered by the protection envisaged in Section 2 and 3 of 
the Act." 

(xv) Suganthi Suresh Kumar vs. Jagdeeshan, reported in (2002) 2 

SCC 420 : 

"11. When this Court pronounced in Hari Singh v. 
Sukhbir Singh, (supra) that a court may enforce an order to 
pay compensation "by imposing a sentence in default" it is 
open to all courts in India to follow the said course. The said 
legal position would continue to hold good until it is 
overruled by larger Bench of this court. Hence learned single 
judge of High Court of Kerala has committed an impropriety 
by expressing that the said legal direction of this Court 
should not be followed by the subordinate courts in Kerala. 
We express our disapproval of the course adopted by the said 
judge in Rajendran v. Jose, (2001) 3 Kerala Law Times 431. 
It is unfortunate that when the Sessions judge has correctly 
done a course in accordance with the discipline the Single 
judge of the High Court has incorrectly reversed it." 

(xvi) Union of India and others vs. Kannadapara Sanghatanegala 

Okkuta & Kannadigara and others, reported in (2002) 10 SCC 226 : 

"5. We do not find any basis for the High Court coming 
to the conclusion that the decision of the Union Cabinet was 
vitiated on account of legal malafides. Merely because an 
administrative decision has been taken to locate the 
headquarters at Bangalore, which decision is subsequently 
altered by the same authority, namely, the Union Cabinet, 
cannot lead one to the conclusion that there has been legal 
mala fides. Why the headquarters should be at Hubli and 
not at Bangalore, is not for the court to decide. There are 


104 

various factors which have to be taken into consideration 
when a decision like this has to be arrived at. Assuming that 
the decision so taken is a political one, it cannot possibly 
give rise to a challenge on the ground of legal mala fides. A 
political decision, if taken by a competent authority in 
accordance with law, cannot per se be regarded as mala fide. 
In any case, there is nothing on the record to show that the 
present decision was motivated by political consideration. 
The observation of the High Court that there has been a 
change in the decision because there was a change of the 
Government and a different political party had come into 
power, is not supported by any basis. That the court will not 
interfere in questions of policy decision is clearly brought 
out by the following passage from a decision of this Court in 
Delhi Science Forum v. Union of India. ..." 

(xvii) Sharda Devi vs. State of Bihar and another, reported in (2003) 

3 SCC 128; 

"25. Keeping in view the principles laid down by 
this Court in Dr. G.H. Grant's case (supra) and analyzing 
in-depth the provisions of the Act the difference between 
reference under Section 18 and the one under Section 30 
can be summarized and set out as under:-
By reference to locus 
Under Section 18(1) a reference can be made by 
Collector only upon an application in writing having been 
made by (i) any person interested (ii) who has not accepted 
the award (iii) making application in writing, to the 
Collector, requiring a reference by the Collector to the 
Court (iv) for determination of any one of the four disputes 
(specified in the provision), and (v) stating the grounds on 
which objection to the award is taken. For reference under 
Section 30 no application in writing is required. The prayer 
may be made orally or in writing or the reference may be 
made suo motu by the Collector without any one having 
invited the attention of the Collector for making the 
reference. 

By reference to the disputes referable 

Under Section 18(1) there are four types of disputes 
which can be referred to Civil Court for determination. 
They are the disputes: (i) as to the measurement of the land, 
(ii) as to the amount of the compensation, (iii) as to the 
persons to whom the compensation is payable, or (d) as to 


105 

the apportionment of the compensation among the persons 
interested. Under Section 30 the only disputes which are 
referable are : (i) any dispute as to the apportionment of the 
amount of compensation or any part thereof, or (ii) a 
dispute as to the persons to whom the amount of 
compensation or any part thereof is payable. A dispute as to 
the measurement of the land or as to the quantum of 
compensation or a dispute of a nature not falling within 
Section 30, can neither be referred by the Collector under 
Section 30 of the Act nor would the Civil Court acquire 
jurisdiction to enter into and determine the same. 

By reference to nature of power 

Under Section 18 of the Act the Collector does not 
have power to withhold the reference. Once a written 
application has been made satisfying the requirements of 
Section 18, the Collector shall make a reference. The 
Collector has no discretion in the matter; whether the 
dispute has any merit or not is to be left for the 
determination of the Court. Under Section 30 the Collector 
may refer such dispute to the decision of the Court. The 
Collector has discretion in the matter. Looking to the nature 
of the dispute raised, the person who is raising the dispute, 
the delay in inviting the attention of the Court, and so on 
are such illustrative factors which may enter into the 
consideration by the Collector while exercising the 
discretion. If the Collector makes the reference it may be 
decided by the Court subject to its forming an opinion that 
the dispute was capable of reference and determination 
under Section 30 of the Act. In case the Collector refuses to 
make a reference under Section 30 of the Act, the person 
adversely affected by withholding of the reference or 
refusal to make the reference shall be at liberty to pursue 
such other remedy as may be available to him under the law 
such as filing a writ petition or a civil suit. 

By reference to limitation 

Under Section 18 the written application requiring 
the matter to be referred by the Collector for the 
determination of the Court shall be filed within six weeks 
from the date of the Collector's award if the person making 
it was present or represented before the Collector at the 
time when he made his award or within six weeks of the 
notice from the Collector under Section 12(2) or within six 
months from the date of the Collector's award, whichever 


106 

period shall first expire. There is no such limitation 
prescribed under Section 30 of the Act. The Collector may 
at any time, not bound by the period of limitation, exercise 
his power to make the reference. The expression 'the person 
present or represented' before the Collector at the time 
when he made his award would include within its meaning 
a person who shall be deemed to be present or represented 
before the Collector at the time when the award is made. 
No one can extend the period of limitation by taking 
advantage of his own wrong. Though no limitation is 
provided for making a reference under Section 30 of the 
Act, needless to say, where no period of limitation for 
exercise of any statutory power is prescribed the power can 
nevertheless be exercised only within a reasonable period; 
what is a reasonable period in a given case shall depend on 
the facts and circumstances of each case." 

(xviii) Federation of Railway Officers Association and others vs. Union 

of India, reported in (2003) 4 SCC 289 : 

"18. Even if we assume that there is force in the 
material placed by the petitioners that by forming new 
railway zones efficiency in the railway administration 
would not enhance, the reasons given by the Government 
and material placed by them in support of forming new 
railway zones is no less or even more forceful. Further, 
when technical questions arise and experts in the field have 
expressed various views and all those aspects have been 
taken into consideration by the Government, in deciding 
the matter, could it still be said that this Court should 
reexamine to interfere with the same. The wholesome rule 
in regard to judicial interference in administrative decisions 
is that if the Government takes into consideration all 
relevant factors, eschew from considering irrelevant factors 
and act reasonably within the parameters of the law, courts 
would keep off the same. Even on the test suggested by Dr. 
Pal we cannot travel outside this principle to sit in appeal 
on the decision of the Government. 
19. The decision in B.S.Muddappa's case is 
distinguishable both on principle and on facts from the 
present case. The question in that case is whether 'park' can 
be alloted to a trust for setting up of a private nursing 
home. There is no application of mind by any of the 


107 

authorities as to whether setting up a nursing home in place 
of a 'park' would amount to an improvement as 
contemplated under the statute with which this court was 
concerned in that case. In the present case, the problem is 
entirely different. The question before the Court is whether 
formation of zones is for efficient administration of 
Railways. On this aspect we have considered the rival 
contentions including the material placed before the 
Government of India and the criteria evolved for formation 
of the zones. The test whether such formation of zones is 
for the purpose of efficient administration of Railways have 
been duly considered by the Government before taking 
decision while such consideration was lacking in 
Muddappa's case. Hence, that decision cannot be of any 
assistance to appellant. We have applied the principles set 
out in other decisions relied upon by the appellant to the 
facts of the case in reaching our conclusion in this matter." 

(xix) Escorts Farms Ltd. vs. Commissioner, Kumaon Division, 

Nainital, U.P. And others, reported in (2004) 4 SCC 281 : 

"4. The lands were released to the ruler for its 
development and for making it cultivable within the 
prescribed period. The terms of the Govt. Grant are contained 
in letter dated 26.1.1950 of the Deputy Secretary to the Govt. 
of UP addressed to the Director of Colonization, Lucknow, 
U.P. Consequent to the release of the lands in favour of the 
ruler, no formal lease containing the terms and conditions of 
the Govt. Grant came to be executed between the erstwhile 
ruler and the Government of U.P. but it is not in dispute that 
the possession of the lands under the grant was taken on the 
basis of the proposal of the government, contained in the 
letter dated 29.8.1950. The rights and liabilities of the parties 
are governed by the terms of the said Govt. Grant. 

20. The Learned Counsel for the Farm contended that 
the land subjected to ceiling was held by the Company as a 
Govt. Grantee pursuant to the letter of the Deputy Secretary 
to the Govt. of U.P. dated 26.1.1950 referred above. The 
tenure holder of the land, therefore, within the meaning of the 
Ceiling Act was the Company i.e. the Govt. Grantee and all 
proceedings initiated by notice to the Farm, submission of 
statement and declaration by the Farm culminating in the 
orders passed by the prescribed authority and the appellate 


108 

authority were void and infructuous because the Govt. 
Grantee, as holder of the land, was not at all a party before 
the ceiling authority." 

(xx) Bajaj Hindustan Limited vs. Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises Limited and 

another, reported in (2011) 1 SCC 640 : 

"The lands were released to the ruler for its 
development and for making it cultivable within the 
prescribed period. The terms of the Govt. Grant are 
contained in letter dated 26.1.1950 of the Deputy Secretary 
to the Govt. of UP addressed to the Director of 
Colonization, Lucknow, U.P. Consequent to the release of 
the lands in favour of the ruler, no formal lease containing 
the terms and conditions of the Govt. Grant came to be 
executed between the erstwhile ruler and the Government 
of U.P. but it is not in dispute that the possession of the 
lands under the grant was taken on the basis of the proposal 
of the government, contained in the letter dated 29.8.1950. 
The rights and liabilities of the parties are governed by the 
terms of the said Govt. Grant. 

(xxi) Pradeep Oil Corporation vs. Municipal Corporation of Delhi and 

another, reported in (2011) 5 SCC 270 : 

"45. By reason of the agreement in question, the 
buildings in question do not belong to the Administration. 
Admittedly, it belongs to the grantee i.e. appellant herein. 
As discussed hereinbefore, the Oil tanks has been 
construed as buildings for the purposes of tax. Therefore, 
Section 119 of the MCD Act would not apply to the 
building in question. That being the case, the 
grantee/appellant is liable to pay tax although the 
ownership of the land may belong to the Administration. 

46. Section 115 of the MCD Act clearly 
provides that the general tax shall be payable in respect of 
lands and buildings. Such lands and buildings may be in 
lawful occupation of the owner. The occupation of the said 
building may be lawful or unlawful. Even in a case where 
apartments are constructed on the land belonging to the 
Government or a statutory body but the occupier of the 
apartment is liable to pay tax. If a person encroaches upon 


109 

somebody's lands and constructs buildings thereupon, he 
would also be liable to pay tax. Once it is held that the 
grantee were liable to pay tax, the same becomes payable 
from the date of accrual of the liability. The said position is 
also fortified from specific stipulation in the agreement that 
the liability to pay all taxes including municipal taxes is on 
the grantee. 
47. The learned counsel for the appellant has placed 
strong reliance on the decision of this Court in HUDCO v. 
MCD; (2001) 1 SCC 455 to contend that land belonging to 
the government is immune from the payment of property 
tax by virtue of section 119(1) of the DMC Act and Article 
285 of the Constitution of India. In the HUDCOs case 
vacant land of the government, prior to execution of the 
lease deed in favour of HUDCO, was sought to be taxed 
and that no building had been constructed by HUDCO. 
HUDCOs own case was that interest in land could pass 
only on execution of lease and construction thereon under 
section 120(2) of the MCD Act. MCD had invoked Section 
120(1) DMC Act to fasten liability on HUDCO and not 
under Section 120(2) DMC Act after construction was 
made by HUDCO and lease deed executed bythe 
government. In that case, this Court has held that vacant 
land belonging to the Government was not taxable by 
virtue of section 119 DMC Act and Article 285 of the 
Constitution of India. However, in our considered view, the 
case at hand is totally different. The HUDCO judgment 
dealt with the case where vacant land belonging to the 
lessor/Government and in regard whereto no lease deed had 
been executed and no construction had been made by the 
lessee/HUDCO. The land belonging to the central 
government was sought to be taxed under Section 120(1) of 
the DMC Act which fastens liability on the lessor. Since 
land belonged to UOI the same was exempted from 
payment of tax until the lease deed was executed and 
construction made thereon by HUDCO-under Section 
120(2). 

48. Incidence to pay tax under section 120(2) DMC 
Act is with regard to a composite assessment of land and 
buildings as section 120(2) talks of a composite assessment 
only. In the present case vacant land or property of 
Railways is not sought to be taxed as was in the case of 
HUDCO Vs. MCD under section 120(1) DMC Act, but 
property tax/Composite Assessment is sought to be made 


110 

on the installations/stotage depots having been constructed 
by the appellant-by virtue of Section 120(2) DMC Act. It is 
important to notice that w.e.f. the date of execution of lease 
deed and construction made thereon by HUDCO, HUDCO 
has been paying the property tax. HUDCOs case is 
therefore not applicable." 

(xxii) Government of Tamil Nadu vs. Mecca Prime Tannery and others, 

reported in (2012) 6 MLJ 273 : 

"27. The Supreme Court in the case of Fruit & 
Vegetable Merchants Union vs. Delhi Improvement Trust 
reported in A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 344, thoroughly discussed the 
meaning of the word vest while interpreting different 
provisions of the U.P. Town Improvement Act, 1819. Their 
lordships first quoted the following passage of the 
observations made by Lord Cranworth in Richardson vs. 
Robertson, (1862) 6 L.T. 75 :-14. ... the word 'vest' is a 
word, at least of ambiguous import. Prima facie 'vesting ' in 
possession is the more natural meaning. The expressions 
'investiture' -'clothing' and whatever else be the explanation 
as to the origin of the word, point prima facie rather to the 
enjoyment than to the obtaining of a right. But I am willing 
to accede to the argument that was pressed at the bar, that by 
long usage ' vesting' ordinarily means the having obtained 
an absolute and indefeasible right, as contra-distinguished 
from the not having so obtained it. But it cannot be disputed 
that the word 'vesting' may mean, and often does mean, that 
which is its primary etymological signification, namely, 
vesting in possession. 
Their lordships of the Supreme Court then observed 
as follows :-

19. That the word "vest" is a word of variable import 
is shown by provisions of Indian statutes also. For example, 
s.56 of the Provincial Insolvency Act (V of 1920) empowers 
the court at the time of the making of the order of 
adjudication or thereafter to appoint a receiver for the 
property of the insolvent and further provides that " such 
property shall thereupon vest in the receiver." The property 
vests in the receiver for the purpose of administering the 
estate of the insolvent for the payment of his debts after 
realizing his assets. The property of the insolvent vests in 
the receiver not for all purposes but only for the purpose of 


111 

the Insolvency Act and the receiver has no interest of his 
own in the property. On the other hand, ss. 16 and 17 of the 
Land Acquisition Act. (Act I of 1894), provide that the 
property so acquired, upon the happening of certain events, 
shall" vest absolutely in the Government free from all 
encumbrances'. In the cases contemplated by ss.16 and 17 
the property acquired becomes. the property of Government 
without any conditions or limitations either as to title or 
possession. The legislature has made it clear that the vesting 
of the property is not for any limited purpose or limited 
duration. It would thus appear that the word "vest" has not 
got a fixed connotation, meaning in all cases that the 
property is owned by the person or the authority in whom it 
vests. It may vest in title, or it may vest in possession, or it 
may vest in a limited sense, as indicated in the context in 
which it may have been used in a particular piece of 
legislation. The provisions of the Improvement Act, 
particularly ss.45 to 49 and 54 and 54A when they speak of 
a certain building or street or square or other land vesting in 
a municipality or other local body or in a trust, do not 
necessarily mean that ownership has passed to any of them." 

(xxiii) Azim Ahmad Kazmi and others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and 

another, reported in (2012) 7 SCC 278 : 

"27. For taking possession, the State Government is 
required to follow the law, if any, prescribed. In the absence of 
any specific law, the State Government may take possession by 
filing a suit. 
28. Under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 
1894, if the State Government decides to acquire the property 
in accordance with the provisions of the said Act, no separate 
proceedings have to be taken for getting possession of the land. 
It may even invoke the urgency provisions contained in 
Section 17 of the said Act and the Collector may take 
possession of the land immediately after the publication of the 
notice under Section 9. In such a case, the person in 
possession of the land acquired would be dispossessed 
forthwith. 
29. However, if the Government proceeds under the 
terms of the Government Grants Act, 1895 then what 
procedure is to be followed. Section 3 of the Government 
Grants Act, 1895, stipulates that the lease made by or on behalf 
of the Government is to take effect according to their tenor -


112 

All provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations 
contained in any such creation, conferment or grant referred to 
in Section 2, shall be valid and take effect according to their 
tenor; any decree or direction of a court of law or any rule of 
law, statute or enactments of the legislature, to the contrary." 

19. We have gone through the records; the order impugned and also 

the relevant laws. 

20. To begin with, the Government of Tamil Nadu, vide 

G.O.Ms.Nos.812, Revenue, dated 22.11.1888, and 763, Revenue, dated 

09.12.1898, assigned the lands to Raja Sir Savalai Ramasamy Mudaliar in 

T.S.No.41 to an extent of 1 Cawnie 10 Grounds and 1871 Sq.ft., and 

T.S.No.43/2 to an extent of 5 Grounds and 275 Sq.ft., Vepery Village, Fort-

Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai District, for construction of a choultry, subject to 

the conditions that (i) the choultry shall be available for free use of railway 

travellers and it shall be kept in repair; (ii) the plans of the building shall be 

approved by Government and (iii) the land shall be liable for resumption, 

without compensation, if it ceases to be employed for the purpose for which it 

is granted or is used for any other purposes, without the permission of 

Government. 

21. Following the allegations of misappropriation of funds and 

mismanagement of the choultry, this Court passed a scheme decree on 

18.08.1970 in C.S.No.90 of 1963, by removing the then existing hereditary 

Trustee and appointing the Administrator General and Official Trustee (AGOT) 

for the management of the property. Pursuant thereto, the High Power 


113 

Committee for Chennai Metro Rail Project, chaired by the Chief Secretary, in 

the meeting held on 09.12.2009, identified the lands assigned to Sir Ramasamy 

Mudaliar Choultry, namely, the subject lands, and directed the Chennai Metro 

Rail Limited and the Revenue Department to take appropriate action for 

allocation of the lands well before the construction of Metro Station is taken up. 

Thereafter, the District Collector, Chennai, and the Principal Secretary and 

Commissioner of Land Administration sent reports to Government, on non-

functioning of choultry and the commercial exploitation of land/buiildings such 

as hotels and travel agencies, which was a violation of the conditions imposed 

by the Government at the time of granting of lands to the choultry. Based on 

the said reports of the District Collector and the Principal Secretary and 

Commissioner of Land Administiration and also considering the requirement of 

the land for implementation of Chennai Metro Rail Project, orders were issued 

by the Government vide G.O.Ms.No.168, Revenue, dated 21.05.2012, for 

resumption of lands in Block No.7 of T.S.Nos.41 and 43/2, for violation of 

conditions of grant and alienation to Chennai Metro Rail Limited. Challenging 

the said G.O.Ms.No.168, dated 21.05.2012, and notice of eviction, some of the 

lessees/tenants/occupants moved this Court by filing a batch of 21 writ 

petitions in W.P.No.19469 of 2012. The said writ petitions were allowed and 

G.O.Ms.No.168 was set aside by a learned single Judge of this Court vide his 

order, dated 26.11.2012, and the matter was remitted to the Government to 

issue notice to AGOT, Co-Trustee, CMRL and writ petitioners, who were in 


114 

possession of the land/building, consider the objections to be filed, give them 

an opportunity of hearing and, thereafter, to pass fresh orders as expeditiously 

as possible. 

22. The Government, considering that if notices were to be issued afresh 

and further action taken on getting replies, it would further delay the matter 

apart from paving way to further legal proceedings from the beginning and 

issue of fresh notices also would not yield any new outcome, thought it fit to 

file appeals against the order of the learned single Judge in the writ petitions. 

Accordingly, based on the directions of the Government, the District Collector, 

Chennai, filed Writ Appeals in W.A.Nos.68 to 88 of 2013 before a Division 

Bench of this Court against the orders passed by the learned single Judge. 

Chennai Metro Rail Limited also filed Writ Appeals in W.A.Nos.89 to 106 of 

2013. In the above Writ Appeals, the Division Bench passed a common 

judgment on 12.07.2013, by allowing W.A.Nos.70 to 88 of 2013 filed by the 

Government and 91 to 106 of 2013 filed by CMRL pertaining to the lands in 

T.S.No.41 and dismissing W.A.Nos.68 and 69 of 2013, filed by the 

Government, and 89 and 90 of 2013, filed by CMRL, in respect of the lands in 

T.S.No.43/2. 

23. As against the judgment passed by the Division Bench, dated 

12.07.2013, the aggrieved parties in respect of the lands in T.S.No.41 have filed 

S.L.P.Nos.23081 to 23084 of 2013, which were numbered as Civil Appeal 

Nos.6065 to 6068 of 2013, before the Supreme Court, which, by its order, dated 


115 

25.07.2013, directed the State Government to issue notices to all the lease 

holders concerned on or before 05.08.2013. The appellants therein were 

permitted to respond to the said notices on or before 16.08.2013. The 

determination thereon, one way or the other, was directed to be rendered by the 

appropriate authority within one week thereafter. In case any of the appellants 

were to be adversely affected, a well reasoned speaking order was directed to 

be passed, taking into consideration all the issues canvassed in response to the 

show cause notices. Likewise, the appellants were given liberty to obtain the 

final orders passed in the matter on or after 30.09.2013 from the office of the 

concerned District Collector, Chennai. 

24. As per the directions of the Supreme Court of India, notices were 

issued to AGOT, Co-Trustee and 44 lessees/tenants/occupants by the District 

Collector, Chennai, on 01.08.2013 and the AGOT, Co-Trustee and 17 

lessees/tenants/occupants have furnished their replies before the due tate i.e., 

16.08.2013. The District Collector, Chennai, has complied with all the 

directions of the Supreme Court viz., issuing notice, getting replies, examining 

with reference to legal position and sent her compliance report to the 

Government through the Principal Secretary and Commissioner of Land 

Administration with a request to pass orders for resumption of land in 

T.S.No.41. The Principal Secretary and Commissioner of Land Administration 

has endorsed the report of the District Collector, Chennai. 

25. Based on the records available, legal position, relevant rules and 


116 

regulations, the Government has examined the proposal of the District 

Collector and the Principal Secretary and Commissioner of Land 

Administration; considered the objections raised by AGOT, Co-Trustee, 

lessees/tenants/occupants in depth vide the annexure; and decided to accept the 

proposal for resumption of land and alienation to Chennai Metro Rail Limited. 

Accordingly, the Government passed G.O.Ms.No.380, Revenue [LD1(1)] 

Department, dated 28.09.2013, which was impugned in the writ petitions filed 

before the learned single Judge, against whose order these Writ Appeals are 

filed. By the said G.O., the District Collector was directed to take necessary 

immediate follow-up action for resumption of the land in T.S.No.41, Block 

No.7, Vepery Village, Fort-Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai District, and to send an 

action taken report in that regard to the Government at an early date. Following 

the same, the District Collector, Chennai, by his orders, dated 30.09.2013, 

directed the appellants to vacate the land and hand over possession of the 

premises to the Tahsildar, Fort-Tondiarpet Taluk, Chennai, which orders also 

were a part of impugnation in the writ petitions. 

26. At this point, we feel it relevant to refer to the provisions of law, 

relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellants. The said 

provisions are : (1) Article 300-A of the Constitution of India; (2) Sections 

10,25 and 29 of the Official Trustees Act,1913, and (3) Section 3 of the 

Government Grants Act,1895, which read as under: 

(1) Article 300-A:-Persons not to be deprived of 


117 

property save by authority of law :-No person shall be 

deprived of his property save by authrity of law. 

(2) Sections 10,25 and 29 of the Official Trustees Act,1913: 

Section 10 : 

10. Power of High Court to appoint Official Trustee to 
be Trustee of property.-(1) If any property is subject to a 
Trust other than a Trust which the Official Trustee is 
prohibited from accepting under the provisions of this Act, 
and there is no Trustee within the local limits of the ordinary 
or extraordinary original civil jurisdiction of the High Court 
willing or capable to act in the Trust, the High Court may on 
application make an order or the appointment of the Official 
Trustee by that name with his consent to be the Trustee of 
such property. 
(2) Upon such order such property shall vest in the 
Official Trustee and shall be held by him upon the same 
Trusts as the same was held previously to such order, and the 
same Trusts as the same was held previously to such order, 
and the previous Trustee or Trustees (if any) shall be exempt 
from the liability as Trustees of such property save in respect 
of acts done before the date of such order. 

(3) Nothing in this section shall, be deemed to affect 
the provisions of the Indian Trust Act, 1882 (2 of 1882). 

Section 25 : 
25. Power of High Court to make orders in respect of 
property vested in Official Trustee.-The High Court may 
make such orders as it thinks fit respecting any Trust property 
vested in the Official Trustee, or the income or produce 
thereof. 
Section 29 : 
29. Transfer of Trust property by Official Trustee to 
original Trustee or any other Trustee.-(1) Nothing in this 
Act shall be deemed to prevent the transfer by the Official 
Trustee of any property vested in him to-
(a) the original Trustee (if any); or 
(b) any other lawfully appointed Trustee; or 
(c) any other person if the Court so directs. 
(2) Upon such transfer such property shall vest in such 
Trustee, and shall be held by him upon the same Trusts as 


118 

those upon which it was held prior to such transfer, and the 
Official Trustee shall be exempt from all liability as 
Trustee of such property except in respect of acts done 
before such transfer: 
Provided that, in the case of any transfer under this section, 
the Official Trustee shall be entitled to retain out of the 
property any fees leviable in accordance with the 
provisions of this Act. 

(3) Section 3 of the Government Grants Act :-

3. Government grants to take effect according to their 
tenor.-All provisions, restrictions, conditions and 
limitations over contained in any such grant or transfer as 
aforesaid shall be valid and take effect according to their 
tenor, any rule of law, statute or enactment of the 
Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding. 

Scope of applicability of Article 300-A to a property belonging to the State 
: 

27. As per Article 300-A of the Constitution, no person shall be deprived 

of his property except by authority of law. In this case, the property in question 

is the property of the Government and not the self-acquired property of the 

appellants. Instead, it was given on lease for Choultry, which, in turn, was sub-

leased or sub-let to the appellants by AGOT. 

28. Though the intention of the Parliament was to do away with the 

fundamental right to acquire, hold and dispose of the property as evident from 

the history of various constitutional amendments and judicial pronouncements, 

the question that arises for consideration is whether the principles of eminent 

domain are completely obliterated when a person is deprived of his property by 

the authority of law under Article 300-A of the Constitution. Deprivation of 


119 

property, under Article 300, must take place for a public purpose or public 

interest. The concept of eminent domain which applies when a person is 

deprived of his property postulates that the purpose must be primarily public 

and not primarily of private interest and merely incidentally beneficial to the 

public. Any law, which deprives a person of his private property for private 

interest, will be unlawful and unfair and undermines the rule of law and can be 

subjected to judicial review. But the question as to whether the purpose is 

primarily public or private, has to be decided by the legislature, which of course 

should be made known. 

29. Requirement of public purpose is invariably the rule for depriving a 

person of his property and any violation of it is amenable to judicial review. 

Payment of compensation amount is a constitutional requirement under Article 

30(1A) and under the 2nd proviso to Article 31A(1), unlike Article 300A. 

After the 44th Amendment Act, 1978, the constitutional obligation to pay 

compensation to a person who is deprived of his property primarily depends 

upon the terms of the statute and the legislative policy. Requirement of public 

purpose, for deprivation of a person of his property under Article 300-A, is a 

pre-condition, but no compensation or nil compensation or its illusiveness has 

to be justified by the State on judicially justiciable standards. Measures 

designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for lesser compensation and 

such a limitation by itself will not make legislation invalid or unconstitutional 


120 

or confiscatory. In other words, the right to claim compensation or the 

obligation to pay, though not expressly included in Article 300-A, it can be 

inferred in that Article and it is for the State to justify its stand on justifiable 

grounds which may depend upon the legislative policy, object and purpose of 

the statute and a host of other factors. 

Doctrine of Sub-silentio : 

30. It is contended that pronouncements of law which are not part of the 

ratio decidendi and are not authoritative and the same are delivered without 

reference to the relevant provisions of the Act and decisions which are not 

express and not founded on reasons nor they proceed on consideration of issue 

cannot be deemed to be a law declared to have a binding effect as is 

contemplated by Article 141. Therefore, this Court is not precluded from 

considering the relevant provisions of law to the facts of this case. 

31. The Theory 'Salmond on Jurisprudence' explains that a decision 

passes sub silentio, in the technical sense that has come to be attached to that 

phrase, when the particular point of law involved in the decision is not 

perceived by the court or present to its mind. The Court may consciously 

decide in favour of one party because of Point A, which it considers and 

pronounces upon. It may be shown, however, that logically the court should 

not have decided in favour of the particular party unless it also decided point B 

in his favour; but point B was not argued or considered by the court. In such 


121 

circumstances, although point B was logically involved in the facts and 

although the case had a specific outcome, the decision is not an authority on 

point B. Point B is said to pass sub silentio. 

32. In this case, the appellants have taken a stand that both the Survey 

Numbers in S.No.43/2 and T.S.No.41 are identical. Though the said property 

in the Survey numbers could be viewed in a different angle from that of other 

Survey numbers, in which matter, the Apex Court has taken a view and laid 

down a ratio that the course adopted by the respondents in resuming the land 

for public purpose would be valid even assuming that this matter requires 

examination, this Court is not the proper forum to examine the position, in 

view of the questions raised and considered by the Supreme Court and even for 

a new proposition of law. 

33. It is for the Apex Court to look into the same as to the principle that a 

decision should be treated as given per incuriam when it is given in ignorance 

of the terms of a statute or of a rule having the force of a statute. So far as the 

order shows, no argument was addressed to the Court on the question or not 

whether any direction could properly be made compelling the concerned 

authority. It may not be proper for this Court to examine this position, as the 

ratio of that case in a given circumstance could be the law laid down under 

Article 141 of the Constitution. Therefore, it is for the parties to raise the same 

before the appropriate forum, as the ratio laid down under Article 141 of the 

Constitution has binding effect and will be the force of law. 


122 

34. A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in a recent decision in 

the case of K.T.Plantation Private Limited v. State of Karnataka, (2011) 9 SCC 

1, while dealing with the power of Government to withdraw exemption granted 

in certain lands, has extensively discussed the scope of Article 300-A and to 

what extent, it could be applied to the said property. In the said case, the Apex 

Court, while asserting the importance of the law providing for deprivation of 

property and where such law is unjust on account of payment of nil 

compensation, had authoritatively held that Article 300-A enables the State to 

put restriction on the right to property by a law that law, so as to be sustainable, 

must comply with other provisions of the Constitution. The limitation or 

restriction should not be arbitrary or excessive or what is beyond required in 

public interest and such limitation must not be disproportionate to the 

Constitution. The legislation providing for deprivation of the property under 

Article 300-A must be just and reasonable, as understood in terms of Articles 

14, 19(1)(g), 26(b), 301 etc. The Court will have to examine the scheme of the 

impugned Act, its object, purpose as also the question whether payment of nil 

compensation or nominal compensation would make the impugned law unjust, 

unfair and unreasonable. It was further held therein that the rule of law, as a 

principle, contains not explicit components like eminent domain, but has many 

shades and colours. 

35. Adverting to the provisions of the Official Trustees Act, 1913, as per 


123 

Section 10, this Court, following the irregularities by the Trust, on application, 

appointed AGOT to manage the property and also passed a scheme decree 

under Section 25 with regard to the Trust property vested in the Official 

Trustee, the income and the produce thereof. Section 29 provides for transfer of 

Trust property by Official Trustee to original Trustee or any other Trustee or to 

any other person if the Court so directs. 

36. Section 3 of the Government Grants Act is categorical that all 

provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations contained in any grant or 

transfer shall be valid and take effect according to their tenor, despite there 

being any rule of law, statute or enactment of the Legislature to the contrary. 

37. In this context, it is indispensable to refer to Basic Structure of the 

Constitution of India, in brief, whereupon the entire case on hand dwells. 

Basic Structure of the Constitution of India :-

38. Constitution of India is the creation of a constituent act and is an 

extra-ordinary legislation derived direct from the people and acting in their 

sovereign capacity for setting up the structure of the Government. 

39. Constitution is a set of laws and rules setting up machinery of the 

Government of a State which defines and determines the relation between the 

different institutions and areas of Government, the executive, legislature and 

the judiciary, the central, the State and the local government. A Constitution is 

a source of jurisprudential fountain head from which other laws must flow and 

it must grow with the growth of the nation with the philosophical and cultural 


124 

advancement of the people who gave birth to it. The Constitution of India is 

one such document which is the longest of its kind representing the political, 

economic and social ideals and aspirations of the vast majority of Indian 

people. The ideals intended to be achieved by the provisions of the 

Constitution were preceded by immense sacrifices and the Constitution could 

not be a source for the destruction of these ideals. It is a constituted document 

keeping with modern constitutional practice, and fundamental to the 

governance of the country. The people of India have provided a constitutional 

polity consisting of certain primary organs, institutions and functionaries to 

exercise the powers provided in the Constitution. All powers belong to the 

people are entrusted by them to specified institutions and functionaries. This is 

enshrined in our Preamble with a statement of the Constitution. 

40. Except the Indian Constitution, no other Constitution in the world 

combines under its wings such diverse peoples with different nations, religious, 

culture and in different stages of economic development into one nation and no 

other nation is faced with such vast socio-economic problems. It is a noble and 

grand vision carried out in part by conferring fundamental rights on the people. 

Legislature, Executive and Judiciary have been created and constituted to serve 

the people. The commitment of the Constitution to the social revolution 

through rule of law lies in the effectuation of the fundamental rights and 

directive principles as supplementary and complimentary to each other. We can 

say that the preamble, fundamental rights and directive principles of State 


125 

policy -the Trinity -are the conscience of the Constitution. 

41. The Constitution of India, having solemn principle and concept, 

underlined the Preamble as follows : 

"WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute 

India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC 

REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens : 

JUSTICE -social, economic and political ; 

LIBERTY -of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship ; 

EQUALITY -of status and of opportunity ; 

and to promote among them all 

FRATERNITY -assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and 

integrity of the Nation ; 

IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of 

November,1949, do HEREBY, ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO 

OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION. 

42. The Preamble to the Constitution forms an important part with the 

hopes and aspirations of the people of India made on the day when this nation 

has become republic. The solemn promise is not only to themselves, but also to 

the coming generations and posterity. The Indian Republic was envisaged in 

the Preamble as a form of Government of the people, for the people and by the 

people through their freely elected representatives and thereby found necessary 


126 

to qualify the sovereignty of the Republic by using the word 'Democratic', 

which was made explicit by emphasising "liberty of thought, expression, belief, 

faith and worship and equality of status and of opportunity", which means, an 

independent sovereign State may well become a people's Government. 

Similarly, the dignity of the individual in the Preamble to the Constitution 

emphases the positive aspect, which signifies the word of moral and spiritual 

import. It implied an obligation on the part of the Union to respect the 

personality of the citizen and to create conditions in which every citizen would 

be left free to find individual self-fulfilment. 

43. No reading of any Constitution can be complete without reading it 

from the beginning to the end. While the end may expand, or alter, the point of 

commencement can never change. It is the Preamble wherefrom the 

Constitution commences. Hence, the significance of the Preamble. 

44. It is no exaggeration to say that the Preamble to the Constitution of 

India is its spirit and backbone. The Preamble pervades through and inspires all 

the provisions of the Constitution. It is also the quintessence of the 

Constitution. Ever since the day it was adopted by the Constituent Assembly, it 

has enabled the Constitution to stand erect -neither bending nor breaking. 

45. The significance of the Preamble is that it contains the fundamentals 

of our Constitution. The people of India resolved to constitute their country 


127 

into a sovereign democratic republic. No one can suggest that the words and 

expressions in the Preamble are ambiguous in any manner. By their true import 

and connotation, it is well known that no question of any ambiguity is involved. 

46. The objectives specified in the Preamble contain the basic structure 

of our Constitution, which cannot be amended in exercise of the power under 

Article 368 of the Constitution. The concept relating to "separation of powers 

among the legislature, the executive and the judiciary" and the fundamental 

concept of an independent judiciary are now elevated to the level of basic 

structure of the Constitution and are the very heart of the constitutional scheme. 

47. Basic Structure of the Constitution of India consists of the following 

features: 

(1) Supremacy of the Constitution; 

(2) Republican and Democratic form of Government; 

(3) Secular character of the Constitution; 

(4) Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the 
judiciary; 

(5) Federal character of the Constitution. 

(6) Independence of the Judiciary. 

Separation of Powers : 

48. Of the above basic features, if we see Separation of Powers, the 


128 

Constitution of India provides for governance of the country by its three 

essential pillars viz., Legislature, Executive and Judiciary. The principle 

'Separation of Powers' deals with the mutual relations among the said three 

organs of the Government. The doctrine of separation of powers has no place in 

strict sense in Indian Constitution, but the functions of different organs of the 

Government have been sufficiently differentiated, so that one organ of the 

Government could not usurp the functions of another. 

49. In Indian Constitution, there is express provision that "Executive 

power of the Union shall be vested in the President and the executive power of 

the State shall be vested in the Governor..." (Article 154(1) of the Indian 

Constitution). But, there is no express provision that legislative and judicial 

powers shall be vested in any person or organ. 

50. It is now to be seen, what is the real position in India, regarding 

Separation of Powers ? 

51. President, being the executive head, is also empowered to exercise 

legislative powers. In his legislative capacity, he may promulgate Ordinances 

in order to meet the situation, as Article 123 (1) says -"If, at any time, except 

when both Houses of Parliament are in Session, President is satisfied that 

circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action, 

he may promulgate such Ordinances as the circumstances appear to him to 


129 

require." When proclamation of emergency has been declared by the President 

due to failure of Constitutional machinery, the President has been given 

legislative power under Article 357 of our Constitution to make any law in 

order to meet the situations. A power has also been conferred on the President 

of India under Articles 372 and 372-A to adopt any law in the country by 

making such adaptations and modifications whether by way of repeal or 

amendment as may be necessary or expedient and to provide that the law so 

adapted or modified shall have effect subject to adaptation and modifications so 

made and the adaptation and modifications shall not be questioned. 

52. The President of India also exercises judicial function, as Article 103 

of the Constitution empowers the President to decide cases of disqualification 

of membership of the Houses of Parliament. According to this Article, if any 

question arises as to whether a member of either House of Parliament has 

become subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in clause (1) of 

Article 102, the question shall be referred for the decision of the President and 

his decision shall be final. Article 50 lays emphasis to separate judiciary from 

executive. But, in practice, we find that the executive also exercises the powers 

of judicial function as in appointment of Judges (Articles 124, 126 and 127). 

The legislature (either House of Parliament) also exercises judicial function in 

removal of President (Article 56) in the prescribed manner. Judiciary also 

exercises legislative power. High Court and Supreme Court are empowered to 


130 

make certain rules, legislative in character. Whenever High Court or the 

Supreme Court finds a certain provision of law against the Constitution or 

public policy, it declares the same null and void and then amendments may be 

incorporated in the legal system. Sometimes, High Court and Supreme Court 

formulate the principles on the point where law is silent. This power is also 

legislative in character. 

53. Apart from this, when Judges establish a new principle by means of a 

judicial decision, they may be said to exercise legislative and not merely 

judicial power. The High Courts, in certain spheres, perform functions which 

are administrative rather than judicial. Their power of supervision over 

subordinate courts is more of administrative nature rather than judicial (Article 

227). Under Article 228, they have power to effect transfer of cases. 

54. In strict sense, the powers of one organ of democracy should not be 

usurped by another organ, thereby maintaining the decorum of three pillars of 

democracy. 

Separation of Powers vis-a-vis Judicial Pronouncements : 

55. The following cases explain the real position of doctrine of 

separation of powers, prevailing in our country : 

55.1. In re Delhi Laws Act case, AIR 1951 SC 332, the then Hon'ble 

Chief Justice Kania observed : 

"Although in the Constitution of India there is 
no express separation of powers, it is clear that a 


131 

legislature is created by the Constitution and detailed 
provisions are made for making that legislature pass 
laws. Is it then too much to say that under the 
Constitution the duty to make laws, the duty to 
exercise its own wisdom, judgment and patriotism in 
making law is primarily cast on the legislature? Does 
it not imply that unless it can be gathered from other 
provisions of the Constitution, other bodies, 
executive or judicial, are not intended to discharge 
legislative functions ?" 

55.2. To the same effect, another case is Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya v. State 

of Punjab, AIR 1955 SC 549, in which the then Hon'ble Chief Justice 

B.K.Mukherjea observed : 

"The Indian Constitution has not indeed 
recognised the doctrine of separation of powers 
in the absolute rigidity but the functions of the 
different parts or branches of the Government 
have been sufficiently differentiated and 
consequently it can very well be said that our 
Constitution does not contemplate assumption, 
by one organ or part of the State, of functions 
that essentially belong to another." 

55.3. In Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice Tendolkar, AIR 1958 SC 538, 

the then Hon'ble Chief Justice S.R.Das opined that in the absence of specific 

provision for separation of powers in our Constitution, such as there is under 

the American Constitution, some such division of powers legislative, executive 

and judicial, is nevertheless implicit in our Constitution. Same view was 

expressed in Jayanti Lal Amrit Lal v. S.N.Rana, AIR 1964 SC 648. 

55.4. Judiciary is independent and a separate wing of the Government. 

Executive or Legislature has no concern with the day to day functioning of the 


132 

Judiciary. In Chandra Mohan v. State of U.P., AIR 1966 SC 1987, Supreme 

Court held : 

"The Indian Constitution, though it does not 
accept the strict doctrine of separation of powers, 
provides for an independent judiciary in the States.... 
But, at the time the Constitution was made in most of 
the States the magistracy was under the direct control 
of the executive. Indeed, it is common knowledge 
that in pre-independence India, there was a strong 
agitation that the judiciary should be separated from 
the executive and that the agitation was based upon 
the assumption that unless they were separated, the 
independence of the judiciary at the lower levels 
would be a mockery." 

55.5. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, AIR 1973 SC 1461, the 
then Hon'be Chief Justice Sikri observed : 

"Separation of powers between the legislature, the 
executive and the judiciary is a part of the basic structure 
of the Constitution; this structure cannot be destroyed by 
any form of amendment." 

55.6. In Smt.Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain, AIR 1975 SC 2299, the 
then Hon'ble Chief Justice Chandrachud observed : 

"The American Constitution provides for a 
rigid separation of governmental powers into three 
basic divisions -the executive, legislative and 
judicial. It is an essential principle of that 
Constitution that powers entrusted to one 
department should not be exercised by any other 
department. The Australian Constitution follows 
the same pattern of distribution of powers. Unlike 
these Constitutions, the Indian Constitution does 
not expressly vest the three kinds of power in three 
different organs of the State. But the principle of 
separation of powers is not a magic formula for 
keeping the three organs of the State within the 
strict confines of their functions." 

55.7. In Hari Shankar Bagla v. State of M.P., AIR 1954 SC 465, it was 


133 

observed : 
"The Legislature cannot delegate its function of 
laying down legislative policy in respect of a measure and 
its formulation as a rule of conduct. The Legislature must 
declare the policy of the law and the legal principles which 
are to control any given cases and must provide a standard 
to guide the officials or the body in power to execute the 
law. The essential legislative function consists in the 
determination of the choice of the legislative policy and of 
formally enacting that policy into a binding rule of 
conduct." 

Evaluation of the principle : 

56. The value of the principle ''Separation of Powers'' lies in the fact that 

it seeks to preserve the human liberty by avoiding the concentration of powers 

in one person or body of persons. The different organs of Government for the 

sake of liberty should be prevented from encroaching on another province. 

57. History has proved the fact that if there is a complete separation of 

powers, the Government cannot run smoothly and effectively. Smooth running 

of Government is possible only by co-operation and mutual adjustment of all 

the three organs of the Government. The aim behind the principle is to protect 

the people against capricious, tyrannical and whimsical powers of the State. 

58. Virtually, absolute separation of powers is not possible in any form of 

Government. In view of the variety of situations, the legislature cannot foresee 

or anticipate all the circumstances to which a legislative measure should be 

extended and applied. Therefore, legislature is empowered to delegate some of 

its functions to administrative authority (executive). But, one thing is notable 


134 

that legislature cannot delegate its essential legislative power. 

59. With the widening of the horizons of 'Judicial Activism', criticism 

emanated from a few percent of the people that the judiciary is overstepping its 

bounds and taking over the Government functions, but, this is not a justifiable 

thought. The Supreme Court and the High Courts act as watchman to keep 

Executive and Legislature within the bounds of law. Today, millions of people 

are suffering in the country because of the failures or inactions of the executive. 

It is the Judiciary, which is holding out hope for them. 

60. The Indian Constitution, adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 

November 26,1949, is a comprehensive document, containing 395 Articles and 

several Schedules. Besides dealing with the structure of Government, the 

Constitution makes detailed provisions for the rights of citizens and other 

persons in a number of entrenched provisions, and for the principles to be 

followed by the State in the governance of the country, labelled as "Directive 

Principles of State Policy". 

61. Historical and geographical factors have been responsible for the 

build of the Constitution, which is the largest Constitution in the world. The 

framers of the Constitution were keen to preserve the democratic values to 

which Indians had attached the highest importance in their struggle for 

freedom. But, they were also keen to make provisions considered to be 


135 

necessary in the light of the social and economic backwardness of certain 

sections of society. They had also before them the precedent of the 

Government of India Act,1935, whose detailed provisions were found suitable 

for adoption in the interests of continuity and certainty. Some precautions for 

the constitutional image being distorted or being impaired in its essential 

features were also required. All this has contributed to the length of the Indian 

Constitution. Therefore, all the organs of the Government, including the 

citizens of India, and various enactments are bound by and subject to the 

provisions of the Constitution of India. 

62. The basic structure doctrine or the doctrine of basic structure of the 

Constitution, as evolved by the Supreme Court of India, is unique in 

constitutional jurisprudence. The seeds of the theory are to be found in the 

Preamble to the Constitution. Landmark pronouncements of the Supreme Court 

in Kesavananda Bharati, AIR 1973 SC 1461, Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj 

Narain, 1975 Supp SCC 1, and Minerva Mills, 1980 (3) SCC 625, bear 

testimony to this truism. Any amendment of the Constitution is open to judicial 

review and liable to be interfered with by the Court on the ground that it affects 

one or the other of the basic features of the Constitution. 

63. The Constitution of India is a constitutive document, in keeping with 

modern constitutional practice, and fundamental to the governance of the 

country. The people of India have provided a constitutional polity consisting of 


136 

certain primary organs, institutions and functionaries to exercise the powers 

provided in the Constitution. No other Constitution combines under its wings 

such diverse people, numbering now more than one billion, with different 

languages and religions and in different stages of economic development, into 

one nation, and no other nation is faced with such vast socio-economic 

problems. The Constitution cannot be interpreted like an ordinary statute, but 

as a Constitution, which, apart from setting up a machinery for the Government, 

has a noble and grand vision, which was put in words in the Preamble and 

carried out in part by conferring fundamental rights on the people and by the 

application of Directive Principles. 

64. The Preamble of the Constitution of India, the Fundamental Rights 

and the Directive Principles, constituting a 'Trinity', assure to every person in a 

welfare State, social and economic democracy, with equality of status and 

dignity of persons. Political democracy without social and economic democracy 

would always remain unstable. Social democracy must become a way of life in 

an egalitarian social order. Economic democracy aids consolidation of social 

stability and smooth working of political democracy. The Preamble 

emphatically declares that we have given to ourselves the Constitution with a 

firm resolve to constitute a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic, 

with equality of status and of opportunity to all its citizens. 
"Rule of Law" 

being our constitutional faith, it is imperative that every governmental 

institution must observe it, irrespective of any obstacles or odds on its path. 


137 

65. Indian Constitution is not to be construed as a mere law, but as the 

machinery, by which laws are made. It is a living and organic instrument, 

which, of all documents, has the greatest claim to be construed broadly and 

liberally. 

66. Keeping the above law in mind, if we see the present case, a 

circumspection of the facts would reveal that the land to an extent of one Cawni 

10 grounds and 1871 sq.ft. in T.S.No.41 of Vepery Village, Fort Tondiarpet, 

Taluk, Chennai District was granted by the Government of Tamil Nadu to one 

Sir Ramaswamy Mudaliar to build a Choultry for the use of persons, who come 

by rail from different parts of the presidency and have no house or friends in 

Madras. While assigning the above land by the Government, the following 

conditions were imposed : 

1. that Choultry should be available for the free use of 

railway travellers; 

2. that the buildings constructed should be approved by the 

Government; and more importantly, 

3. that the land shall be liable to resumption without 

compensation, if it ceases to be used for the purpose for 

which it is granted or is used for any other purposes 

without the permission of the Government. 

67. It is seen that the said lands were granted and assigned in 

favour of Sir Ramaswamy Mudaliar by a Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.253 

dated 17.01.1899, whereby, the conditions were incorporated in the following 

words: 


138 

1. that the land shall revert to Government when it ceased to 

be used for the purpose for which it is granted; and 

2. that should be property be at any time resumed by 
Government, the compensation payable, therefore, shall 
in no case exceed the cost or the then present value 
whichever shall be less of any building erected or other 
works executed on the land. 

68. Subsequently, the said lands were subjected to civil 

jurisdiction and the competent Civil Court, namely, the High Court of 

Judicature at Madras, framed a Scheme Decree in C.S.No.90 of 1963. 

Accordingly, properties held by Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar's Choultry were 

vested with the Administrator General and Official Trustee (hereinafter referred 

to as "AG&OT") of Tamil Nadu from 18.08.1970. From then onwards, the 

management of the Trust and the properties attached to it were under the 

control of the AG&OT. As per the Scheme Decree, the AG&OT of Tamil Nadu 

leased out the lands in T.S.No.41 to various tenants and collected rent. 

69. While that being so, having regard to the unprecedented 

growth of population in general with particular reference to the Metropolitan 

City of Chennai, there was an imminent need to provide better transportation 

facilities to the commuters as also office goers and business people, which 

persuaded the State to expand the rail transport facility in the City of Chennai 

and for such avowed object, CMRL had planned a project called "Chennai 

Metro Rail Project" which aimed for construction of two corridors under 

Phase-I. Corridor I starts from Washermenpet and ends at Airport at a length of 

23.1 kms and Corridor II starts from Chennai Central and ends at St. Thomas 


139 

Mount Station at a length of 22 kms. As per the project, portions of Corridor I 

with a length of 14.3 kms between Washermenpet and Saidapet and portions of 

Corridor II with a length of 9.7 kms from Chennai Central to Anna Nagar 

would be underground Corridors and the remaining portions would be in an 

elevated position. 

70. CMRL is stated to be a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), formed 

for the purpose of implementing the Chennai Metro Rail Project. The project is 

stated to be funded by the Government of India and the State Government by 

way of equal equity contribution in subordinate debt (Government of India 

20%, Government of Tamil Nadu 20.78% and the balance 59.22% being met 

from the loan assistance from Japan International Co-operation agency). The 

Government of India has already accorded sanction for the project as well as for 

its participation. 

71. The lands in question are covered by the project, namely, Corridor I, 

starting from Washermenpet to Chennai Airport and the project is a time-bound 

project with an objective to ease out phenomenal growth of traffic congestion 

in the City of Chennai and any delay in executing the project would affect the 

plans announced by the Government of India as well as the State Government, 

causing inconvenience to Chennai public and further leading to contractual 

implications, such as extension of time and escalation of project costs, which in 

turn would cost the public exchequer several hundred crores of rupees. 

Therefore, the State has come out with an immediate action by invoking 


140 

Section 3 of the Government Grants Act, 1895 for resumption of lands. 

72. Interestingly, it is the matter concerned not only with the action of 

the Executive, but also involvement of other organ of the Democracy, namely 

Judiciary, for the purpose of maintenance and control over the said property. 

The lands in question undoubtedly are lands belonging to the State of Tamil 

Nadu and the same were originally granted in favour of Sir Ramaswamy 

Mudaliar and an order of grant was also passed in this regard with certain 

conditions. In the meanwhile, such persons ultimately approached the 

competent Court of Civil jurisdiction i.e., High Court of Madras, wherein a 

Scheme was framed and that decree is in force as on date. It is equally 

important to note that after framing of the said Scheme, the subject property has 

been entrusted to a Trustee under the control of judiciary, namely, AG&OT. 

Therefore, it is more important that in a public project, for immediate execution 

of the same, the law of the land has to be followed in vesting and divesting the 

property from the authorities concerned before resumption of the land. It is true 

that the State Government is empowered to invoke appropriate jurisdiction 

under the authority of law to resume the land and vacate persons, who later on 

came to the picture in possession of the property, lawfully. 

73. If that could be the position, the question, which arises for 

consideration is, as to, whether the State, by invoking eminent domain, can 


141 

resume the land under the authority of law, namely, Section 3 of the 

Government Grants Act, 1895, notwithstanding any law for the time-being in 

force. Here again, another question arises to the effect that when the subject 

matter is concerned with two authorities, namely, Union of India and State of 

Tamil Nadu, and the property in question has already been vested with the 

judicial organ, viz., AG&OT, which comes under the purview of Official 

Trustees Act, is it appropriate for the State authority alone to take a decision for 

resumption of the land, that too without taking proper course in resumption of 

the land by approaching appropriate Scheme Court or in the absence of any 

order in respect of vesting, divesting, modification or any change in control and 

management of the property from the AG&OT Court, dealing with AG&OT 

properties, which is normally headed by a senior-most Judge of the High Court 

of Madras. Merely because the State is dominantly empowered to exercise its 

jurisdiction under the Government Grants Act for resumption of the land for a 

public purpose, will they be exempted from approaching the appropriate 

Scheme Court and also AG&OT Court especially when such Decrees and 

Orders are in force as on date. 

Eminent Domain : 

74. Coming to the aspect of eminent domain, it is to be stated that 

principles of public accountability are applicable to State officers/officials with 

all their rigour. Greater the power to decide, higher is the responsibility to be 

just and fair. The dimensions of administrative law permit judicial intervention 


142 

in decisions, though of administrative nature, which are ex facie discriminatory. 

The adverse impact of lack of probity in discharge of public duties can result in 

varied defects, not only in the decision-making process but in the final decision 

as well. Every officer in the hierarchy of the State, by virtue of his being 

"public officer" or "public servant", is accountable for his decisions to the 

public as well as to the State. This concept of dual responsibility should be 

applied with its rigours in the larger public interest and for proper governance. 

Therefore, it is expected of the State officers not to forget the principles of 

public accountability in exercise of the State's power of eminent domain and 

the legislative intent behind providing safeguards and some benefits against the 

resumption cannot be frustrated by inaction and omissions on the part of the 

officers. Imperatively, it must follow that the Central Government and all State 

Governments must issue appropriate directions to ensure that there is no 

harassment, hardship or inequality caused to the owners/persons interested in 

the lands to be resumed by the State in exercise of its power of eminent 

domain. 

75. Our Constitution, subject to certain exceptions, has guaranteed the 

fullest protection to property. It has not only provided that no person can be 

deprived of property by the executive without legislative sanction but it has 

further provided that even the legislature cannot deprive a person of his 

property unless there is a public purpose and then only on payment of 

compensation. Article 31, in this regard, provides as follows: 


143 

"31. (1) No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of 
law. 
(2) No property, movable or immovable, including any interest in, or in 
any company owning, any commercial or industrial undertaking, shall be 
taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law 
authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition, unless the law 
provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired 
and either fixes the amount of the compensation, or specifies the principles 
on which, and the manner in which, the compensation is to be determined 
and given. 

(3) No such law as is referred to in clause (2) made by the legislature of a 
State shall have effect unless such law, having been reserved for the 
consideration of the President, has received his assent. 
(4) If any Bill pending at the commencement of this Constitution in the 
Legislature of a State has, after it has been passed by such legislature, been 
reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, 
then, notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the law so assented to 
shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes 
the provisions of clause (2). 
(5) Nothing in clause (2) shall affect-
(a) the provisions of any existing law other than a law to which the 
provisions of clause (6) apply, or 
(b) the provisions of any law which the State may hereafter make-
(i) for the purpose of imposing or levying any tax or penalty, or 
(ii) for the promotion of public health or the prevention of danger to 
life or property, or 
(iii) in pursuance of any agreement entered into between the 
Government of the Dominion of India or the Government of India and 
the Government of any other country, or otherwise, with respect to 
property declared by law to be evacuee property. 
(6) Any law of the State enacted not more than eighteen months before 
the commencement of this Constitution may within three months from such 
commencement be submitted to the President for his certification; and 
thereupon, if the President by public notification so certifies, it shall not be 
called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the 
provisions of clause (2) of this article or has contravened the provisions of 
sub-section (2) of Section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935." 

76. Property, in legal sense, means an aggregate of rights, which are 

guaranteed and protected by law. It extends to every species of valuable right 


144 

and interest, more particularly, ownership and exclusive right to a thing, the 

right to dispose of the thing in every legal way, to possess it, to use it, and to 

exclude everyone else from interfering with it. The dominion or indefinite right 

of use or disposition which one may lawfully exercise over particular things or 

subjects is called property. The exclusive right of possessing, enjoying, and 

disposing of a thing is property in legal parameters. Therefore, the word 

'property' connotes everything which is subject of ownership, corporeal or 

incorporeal, tangible or intangible, visible or invisible, real or personal; 

everything that has an exchangeable value or which goes to make up wealth or 

estate or status. Property, therefore, within the constitutional protection, 

denotes group of rights inhering citizen's relation to physical thing, as right to 

possess, use and dispose of it in accordance with law. 

77. Article 31, which was deleted by the Constitution 44th Amendment 

Act, 1978 with effect from 20.06.1979, provided for compulsory acquisition of 

property. Clause (3) of that Article provided that, no law referred to in clause 

(2), made by the legislature of a State shall have effect unless such law, having 

been reserved for the consideration of the President, has received his assent. 

Article 31-A confers protection upon laws falling within clauses (a) to (e) of 

that Article, provided that such laws, if made by a State Legislature, have 

received the assent of the President. Clause (a) of Article 31-A comprehends 

laws of agrarian reform. Right to property is a human right as also a 

Constitutional right. But, it is not a fundamental right. At the same time, each 


145 

and every claim to property would not be a property right. 

78. In Ramanatha Aiyar's The Law Lexicon, Reprint Edn., 1987, at p. 

1031, it is stated that the property is the most comprehensive of all terms which 

can be used, inasmuch as it is indicative and descriptive of every possible 

interest which the party can have. The term property has a most extensive 

signification, and, according to its legal definition, consists in free use, 

enjoyment, and disposition by a person of all his acquisitions, without any 

control or diminution, save only by the laws of the land. 

79. Also, the word 'property' used in Article 300-A, must be understood 

in the context in which the sovereign power of eminent domain is exercised by 

the State and property expropriated. No abstract principles could be laid. Each 

case must be considered in the light of its own facts and setting. The phrase 

"deprivation of the property of a person" must equally be considered in the fact 

situation of a case. Deprivation connotes different concepts. Article 300-A gets 

attracted to an acquisition or taking possession of private property, by 

necessary implication for public purpose, in accordance with the law made by 

Parliament or a State Legislature, a rule or a statutory order having force of law. 

It is inherent in every sovereign State by exercising its power of eminent 

domain to expropriate private property without owner's consent. Prima facie, 

State would be the judge to decide whether a purpose is a public purpose. But it 

is not the sole judge. This will be subject to judicial review and it is the duty of 

the court to determine whether a particular purpose is a public purpose or not. 


146 

Public interest has always been considered to be an essential ingredient of 

public purpose. But every public purpose does not fall under Article 300-A nor 

every exercise of eminent domain an acquisition or taking possession under 

Article 300-A. Generally speaking, preservation of public health or prevention 

of damage to life and property are considered to be public purposes. Yet, 

deprivation of property for any such purpose would not amount to acquisition 

or possession taken under Article 300-A. It would be by exercise of the police 

power of the State. In other words, Article 300-A only limits the powers of the 

State that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. 

There has to be no deprivation without any sanction of law. Deprivation by any 

other mode is not acquisition or taking possession under Article 300-A. 

80. What needs to be emphasised is, that, although in exercise of the 

power of eminent domain the State can acquire the property for a public 

purpose, it must be remembered that compulsory acquisition of the property 

which is under occupation of an individual is a serious matter and has grave 

repercussions on his constitutional right of not being deprived of his property 

without the sanction of law viz., Article 300-A and the legal rights. Therefore, 

the State must exercise this power with great care and circumspection. At times, 

compulsory acquisition of land is likely to make the owner/occupant landless. 

The degree of care required to be taken by the State is greater when the power 

of compulsory acquisition of land is exercised, because that results in depriving 


147 

the individual of his property. 

81. In this case, though the State, through the District Collector of 

Chennai and also AG&OT concerned, made applications before the AG&OT 

Court under the jurisdiction of the High Court of Madras for taking suitable 

orders, such applications have subsequently been withdrawn by them for 

reasons best known to them. In the matter in question, when the subject land is 

governed by an authority of law being controlled and maintained by the 

judiciary, then involvement of judiciary could not be bye-passed or dispensed 

with merely by invoking the Government Grants Act. The basic structure of the 

Constitution defines certain distinct and separate powers for Executive and 

Judiciary. In the event of Executive acting independently under the authority of 

law, the role of judiciary to look into its functioning is very limited. But, once 

they approach the other organ, namely, Judiciary under the competent 

jurisdictional Court, the Executive should understand and delineate as to the 

proper method and procedures to be adopted in taking out the land, which has 

already been entrusted with the judiciary for proper control and maintenance. In 

that case, what is required to be done is fair play in applying proper rule of law, 

which is the basic structure of governance of our country in dealing with 

separation of powers of the Executive and Judiciary. 

Rule of Law : 

82. The Constitution of India provides for governance of the country by 


148 

its three essential pillars viz., the legislature, the executive and the judiciary and 

it promises governance through "Rule of Law". Maintenance of "Rule of Law", 

therefore, is a sine qua non under our constitutional scheme and, in fact, is 

essential to sustain any democracy. We must consider ourselves to be fortunate 

enough that notwithstanding the vastness and size of our population and the 

complexity and problems we have, on account of diverse philosophy, 

democracy has taken deep roots in this country and democratic institutions have 

flourished to such an extent that it will be difficult for any of our neighbours to 

destabilise the same. It is the sacred duty of the judiciary to see that the "Rule 

of Law" is maintained and it shall be construed as a constitutional obligation 

for the judiciary to do all that is possible in maintaining the "Rule of Law" not 

merely in interpreting the provisions of law but also in issuing directions and 

orders to the authorities concerned for maintenance of the "Rule of Law". 

83. In the given situation, in the instant case, the action of the Executive, 

without resorting to the Rule of Law in resumption of the land in question, 

being controlled and maintained by the judiciary under the Civil jurisdiction, 

cannot be said to be interpreted in the manner as contemplated under Section 3 

of the Government Grants Act, 1895, when notwithstanding any law for the 

time being in force, the State has got absolute power to resume its own 

property, which has been entrusted to the other organ of the democracy, 

namely, Judiciary. The Executive should act only under the authority of law by 

invoking appropriate jurisdiction, when the subject property is already under 


149 

the control of the judiciary. Such an act of the State, in our considered opinion, 

bypassed the procedures to be followed and is not the appropriate method to be 

adopted by them for resumption of the land, though the said land is required for 

a public purpose. Rule of law is supreme beginning with the fundamental to 

special features of Constitution and no authority under them can waive such 

jurisdictional limits contemplated under law. This Court has already taken a 

view in one way or the other in interpreting Section 3 of the Government 

Grants Act, 1895 and the basic structure of the Constitution is the fundament of 

the Constitution. Therefore, the three organs should always be within the Rule 

of law. 

84. In this regard, the crucial question that arises for consideration in this 

case is, when one organ of democracy, namely, the executive/Government has 

been empowered to entrust its own property to another organ viz., judiciary 

under which the control has been given to Administrator General & Official 

Trustee (AGOT) under an enactment, on the principle of eminent domain, can 

the Government invoke another enactment i.e., Government Grants Act under 

Section 3, resuming the land on its own, without resorting to any procedure 

contemplated under the Official Trusts Act ? 

85. To examine the above issue, in this case, the Government, while 

making an order for resumption of land through its executive, did not take any 

order either from the scheme court or from the AGOT Court. Though there 


150 

were attempts made by the executive to file applications one by Chennai Metro 

Rail Limited and the other by District Collector, subsequently, the same were 

withdrawn. So, it is clear that there was no order made by AGOT Court, which 

is the court of competent jurisdiction to permit AGOT to hand over the 

possession of the land in its control to the Government, for resumption. The 

said judicial procedure has been overlooked by the Government in resuming the 

land, even of its own. This act of the Government, bypassing an act under 

which the entrustment has been made, would amount to violation of the basic 

structure of the Constitution of India and the power of separation which has 

been demarcated could not be usurped by one organ on its own. 

86. It is necessitated that though the earlier Division Benches of this 

Court have taken their own perceptions on the matter, in the given facts and 

circumstances of the case, our conscientious endeavour is to arrive at the 

correct legal position in accordance with law, particularly, on the Basic 

Structure of the Constitution and the Rule of Law. 

Article 141 -Judicial Discipline and Binding Obligation : 

87. The Supreme Court, with regard to the very same subject lands, on 

the appeals filed by Chennai Metro Rail Limited and the State of Tamil Nadu in 

Civil Appeal Nos.2572-2573 of 2014 and Civil Appeal Nos.2575-2578 of 2014 

respectively, against the Division Bench judgment, dated 12.07.2013, has dealt 

with the matter as regards T.S.No.43/2 as well as T.S.No.41 and, by a 

judgment, dated 21.02.2014, held that the project details and the plan annexed 


151 

with it disclose that the lands situated in Survey No. 43/2 as well as Survey No. 

41 were all part of the projects for putting up various other ancillary units such 

as mechanical plant rooms, electrical plant rooms, building services, drop-off 

and pick-up facilities, airport check-in facilities, ventilation shafts, subway, 

feeder bus stand, multi-model facilities, pick-up and drop-off bay, MTC Bus 

bay, fireman staircase, entry and exit points and that if the taking over of the 

lands by the Chennai Metro is not allowed, the same would seriously prejudice 

and cause unnecessary hurdles in proceeding with the project. Holding so, the 

Supreme Court set aside the Division Bench judgment of this Court and 

allowed W.A.Nos.68,69,89 and 90 of 2013, filed by State and CMRL, thereby 

paving way for resumption of land for Chennai Metro Rail Project. Allowing 

the appeals, the Supreme Court, however, directed the appellants therein, who 

were State and CMRL, to value the buildings belonging to the first respondent 

therein, who is not a party to the proceedings in these appeals, standing in 

T.S.No.43/2, determine the compensation and pay the same to the first 

respondent within three months. By the said judgment, the first respondent 

therein was directed to surrender possession of the lands through AGOT within 

four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of the said judgment. The relevant 

portions of the judgment of the Supreme Court are as under : 

"18. While considering the submissions of learned 
Additional Solicitor General and Mr. Gopal Subramanium, 
learned Senior Counsel for the First Respondent, inasmuch 
as we find that the reasoning of the Division Bench in 
having stated that the underground Metro Station has been 


152 

planned in a stretch of Land on the Northern side of the 
Arterial Road, namely, Poonamallee High Road and that 
certain other lands were available in that side and, 
therefore, there was no necessity for taking over the lands 
in the possession of the First Respondent is patently a 
conclusion which was contrary to the records placed 
before the Division Bench and the same cannot be 
sustained. In other words, as rightly pointed out by learned 
Additional Solicitor General, the conclusion of the 
Division Bench that the lands concerned in these Appeals, 
namely, the one situated in Survey No. 43/2 were not part 
of the project of the Chennai Metro was a wrong 
assimilation of facts. When it has been demonstrated 
before us based on the project details and the plan annexed 
with it, which disclose that the lands situated in Survey 
No. 43/2 as well as Survey No. 41 were all part of the 
projects for putting up various other ancillary units such as 
mechanical plant rooms, electrical plant rooms, building 
services, drop-off and pick-up facilities, airport check-in 
facilities, ventilation shafts, subway, feeder bus stand, 
multi-modal facilities, pick-up and drop-off bay, MTC Bus 
bay, fireman staircase, entry and exit points, if the taking 
over of the lands by the Chennai Metro is not allowed, the 
same would seriously prejudice and cause unnecessary 
hurdles in proceeding with the project. In our considered 
view, the failure of the Division Bench in noting the 
details displayed in the plan and the project which were 
placed before it has resulted in the passing of the 
impugned Order. The Division Bench failed to note that 
the project details pertaining to the proposed underground 
Metro Station and the other supporting provisions to be 
made such as mechanical plant rooms, electrical plant 
rooms, bus bay and other developments to be carried out 
spread over a vast extent of land both on the Northern side 
of the Poonamallee High Road as well as the lands situated 
on the Southern side of the said Road with which we are 
now concerned. Therefore, in the light of the above details 
placed before the Court which according to learned 
Additional Solicitor General was made available before 
the Division Bench also, we have no reason to reject the 
said submission in order to sustain the conclusion of the 
Division Bench. In other words, the conclusion of the 
Division Bench having been reached without properly 
examining the relevant documents relating to the Chennai 


153 

Metro Project, namely, the plans, the project schedule and 
the other averments placed before the Division Bench, the 
impugned order of the Division Bench cannot be 
sustained. 

19. Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior 
Counsel appearing for the First Respondent in support of 
his submission that the lands situated in Survey No. 43/2 
were not required at all for the purpose of carrying out the 
Metro Project and referred to an affidavit filed before the 
Division Bench by the Managing Director of Chennai 
Metro Rail Limited. The learned Senior Counsel submitted 
that in the said affidavit the reference to the Metro Rail 
Station planned along the Poonamallee High Road has 
been stated and while referring to the same, a specific 
reference was made to the private buildings located 
opposite to Picnic Hotel and that acquisition of those 
private lands would cost dearly to the State Exchequer 
apart from evacuation of the tenants/owners would 
consume considerable length of time which would in turn 
cause delay in the construction of the underground Station. 
When we perused the said affidavit which has been 
extracted in the reply affidavit filed by the Managing 
Director of Chennai Metro in W.P. No. 19469 of 2012, we 
find that statement came to be made when a litigation was 
launched at the instance of Hotel Picnic and while meeting 
the stand of Hotel Picnic, it was stated that the above 
statement came to be made. We do not find any scope to 
reject the stand of the Appellant with reference to the 
lands situated in Survey No. 43/2 which had nothing to do 
with the construction of the underground Metro Station. 
Though, the various other units to be set up in the lands in 
Survey No. 43/2 were also part of the Metro Project as has 
been demonstrated before us based on relevant documents, 
the reference to the Heritage Buildings and other private 
buildings situated opposite to Hotel Picnic was referred to 
by Chennai Metro while pointing out its inability to plan 
the setting up of underground Metro Station in any other 
land except the lands where Hotel Picnic was situated. 
Therefore, the said submission of the learned Senior 
Counsel for the First Respondent does not in any way 
support the stand of the First Respondent. As far as the 
contention of Mr. Gopal Subramanium that like in the case 
of other occupants wherein a direction was issued by this 


154 

Court to give a show cause notice and decide the matter, 
the said contention cannot be countenanced in this case 
inasmuch as before the Division Bench of the High Court 
as well as before us the issue was argued on merits. In fact, 
the Division Bench after hearing the Appellants and the 
First Respondent allowed both his Writ Petitions by 
modifying the order of the learned Single Judge and 
thereby held that there was no necessity for a remand. 
Therefore, since we have also decided the whole 
controversy on merits there is no need for a remand. 

20. Therefore, once we are convinced that the 
entitlement of the Appellant to hold the lands belonging to 
the State falling under Survey Nos. 43/2 as well as 41 
which the Appellant is able to take possession of from the 
State Government without payment of any compensation, 
the only other question to be examined is as to whether the 
lease granted in favour of the First Respondent by the AG 
& OT based on the directions of the High Court can have 
any implication in preventing the Appellant from taking 
over the lands. As noted earlier, indisputably the lands in 
Survey No. 43/2 belong to the State. At the time when the 
lands were granted and assigned in favour of Sir 
Ramaswamy Mudaliar Trust vide GO Ms. Nos. 763 and 
253 dated 09.12.1898 and 17.01.1899 respectively, 
conditions were imposed to the effect that the lands would 
revert back to the Government when it ceases to be used 
for the purpose for which it was granted and that should 
the property at any time resumed by Government, the 
compensation payable should in no case exceed the cost or 
the then present value whichever shall be less of any 
building erected or other works executed in the land. 
Though, learned Additional Solicitor General sought to 
contend as was also contended before the High Court that 
by leasing out the lands to different parties the condition 
No. 1 was violated, namely, that the land was put to 
different use than for what it was granted, we do not find 
any good grounds to accept the same. On the other hand, 
we find that the Trust itself was vested with the AG & OT 
on 18.08.1970 pursuant to a Scheme Decree framed by the 
High Court in C.S. No. 90 of 1963. From then onwards, 
the AG & OT was administering the Trust and was 
apparently fulfilling the purpose for which the Trust came 
to be created, though, by leasing out the lands to different 


155 

individuals for the purpose of generating income from the 
lands. The AG & OT by approaching the High Court, as 
and when required, seem to have granted the lease of the 
lands to different parties based on the orders passed by the 
High Court. 

21. In so far as the First Respondent was concerned, 
his lease came into existence initially on 22.12.1972, and 
by Order dated 10.12.2004 in Application No. 915 of 
2003, the lease in favour of the First Respondent was 
extended for a further period of 25 years by enhancing the 
rent. The said order was also confirmed by the Division 
Bench in the Order dated 20.08.2009 in O.S.A. No. 298 of 
2004. In the said circumstances, it cannot be held that the 
said possession with the First Respondent was unlawful. 
However, on that basis when it comes to the question of 
resumption of the land by the State Government when the 
Government through the AG & OT thought it fit to resume 
the lands which was in accordance with the terms 
contained in the Original Grant, namely, GOS No. 763 and 
253 dated 09.12.1898 and 17.01.1899, there would be no 
scope for the First Respondent to contend that the 
Appellants are not entitled for the resumption of the lands 
situated in Survey No. 43/2. 

22. We, therefore, hold that the State Government as 
the owner of the land and having regard to the right 
retained by it while making the grant in the years 1898 and 
1899 and in the larger public interest of setting up of the 
Chennai Metro Project the lands were required by it, the 
same cannot be questioned by the Original Grantee or by 
the lessees whose holding was subordinate in character to 
the Original Grantee. Therefore, we do not find any 
justification in the Division Bench in having interfered 
with the impugned GO Ms. No. 168 dated 21.05.2012 and 
the consequential orders of the Tehsildar dated 21.06.2012 
and that of the AG & OT dated 25.06.2012 directing the 
First Respondent to handover possession of the lands. 
23. Therefore, while the impugned GO and the 
consequential orders of the Tehsildar and AG & OT can be 
sustained, having regard to the condition contained in the 
initial GO Ms. Nos. 763 and 253 dated 09.12.1898 and 
17.01.1899 since based on valid orders of the High Court 
and the AG & OT the First Respondent developed its 


156 

Hotel business in the lands in question, while resuming the 
lands, the State Government along with the Chennai Metro 
is bound to compensate the First Respondent for the 
buildings which were erected in the said land in Survey 
No. 43/2 based on the valuation to be made by the 
appropriate Authorities. 

24. Therefore, while allowing the Appeals of the 
State Government as well as the Chennai Metro and while 
setting aside the Judgment of the Division Bench, Writ 
Appeal Nos. 68, 69, 89 and 90 of 2013 are allowed. We, 
however, direct the Appellants to value the buildings 
belonging to the First Respondent standing in Survey No. 
43/2 and determine the compensation and pay the same to 
the First Respondent. The said exercise of valuation and 
payment of compensation shall be effected within three 
months from this date. 

25. In the light of our above orders, the First 
Respondent is directed to surrender possession of the lands 
in Survey No. 43/2 in an extent of 5644 sq. ft. through the 
AG & OT within four weeks from the date of receipt of 
copy of this judgment. With the above directions, these 
appeals are allowed." 

88. Judicial discipline binds us and the constitutional wisdom 

underlined under Article 141 of the Constitution is to be followed. The parties 

before the Supreme Court with regard to Survey Nos.41 and 43/2 were same. 

The Apex Court discussed about both the above survey numbers, while dealing 

with survey number 43/2. Under the circumstances, the ratio laid down by the 

Supreme Court in its recent judgment, allowing the appeals filed by State and 

Chennai Metro Rail Limited, has to be squarely made applicable to the present 

case also. 

89. Accordingly, while upholding the rule of law that there shall be a 


157 

proper procedure to approach the AGOT Court and also the competent court of 

civil jurisdiction where the scheme decree has been formulated for control and 

management of the property for obtaining an order before resumption of the 

land under the Official Trustees Act, applying the law laid down by the 

Supreme Court in Civil Appeal Nos.2572-2573 and 2575-2578 of 2014, these 

Writ Appeals are to be dismissed. 

90. It is true, as contended by the learned Additional Advocate General, 

Section 3 of the Government Grants Act declares the unfettered discretion of 

the Government to impose such conditions and limitations as it thinks fit, no 

matter what the general law of the land be. The meaning of Sections 2 and 3 of 

the Government Grants is that the scope of that Act is not limited to affecting 

the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act only. The Government has 

unfettered discretion to impose any conditions, limitations, or restrictions in its 

grants, and the rights, privileges and obligations of the grantee would be 

regulated according to the terms of the grant, notwithstanding any provisions of 

any statutory or common law, but the same shall be subject to Rule of Law and 

cananot be contrary to the basic structure of the Constitution, which means the 

Government should follow the proper procedure, which, in this case, is already 

in currency but not followed, while revoking the grants. 

91. Moreso, Article 300-A would be equally violated if the provisions of 

law authorising deprivation of property have not been complied with. While 

enacting Article 300-A, the Parliament has only borrowed Article 31(1), the 


158 

"Rule of law" doctrine and not Article 31(2), which had embodied the doctrine 

of "Eminent Domain". Article 300-A enables the State to put restrictions on the 

right to property by law. That law has to be reasonable. It must comply with 

other provisions of the Constitution. The limitation or restriction should not be 

arbitrary or excessive. The legislation providing for deprivation of property 

under Article 300-A must be just, fair and reasonable, as understood in terms of 

Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 26(b), 301, etc. Thus, in each case, courts will have to 

examine the scheme of the impugned Act, its object, purpose as also the 

question whether payment of nil compensation or nominal compensation would 

make the impugned law unjust, unfair or unreasonable in terms of other 

provisions of the Constitution, as indicated above. 

92. Therefore, we are constrained to hold that though there is a violation 

of Rule of Law by the authorities in resumption of lands in question, with 

heavy heart, by giving due respect to the ratio decidendi of the Supreme Court 

with regard to the very same subject lands, we are left with no other choice but 

to follow the same under Article 141 of the Constitution. 

93. However, while parting with, we feel it our duty to say that the 

executive action taken in this case by the State and its officers is incompatible 

to the basic principle of the Rule of Law. The facts and the position in law are 

(1) that the buildings constructed on the piece of Government land did not 

belong to Government, (2) that the petitioners were in possession and 

occupation of the buildings and (3) that by virtue of enactments binding on the 


159 

Government, the petitioners could be dispossessed, if at all, only in pursuance 

of a decree of a Civil Court obtained in proceedings properly initiated. Under 

the circumstances, the action of the Government in taking the law into their 

hands and dispossessing the appellants by way of a Government Order exhibits 

a clear disregard to the normal requirements of the rule of law, apart from what 

might legitimately and reasonably be expected from a Government functioning 

in a society governed by a Constitution which guarantees to its citizens against 

arbitrary invasion by the executive of peaceful possession of property. At the 

same time, this Court is conscious of the situation, wherein the subject land has 

been sought to be acquired for a public purpose on a larger public interest of 

the people of Chennai Metropolitan city; the significance of the project, the 

delay in its execution and the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court so also the 

concern of CMRL for taking possession of the land for putting up various 

ancillary units, such as, mechanical plant rooms, electrical plant rooms, 

building services, drop-off and pick-up facilities, airport check-in facilities, 

ventilation shafts, subway, feeder bus stand, multi-modal facilities, pick-up and 

drop-off bay, MTC Bus bay, fireman staircase and entry and exit points. 

94. With the above obiter dicta, all these Writ Appeals are dismissed. No 

costs. Consequently, the connected M.Ps. are closed.
