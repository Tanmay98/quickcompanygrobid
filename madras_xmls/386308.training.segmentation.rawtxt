JUDGMENT 

T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is numbered on conversion of O.P.No.367 of 2008, praying that 

Letters of Administration with a Will annexed, may be granted to the plaintiff as the daughter and 

one of the legatees under the Will of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, having effect limited to the 

State of Tamil Nadu. 

2. The case of the plaintiff is as follows: 

(a) The father of the plaintiff is late Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan and he died on 31.12.1980 at 

"Ramamandiram" No.868, Poonamallee High Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-600 010, where he was 

then ordinarily residing within the State of Tamil Nadu. He executed the last Will and Testament 

on 15.07.1970 in the city of Madras, in the presence of two witnesses who signed and attested the 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


2 

Will. The Will is registered as Document No.39 of 1970 in the office of the Sub-Registrar, 

Purasawalkam, Chennai. Both the attesting witnesses, namely Mr.T.S.Ramadoss and Dr.R.Paul 

Doraiswamy, are not alive as on date. Hence, third party affidavit has been filed. 

(b) The properties under the Will have been bequeathed to the plaintiff to be enjoyed for 

her lifetime and thereafter, to be inherited absolutely by her children. The plaintiff has one 

daughter and one son, viz., N.Divya and N.Dheeraj Kumar and they have given consent in favour 

of the plaintiff. The plaintiff continues to be a Hindu and her husband Mr.N.Niranjan Kumar is also 

a Hindu. The deceased S.V.Ramakrishan, the testator, has given certain directions for payment 

of maintenance to his wife Smt.S.V.R.Sarjoa, the plaintiff's mother. 

(c) Though the Will provides for vesting of properties with the Official Trustee or such 

Officer or person appointed by this Court, such vesting was restricted only till the plaintiff 

completes the age of 18 years and the plaintiff has completed the age of 18 years on 22.06.1979 

and hence, the provision for the Official Trustee to take over the properties as on date, does not 

have any force. 

(d) By the said Will, the deceased did not appoint any executor and hence, she has filed 

the petition for grant of Letters of Administration with the Will annexed. The amount of immovable 

assets which are likely to come in the hands of the plaintiff, does not exceed in the aggregate sum 

of Rs.2,80,00,000/-and the net amount of assets after deducting all items which the plaintiff by 

law allowed to deduct, is only of the value of Rs.2,79,93,000/-. All the other movable assets 

mentioned in the Will had been disposed of by the testator himself during his lifetime. 

(e) No application has been made to any District Court or delegate or to any other High 

Court for the probate of the said Will of the deceased or Letters of Administration with or without 

the Will annexed of his property and credit. The plaintiff undertakes to duly administer the property 

and credits of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and in any way concerning his Will, by paying first 

his debts and then the legacies therein bequeathed so far as the assets will extend and to make 

full and true inventory thereof and exhibit the same in this Court within six months from the date of 

grant of Letters of Administration with the Will annexed and also to render to this Court a true 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


3 

account of the said property and credits within one year from the said date. 

(f) Though the plaintiff was aware of the existence of the Will for all these years, she has 

been advised to get the Letters of Administration only recently to safeguard her interest and that 

of her children and also the wishes of her deceased father. Further, various litigations relating to 

the estate also delayed her to file the petition. Though there is no time limit for filing petition for 

Letters of Administration, she explains as stated above, since no laches could be attributed to her. 

(g) The deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan has left the following persons as his legal heirs: 

(i) Mrs.S.V.R.Saroja -Second wife, 

(ii) Mrs.R.Vijayalakshmi @ R.Vijaya -daughter, 

(iii) Mr.S.V.R.Ramprasad -son, 

(iv) Mrs.N.Renuka Devi -daughter, 

(v) Mrs.R.S.P.Dhanurmathi -daughter, 

(vi) Mrs.E.Lalitha -daughter and 

(vii) Mr.S.V.Mathaprasad @ Pancras Matha Prasad -son. 

Mrs.E.Lalitha and Mr.S.V.Mathaprasad @ Pancras Matha Prasad are daughter and son 

respectively, of the first wife S.V.Rajalakshmi, who pre-deceased the testator. The parents of the 

deceased pre-deceased him. 

(h) The plaintiff has filed consent affidavits of Smt.S.V.R.Saroja, Mrs.R.Vijayalakshmi, 

Mr.S.V.R.Ramprasad and Mrs.R.S.P.Dhanurmathi. The notice has to be issued only to 

Mrs.E.Lalitha and Mr.S.V.Mathaprasad @ Pancras Matha Prasad. She prays that Letters of 

Administration with the Will annexed may be granted to her as the daughter and one of the 

legatees under the Will of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan having effect limited to the State of 

Tamil Nadu. 

3. The first defendant has filed written statement stating as follows: 

(a) The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts and the same is liable to be 

dismissed in-limine. The averment that the first respondent (S.V.R.Saroja) is the wife of late 

S.V.Ramakrishnam, is denied and the fact is that Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan was only married to 

Smt.Rajalakshmi and the first and second defendants were born out of that wedlock. Smt.Saroja 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


4 

was never married to late S.V.Ramakrishnan and she was wife of one Mr.A.Ramadoss and had a 

child through that marriage. She, with malicious intent, schemed and enticed late 

S.V.Ramakrishnan to develop illicit intimacy with her. This illicit relationship caused havoc in the 

family and was the reason for the defendant's mother's mysterious death on 04.03.1952 and also 

death of Smt.Vellamal, the adoptive mother of Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan. Mrs.Saroja was pestering 

her father to marry her and she also harassed him through a criminal case in the year 1956 and 

the defendant's father was forced to compromise with her. Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan was a dotting 

father and he never conceded her demand to marry him. There had been no marriage between 

Mrs.Saroja and Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan. 

(b) The first defendant had no knowledge of the information contained in paragraphs 3 to 

5 of the affidavit filed in support of the petition. It is an admitted fact that the fifth respondent is the 

only legitimate daughter and the sixth respondent is the only legitimate son of the deceased 

S.V.Ramakrishnan. It is true that late Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan died on 31.12.1980 at 

"Ramamandiram", No.868, Poonamalle High Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-600 010. It is absolute false 

that late S.V.Ramakrishnan executed a Will in the city of Madras on 15.07.1970. The first 

defendant doubts the genuineness of the Will purported to be executed, attested and registered 

on 15.07.1970. After driving out the defendants from the household, Mrs.Saroja had complete 

control over late S.V.Ramakrishnan and the said Will had been obtained by coercion and undue 

influence. 

(c) The first defendant's father wanted his property to devolve on his successors. The first 

defendant's father was never married to Mrs.Saroja and her children are illegitimate. The Will 

itself states that "I am living with Srimathi Saroja, and we are living as husband and wife, even 

though there has not been a marriage between us." Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan was physically not fit 

and mentally not alert and he died after prolonged illness. The first defendant's father was very 

well versed in Court procedures, but the reading of the purported Will shows that it has been 

drafted by a layman. There has been a long gap of 10 years between execution of the Will and the 

death of the testator. Mrs.Dhanurmathi was born during this period, so, if the Will has been 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


5 

genuine, the testator would have definitely left a codicil for her benefit. The said Will does not 

contain the last Will of the testator. 

(d) The first defendant's late father Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan was residing at Nos.868 and 

869, Poonamallee High Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-600 010 and the said property is spread over 

sixty grounds and contained a huge building and the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4 executed 

sale deeds in respect of the aforesaid property and appropriated the sale proceeds. 

(e) The purported Will does not contain any detail of the properties. The deceased 

S.V.Ramakrishan was not the absolute owner of the properties as listed out in the affidavit of 

assets and the properties are not his self-earned properties. The properties are ancestral, 

coparcenary and the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan took the properties as the adopted son of late 

S.Ramaswamy Mudaliar, as per the directions of the Will, dated 10.09.1937, which had been 

probated in O.P.No.7 of 1938 in this Court by the executrix Smt.Vellammal, who thereupon 

registered a deed of adoption bearing Doc.No.125 of 1938 at the office of the District Registrar, 

Chenai-600 001, confirming the said adoption. 

(f) A mere reading of the purported Will shows that 'all the properties on the date of my 

death shall be taken over by the Official Trustee or such officer or person appointed by Court'. 

The first respondent-Mrs.Saroja, the mother of the plaintiff, intentionally did not take steps to 

inform the Court about the Will after the death of S.V.Ramakrishnan. There is no explanation in 

this regard by the plaintiff. All these years, the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4 had been 

claiming in the numerous Court cases that a Will, dated 15.07.1970 has been left by late 

S.V.Ramakrishnan and they are going to probate it, but they never took any steps all these years. 

They knew that purported Will does not contain last Will of the testator. 

(g) There has been a long gap of 28 years since her father died and now the plaintiff has 

come for Letters of Administration and the long delay in probating the Will has not been explained. 

The plaintiff has not come before this Court with clean hands and it is for the sole purpose to 

delay and deny the benefits to the real legal heirs of late S.V.Ramakrishnan. 

(h) The defendant denies that respondents 1 to 4 and the plaintiff are the legal heirs of the 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


6 

deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan. The defendants are the only legal heirs of the deceased. The 

deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan was married to S.V.Rajalakshmi and out of wedlock, defendants 

were born. The first respondent was only concubine of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan. She was 

never married to him and respondents 2 to 4 and the plaintiff are illegitimate children. 

(i) In the affidavit of assets -Annexure-A, I --movables had been given falsely. The 

movables like cash, household goods, paintings, shares, gold and silver articles and share 

certificates worth several lakhs, had been misappropriated and had not been properly accounted. 

The plaintiff has deliberately suppressed the facts in the affidavit of assets filed by her. As per 

Annexure-A, II, immovable properties, item No.1 is a family temple, item No.2 is family burial 

ground and item Nos.3 and 4 are the ancestral coparcenary properties. Item Nos.3 and 4 were 

subject matter of suit in C.S.No.43 of 1962 before this Court, where Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan and his 

only son Mr.S.V.Mathaprasad, had been plaintiffs and the said suit was decreed in their favour 

and the defendant filed appeal in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 and a Division Bench of this Court 

allowed the appeals and set aside the decree of the trial Court. Mr.Ramakrishna Mudaliar 

preferred S.L.P. to the Supreme Court. Leave was granted and the appeal was numbered as 

C.A.No.224 of 1974, which was allowed by the Supreme Court on 17.04.1995, which upheld the 

judgment of the trial Court. E.P.No.48 of 1997 in the said matter is pending before this Court. 

(j) The plaintiff along with respondents 1 to 4, inter-meddled with the estate of late 

S.V.Ramakrishnan and has dealt in excess with properties beyond the scope of the purported 

Will. The plaintiff and others executed a sale deed in favour of D.K.Sekar, relating to the property 

situated at No.30, Ormes Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-10, representing themselves to be the legal 

heirs of late S.V.Ramakrishan, which ended in Court proceedings C.S.Nos.577 to 579 of 1995 by 

judgment dated 22.01.2002, wherein it was declared that they cannot claim themselves as legal 

heirs of late S.V.Ramakrishnan and as such, the sale was deemed null and void. 

(k) The Will dated 15.07.1970 does not contain any of the properties listed out in the 

affidavit of assets. Item Nos.1 and 2 of the properties are ancestral family properties, one being a 

Ganesha Temple and the other, a family burial ground, which cannot be Willed away to the 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


7 

plaintiff or respondents 1 to 4. Item Nos.3 and 4 are the subject matter of pending litigations to 

which the plaintiff and respondents 1 to 4 have been agitating ever since 1999 and being unable 

to prove their legitimacy, have now come forward after 28 years to probate the Will, knowing fully 

well that the Will does not contain the said properties and only to deceive the Court. As regards 

the properties contained in item Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of assets, during the pendency of the 

appeal C.A.No.224 of 1974, the plaintiff and respondents 1 to 4 executed assignment deeds in 

favour of M/s.Lalachand Megnraj and Chimandas Megnraj, relinquishing their rights to the said 

properties stating that, "Whereas S.V.Ramakrishnan Mudaliar having executed the Will and 

testament dt. 15.07.1970 had died intestate in respect of the right to obtain re-conveyance of the 

property forming the subject matter of C.A.No.224/74 pending on the file of the Supreme Court." 

The acceptance of this statement by the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4 is confirmation that 

the Will does not contain item Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of assets. 

(l) The illegitimate children and their mother have been trying all these years to claim in 

Court proceedings that they are the legal heirs and has suppressed the Will. But in several 

judgments of this Court, it has been upheld that Mrs.Saroja is not legally wedded wife of 

Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan and her children are illegitimate. The plaintiff, with the help of her brother, 

the third respondent, had been misleading the Courts. The plaintiff has been approbating and 

reprobating to suit her needs and the plaintiff, with the aid of the third respondent, has been 

abusing the process of Court. The first defendant prays that the suit may be dismissed. 

4. The second defendant has filed written statement stating as follows: 

(a) The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts and the same is liable to be 

dismissed in-limine. The second defendant denies the allegations contained in paragraphs 2 to 5 

of the affidavit filed in support of the petition. It is admitted fact that the fifth and sixth respondents 

are the legitimate daughter and legitimate son of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan. It is true that 

Sri.S.V.Ramakrishnan died on 31.12.1980. It is true that Sri.S.V.Ramakrishnan executed a Will, 

dated 15.07.1970.

(b) The deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan was not the absolute owner of the properties as 

listed out in the affidavit of assets and the properties are not his self-earned properties. The 

properties are ancestral coparcenary and the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan took the properties as 

the adopted son of late S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar as per the directions of the Will, dated 

10.09.1937, which had been probated in O.P.No.7 of 1938 in this Court by the executrix 

Smt.Vellammal, his wife, who thereupon even registered a deed of adoption bearing Doc.No.125 

of 1938, registered at the Office of the District Registrar, Chennai-600 001, confirming the said 

adoption. The second defendant's late father, the said late S.V.Ramakrishnan was residing at 

Nos.868 and 869, Poonamallee High Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-600 010, and the property as such 

was spread over sixty grounds and contained a huge building and he was living there till his death 

on 31.12.1980. 

(c) The plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4 executed sale deeds in respect of the 

aforesaid property bearing Door Nos.868 and 869, Poonamallee High Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-

600 010 and appropriated the sale proceeds. The plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4 have also 

appropriated all the movables, such as valuable gold, silver and precious stone jewelleries, 

antiques consisting of rare paintings and costly furnitures, cash deposits in Banks and shares 

worth several lakhs. The plaintiff deliberately suppressed the facts in the affidavit of assets filed by 

her. 

(d) A mere reading of the Will shows that, "all the properties on the date of my death shall 

be taken over by the Official Trustee or such officer or person appointed by the Court." The first 

respondent-Smt.Saroja, the mother of the plaintiff, intentionally did not take steps to inform the 

Court about the Will on the death of S.V.Ramakrishnan and there seems to be no explanation in 

this regard by the plaintiff. This only shows the mala-fide intentions of the first respondent and the 

plaintiff. 

(e) The household of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishan and his family consisting of his wife 

late Smt.Rajalakshmi and his two children, Lalitha (respondent 5) and Matha Prasad (Respondent 

6) and his adoptive mother Smt.Vellammal (late), was a peaceful and harmonious household, until 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


9 

the advent of Saroja, the first respondent, the wife of Mr.A.Ramadoss, into the household. 

Smt.Saroja, the first respondent, though married to A.Ramadoss and having a child of her own, 

with malicious intent, entered the household of Ramakrishnan being envious of her sister's 

lifestyle and the status that she enjoyed. She schemed and enticed Ramakrishnan to develop illicit 

intimacy with her. The first respondent's behaviour with Ramakrishnan disrupted the peaceful 

atmosphere of the family and was the cause of the death of the mother, Rajalakshmi, of 

respondents 5 and 6 on 04.03.1952 and later that of their grandmother Vellammal in the same 

year in July. 

(f) The first respondent even succeeded in bringing about an estrangement between late 

S.V.Ramakrishnan and his children, viz, the respondents 5 and 6 after the death of their mother 

and the first respondent cunningly induced respondent 5--Lalitha to marry her maternal uncle 

Mr.Ekambaram much to the displeasure of her father late S.V.Ramakrishnan and also succeeded 

in estranging the feeling of the father and son--respondent 6 and his father late 

S.V.Ramakrishnan. The first respondent thereafter induced and coerced S.V.Ramakrishnan to 

execute the Will and it is with great aversion, he consented. The Will itself would bear witness to 

the animosity that he bore towards the first respondent--Saroja in stating that, "I am living with 

Smt.Saroja and we are living as husband and wife even though there has not been a marriage 

between us." This statement clearly shows that Saroja was not the wife of S.V.Ramakrishnan, but 

only a concubine, thereby, she and her children have no inheritable status. This aspect was 

confirmed by Court proceedings in C.S.No.108 of 1992 and confirmed in O.S.A.No.47 of 1994 

and finally in C.S.Nos.577 to 579 of 1995, by judgment dated 22.01.2002 in relation to a sale deed 

executed by the first respondent, the plaintiff and the respondents 2 to 4 to Mr.D.K.Sekar. The first 

respondent in her own affidavit before the City Civil Court, Chennai in C.M.P.No.12172 of 1972 in 

L.A.C.No.223 of 1959, has admitted to the fact that she is not the wife of late S.V.Ramakrishnan. 

In that affidavit, she states, "I, Saroja, daughter of Govindaswamy Mudaliar etc, etc---" and not as 

the wife of S.V.Ramakrishnan, and this statement is much after the Will dated 15.07.1970. 

(g) Item Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of assets, are the subject matter of E.P.No.48 of 1997 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


10 

in C.A.No.224 of 1974 in C.S.No.43 of 1962, presently on the file of the Supreme Court of India as 

S.L.P.Nos.13783 to 13786 of 2008. The Will has no schedule of properties. It simply states, "It will 

not be possible now to detail the properties immovable, movable, cash etc., that I may die 

possessed of. Hence I do not propose to detail them." Neither the Will provides for the fourth 

respondent-Dhanurmathi, nor is there a codicil to that effect. The Will neither gives the first 

respondent--Saroja the status of a wife, for it states, "I am living with Srimathi Saroja, and we are 

living as husband and wife even though there has not been a marriage between us." This 

statement only shows that he accepted her as his concubine, which has been admitted by the first 

respondent-Saroja in her own sworn affidavit before the City Civil Court, Chennai in 

C.M.P.No.12172 of 1972 in L.A.C.No.223 of 1959, which reads, "I, Saroja, daughter of 

Govindaswamy Mudaliar, aged 33 years..." and it further states, "I am the mother and guardian of 

Ramprasad, the second claimant. I state that having regard to the facts of the case, and the legal 

position, the minor second claimant is not entitled to any right etc." 

(h) Item Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of assets are the subject matter of appeal Civil 

Appeal No.224 of 1974 arising out of O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 as against judgment and decree 

in C.S.No.43 of 1962 filed by S.V.Ramakrishnan and this defendant against M/s.Buharis. The 

original specific performance suit C.S.No.43 of 1962 filed by this defendant and his late father 

S.V.Ramakrishan, against Mrs.Fathima Buhari and Mr.A.M.B.Buhari, was decreed in their favour. 

Thereupon, entailment of litigation of O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 led to appeal Civil Appeal 

No.224 of 1974 on the file of the Supreme Court of India. During the pendency of the said Civil 

Appeal No.224 of 1974, the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 3 only filed C.M.P.No.7242 of 1981 

claiming themselves as legal representatives of the deceased Ramakrishnan by virtue of the 

unprobated Will, dated 15.07.1970. During the pendency of the appeal in Civil Appeal No.224 of 

1974, the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 3 and also the fourth respondent, executed 

assignment deeds in favour of M/s.Lalchand Megnraj and Chimmindas Megnraj, relinquishing 

their rights to the said properties, stating that, "Whereas S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar 

notwithstanding having executed the Will and Testament dt.15.07.1970 had died intestate in 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


11 

respect of the right to obtain re-conveyance of the property forming the subject matter of 

C.A.No.224/74 pending on the file of the Supreme Court." Acceptance of this statement by the 

plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4, is confirmation that the Will does not contain item Nos.3 and 4 

of the affidavit of assets. Even assuming that the plaintiff could claim vide intestate succession, 

she and the respondents 1 to 4 have to prove their legitimacy rights under the provisions of the 

Hindu Law. 

(i) Appeal in Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974 was allowed by the Supreme Court of India on 

17.04.1995 and the trial Court's judgment and decree was restored and the judgment debtors 

M/s.Buharis were directed to re-convey the suit properties in accordance with the trial Court's 

decree in C.S.No.43 of 1962, wherein, this defendant and late S.V.Ramakrishnan alone were 

plaintiffs. Under the provisions of Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, the plaintiff and 

respondents 1 to 3 could not claim to be decree-holders. In accordance with the order of the 

Supreme Court, this defendant filed Execution Petition in E.P.No.48 of 1997, which is still pending 

because of frivolous petitions filed by third parties as well as by the respondents 1 to 4 and the 

plaintiff herein. 

(j) The third respondent, for himself and on behalf of the plaintiff and respondents 1 and 2 

and even 4, filed objections to E.P.No.48 of 1997 after nearly five years after the pronouncement 

of the judgment by the Apex Court on 17.04.1995, claiming to be the legitimate claimants 

suppressing the Will, dated 15.07.1970. However, matters ensued further litigation and was finally 

decided on 17.04.2003 in S.L.P.(C).C.C.No.895 of 2003, in which, it is stated that, "It is hereby 

clarified that if any suit is filed interse the contending claimants to the ownership of the suit 

property then the question of ownership the number of owners and the extent of share shall be 

decided in that suit only." Even after the orders passed by the Apex Court on 17.04.2003, the 

plaintiff, though fully aware of the prevailing situations, made no attempt to probate the Will. 

(k) The matters relating to item Nos.3 and 4 are still being agitated in the Supreme Court 

because of the interference of third parties filing frivolous petitions with the intent to stall 

proceedings in the execution proceedings relating to E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962. The 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


12 

plaintiff, with the aid of the respondents 1 to 4, inter-meddled with the estate of late 

S.V.Ramakrishnan and in excess, has dealt with properties beyond the scope of the so-called 

Will. The plaintiff and others who had executed a sale deed relating to property bearing No.30, 

Ormes Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-600 010, purporting to be the legal heirs of late 

S.V.Ramakrishnan to Mr.D.K.Sekar, ended in Court proceedings in C.S.Nos.577 to 579 of 1995 

by judgment dated 22.01.2002, wherein it was declared that they cannot claim themselves as 

legal heirs of late S.V.Ramakrishnan and as such, the sale was deemed null and void. 

(l) The Will, dated 15.07.1970 does not contain any of the properties listed out in the 

affidavit of assets. Item Nos.1 and 2 properties are ancestral family properties, one being a 

Ganesha Temple and the other, a family burial ground, which incidentally cannot be Willed away 

to strangers such as the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 3 or even to respondent 4. Items 3 and 

4 are subject matter of pending suits, to which the plaintiff and respondents 1 to 4 have been 

agitating ever since 1999 and being unable to prove their legitimacy to claim the property, have 

now come forward after 29 years to probate the Will, knowing fully well that the Will does not 

contain the said properties, even at the loss of their status, only to deceive the Court and harass 

the respondents 5 and 6 from claiming what rightfully belongs to them and to further stall the 

progress of the Execution Petition in E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 in the Master's 

Court. 

(m) The statement in the Will that, "All the properties on the date of my death...", by no 

stretch of imagination could include the decree that would be passed 15 years after his death, the 

testator could not have envisaged the outcome of the pending suit Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974 

arising out of O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 on the file of the Supreme Court of 

India in the year 1970. The property had been passed on to M/s.Buharis by the Division Bench 

judgment in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966, as such, M/s.Buharis were the owners of the properties 

and in possession of the same. The testator did not possess item Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of 

assets as set out by the plaintiff, for him to deal with them. The testator died after 10 years after 

the execution of the Will, dated 15.07.1970 on 31.12.1980 and he, in no way altered the said Will

or annexe a codicil to the said Will in view of the situation prevailing during that period. The 

testator does not make any reference to the said pending suit C.A.No.224 of 1974 on the file of 

the Supreme Court of India or of its outcome to enable the beneficiaries to lay claim to those 

properties. 

(n) The plaintiff, with the help of her brother, the third respondent, had been misleading 

the Courts and she has been approbating and reprobating to suit her needs. The plaintiff, with the 

aid of the third respondent, had been abusing the process of Court. The second defendant prays 

that the suit may be dismissed. 

5. The plaintiff has filed reply statements separately, denying the averments made in the 

written statements filed by defendants 1 and 2. 

6. This Court, by order dated 06.11.2009, framed the following issues for consideration in 

the suit: 

(i) Whether the Will dated 15.07.1970 propounded to be the last Will of 

deceased S.V.Rama Krishnan is genuine and legally valid? 

(ii) Whether the suit Will was obtained by coercion and exerting undue 

influence as pleaded by the defendants ? 

(iii) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the grant of Letters of Administration 

as prayed for in this suit ? and 

(iv) To what other relief the parties are entitled ? 

7. During the course of trial, on the side of the plaintiff, the plaintiff was examined as 

P.W.1 (N.Renuka Devi) and P.W.2 B.Murali Kumar, P.W.3 N.Dheeraj Kumar, P.W.4 N.Divya 

Deepa and P.W.5 Dr.Philip Rajanna Doraiswamy, were examined and Exs.P-1 to P-78 were 

marked. On the side of the defendants, the first defendant was examined as D.W.1 (E.Lalitha) 

and the second defendant was examined as D.W.2 (S.V.Mathaprasad) and Exs.D-1 to D-25 

were marked. 

8. During the pendency of T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, the second defendant has filed the 

following applications for the relief stated therein: 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


14 

(a) A.No.4456 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is filed to direct the plaintiff to pay proper 

Court fees according to the market value of the suit properties which is Rs.34,85,27,994/-crores 

and make up the deficit of the Court fees. 

(b) A.No.4457 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is filed to pass a decree of dismissal of the 

suit filed by the plaintiff on the ground of admission. 

(c) A.No.4458 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is filed to reject the plaint in T.O.S.No.2 of 

2009 with regard to the properties listed in Annexure-A therein, specially, in regard to immovable 

properties Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of assets. 

(d) A.No.4533 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is filed to frame an additional issue on the 

question of limitation and to decide the said same as a preliminary issue. 

9. This Court, on a consideration of the pleadings and evidence adduced, both in the suit 

and in the above applications, heard the submissions made by learned counsel appearing for the 

parties and perused the relevant records. 

10. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff contended that the suit schedule properties 

belong to late S.V.Ramakrishnan and out of free consent, with sound and disposing state of mind, 

he executed the Will on 15.07.1970, which is marked as Ex.P-1. Subsequently, he died on 

31.12.1980. His Death Certificate is marked as Ex.P-23. The plaintiff is one of the daughters of 

the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and the said Will was executed in favour of the plaintiff with 

some conditions. Learned counsel for the plaintiff further contended that the first defendant is 

another daughter of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and the second defendant is his son. The 

wife of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan is S.V.R.Saroja and his first wife S.V.Rajalakshmi died. 

The said was executed by late S.V.Ramakrishnan in the city of Chennai in the presence of two 

attesting witnesses, both of whom died. The Will was registered in the Office of the Sub-Registrar, 

Purasawalkam, Chennai, as Document No.39 of 1970. Since both the witnesses are not alive, in 

order of prove their signatures, the close relatives of the attesting witnesses, namely P.W.2 

B.Murali Kumar and P.W.4 N.Divya Deepa were examined. In the said Will, it is stated that after 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


15 

the death of the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan, the properties were vested with the Office Trustee or 

such Office or person appointed by this Court and the said condition was restricted only till the 

plaintiff attains majority. In order to grant the Letters of Administration, the consent affidavits of the 

children of the plaintiff, i.e. N.Divya Deepa and N.Dheeraj Kumar, have been filed and marked as 

Exs.P.-33 and P-34 respectively. Learned counsel for the plaintiff further submitted that the 

defendants have no right, title or interest over the suit properties and since they have objected for 

grant of Letters of Administration, O.P.No.367 of 2008 earlier filed by the plaintiff, was converted 

as T.O.S.No.2 of 2009. The consent affidavits of the wife-S.V.R.Saroja, daughter-R.Vijayalakshim 

alias R.Vijaya, son-S.V.R.Ramprasad and another daughter R.S.P.Dhanurmathi, of the deceased 

S.V.Ramakrishnan, were marked as Exs.P-2 to P-5 respectively. The Birth Certificates of 

R.Vijaya, S.V.R.Ramprasad, the plaintiff-N.Renuka Devi and S.V.R.Dhanurmathi, were marked as 

Exs.P-7 to 10 respectively. The other son of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, namely the second 

defendant herein (S.V.Mathaprasad) filed a suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 against the plaintiff's father 

and the plaint copy of the said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 is marked as Ex.P-12. The copy of the 

written statement filed by the plaintiff's father in the said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 is marked as 

Ex.P-13. The copy of the decree, dated 30.10.1972 passed in the said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 is 

marked as Ex.P-14. 

11. Learned counsel for the plaintiff further contended that the plaintiff's mother 

S.V.R.Saroja execute a sale deed, dated 01.07.1983 in favour of Lakshmi Builders and 

M/s.Kumaran Illam and the copy of the same is marked as Ex.P-15. She also executed a sale 

deed, dated 15.02.1983 in favour of S.Palanisamy and the copy of the same is marked as Ex.P-

16. She also executed a sale deed, dated 09.02.1987, in favour of Mrs.Geetha Ravichandran and 

the copy of the same is marked as Ex.P-17. She further executed a sale deed, dated 21.10.1989 

in favour of Padmavathi and the copy of the same is marked as Ex.P-18. The son the second 

defendant herein, i.e. M.D.Prasad, filed a suit before this Court against S.V.Matha Prasad, the 

defendant herein and others, in C.S.No.159 of 2002 and the copy of the plaint in C.S.No.159 of 

2002 is marked as Ex.P-24. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff further submitted that 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


16 

M/s.Lakshmi Builders filed a suit in C.S.No.469 of 1981 before this Court against Mrs.Saroja and 

others, and the orders, dated 17.03.1982 and 12.02.1997 passed in C.S.No.469 of 1981 are 

marked as Exs.P-26 and P-27. The third party affidavits filed by the plaintiff, along with O.P., is 

marked as Exs.P-30 and 38. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff further contended that 

the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and S.V.Mathaprasad earlier filed a suit in C.S.No.43 of 1962 

before this Court against Buhari and another; the copy of the plaint in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is 

marked as Ex.P-71 = Ex.D-13; the copy of the decree, dated 10.11.1965 passed in C.S.No.43 of 

1962 is marked as Ex.P-72 = Ex.D-14. As against the said decree, dated 10.11.1965 passed in 

C.S.No.43 of 1962, the appeals in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 were preferred, which were 

disposed of by the Division Bench of this Court on 10.05.1972, against which, Civil Appeal in 

C.A.No.224 of 1974 was preferred before the Supreme Court. The copy of the affidavit filed in 

I.A.No.2 of 2008 in Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974 filed before the Supreme Court is marked as 

Ex.P-78. The judgment dated 17.04.1995 passed by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.224 of 

1974 is marked as Ex.P-28, with amended cause title therein, which is marked as Ex.P-29. 

Subsequently E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 was preferred by S.V.Ramakrishna 

Mudaliar (since deceased) and S.V.Matha Prasad, the second defendant herein, and the order 

dated 07.07.2000 passed in the said E.P. is marked as Ex.D-6. The counter affidavit filed by the 

second defendant herein in A.Nos.2872 and 2873 of 2000 in E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 

1962 is marked as Ex.P-55. The copy of the order dated 24.08.2000 passed in A.Nos.2872 and 

2873 of 2000 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-56 = Ex.D-18. There are some other suits 

filed by various parties and the relevant documents in those suits are marked on the side of the 

plaintiff to substantiate their case. 

12. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff further submitted that to prove the Will 

executed by S.V.Ramakrishnan, on the side of the plaintiff, close relatives of the attesting 

witnesses to the Will, namely P.W.2 B.Muralikumar and P.W.5 Dr.Philip Rajanna Doraiswamy, 

were examined, who spoke about the signatures of the attesting witness to the Will and its 

registration. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff further stated that there is mention about 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


17 

the Will Ex.P-1 in subsequent documents, in which, the defendants are also parties, and hence, 

he submitted that the genuineness of the Will cannot be questioned at this stage by the 

defendants. He further contended that the only defence raised by the defendants in their case is 

that the Will was obtained by undue influence, which has not been proved by the defendants 

through evidence. The Will was executed by the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan out of free consent 

and while he was in a sound and disposing state of mind, and the Will was duly registered before 

the Registrar Office, and hence, the Will has been proved by the plaintiff by adducing evidence. 

13. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff also submitted that after the death of the 

testator S.V.Ramakrishnan on 31.12.1980, the plaintiff has taken steps to execute the Will by 

filing O.P.No.367 of 2008 before this Court for grant of Letters of Administration, and though there 

may be some delay, the delay may not defeat the rights of the plaintiff and that, as contended by 

the learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants, the T.O.S. may not be dismissed, 

since Article 137 of the Limitation Act will not apply to the facts of the present case and in this 

regard, he relied on the judgment of the First Bench of this Court in O.S.A.Nos.10 and 72 of 2013, 

dated 07.01.2016. Hence, learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff submitted that the T.O.S. 

may not be dismissed as time barred. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff also submitted 

that even though it is contended on the side of the defendants that the suit properties were under-

valued by the plaintiff and no proper Court fee was filed, the defendants have not proved their 

case with regard to the market value of the properties by relevant oral or documentary evidence. 

14. For all the above reasons, learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff prayed that the 

Letters of Administration may be granted in favour of the plaintiff and the T.O.S. may be decreed 

as prayed for. In support of his submissions, learned counsel for the plaintiff relied on the 

following decisions: 

(a) 2005 (1) CTC 304 (SC) (Iridium India Telecom Ltd. Vs. Motorola Inc.): 

"2. This appeal impugns the judgment of the Division Bench of the 
High Court of Judicature at Bombay in a letters patent appeal holding that the 
amended provision of Order 8, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
(hereinafter referred to as "CPC") would not apply to the suits on the original 
side of the High Court and that such suits would continue to be governed by 
the High Court Original Side Rules.

... ... 
14. Prior to the establishing of the chartered High Courts by the British 
Government in 1862, the civil courts in the Presidency of Bombay were 
governed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1859 (Act No.VIII of 1859, which 
received the assent of the Governor General on 22.3.1859). This Act, as its 
preamble suggests, was 'an Act for simplifying the procedure of the Courts of 
Civil Judicature not established by Royal Charter' and was not intended to 
apply to High Courts established by Royal Charter. 
15. The First Letters Patent or Charter establishing High Courts was 
accompanied by a Despatch from the Secretary of State on 14.5.1862, and 
was in force till revoked by a further Letters Patent on 28.12.1865. The learned 
counsel drew our attention to para 36 of the Despatch, which explains the 
purpose of Clause 37 in the First Letters Patent. The said paragraph 36 of the 
Despatch reads as under: 
"36. Clause 37 is a very important one, and there 
is little doubt, will prove a very salutary provision. It has, 
therefore, been inserted, although the change introduced 
is somewhat greater and more substantial than is 
generally aimed at in this Charter. It extends to the High 
Court the Code of Civil Procedure enacted by the 
legislature of India for the Court, not established by Royal 
Charter, and thus accomplishes the object so long 
contemplated of substituting one simple Code of 
Procedure for the various systems (corresponding to its 
common law, equity and admiralty jurisdiction) which have 
been in operation in the Supreme Court since the date of 
its establishment." 

16. It is therefore seen that Clause 37 of the Letters Patent was 
intended to extend to the High Courts the Code of Civil Procedure enacted 
by the Legislature of India for the Courts other than the Courts established 
by the Royal Charter. The intention was to substitute one simple Code of 
Procedure for the various systems which had been in operation in the 
Supreme Court since the date of its establishment. 
17. Clause 37 of the Letters Patent of 1865, which deals with "civil 
procedure and regulation of proceedings", reads as follows: 
"37. And we do further ordain that it shall be lawful for the 
said High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal, from time 
to time, to make rules and orders for the purpose of regulating all 
proceedings in civil cases which may be brought before the said 
High Court, including proceedings in its Admiralty, Vice-Admiralty, 
Testamentary, 
Intestate 
and 
Matrimonial 
Jurisdictions, 
respectively: 
Provided that the said High Court shall be guided in 
making such rules and orders as far as possible, by the provisions 
of the Code of Civil Procedure, being an Act passed by the 
Governor-General-in-Council, and being Act No.VIII of 1859, and 
the provisions of any law which has been made amending or 
altering the same, by competent legislative authority for India." 
(Letters Patents of the three High Courts, namely, Calcutta, 
Bombay and Madras are identically worded.) 

18. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1877 (Act No.X of 1877), which 
received the assent of the Governor General on 30.3.1877, and was 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


19 

thereafter brought into force with effect from 1.10.1877, was "an Act to 
consolidate and amend the laws relating to the procedure of the Court of 
Civil Judicature". Part IX of this Act contained special rules relating to the 
Chartered High Courts. Chapter XLVIII of the Act applied only to the 
Chartered High Courts. Section 632 of the Civil Procedure Code of 1877, 
in express words, provided: "except as provided in this Chapter the 
provisions of this Code apply to such High Courts". Section 638 was the 
exception to the general rule and provided as under: 
"The following portions of this Code shall not apply to the 
High Court in the exercise of its ordinary or extraordinary original 
civil jurisdiction, namely, Sections 16 and 17, Sections 54, 
Clauses (a) and (b), 57, 119, 160, 182 to 185 (both inclusive), 
187, 189, 190, 191, 192 (so far as relates to the manner of taking 
evidence), 198 to 206 (both inclusive), 261, and so much of 
Section 409 as relates to the making of a memorandum; and 
Section 579 shall not apply to the High Court in the exercise of its 
appellate jurisdiction. 
Nothing in this Code shall extend or apply to any High Court in the 
exercise of its jurisdiction as an Insolvency Court." 

19. The Legislature recognised the special role assigned to the 
chartered High Courts and exempted them from the application of several 
provisions of the Code in the exercise of their ordinary or extraordinary 
civil jurisdiction for the simple reason that those jurisdictions were 
governed by the procedure prescribed by the rules made in exercise of 
the powers of the Chartered High Courts under Clause 37 of the Letters 
Patent. Interestingly, Section 652 of this Act itself empowered the High 
Courts to make rules 'consistent with this Code to regulate any matter 
connected with the procedure of the Courts of Civil Judicature subject to 
its superintendence', suggesting that consistency with the Code was a 
sine qua non only when making rules for the subordinate Courts. 
... ... 
32. There cannot be any doubt about the principle of harmonious 
construction. However, what confronts us is not a mere question of two 
independent provisions of the CPC being in conflict. The provisions of the 
CPC, which we have extracted, and the historical development of the 
different sections to which we have referred, do not suggest a situation of 
mere conflict. They seem to suggest that, throughout, the Legislature had 
made a distinction between the proceedings in other civil Courts and the 
proceedings on the Original Side of the Chartered High Courts. This 
distinction was made for good historical reasons and it had continued 
unabated, as we have noticed, through the consolidating Acts, and 
continued unaffected even through the last amendment of the CPC in the 
year 2002. In the face of this body of evidence, it is difficult to accede to 
the contention of the appellant that the force of the non-obstante clause is 
merely declaratory and not intended to operate as a declared exception to 
the general body of the CPC. 
... ... 
35. Reference was made to A.G.Varadarajulu and Anr. Vs. State 
of Tamil Nadu and Ors., AIR 1998 SC 1388, at para 16. This judgment 
merely followed the observations made in Aswini Kumar (supra) -Aswini 
Kumar Ghosh Vs. Arabinda Bose,1953 SCR (1) 377 and Madhav Rao 
Scindia Vs. Union of India, 1971 (1) SCC 85 at p.139. There is no doubt 
that where the non obstante clause is widely worded, "a search has, 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


20 

therefore, to be made with a view to determining which provision answers 
the description and which does not". The historical development of the law 
suggests that the non obstante clause in Section 129 is intended to 
bypass the entire body of the Code so far as the rules made by the 
Chartered High Court for regulating the procedure on its Original Side are 
concerned. 
.. ... 
47. Finally, it was argued by Mr.Jethmalani that the Letters Patent, 
and the rules made thereunder by the High Court for regulating its 
procedure on the Original Side, were subordinate legislation and, 
therefore, must give way to the superior legislation, namely, the 
substantive provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. There are two 
difficulties in accepting this argument. In the first place, Section 2(18) of 
the CPC defines "rules" to mean "rules and forms contained in the First 
Schedule or made under Section 122 or Section 125". The conspicuous 
absence of reference to the rules regulating the procedure to be followed 
on the Original Side of a Chartered High Court makes it clear that those 
rules are not "rules" as defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. 
Secondly, it is not possible to accept the contention that the Letters Patent 
and rules made thereunder, which are recognised and specifically 
protected by Section 129, are relegated to a subordinate status, as 
contended by the learned counsel. We might usefully refer to the 
observations of the Constitutional Bench of this Court in P.S.Santhappan 
(Dead) by LRs. Vs. Andhra Bank Ltd. & Ors., JT 2004 (8) SC 464. With 
reference to Letters Patent, this is what the Constitution Bench said: 
"148. It was next submitted that Clause 44 of the 
Letters Patent showed that Letters Patent were subject to 
amendment and alteration. It was submitted that this showed 
that a Letters Patent was a subordinate or subservient piece of 
law. Undoubtedly, Clause 44 permits amendment or alteration 
of Letters Patent, but then which legislation is not subject to 
amendment or alteration? CPC is also subject to amendments 
and alterations. In fact it has been amended on a number of 
occasions. The only unalterable provisions are the basic 
structure of our Constitution. Merely because there is a 
provision for amendment does not mean that, in the absence 
of an amendment or a contrary provision, the Letters Patent is 
to be ignored. To submit that a Letters Patent is a subordinate 
piece of legislation is to not understand the true nature of a 
Letters Patent. As has been held in Vinita Khanolkar's, JT 1997 
(9) SC 490 case and Sharda Devi's, JT 2002 (3) SC 43 case a 
Letters Patent is the Charter of the High Court. As held in 
Shah Babulal Khimaji's, 1982 (1) SCR 187 case a Letters 
Patent is the specific law under which a High Court derives its 
powers. It is not any subordinate piece of legislation. As set out 
in aforementioned two cases a Letters Patent cannot be 
excluded by implication. Further it is settled law that between a 
special law and a general law the special law will always 
prevail. A Letters Patent is a special law for the concerned 
High Court. Civil Procedure Code is a general law applicable to 
all Courts. It is well settled law, that in the event of a conflict 
between a special law and a general law, the special law must 
always prevail. We see no conflict between Letters Patent and 
Section 104 but if there was any conflict between a Letters 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


21 

Patent and the Civil Procedure Code then the provisions of the 
Letters Patent would always prevail unless there was a specific 
exclusion. This is also clear from Section 4 of the Civil 
Procedure Code which provides that nothing in the Code shall 
limit or affect any special law. As set out in Section 4 CPC only 
a specific provision to the contrary can exclude the special law. 
The specific provision would be a provision like Section 100-A." 

(b) 2014 (4) SCC 434 (R.Unnikrishnan Vs. V.K. Mahanudevan): 

"19. It is trite that law favours finality to binding judicial decisions 
pronounced by courts that are competent to deal with the subject-matter. 
Public interest is against individuals being vexed twice over with the same 
kind of litigation. The binding character of the judgments pronounced by the 
courts of competent jurisdiction has always been treated as an essential 
part of the rule of law which is the basis of the administration of justice in 
this country. We may gainfully refer to the decision of the Constitution 
Bench of this Court in Daryao Vs. State of U.P. (AIR 1961 SC 1457) where 
the Court succinctly summed up the law in the following words: (AIR 
p.1462, paras 9 & 11) 
"9. … It is in the interest of the public at large that 
a finality should attach to the binding decisions 
pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction, and it is 
also in the public interest that individuals should not be 
vexed twice over with the same kind of litigation. 
* 
* 
* 
11. … The binding character of judgments 
pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction is itself an 
essential part of the rule of law, and the rule of law 
obviously is the basis of the administration of justice on 
which the Constitution lays so much emphasis." 

20. That even erroneous decisions can operate as res judicata is 
also fairly well settled by a long line of decisions rendered by this Court. In 
Mohanlal Goenka Vs. Benoy Kishna Mukherjee (AIR 1953 SC 65) this 
Court observed: (AIR p.72, para 23) 
"23. There is ample authority for the proposition 
that even an erroneous decision on a question of law 
operates as 'res judicata' between the parties to it. The 
correctness or otherwise of a judicial decision has no 
bearing upon the question whether or not it operates as 
'res judicata'. " 

21. Similarly, in State of W.B. Vs. Hemant Kumar Bhattacharjee 
(AIR 1966 SC 1061 : 1966 Cri.L.J. 805) this Court reiterated the above 
principles in the following words: (AIR p.1066, para 14) 
"14. … A wrong decision by a court having 
jurisdiction is as much binding between the parties as a 
right one and may be superseded only by appeals to 
higher tribunals or other procedure like review which the 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


22 

law provides." 

22. The recent decision of this Court in Kalinga Mining Corpn. Vs. 
Union of India (2013 (5) SCC 252 : 2013 (2) SCC (Civ) 797) is a timely 
reminder of the very same principle. The following passage in this regard is 
apposite: (SCC pp.267-68, para 44) 
"44. … In our opinion, if the parties are allowed to 
reagitate issues which have been decided by a court of 
competent jurisdiction on a subsequent change in the law 
then all earlier litigation relevant thereto would always 
remain in a state of flux. In such circumstances, every 
time either a statute or a provision thereof is declared 
ultra vires, it would have the result of reopening of the 
decided matters within the period of limitation following 
the date of such decision." 

23. In Mathura Prasad Bajoo Jaiswal Vs. Dossibai N.B.Jeejeebhoy 
(1970 (1) SCC 613) this Court held that for the application of the rule of res 
judicata, the court is not concerned with the correctness or otherwise of the 
earlier judgment. The matter in issue if one purely of fact decided in the 
earlier proceedings by a competent court must in any subsequent litigation 
between the same parties be recorded as finally decided and cannot be 
reopened. That is true even in regard to mixed questions of law and fact 
determined in the earlier proceeding between the same parties which 
cannot be revised or reopened in a subsequent proceeding between the 
same parties. Having said that we must add that the only exception to the 
doctrine of res judicata is "fraud" that vitiates the decision and renders it a 
nullity. This Court has in more than one decision held that fraud renders any 
judgment, decree or order a nullity and non est in the eye of the law. In 
A.V.Papayya Sastry Vs. State of A.P. (2007 (4) SCC 221), "fraud" was 
defined by this Court in the following words: (SCC pp.231-32, para 26) 
"26. Fraud may be defined as an act of deliberate 
deception with the design of securing some unfair or 
undeserved benefit by taking undue advantage of another. 
In fraud one gains at the loss [and cost] of another. Even 
most solemn proceedings stand vitiated if they are 
actuated by fraud. Fraud is thus an extrinsic collateral act 
which vitiates all judicial acts, whether in rem or in 
personam. The principle of 'finality of litigation' cannot be 
stretched to the extent of an absurdity that it can be utilised 
as an engine of oppression by dishonest and fraudulent 
litigants."

16. The controversy pertaining to the provisions contained in Order 
14 Rule 2, had come up for consideration before this Court in Major 
S.S.Khanna Vs. Brig.F.J.Dillon, AIR 1964 SC 497 : 1964 (4) SCR 409, 
wherein it has been ruled thus: 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


23 

"Under Order 14, Rule 2, where issues both of law and of 
fact arise in the same Suit, and the Court is of opinion that the case 
or any part thereof may be disposed of on the issue of law only, it 
shall try those issues first, and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit, 
postpone the settlement of the issues of fact until after the issues of 
law have been determined. The jurisdiction to try issues of law apart 
from the issues of fact may be exercised only where in the opinion 
of the Court the whole Suit may be disposed of on the issues of law 
alone, but the Code confers no jurisdiction upon the Court to try a 
Suit on mixed issues of law and fact as Preliminary issues. Normally 
all issues in a Suit should be tried by the Court: not to do so, 
especially when the decision on issues even of law depends upon 
the decision of issues of fact, would result in a lop-sided trial of the 
Suit". 
... ... 
18. In Ramesh D.Desai and others Vs. Bipin Vadilal Mehta and 
others, 2006 (5) SCC 638, while dealing with the issue of limitation, the Court 
opined that a plea of limitation cannot be decided as an abstract principle of 
law divorced from facts as in every case the starting point of limitation has to 
be ascertained which is entirely a question of fact. The Court further 
proceeded to state that a plea of limitation is a mixed question of fact and 
law. On a plain consideration of the language employed in sub-rule (2) of 
Order 14 it can be stated with certitude that when an issue requires an inquiry 
into facts it cannot be tried as a Preliminary issue. In the said Judgment the 
Court opined as follows: 
"13. Sub-rule (2) of Order 14, Rule 2, C.P.C., lays down 
that where issues both of law and of fact arise in the same Suit, and 
the Court is of the opinion that the case or any part thereof may be 
disposed of on an issue of law only, it may try that issue first if that 
issue relates to (a) the jurisdiction of the Court, or (b) a bar to the 
Suit created by any law for the time being in force. The provisions 
of this Rule came up for consideration before this Court in Major 
S.S.Khanna Vs. Brig.F.J.Dillon and it was held as under: (SCR 
p.421) 
"Under Order 14, Rule 2, Code of Civil Procedure 
where issues both of law and of fact arise in the same Suit, 
and the Court is of opinion that the case or any part thereof 
may be disposed of on the issues of law only, it shall try 
those issues first, and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit, 
postpone the settlement of the issues of fact until after the 
issues of law have been determined. The jurisdiction to try 
issues of law apart from the issues of fact may be exercised 
only where in the opinion of the Court the whole Suit may be 
disposed of on the issues of law alone, but the Code confers 
no jurisdiction upon the Court to try a Suit on mixed issues of 
law and fact as preliminary issues. Normally all the issues in 
a Suit should be tried by the Court; not to do so, especially 
when the decision on issues even of law depend upon the 
decision of issues of fact, would result in a lopsided trial of 
the Suit". 

Though there has been a slight amendment in the language of 
Order 14, Rule 2, C.P.C., by the amending Act, 1976 but the 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


24 

principle enunciated in the above quoted decision still holds good 
and there can be no departure from the principle that the Code 
confers no jurisdiction upon the Court to try a Suit on mixed issues 
of law and fact as a Preliminary issue and where the decision on 
issue of law depends upon decision of fact, it cannot be tried as a 
preliminary issue". 

19. In the case at hand, we find that unless there is determination 
of the fact which would not protect the Plaintiff under Section 10 of the 
Limitation Act the Suit cannot be dismissed on the ground of limitation. It is 
not a case which will come within the ambit and sweep of Order 14, Rule 2, 
which would enable the Court to frame a Preliminary issue to adjudicate 
thereof. The learned Single Judge, as it appears, has remained totally 
oblivious of the said fact and adjudicated the issue as if it falls under Order 
14, Rule 2. We repeat that on the scheme of Section 10 of the Limitation 
Act we find certain facts are to be established to throw the lis from the 
sphere of the said provision so that it would come within the concept of 
limitation. The Division Bench has fallen into some error without 
appreciating the facts in proper perspective. That apart, the Division 
Bench, by taking recourse of Articles 92 to 96 without appreciating the 
factum that it uses the words "transferred by the trustee for a valuable 
consideration" in that event the limitation would be twelve years but in the 
instant case the asseveration of the Plaintiff is that the Trustee had created 
three Settlement Deeds in favour of his two daughters and a grand-
daughter. The issue of consideration has not yet emerged. This settlement 
made by the father was whether for consideration or not has to be gone 
into and similarly whether the property belongs to the Trust as Trust is 
understood within the meaning of Section 10 of the Limitation Act has also 
to be gone into. Ergo, there can be no shadow of doubt that the Issue No.1 
that was framed by the learned Single Judge was an issue that pertained to 
fact and law and hence, could not have been adjudicated as a Preliminary 
Issue. Therefore, the impugned Order is wholly unsustainable." 

(d) 2014 (6) CTC 80 (SC) (Leela Rajagopal Vs. Kamala Menon Cocharan): 

"10. A Will may have certain features and may have been executed 
in certain circumstances which may appear to be somewhat unnatural. Such 
unusual features appearing in a Will or the unnatural circumstances 
surrounding its execution will definitely justify a close scrutiny before the 
same can be accepted. It is the overall assessment of the Court on the basis 
of such scrutiny; the cumulative effect of the unusual features and 
circumstances which would weigh with the Court in the determination 
required to be made by it. The judicial verdict, in the last resort, will be on the 
basis of a consideration of all the unusual features and suspicious 
circumstances put together and not on the impact of any single feature that 
may be found in a Will or a singular circumstance that may appear from the 
process leading to its execution or registration. This, is the essence of the 
repeated pronouncements made by this Court on the subject including the 
decisions referred to and relied upon before us. 
11. In the present case, a close reading of the will indicates its clear 
language, and its unambiguous purport and effect. The mind of the testator 
is clearly discernible and the reasons for exclusion of the sons is apparent 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


25 

from the will itself. Insofar as the place of execution is concerned, the 
inconsistency appearing in the verification filed along with the application for 
probate by PW 3 and the oral evidence of the said witness tendered in court 
is capable of being understood in the light of the fact that the verification is in 
a standard form (Form No. 55) prescribed by the Madras High Court on the 
Original Side, as already noticed. Besides, in the facts of the present case 
the participation of the first respondent in the execution and registration of 
the Will cannot be said to be a circumstance that would warrant an adverse 
conclusion. The conduct of the first respondent in summoning her friend 
(PW.3) to be an attesting witness and in taking the testator to the office of 
the Sub-Registrar should, again, not warrant any adverse conclusion. It also 
cannot escape notice that the Will dated 11.1.1982 is identical with the 
contents of the earlier Will dated 28.12.1981. Insofar as the execution of the 
Will dated 28.12.1981 and its registration is concerned no active 
participation has been attributed to the first respondent. The change of the 
Attesting Witnesses and the non-examination of Seetha Padmanabhan, who 
had attested the second Will dated 11.1.1982 has been sufficiently 
explained. 
... ... 
13. All the unusual and allegedly suspicious circumstances being 
capable of being understood in the manner indicated above, we cannot find 
any fault with the conclusions reached by the High Court while reversing the 
judgment of the learned Trial Court." 

(e) AIR 1974 SC 1999 (Surendra Pal and others Vs. Dr.(Mrs.)Saraswati Arora and 

another): 

"9. The Appellate Court agreeing with the trial Judge held that 
Respondent 1 was merely present at the time of the execution of the Will 
and did not have anything to do with its execution. The case of Appellant 1 
was that as a condition of the marriage arrangement, the Will was 
executed and because of that Bhim Sain made no provision for the 
maintenance of his aged mother or for the maintenance and marriage of 
his youngest daughter Rita who was then studying. Instead he gave away 
the entire property to Respondent 1 which is a suspicious circumstance 
and raises an inference of undue influence. This submission was clearly 
negatived, and on the evidence there can be no gainsaying the fact that 
the conclusions to which both the Courts have come to are unassailable. It 
is not for us to fathom the motivations of a man. His actions and reactions 
are unpredictable as they depend upon so many circumstances. There is, 
however, always some dominant and impelling circumstance which 
motivates a man's action though in some cases even a trivial and trifling 
cause impels him to act in a particular way which a majority of others may 
not do. At times psychological factors and the frame of mind in which he is, 
may determine his action. 
... ... 
14. Apart from general considerations emerging from the nature of 
a Will and the circumstances which not infrequently surround the 
execution of it, there are other matters which are peculiar to the times and 
the society and perhaps even to the person making the Will and his or her 
family. Inferences arising from relationships between a testator and a 
legatee are certainly so dependent upon the peculiarities of the society or 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


26 

community to which the testator and the legatee belong, their habits and 
customs, their values, their mores, their ways of thinking and feeling, their 
susceptibilities to particular kinds of pressures, influences, or inducements 
that it seems very difficult to reduce them to a general rule applicable at all 
times and everywhere so as to raise a presumption of undue influence 
from a particular type of relationship. The only kinds of relationship giving 
rise to such presumptions are those contemplated in Section 111 of the 
Evidence Act. Any other presumption from a relationship must, to be 
acceptable, be capable of being raised only under Section 114 of the 
Evidence Act. Such presumptions of fact are really optional inferences 
from proof of a frequently recurring set of facts which make a particular 
inference from such facts reasonable and natural. If a particular situation 
arising from a set of facts, which may raise a presumption elsewhere, is 
exceptional or unusual here, there could be no question here of applying a 
presumption arising from a common or natural course of events. A 
suggested inference of undue influence would then be a matter of proof on 
the particular facts of the case before the Court. This, we think is the 
correct legal position here. 
15. The case before us could certainly not fall within Section 111 
of the Evidence Act. There is no presumption of law or fact in this country 
that a woman to whom a man is engaged to be married is in a position to 
dominate his will so as to over-ride his own real intentions. It is not mere 
influence, but undue influence, which has to be proved by the party which 
sets up such a case. We think that a plea of undue influence, where set 
up, is a special plea. Section 103 of the Evidence Act places the burden of 
substantiating such a plea on the party which sets it up. 
... ... 
17. In the instant case, there was no suggestion that the testator 
was feeble minded or so completely deprived of his power of independent 
thought and judgment as to faithfully carry out the wishes of the lady to 
whom he became engaged and then married. In fact, it appears that it was 
he who might have offered the inducement voluntarily to the lady 
concerned to agree to share his life. Upon the facts of such a case, no 
presumption of the kind urged before us on behalf of the appellant could, 
in our opinion reasonably arise in any country, at any time, in any society. 
... ... 
20. We have also no doubt that the Will was genuine. All the 
formalities required were fully satisfied, it was executed by the testator in a 
sound disposing mind and it was duly attested as required by law." 

(f) AIR 1955 SC 363 (Naresh Charan Das Gupta v. Paresh Charan Das Gupta and 

another): 

"5. The facts so far as they are material for this issue, may now be 
stated. The testator was a police officer and retired in 1927 as Deputy 
Superintendent of Police. Paresh Charan, the elder son, was married in 
1925, and lived all along with his parents with his wife and children. 
Nirmala, the wife of the testator, died in 1929, and thereafter it was the wife 
of Paresh Charan that was maintaining the home. Naresh Charan studied 
up to I.A., but in 1920 discontinued his studies and got into employment in 
the workshop of Tata & Co., at Jamshedpur on a petty salary; and the 
evidence is that thereafter he was practically living apart from the family. In 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


27 

1928 he married one Shantimayi, who was a widow having some children 
by her first husband. She belonged to the Kayastha caste, whereas Naresh 
Charan belonged to the Baid caste. The testator was strongly opposed to 
this intercaste marriage, and did his best to stop it but without success. The 
correspondence that followed between the appellant and his father during 
this period clearly shows that the father felt very sore over this alliance, and 
wrote that it could not pain him even if his son died. 

6. With this background, we may turn to the will. The relevant 
recitals therein are as follows: 
"My younger son Sri Naresh Charan Das Gupta is behaving 
badly with me and without my knowledge and consent he has married 
a girl of a different caste and she has given birth to two female 
children and one male child. In these circumstances my said son Sri 
Naresh Charan Das Gupta and his son Sreeman Arun Gupta and the 
two daughters or any other son or daughter who may be born to him, 
will not be entitled to perform my sradh or to offer me pindas. For all 
these reasons I deprive my second son Sri Naresh Charan and his 
son Sreeman Arun Gupta and his two daughters and any other sons 
or daughters who may be born to him as well as Naresh's wife 
Sreemati Santi of inheritance from me and from all my movable and 
immovable properties, ancestral as well as self-acquired. They shall 
not get any share or interest or possession in any of my aforesaid 
properties". 

It is not disputed that these recitals accord with what the testator had 
expressed in the correspondence at the time of the marriage and for some 
years thereafter. But it is argued that since then, more than a decade had 
passed before the will was executed, and that during this period the natural 
affection of the testator for his son had reasserted itself, that he had 
forgiven and forgotten the past, and that when the will was actually 
executed, the recitals above extracted did not correctly reflect the then mind 
of the testator. 

6a. We have been taken through the entire correspondence that 
passed between the testator and the appellant and the members of his 
family. It shows that the testator was solicitous about the welfare of the 
appellant, and was enquiring about his health and sending him on 
occasions medicines; that he was affectionately disposed towards his 
children and was sending them presents of cloth; that latterly he had so far 
modified his attitude towards the wife of the appellant as to invite her and 
her children to Calcutta; that he himself stayed with them for some time at 
Jamshedpur and was giving advice to the appellant on matters connected 
with his employment. It was argued that there was thus a gradual change of 
heart on the part of the father towards the appellant and the members of his 
family, that the recitals in the will could not be reconciled with this change of 
attitude, and that they must have been inspired by the first respondent. 

We are unable to agree. It is one thing for a father who feels that he has 
been wronged by a disobedient son to wish him well in life, and quite 
another thing to give him any of his properties. In the whole of the 
correspondence which has been read to us, there is nothing to suggest that 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


28 

he wanted the appellant to share in the estate. On the other hand, there are 
indications that even when the appellant was in financial difficulties, the 
testator considered that he was under no sort of obligation to come to his 
help. Vide Exs.5(c) and C(1). It may be mentioned that after making the will 
on 28-11-1943, the testator continued to correspond with the appellant and 
the members of his family precisely in the same terms as before. Vide 
Exs.B(2), C(4) and A(10). That shows that the two currents of natural 
affection and settlement of properties flowed in distinct channels, and that 
the change in the course of the one had no effect on the direction of the 
other. 
7. The testator, it is clear from the correspondence, was a man of 
strong will, determined and unshakable in his resolutions. He wrote of 
himself in Ex.C(34) that "I am one-third conservative, one-third liberal and 
one-third autocratic". He was very solicitous about the family prestige and 
reputation, and felt deeply hurt when his son entered into a marriage which 
was viewed by his community with disfavour. In Ex.6(c) he wrote, 

"You broke our hearts for a woman who has no right to be in my house." 
And as late as 25-12-1941 he wrote to the appellant that if his wife and 
children came to live with him "they must prepare themselves to meet 
uncalled for taunts and unpleasant enquiries which may be made by our 
near and distant village relations in our society who will come to see us". 
(Vide Exhibit C(37)). 

There cannot, therefore, be any doubt that the testator was all along 
smarting under a sense of social humiliation by reason of the inter-caste-
marriage, and that the recitals in the will were manifestations of a sore in 
his heart which had remained unhealed to the last. 

8. It was also argued that the dispositions in the will were unnatural 
in that the appellant had been practically disinherited and his children 
altogether ignored. This by itself cannot lead to any inference of undue 
influence on the part of the first respondent. Having regard to the character 
of the testator and his feelings in the matter it is not a matter for surprise 
that he should have cut off the appellant with a small legacy. It must also be 
mentioned that the net value of the assets as given in the Probate petition is 
Rs.23,865-10-9, and if the other legacies and charges are deducted, what 
was bequeathed to the first respondent cannot be said to be very 
considerable. It also appears that at that time his salary was Rs.60/-per 
mensem and that he had a number of children, whereas the appellant is 
stated to have had a basic salary of Rs.250/-per mensem then. 
Respondent 1, his wife and children have all along been dependents of the 
testator, whereas the appellant had lived apart from him from 1920. And it 
is not unnatural for the testator so to order the distribution of his estate as to 
secure the continuance of the existing state of affairs. The terms of the will, 
therefore, cannot be relied on as intrinsic evidence of undue influence, as 
contended for by the appellant. 
9. Then there is the evidence of Indira, the daughter of the testator, 
which was taken on commission. She deposed that the testator had told her 
that there were troubles in the house, that the elder son had objection to 
stay with the younger one, "because if they live together, there will be social 
trouble regarding his daughter's marriage", and that he therefore wanted to 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


29 

make a will She went on to add that the father subsequently wanted to alter 
the will and sent for her repeatedly for discussions, but that she generally 
excused herself, because she did not like to intervene in the matter, and 
that on those occasions, he told her, "At present this will stand, but I want to 
modify it in future". 

Indira also deposed that the first respondent and his wife used to tell the 
testator that there was no change in the conduct of the appellant, that he 
was extravagant in his habits and incurred debts, and that he had taken 
away some articles. We do not consider that it is safe to act on this 
evidence. It is clear from Ex.1 that Indira and her husband had taken sides 
with the appellant as against the first respondent, and wrote to him that in 
spite of the will the appellant "should have his share as early as possible in 
order to avoid further complication", though it may be noted that they 
insisted on their rights under the will. Stripped of all its embellishments, the 
evidence of Indira, if true, comes only to this that the first respondent told 
his father that he could not live under the same roof with his brother, and 
that in view of that attitude, the testator gave no share to the appellant in 
the house. We are unable to see any undue influence in this. The first 
respondent was entitled to put forward his views in the matter, and so long 
as the ultimate decision lay with the testator and his mental capacity was 
unimpaired, there can be no question of undue influence. 
10. It is elementary law that it is not every influence which is 
brought to bear on a testator that can be characterised as "undue". It is 
open to a person to plead his case before the testator and to persuade him 
to make a disposition in his favour. And if the testator retains his mental 
capacity, and there is no element of fraud or coercion-it has often been 
observed that undue influence may in the last analysis be brought under 
one or the other of these two categories-the will cannot be attacked on the 
ground of undue influence. The law was thus stated by Lord Penzance in 
'Hall Vs. Hall (1868) 1 P and D 481 at p.482 (C): 
"But all influences are not unlawful. Persuasion, appeals to 
the affections or ties of kindred, to a sentiment of gratitude for past 
services, or pity for future destitution, or the like,-these are all 
legitimate and may be fairly pressed on a testator. On the other hand, 
pressure of whatever character, whether acting on the fears or the 
hopes, if so exerted as to overpower the volition without convincing 
the judgment, is a species of restraint under which no valid will can be 
made. Importunity or threats, such as the testator has the courage to 
resist, moral command asserted and yielded to for the sake of peace 
and quiet, or of escaping from distress of mind or social discomfort,-
these, if carried to a degree in which the free play of the testator's 
judgment, discretion, or wishes is overborne, will constitute undue 
influence, though no force is either used or threatened. In a word, a 
testator may be led, but not driven; and his will must be the offspring 
of his own volition, and not the record of some one else's." 

Section 61 of the Indian Succession Act (Act 39 of 1925) enacts that, 
"A will or any part of a will, the making of which has been 
caused by fraud or coercion, or by such importunity as takes away 
the free agency of the testator, is void."

Illustration (vii) to the section is very instructive, and is as follows: 
"A, being in such a state of health as to be capable of 
exercising his own judgment and volition, B uses urgent intercession 
and persuasion with him to induce him to make a will of a certain 
purport. A, in consequence of the intercession and persuasion, but in 
the free exercise of his judgment and volition, makes his will in the 
manner recommended by B. The will is not rendered invalid by the 
intercession and persuasion of B." 

(g) 2013 (6) CTC 471 (Madras High Court) (K.Karthik s/o. K.Kalaivanan and another Vs. 

Jayanthi Iyengar and others): 

"5. The cause of action for filing the present Application is as follows: 
"6. I submit that during trial in the abovesaid Suit, the Applicants 
herein came to know that after the death of Mr. P.D. Rajagopalan, the 
First Respondent herein (Petitioner in the above O.P.No. 842 of 2012) 
has forged Mr.P.D.Rajagopalan's signature and has created a Will, as if 
he has bequeathed the abovesaid property in her favour. 
7. On enquiries I have come to know that the First Respondent 
herein filed the above O.P.No. 842 of 2012 seeking grant of Letters of 
Administration with respect of a Will, alleged to have been executed by 
the abovesaid P.D. Rejagopalan on 16.6.2000 in favour bequeathing the 
abovesaid property in her favour. 
8. I submit that the Will dated 16.6.2000 in respect of which the 
First Respondent herein has applied for Letters of Administration, is not a 
genuine one. I submit that the said Will dated 16.6.2000 is a forged one. 
Therefore, the above O.P.No. 842 of 2012 is liable to be dismissed. 
9. I submit that under the facts and circumstances stated above, 
being absolute owners of the property covered under the alleged Will, the 
Applicants herein are proper and necessary parties to the above 
O.P.No.842 of 2012. It is therefore just, proper and necessary that the 
Applicants herein be impleaded as Respondents Nos. 5 & 6 in the above 
O.P.No. 842 of 2012 as otherwise they will be put to irreparable loss and 
injury." 
Therefore, the present Application is filed praying to implead the Petitioner in the 
Original Petition. 
6. This is resisted by the respondent herein and the Petitioner in the 
Original Petition, who has filed a detailed Counter, which of course, upto para-18 
is not relevant for repudiating the claim on facts which is not required for the 
disposal of the present Application. Para-19 of the Counter Affidavit is relied 
upon by K.V. Babu, learned Counsel for the Respondent that no caveatable 
interest is there for the impleading Applicants and, therefore, the Application has 
to be rejected. Learned Counsel for the Respondent relied upon the decision of 
the Supreme Court in Kanwarjit Singh Dhillon Vs. Hardayal Singh Dhillon & 
Others, 2008(1)CTC 80 (SC) : 2007(11)SCC 357, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court, while relying upon its earlier decision in Chiranjilal Shrilal Goenka Vs. 
Jasjit Singh & others, 1993 (2) SCR 454, and pleaded that in a probate, the Court 
in exercise of jurisdiction under the Indian Succession Act is not competent to 
determine the question of title to the Suit property and for other issues relating to 
title. In the said decision, the Supreme Court has held as follows: 
"11. In Chramyilal Shrilal Goenka Vs. Jasjit Singh and others, 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


31 

1993 (2) SCC 507, this Court while upholding the above views and 
following the earlier decisions of this Court as well as of other High Courts 
in India observed in Paragraph 15 at page 515 which runs as under: 
"In Ishwardeo Narain Singh Vs. Smt.Kanta Devi (AIR 1954 
SC 280) this Court held that the Court of probate is only 
concerned with the question as to whether the document put 
forward as the last Will and testament of a deceased person was 
duly executed and attested in accordance with law and whether at 
the time of such execution the testator had sound disposing mind. 
The question whether a particular bequest is good or bad is not 
within the purview of the Probate Court. Therefore, the only issue 
in a Probate proceeding relates to the genuineness and due 
execution of the Will and the Court itself is under duty to determine 
it and perverse the original Will in its custody. The Succession Act 
is a self-contained code insofar as the question of making an 
Application for probate, grant or refusal of probate or an Appeal 
carried against the decision of the Probate Court. This is clearly 
manifested in the fascicule of the provisions of the Act. The 
Probate proceedings shall be conducted by the Probate Court in 
the manner prescribed in the Act and in no other ways. The grant 
of probate with a copy of the Will annexed establishes conclusively 
as to the appointment of the Executor and the valid execution of 
the Will. Thus, it does no more than establish the factum of the 
Will and the legal character of the Executor. Probate Court does 
not decide any question of title or of the existence of the property 
itself." " 

(h) 2005 (1) LW 455 (Division Bench of Madras High Court) (Janaki Devi Vs. R.Vasanthi 

and others): 

"27. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that Order 25 Rule 9 
of Madras High Court Original Side Rules, is not complied with in this case, and 
the non explanation of the delay, with materials should be construed as one of the 
unavoidable circumstances, to cast shadow upon the Will, to eclipse the same. 
Order 25 Rule 9 of the Madras High Court Original Side Rules says: 
"In any case where probate or letters of administration is for first 
time applied for after the lapse of three years from the death of the 
deceased, the reason for the delay shall be explained in the petition." 

In the case on hand, it cannot be said, that this requirement is not 
complied with, since paragraph-7 of the petition gives some explanation, for the 
delay. The submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant, that during 
the relevant period viz., from September 1984 to June 1989, the plaintiff/first 
respondent could not have been in bed rest, since she was attending the Court in 
the connected proceedings, fails to inspire us, to reject the explanation offered, 
considering the fact that the petitioner had proclaimed and propounded the Will, 
as and when occasion had arisen for her to do so. Admittedly, this petition or 
plaint has been filed, after three years from the date of death of the testator, since 
she died on 22.6.1981. If the plaintiff had been silent, not even whispering about 
the Will, when occasion had arisen, then the inaction on the part of the plaintiff for 
more than three years in not taking the steps, to probate the Will, could be viewed 
with suspicion. In this case, admittedly, on the basis of the Will, probably thinking 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


32 

that the Will need not be probated, a suit has been filed by the petitioner, before 
the District Munsif Court, Villupruam against one Kannan, who was the tenant of 
the property, for certain reliefs and in those proceedings, this Will was exhibited 
as Ex.A1, thereby showing, the plaintiff had taken action, immediately, to 
preserve the property, over which right has been given, indicating that the plaintiff 
had no intention, to suppress the Will or conceal the same, from the eyes of 
others. True, ultimately the suit has been dismissed on the ground, that the Will 
could not be acted upon, as it was not probated and that is why the present case 
is filed, though not immediately, but within the reasonable time, explaining the 
delay. As held by the Division Bench of this Court, in Ammu Balachandran's case 
(Ammu Balachandran Vs. O.T.Joseph --AIR 1996 Madras 442), if the execution 
of the Will is proved, the delay in taking steps to probate the Will, will not loom 
large, since Order 25 Rule 9 of Madras High Court Original Side Rules has not 
prescribed any period of limitation and probably, it aims to give explanation alone. 
.. .. 
29. For the reasons which we are going to assign hereunder, the 
execution of the Will is duly proved and therefore, on the ground of the delay in 
filing the petition for probate alone or letters of administration, entertaining 
indelible suspicion, a doubt could not be entertained, as if the Will was fabricated 
by the plaintiff. Hence, this defence deserves rejection." 

(i) 2014 (15) SCC 578 (Ved Mitra Verma Vs. Dharam Deo Verma): 

"12. It is not a fact that the will and its contents had come to light for the 
first time after 17 years when the application was filed before the learned trial 
court by the present respondent. From the materials on record before the High 
Court, it is evident that there was a family dispute between the parties which was 
resolved by the local Durbar and the proceedings thereof were recorded in Ext.10. 
In the said document, there is a reference to the "deed of agreement" made by 
the deceased father in 1974 on the basis of which the appellant was found 
entitled to be in possession of the property in question. The aforesaid "deed of 
agreement" is, in fact, the will dated 20-11-1974. 
... .... 
14. All the alleged suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of 
the will being capable of being understood in the manner indicated above and the 
requirement of Section 69 of the Evidence Act, 1872 having been satisfied by the 
evidence of PW 3, we find that in the present case, the findings and conclusions 
recorded by the High Court would not call for any interference. Consequently, and 
for the reasons aforesaid, we dismiss the appeal leaving the parties to bear their 
own costs." 

(j) 2014 (2) CTC 199 (SC) = 2014 (16) SCC 125 (Surjit Kaur Gill Vs. Adarsh Karu Gill): 

"10. With respect to these submissions, Mr.Divan pointed out that in 
fact there is a clear writing of Respondent 1 herein executed on 12-2-1991 
which clearly states, amongst others, in Para (d) that she will not claim any 
tenancy right or charge on the abovereferred property. In Para (b) of that writing 
she agreed to render the accounts with respect to the rental income received 
from 1-1-1980 to 30-11-1990. In Para (c) of that writing she states that with 
respect to the two mortgages redeemed in her name, she will not claim any 
charge as the amounts paid for redeeming the said mortgages were paid from 
the estate of Smt.Abnash Kaur. Mr.Divan states that after executing this writing, 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


33 

the disputes between the parties were supposed to get settled, but then 
unfortunately it did not happen. Respondent 1 started construction on the 
particular property in her own right. This having happened in 1992, the original 
plaintiff was constrained to file the suit for the partition of the property belonging 
to Smt.Abnash Kaur. Smt.Abnash Kaur having made a will about her property, 
the original plaintiff had to see to it as the administrator of the will that the 
property is distributed in accordance therewith. This being the position, in his 
submission it is Article 58 which is the relevant article for all these prayers, which 
provides for a period of three years when the right to sue first accrues. In the 
present case, it will be when the dispute arose because of the conduct of 
Respondent 1 herein. The issue of limitation is always a mixed question of facts 
and law, and therefore, it could not be held that no case was made out for 
proceeding for a trial. Mr.C.A.Sundaram submitted that Respondent 1 disputed 
the writing dated 12-2-1991 and it had to be forensically tested. This submission 
all the more justifies that the trial had to proceed. For deciding an application 
under Order 7 Rule 11, one has to look at the plaint and decide whether it 
deserved to be rejected on the ground raised. In our view, the view taken by the 
Division Bench is clearly erroneous. The appeal is therefore allowed and the 
judgment and order of the Division Bench is set aside. The application made 
under Order 7 Rule 11 moved by Respondent 1 herein will stand rejected. We 
may however clarify that all the observations herein are only for the purpose of 
deciding this appeal." 

(k) 2010 (2) SCC 162 (Suresh Kumar Bansal Vs. Krishna Bansal): 

"14. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going 
through the impugned order as well as the application for substitution of the 
appellant on the basis of the will alleged to have been executed by the deceased 
plaintiff, we are of the view that the impugned order of the High Court is liable to 
be interfered with and the application for impleadment filed at the instance of the 
appellant on the basis of the will alleged to have been executed by the deceased 
plaintiff must be allowed and the appellant must be impleaded in the suit along 
with the natural heirs and legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff, subject to 
grant of probate by a competent court of law. 
15. It is true that in the impugned order, the High Court has made it clear 
that the finding regarding genuineness of the will was made only for the purpose 
of deciding the application for impleadment filed at the instance of the appellant. 
But, in our view, if at this stage, the appellant is not permitted to be impleaded and 
in the event an order of eviction is passed ultimately against the respondent 
tenant, the tenants will be evicted by the natural heirs and legal representatives of 
the deceased plaintiff who thereby shall take possession of the suit premises, but 
if ultimately the probate of the alleged will of the deceased plaintiff is granted by 
the competent court of law, the suit property would devolve on the appellant but 
not on the natural heirs and legal representative of the deceased. Therefore, in 
the event of grant of probate in favour of the appellant, he has to take legal 
proceeding against the natural heirs and legal representatives of the deceased 
plaintiff for recovery of possession of the suit premises from them which would 
involve not only huge expenses but also considerable time would be spent to get 
the suit premises recovered from the natural heirs and legal representatives of the 
deceased plaintiff. 
... ... 
17. That apart, since the question of genuineness of the will cannot be 
conclusively gone into by the court in a proceeding for substitution in a pending 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


34 

eviction suit and in view of the fact that an application was made at the instance of 
the appellant for impleadment as a legal representative of the deceased on the 
basis of the will which is yet to be probated, in our view, the best course open to 
the court is to allow impleadment of the appellant in the eviction proceeding, 
thereby permitting him to proceed with the eviction suit along with natural heirs 
and legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff, but in case the decree is to be 
passed for eviction of the tenant from the suit premises such eviction decree shall 
be subject to the grant of probate of the will alleged to have been executed by the 
deceased plaintiff. 
18. At the same time, it is clear that in case the will of the deceased 
plaintiff is found not to be genuine and probate is not granted, the court shall 
proceed to grant the eviction decree in favour of Respondent 1 and not in favour 
of the appellant. It is well settled that in the event, the will is found to be genuine 
and probate is granted, only the appellant would be entitled to get an order of 
eviction of the respondent tenants from the suit premises excluding the claim of 
the natural heirs and legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff. 
19. The Code of Civil Procedure enjoins various provisions only for the 
purpose of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings and for adjudicating of related 
disputes in the same proceedings, the parties cannot be driven to different courts 
or to institute different proceedings touching on different facets of the same major 
issue. Such a course of action will result in conflicting judgments and instead of 
resolving the disputes, they would end up in creation of confusion and conflict. 
20. It is now well settled that determination of the question as to who is 
the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff or defendant under Order 22 
Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure is only for the purpose of bringing legal 
representatives on record for the conducting of those legal proceedings only and 
does not operate as res judicata and the inter se dispute between the rival legal 
representatives has to be independently tried and decided in probate proceedings. 
If this is allowed to be carried on for a decision of an eviction suit or other allied 
suits, the suits would be delayed, by which only the tenants will be benefited. 
21. In order to shorten the litigation and to consider the rival claims of the 
parties, in our view, the proper course to follow is to bring all the heirs and legal 
representatives of the deceased plaintiff on record including the legal 
representatives who are claiming on the basis of the will of the deceased plaintiff 
so that all the legal representatives, namely, the appellant and the natural heirs 
and legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff can represent the estate of the 
deceased for the ultimate benefit of the real legal representatives. If this process 
is followed, this would also avoid delay in disposal of the suit. 
22. In view of our discussions made hereinabove, we are, therefore, of 
the view that the High Court as well as the trial court were not at all justified in 
rejecting the application for impleadment filed at the instance of the appellant 
based on the alleged will of the deceased plaintiff at this stage of the proceedings. 
23. Before parting with this judgment, it is necessary to consider the 
decision of this Court in Jaladi Suguna Vs. Satya Sai Central Trust (2008 (8) SCC 
521) cited by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant. In Jaladi Suguna, this 
Court held that the intestate heir (husband) and the testamentary legatees (nieces 
and nephews), seeking impleadment as the heirs of the deceased respondent in 
an appeal have to be brought on record before the court can proceed further in 
the appeal. Furthermore, in that decision it was also held that a legatee under a 
will, who intends to represent the estate of the deceased testator, being an 
intermeddler with the estate of the deceased testator, will be a legal 
representative. 
24. In view of the aforesaid discussions and in view of the decision in 
Jaladi Suguna, we are also of the view that in an eviction proceeding, when a 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


35 

legatee under a will intends to represent the interest of the estate of the deceased 
testator, he will be a legal representative within the meaning of Section 2(11) of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, for which it is not necessary in an eviction suit to 
decide whether the will on the basis of which substitution is sought for, is a 
suspicious one or that the parties must send the case back to the Probate Court 
for a decision whether the will was genuine or not. 
25. For the reasons aforesaid, we are of the view that the High Court as 
well as the trial court had acted illegally and with material irregularity in the 
exercise of their jurisdiction in not impleading not only the natural heirs and legal 
representatives of the deceased plaintiff but also the appellant who is claiming his 
impleadment on the basis of an alleged will of the deceased plaintiff." 

(l) 2012 (6) SCC 430 (A.Shanmugam Vs. Ariya Kshatriya Rajakula Vamsathu Madalaya 

Nandhavana Paripalanai Sangam): 

"Entire journey of a Judge is to discern the truth 
24. The entire journey of a Judge is to discern the truth from the 
pleadings, documents and arguments of the parties. Truth is the basis of the 
justice delivery system. This Court in Dalip Singh Vs. State of U.P. (2010 (2) SCC 
114 : 2010 (1) SCC (Civ) 324) observed that: (SCC p.116, para 1) 
"1. … Truth constituted an integral part of the justice delivery 
system which was in vogue in the pre-Independence era and the people 
used to feel proud to tell the truth in the courts irrespective of the 
consequences. However, post-Independence period has seen drastic 
changes in our value system." 
.. ... 
26. As stated in the preceding paragraphs, the pleadings are the 
foundation of litigation but experience reveals that sufficient attention is not paid 
to the pleadings and documents by the judicial officers before dealing with the 
case. It is the bounden duty and obligation of the parties to investigate and satisfy 
themselves as to the correctness and the authenticity of the matter pleaded. 
27. The pleadings must set forth sufficient factual details to the extent 
that it reduces the ability to put forward a false or exaggerated claim or defence. 
The pleadings must inspire confidence and credibility. If false averments, evasive 
denials or false denials are introduced, then the court must carefully look into it 
while deciding a case and insist that those who approach the court must 
approach it with clean hands. 
28. It is imperative that the Judges must have complete grip of the facts 
before they start dealing with the case. That would avoid unnecessary delay in 
disposal of the cases. 
29. Ensuring discovery and production of documents and a proper 
admission/denial is imperative for deciding civil cases in a proper perspective. In 
relevant cases, the courts should encourage interrogatories to be administered. 
Framing of issues 

30. Framing of issues is a very important stage of a civil trial. It is 
imperative for a Judge to critically examine the pleadings of the parties before 
framing of issues. Rule 2 of Order 10 CPC enables the court, in its search for the 
truth, to go to the core of the matter and narrow down, or even eliminate the 
controversy. Rule 2 of Order 10 reads as under: 
"2. Oral examination of party, or companion of party.-(1) At the first 
hearing of the suit, the court-

http://www.judis.nic.in 


36 

(a) shall, with a view to elucidating matters in controversy in the 
suit, examine orally such of the parties to the suit appearing in person or 
present in court, as it deems fit; and 
(b) may orally examine any person, able to answer any material 
question relating to the suit, by whom any party appearing in person or 
present in court or his pleader is accompanied. 
(2)-(3) * 
* 
* " 
It is a useful procedural device and must be regularly pressed into service. 
.. ... 
32. If issues are properly framed, the controversy in the case can be 
clearly focused and documents can be properly appreciated in that light. The 
relevant evidence can also be carefully examined. Careful framing of issues also 
helps in proper examination and cross-examination of the witnesses and final 
arguments in the case. 
... ... 
43. On the facts of the present case, the following principles emerge: 
43.1. It is the bounden duty of the court to uphold the truth and do justice. 
43.2. Every litigant is expected to state truth before the law court whether 
it is pleadings, affidavits or evidence. Dishonest and unscrupulous litigants have 
no place in law courts. 
43.3. The ultimate object of the judicial proceedings is to discern the truth 
and do justice. It is imperative that pleadings and all other presentations before 
the court should be truthful. 
43.4. Once the court discovers falsehood, concealment, distortion, 
obstruction or confusion in pleadings and documents, the court should in addition 
to full restitution impose appropriate costs. The court must ensure that there is no 
incentive for wrongdoer in the temple of justice. Truth is the foundation of justice 
and it has to be the common endeavour of all to uphold the truth and no one 
should be permitted to pollute the stream of justice. 
43.5. It is the bounden obligation of the court to neutralise any unjust 
and/or undeserved benefit or advantage obtained by abusing the judicial process. 
43.6. The watchman, caretaker or a servant employed to look after the 
property can never acquire interest in the property irrespective of his long 
possession. The watchman, caretaker or a servant is under an obligation to hand 
over the possession forthwith on demand. According to the principles of justice, 
equity and good conscience, the courts are not justified in protecting the 
possession of a watchman, caretaker or servant who was only allowed to live into 
the premises to look after the same. 
43.7. The watchman, caretaker or agent holds the property of the 
principal only on behalf of the principal. He acquires no right or interest 
whatsoever in such property irrespective of his long stay or possession. 
43.8. The protection of the court can be granted or extended to the 
person who has a valid subsisting rent agreement, lease agreement or licence 
agreement in his favour." 

(m) 2008 (14) SCC 754 (Babu Singh Vs. Ram Sahai): 

"16. Section 69 of the Act (Evidence Act) reads, thus: 
"69. Proof where no attesting witness found.-If no such attesting 
witness can be found, or if the document purports to have been executed 
in the United Kingdom, it must be proved that the attestation of one 
attesting witness at least is in his handwriting, and that the signature of 
the person executing the document is in the handwriting of that person." 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


37 

17. It would apply, inter alia, in a case where the attesting witness is 
either dead or out of the jurisdiction of the court or kept out of the way by the 
adverse party or cannot be traced despite diligent search. Only in that event, the 
will may be proved in the manner indicated in Section 69 i.e. by examining 
witnesses who were able to prove the handwriting of the testator or executant. 
The burden of proof then may be shifted to others. 
18. Whereas, however, a will ordinarily must be proved keeping in view 
the provisions of Section 63 of the Succession Act and Section 68 of the Act, in 
the event the ingredients thereof, as noticed hereinbefore, are brought on record, 
strict proof of execution and attestation stands relaxed. However, signature and 
handwriting, as contemplated in Section 69, must be proved." 

(n) 2012 (8) MLJ 701 (Madras High Court) (R.Sarala Vs. K.S.Mohan): 

"15. Per contra, Mr.R.Parthasarathy, learned counsel for the 
respondents placed reliance upon Clause 37 of the Letters Patent, where this 
court has been given power to frame rules for regulating its own procedure and 
in respect of the civil procedure. Insofar as the testamentary proceedings are 
concerned, it is governed by Order 25 of the O.S. Rules. Order 25 Rule 9 though 
states that if a petition for letters of administration was presented before this 
court after a lapse of three years from the date of the death of the deceased, the 
reason for the delay has to be explained in the petition. Therefore, he argued that 
Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act read with Article 137 of the Limitation 
Act will not apply as the petition has been presented under the rules framed 
under the Letters Patent. 
16. In this context, he placed reliance upon a judgment of the Supreme 
Court in Iridium India Telecom Ltd. Vs. Motorola Inc., AIR 2005 SC 514 : 2005 (2) 
SCC 145 : 2005 (2) MLJ 97 and referred to the following passages found in 
paragraphs 28, 29, 30 and 44, which reads as follows: 
"28. It appears to us that this was the real reason why a 
distinction was drawn between the proceedings in original jurisdiction 
before the chartered High Courts and those in other courts. For historical 
reasons this distinction was maintained right from the time the Letters 
Patent was issued, and has not been disturbed by the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908, despite the amendments made in CPC from 1976 to 
2002. 
29. The learned counsel for the appellant referred to the speech 
of the Law Member while introducing the Code of Civil Procedure Bill, 
1907, which ultimately resulted in the Code of 1908. Our attention was 
drawn to the proceedings of the Council of the Governor General of 
India (published in the Gazette of India dated 7-9-1907, pp. 134 to 143). 
The only relevant portion is the portion at p. 141 where the Law Member, 
who introduced the Bill, referring to clauses 145 and 148 to 150 
contained in Parts X and XI of the Bill, explained the need as under: 
"I have already explained the nature of the rule-making 
power which is dealt with in Part X of the Bill and in regard to 
Part XI (miscellaneous), I would only call attention to Clauses 
145 and 148 to 150, which widen the discretion of Courts. They 
confer powers to enlarge time and to amend written 
proceedings, and they recognise the inherent powers of the 
Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of 
justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court. In these 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


38 

ways greater elasticity will, it is hoped, be of benefit." 

30. Far from advancing the case of the appellant, the speech of 
the Law Member, while introducing the Bill, suggests that it was thought 
necessary that the inherent powers of the Court to make appropriate 
orders, as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse 
of the process of the Court, was retained for the purpose of greater 
elasticity. 
44. The Full Bench of the High Court of Calcutta in 
Manickchand Durgaprasad Vs. Pratabmull Rameswar -AIR 1961 
Calcutta 483, had occasion to consider this very contention with regard 
to Clause 37 of the Letters Patent and observed: (AIR p. 489, para 13) 
"The restriction upon the power of the Court as 
contained in the proviso to Clause 37 of the Letters Patent is 
that the rules framed under that clause should, "as far as 
possible" be in conformity with the provisions of the Code of 
Civil Procedure. This restriction as the phrase "as far as 
possible" indicates is merely directory. The provisions of the 
Code of Civil Procedure are intended for the purpose of 
guidance of this Court in framing rules under Clause 37 of the 
Letters Patent. Consequently, if any rule framed by the High 
Court under Clause 37 be inconsistent with or confers any 
additional power besides what is granted by the Code of Civil 
Procedure, the rule framed under Clause 37 will prevail over the 
corresponding provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure." 

This we think is the correct view to be taken in interpreting the words "as 
far as possible" in Clause 37 of the Letters Patent. This interpretation 
would be consistent with the amplitude of the words used in Section 129 
CPC by which the High Court is empowered to make rules "not 
inconsistent with the Letters Patent to regulate its own procedure in the 
exercise of its original jurisdiction as it shall think fit". 

In view of the above, he contended that the argument based upon limitation will 
have no application to the case on hand. 

17. He also stated that for the purpose of rejecting a petition in terms of 
the power under Order 7 Rule 11(d), the Courts are slow in applying the said 
provisions for rejecting the petition on the ground of limitation as it is the question 
involved in both question of law and facts. For this purpose, he referred to a 
judgment of the Supreme Court in Popat and Kotecha Property Vs. State Bank 
of India Staff Assn., reported in 2005 (7) SCC 510 and a reference was made to 
the following passage found in paragraph 25, which reads as follows : 
"25. When the averments in the plaint are considered in the 
background of the principles set out in Sopan Sukhdeo Sable and others 
Vs. Assistant Charity Commissioner and others (supra) the inevitable 
conclusion is that the Division Bench was not right in holding that Order 
7 Rule 11 CPC was applicable to the facts of the case. Diverse claims 
were made and the Division Bench was wrong in proceeding with the 
assumption that only the non-execution of lease deed was the basic 
issue. Even if it is accepted that the other claims were relatable to it they 
have independent existence. Whether the collection of amounts by the 
respondent was for a period beyond 51 years needs evidence to be 
adduced. It is not a case where the suit from statement in the plaint can 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


39 

be said to be barred by law. The statement in the plaint without addition 
or subtraction must show that it is barred by any law to attract 
application of Order 7 Rule 11. This is not so in the present case." 

In the light of the above, he sought for dismissal of the two applications. 
He further contended that it is only when a citation is issued on the original 
petition, the question as to whether it could be tried as a petition for letters of 
administration or to be converted into T.O.S., has to be considered. 
18.The stand taken by the respondents is well founded. This court do not 
incline to accept the contentions of the applicants in rejecting the O.P. even 
before the matter could be taken up for appropriate consideration after due 
notice to the respondents. Hence both applications will stand dismissed. No 
costs. Post the O.P. before the learned Master for compliance regarding 
service." 

(o) AIR 1989 Madras 111 (Division Bench of Madras High Court) (Philo Peter and another 

Vs. Divyanathan and others): 

"3. Before considering the legal position emerging out of the above said 
decisions, it is necessary to take notice of the relevant provisions in the 
Succession Act, 1925. Section 266 of the Act provides that the District Judge 
shall have, in relation to the granting of Probate and Letters of Administration, all 
the powers and authority as are vested in him in relation to any civil suit. Section 
288 lays down that the proceedings of the Court of the District Judge shall, save 
as otherwise provided, be regulated, so far as the circumstances of the case 
permit, by the Civil Procedure Code. A proceeding for Probate is initiated by the 
presentation of an application in that behalf. What are the matters which should 
be mentioned in such an application, is provided in Section 276. Similarly, a 
proceeding for Letters of Administration is initiated by an application as provided 
in Section 278. Section 295, which is the important section to be considered in 
these proceedings, reads as follows --
"If any case before the District Judge in which there is 
contention, the proceedings shall take, as nearly as may be, the form of 
a regular suit, according to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure 
1908 (5 of 1908), in which the petitioner for probate or letters of 
administration, as the case may be, shall be the plaintiff, and the person 
who has appeared to oppose the grant shall be the defendant." 

Section 299 provides for an appeal against every order made by the District 
Judge. 
4. Before construing the scope of Section 295 of the Succession Act, it is 
better to refer to Order 25 of the Rules of the Original Side of the High Court, 
Madras of 1956. It relates to the Testamentary and Intestate matters and 
prescribes a procedure for granting Probate or Letters of Administration or 
Succession Certificate. It contains separate provisions for contentious and non-
contentious matters, relating to Wills. A Will may be proved either in common 
form or in solemn form. In a case where the petitioner wants to prove the Will in 
common form, it is enough if he files the Will along with the affidavit of attesting 
witnesses. There is a provision for issuing public notice and also notice to the 
interested parties. In such cases, anybody intending to oppose the issue of 
Probate or Letters of Administration, may enter caveat under Rule 51 of Order 25

of the Original Side Rules and file an affidavit in support of the caveat under Rule 
22 within eight days of entering the caveat stating the grounds of objection to the 
grant of Probate or Letters of Administration. On such contest being made, the 
proceeding, which was originated by the original petition, is converted into T.O.S. 
In such a case, the plaintiff is bound to pay the required Court-fee as provided in 
Article 11(k) of Schedule II of the Tamil Nadu Court-fees and Suits Valuation Act, 
1955. Therefore, here, we find that there is a definite procedure prescribed for 
converting the petition into a regular suit in which case, the liability for payment of 
Court-fee is automatically attracted. 
5. A difficulty was felt in construing the real scope of Section 295 of the 
Succession Act. There is no difficulty, as long as the petition is not opposed by 
any body. But when some body files a caveat and opposes the grant of probate 
or Letters of Administration, the question arose whether it should be treated as a 
suit and payment of Court-fee can be insisted on that basis. Two contentions 
were raised in such matters. One was whether the proceedings can be treated as 
a suit when it is not opposed by means of a caveat filed by the opposing parties 
even though such opposing parties are respondents in the petition. In considering 
this petition, Paul, J. in Nattorajan Vs. Parthasarathi, T.O.S. No.8 of 1972, dt. 06-
02-1973, held as follows :-

"In this case the petitioner himself chooses to prove the Will in 
solemn form so that all interested persons may come in, watch and 
participate in the proceedings when he can as well apply for probate on 
proving the Will in common form to avoid contest. If the proviso to Clause 
(2) is extended to cases where a petitioner applying for Probate or Letters 
of Administration with a Will annexed wants to prove the Will in the 
solemn form, it would encourage such persons to apply for Probate on 
proving the Will in common form and avoid any contest in order to avoid 
payment of ad valorem Court-fee. It is perhaps this aspect that has led to 
no provision being made for payment of ad valorem Court-fee, in cases 
coming under Rule 58 of Order 25 of the Original Side Rules. In these 
circumstances, I am of the opinion that the petitioner need not pay ad 
valorem Court-fee under the proviso to Sub-clause (2) of Article 11(k)(ii) 
of Schedule II of the Court-fees and Suits Valuation Act." 

In Flarance Cheliah v. Soundararaj Peter, (1966) 2 Mad LJ 33, 
Veeraswami J. as he then was, had to consider a similar position. In that case, 
the petitioner herself had impleaded certain persons as respondents who are 
likely to oppose the petitioner in the original petition. The learned Judge directed 
the petition to be registered as a suit. Regarding the payment of Court-fee on 
advalorem basis, the learned Judge held as follows : --
"But the question is whether for the purpose of the proviso to 
Article 11(k) of the Court-fees and Suits Valuation Act, there should be a 
formal entry of caveat in order to attract the proviso, for; there is 
contention and the application is therefore, to be tried as a suit Merely 
because there is no formal entry of caveat, it does not appear that the 
proviso is none the less applicable. It is true Article 18 of Schedule II 
prescribes a separate Court-fee of Rs.10 on caveat. But merely because 
a caveat does not bear stamp, it cannot be said that it is not a caveat, 
any more than a plaint which bears less than the required Court-fee 
ceases to be a plaint on that account. Where an application for probate 
becomes contentious and is tried as a suit, it should be assumed for the 
purpose of the proviso that a caveat is impliedly entered."

This decision was followed by Sengottuvelan,J., in Krishna Iyer Vs. 
Krishnamachari, 98 Mad.L.W. 80 : AIR 1985 Mad 346. The learned Judge, after 
considering the other decisions, came to the following conclusion : --
"A reading of Schedule II, Article 11(k) of the Tamil Nadu Court-
fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1955, clearly shows that in case of Wills 
not disputed a fixed Court-fee is made payable and where the Wills are 
disputed and the matter becomes contentious, a Court-fee of one half of 
the ad valorem value is made payable in view of the procedure for such 
matters as laid down by the Original Side Rules, 1956, by which if an 
objection is taken by means of a caveat an enhanced Court-fees is made 
payable. It is also seen that the enhanced Court-fee is made payable 'if a 
caveat is entered and the application is registered as a suit. In cases 
where the contesting respondents were already made parties, the 
original petition is registered as a suit straightway as per Order 25, Rule 
58 of the Original Side Rules, 1956. Perhaps if the respondents cited in 
the original petition do not enter caveat, the petitioner may contend that 
in view of the fact that there is no contest no enhanced Court-fee is 
payable. But whenever there is contest, whether a caveat is entered or 
not, according to the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Court-fees and Suits 
Valuation Act, 1955, enhanced Court-fee is payable." 

6. It must be borne in mind that the decisions of Paul J. and 
Sengottuvelan J. relate to the proceedings before the Original Side of this Court 
and whereas the case decided by Veeraswami J. as he then was, arose out of 
the proceedings before the District Judge. In so far as the proceedings relating to 
Testamentary and Intestate matters covered under Order 25 of the Original Side 
Rules, are concerned, we have already seen that there are" specific provisions 
providing for registering a petition as a suit as and when the application is 
registered by means of a caveat. In such a case, the Payment of Court-fee is 
automatically payable under the Court-fees Act as it stands. We are not 
concerned with such matters in this case as the validity of such a procedure is 
not being challenged before us. Therefore, we confine ourselves to the short 
question relating to the original petitions filed before a District Judge under 
Section 295 of the Succession Act only. Viewing from this angle, there cannot be 
a real conflict between these decisions. But however, Sengottuvelan,J., has 
chosen to differ from. the view expressed by Veeraswami,J., as he then was, in 
so far as the payment of Court-fee is concerned, as it has become necessary to 
resolve this apparent conflict. It is significant to note that the points now raised 
before us to the effect that when there is no provision for registering a petition as 
a suit by the District Judge in the Succession Act and as long as the petition is 
not registered as a suit, no Court-fee is payable on ad valorem basis, have not 
been taken in the earlier decisions. 
7. Mr.R.Arunagirinathan, and Miss.M.B.Dominique, learned counsel 
appearing for the revision petitioners in these revision petitions contended that 
there is absolutely no provision in the Indian Succession Act to convert the 
original petition as a suit whenever a caveat is entered by the opposite party. 
According to them, what is provided under Section 295 of the Indian Succession 
Act is the procedure to be followed when the proceedings become contested The 
use of the words 'as nearly as may be' in the said section itself indicates that the 
proceeding in question was not considered to be exactly the same as a suit. It 
was further contended that even if such an extreme interpretation could be given, 
the proceeding cannot be treated as a suit in the absence of a caveat being filed 
by the opposing party. Learned counsel submitted that the Court-fees Act being a 
taxing statute, it has to be strictly construed as it has always been held that liberal 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


42 

construction in favour of the litigant has to be adopted. Learned counsel have 
relied on the decisions reported in Panzy Fernandes Vs. M.F.Queoros, AIR 1963 
All. 153 (FB) and B.L.Banerjee Vs. Ganguly, AIR 1984 Cal. 16. The other 
decisions may not be relevant for the purpose of this case. 
8. Per contra, Mr.K.Srinivasan, who is appearing for the respondents in 
C.R.R.P.2052 of 1987 and Mr.T.N.Vallinayagam, learned Government Pleader, 
submitted that the language of Section 295 of the Indian Succession Act is clear 
and mandatory that a petition filed for grant of Probate or Letters of 
Administration should be treated as a suit as soon as it is opposed by a 
contesting party either by filing a caveat or otherwise. The words found in Section 
295 that the proceedings shall take the form of a regular suit and that the 
petitioner in such a case is treated as the plaintiff and the persons, who have 
appeared to oppose the grant shall be the defendants, denote that for all practical 
purposes, the proceeding is nothing but a suit. According to them, if that is not 
the intentions, such positive terms would not have been used in the Section. 
Mr.Srinivasan, in support of his contentions, relied on the decisions reported in 
Kalyanchand Lalchand Vs. Sitabai, ILR 38 Bom 309 : (AIR 1914 Bom 8), 
Gangabai Vs. Jaikishindas, AIR 1938 Sind 36 (FB). In re Seethalakshmi, ILR 
(1980) 2 Ker 348 and Bai Zabu Khima Vs. Amardas, AIR 1967 Guj. 214, wherein 
it was held that contentious probate proceedings must take the form of a suit and 
that they constitute a suit within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
Further, reliance was placed on the decision in Chotalal Vs. Bai Kabubai, (1898) 
ILR 22 Bom. 261, wherein it was held that since the proceeding becomes 
contentious, it must be treated as a plaint in a suit and that the suit is governed 
as far as practicable by the procedure prescribed in the Civil Procedure Code. It 
is a case relating to the Original Side of the Bombay High Court. Reliance was 
also placed on the decision reported in Dr.Mrs.I.S.Bose Vs. Mrs.H.N.Judah, AIR 
1958 All. 672, which held that contested applications for probate and Letters of 
Administration have been classed along with first appeals for the matter of 
taxation. We are presently going to see that the same High Court has taken a 
different view in a later decision. 
9. Learned Government Pleader relied on the decision of this Court in 
Noor Mohammad Vs. Mohammad Kareem, AIR 1938 Mad. 502, in which it was 
held as follows: --
"Under Section 295, where there is contention, the proceeding 
must take the form of a regular suit according to the Civil P. C. and in 
such a case, it is not open to the Court to refuse to make full enquiry and 
to proceed to decide the matter in a summary fashion leaving his 
decision subject to modification in a suit to be filed afterwards." 

They have also relied upon the view expressed by Veeraswami,J., as he then 
was, and Sengottuvelan,J. in the above said case in support of their contentions, 
they urged that whether there is caveat or not, it matters little because what is 
intended under the Act is that once there is contest in such proceedings, it should 
be treated as a suit. Therefore, according to them, even if there is no formal 
caveat, it is enough if the contesting parties are impleaded as respondents in the 
petition and they raised a contention opposing the Will. We feel that the principles 
laid down in the said rulings are of no help to the respondents as they have not 
directly considered the points that are being projected now in these proceedings. 
Moreover, we are unable to agree with the reasonings expressed in those 
decisions. 
10. Since the question raised before us is of some importance relating to 
payment of court-fee, we have to carefully analyse the various views in this 
connection to find out the actual scope of Section 295 of the Succession Act in so 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


43 

far as payment of court-fee is concerned. In order to find out the meaning of 'suit' 
found in Section 295 of the Succession Act, which came to be passed in 1925, 
we have to see the provisions relating to suits in old Civil Procedure Code of the 
year 1859. Section 25 of the old Civil Procedure Code provided as follows: -
"all suits shall be commenced by a plaint which.... shall be 
presented to the curt by the plaintiff in person or by his recognised agent 
or by a pleader duly appointed to act on his behalf." 

Further,Section 26 specified the particulars that are to be furnished in the plaint 
Section 27provided the manner in which the plaint was to be signed and verified. 
The provisions of the old and new Code of Civil Procedure disclose that a decree 
marks the culmination of a proceeding which is described as a suit and which, 
according to the Code, is initiated by means of a plaint. But in so far as the 
proceedings under the Succession Act are concerned they are not commenced 
by the institution of a plaint. But on the other hand, as Sections 278 to 281 of the 
said Act show, they are commenced by an 'application' or a 'petition'. 
11. There is another angle from which we have to test the intention of the 
Legislature in prescribing the procedure as if it is a suit. Once we hold that the 
proceeding under the Act is not a suit, the orders passed in such a petition 
cannot be termed as a decree. Though the term 'decree' was not defined in the 
old Civil Procedure Code of 1859, it was Defined in Section 2(2) of the Civil P. C. 
1908, as follows: --
"a formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards 
the court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties 
with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit, and may 
be either preliminary or final." 

It is, therefore, possible to hold that the use of the term 'suit' in the above 
definition indicates that a decree under the Civil P.C could only be passed in a 
proceeding which could be termed as a 'suit'. In this connection, we have to 
notice the provisions in Section 299 of the Indian Succession Act, relating to the 
filing of appeals and it reads as follows--
"299. Appeals from orders of District Judge:--Every order made 
by a District Judge by virtue of the powers hereby conferred upon him 
shall be subject to appeal to the High Court in accordance with the 
provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (5 of 1908), applicable to 
appeals." 

Under the said section, every order including the order passed at the final stage 
granting the probate made by the District Judge shall be subject to appeal to the 
High Court. Even for the final judgment granting the Probate the word that has 
been used is 'order'. This provision also shows that the proceedings even if they 
had become contentious, did not become proceedings in the suit, and unless 
there is a suit as provided under the Civil P. C. there can be no decree, except in 
cases of certain orders which are expressly included in the definition of decree. 
12. The question relating to the meaning of the words 'as nearly as may 
be' used in Section 295 of the Succession Act, has to be understood in the 
context in which it is uses in the Act. A perusal of Section 295 of the Succession 
Act, 1925 which corresponds to Section 261 of the Succession Act of 1865, itself 
indicates that such a proceeding is not a suit Since the Legislature did not treat 
the proceeding itself as a suit, it was found necessary in S.295 of the Act to lay 
down that such proceeding should, as nearly as possible take the form of a 
regular suit. In this connection, we have to give special meaning to the words 'as 
nearly as may be' in the section. The use of the said words itself indicates that 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


44 

the proceeding in question was not considered to be exactly the same as a suit. 
Again, we have to notice that the fact that the section itself directs that such a 
proceeding shall take the form of a regular Suit, indicates that in substance it is 
not a suit. It is evident that the Legislature thought fit to make a distinction 
between a regular suit and the proceeding under Section 295 of the Act. As there 
is basic difference of the two proceedings, it was found necessary to direct that 
one was to take the form of the other. It Is also significant to note that such a 
direction regarding the change of the form is to be adopted only in cases where 
there is contention. Therefore, when there is no contention, the change of form 
contemplated in Section 295 of the Act does not come into operation and the 
proceedings fully retain their initial form. These principles have been elaborately 
considered by a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Panzy Fernandes Vs. 
M.F.Queoros, AIR 1963 All. 153 and the learned Judges came to the same 
conclusion. We are in respectful agreement with the reasonings of the learned 
Judges who decided the said case. 
13. We have bestowed our anxious consideration to the meaning of the 
words 'as nearly as may be' and we are unable to persuade ourselves to come to 
a conclusion that the proceeding under Section 295 can be termed to be a 
regular suit. The main reason is that if the Legislature had intended that such 
proceedings should be treated as suits and not as applications, there is nothing 
to prevent the Legislature from making a simple and clear provision to the effect 
that such proceedings might be converted into a suit and treated as such. This 
inference is strengthened by the fact that in Section 47. C.P. Code, it is laid down 
that it is open to a Court to treat a proceeding under that section as a suit and 
order payment of additional court-fee. The fact that such a specific provision was 
not made in Section 295 of the Succession Act, demonstrates the intention of the 
Legislature in clear terms. 
14. In this context, we have to consider as to the proper Court-fee 
payable in a proceeding under Section 295 of the Succession Act. We have 
already seen that the petition filed under the said Act does not become a suit on 
a contention being raised by the opposite party. The proceedings are treated as a 
regular suit in form only and not in substance. Court-fee is now demanded on the 
basis of the provision contained in Article 11, Sub-clause (k) of Schedule II of the 
Tamil Nadu Court-fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1955, which provides as follows:-

Particulars 
Proper fee 

(k) (i) Application for Probate or 
Letters of Administration to have 
effect throughout India 

Twenty five rupees 

(ii) Application for Probate or 
Letters of Administration not falling 
under clause (i) 

Seventy five paise 

(1) If the value of the estate does 
not exceed Rs.1000 

Seventy five paise 

(2) If the value exceeds Rs.1000 
Five rupees 

Provided that if a caveat is entered and the application is registered as a suit One 
half of the scale of fee prescribed in Art.1 of Schedule I on the market value of 
the estate less the fee already paid on the application shall be levied. 

It is seen that Sub-clause (2) of Clause (ii) provides for payment of one half the 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


45 

scale of fees prescribed in Article 1 of Schedule 1 on the market value of the 
estate when a caveat is entered and the application is registered as a suit. 
Therefore, before a party is called upon to pay court-fee under this provision two 
conditions must be satisfied, namely, that a caveat must have been entered and 
that the application must have been registered as a suit. Unless and until these 
conditions are satisfied, there is no warrant for demanding court-fee as if it is a 
regular suit. We have already seen that when the proceeding becomes 
contentious, it does not become a suit, as such, as contemplated under the Civil 
Procedure Code, and that it is considered to be a suit only in form and not in 
substance. Therefore, as long as there is no suit in the eye of law, this provision 
for payment of court-fee cannot-be invoked. We have also noticed that there is 
no provision anywhere in the Succession Act or in the Court-fees Act to register a 
petition under the Succession Act as a suit. When there is no such specific 
provision in any of these Acts, it is not open to the State to demand court-fee as if 
it is a regular suit, on such a petition at any stage of the proceedings. 
15. There is one other reason for holding that the said provision under 
the Court-fees Act cannot be made applicable to a case of this nature. It is seen 
that Article 11(k) of Schedule 11 provides that one-half of the scale of fee 
prescribed in Article 1 of Schedule I on the market value of the estate is payable 
in the proceedings under the Indian Succession Act, as and when a caveat is 
entered and the application is registered as a suit Article 1 in Schedule I provides 
for payment of court-fee on the value of the subject-matter of the suit. This 
provision of law cannot be made applicable since the subject-matter in dispute in 
a proceeding relating to Probate or Letters of Administration is the right of the 
grantee to represent the estate of the deceased and as such it is incapable of 
valuation. The said provisions contained in the Court-fees Act contemplate 
payment of court-fee in cases where the subject-matter is capable of valuation 
and not otherwise. It cannot be disputed that the value of the properties 
comprised in such applications cannot be taken to be the value for purposes of 
payment of court-fee in such applications. The properties as such are not the 
subject-matter in dispute here and on the other hand the subject-matter in 
dispute is the right to represent the estate of the deceased and not the title to the 
said estate. It has to be noted that before an order actually entitling the petitioner 
to the grant of Probate or Letters of Administration is passed, he is required to 
pay court-fee on the Probate or Letters of Administration on the value of the 
estate under Schedule I of the Court-fees Act, Apart from this payment of court-
fee, when the petitioner wants to recover the property comprised within the estate 
of the deceased he is again required to pay ad valorem court fee on the plaint in 
the suit filed for recovery of the property. It is, therefore clearly seen that it would 
result in payment of court-fee more than once. It is a well established principle of 
law that such fiscal statutes should be construed strictly and whenever there is a 
doubt in the matter, an interpretation favourable to the litigants should be 
referred. These principles have been clearly laid down in the above said decision 
of the Allahabad High Court following the decisions reported in A.V.Fernandez 
Vs. State of Kerala and Central India Spinning and Weaving and Manufacturing 
Co. Ltd. Vs. Municipal Committee, Wardha., AIR 1958 SC 341. We, therefore, 
hold that a proceeding referred to in Section 295 of the Succession Act does not 
become a suit in the strict sense of the term even after it becomes contentious 
and as such court-fee is not payable as a suit under Article 11(k) of Schedule II to 
the Tamil Nadu Court-fees Act. 
16. In so far as the decisions rendered by Paul,J., in Natarajan Vs. 
Parthasarathi and others T.O.S.No.8 of 1972, dt.6-2-1973 and Sengottuvelan,J., 
in Krishna Iyer Vs. Krishnamachari, 98 Mad.L.W. 80 : (AIR 1985 Mad. 346) are 
concerned, they relate to the proceedings in the Original Side of the High Court 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


46 

and as such it cannot be stated that they have taken a different view in so far as 
the proceedings taken before the Courts outside the Original jurisdiction of the 
High Court As regards the decision of Veeraswami,J., as he then was, in 
Flarence Chelliah Vs. Soundararaj Peter, (1965) 2 Mad LJ 33, it is seen that the 
question was not raised in the form in which it is raised in these proceedings and, 
therefore, the learned Judge had no opportunity to consider the matter from this 
angle. The only question that was raised before the learned Judge was whether 
the filing of a caveat is a condition precedent for treating the proceedings as a 
suit. It was a case where the object ore were impleaded as respondents in the 
original petition itself, and, therefore, it was contended that in the absence of a 
caveat being entered on their behalf, court-fee was not payable. In dealing with 
this question, the learned Judge came to the conclusion that merely because 
there was rio formal entry of a caveat, it does not mean that the proviso is none 
the less applicable. Even if it is to be construed that the Judge has taken a 
different view, we hold that it is no longer a good law. 
17. In the result, we answer the reference in the following manner:--
When the proceeding initiated on a petition before a District Judge, for grant of 
Probate or Letters of Administration, becomes contentious and is required to be 
tried in the form of a regular suit according to the provisions of the Civil P. C., it 
cannot be considered as a suit in the strict sense of the term and as such ad 
valorem court-fee is not payable on such application under Article 11(k) (ii) Sub-
clause (2) of Schedule II of the Tamil Nadu Court-fees and Suits Valuation Act, 
1955. Since this is the only question to be decided in these two revision petitions, 
it is unnecessary to send back them to be disposed of by a learned single Judge 
of this court on merits. Therefore, these revision petitions are allowed and the 
orders of the lower court are set aside. No costs." 

(p) AIR 1996 Madras 442 (Division Bench of Madras High Court) (Ammu Balachandran 

Vs. Mrs.U.T.Joseph (died) and others): 

"21. The above are the principles on the basis of which a finding 
regarding the genuineness of a Will has to be arrived at. It also follows that if the 
provisions of the Will are natural and rationale in character, the question of 
challenging the Will on the above grounds loses much of its importance. Further, 
if the testator himself has explained the reason why he does not want to provide a 
particular heir, a suspicious circumstance cannot be alleged, if the execution is 
properly proved. 
22. Long delay in producing the Will and getting it probated, if properly 
explained, and if the execution and attestation are properly proved also, is of no 
avail in granting the probate. 
... ... 
40. That apart in view of the decision of the Privy Council in AIR 1945 PC 
105 (Manindra Chandra Lala Vs. Mahalaxmi Bank Ltd.), the said question also 
has to be answered only against the appellant. It was held in that decision thus :--
"Delay in applying for probate naturally gives rise to some 
suspicion but when the execution and attestation of the Will is proved the 
suspicion no longer operates." 

The learned Judge has believed the evidence of P.W.1. Further, we have held 
that the Will was properly executed by the testator and also properly attested. In 
view of that finding also we find that even if there is any delay, the same is 
properly explained and that cannot be treated as a suspicious circumstance for 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


47 

denying a probate. 
... ... 
42. The same High Court, namely, the Andhra Pradesh High Court, in 
another Division Bench Judgment reported in (1978) 1 Andh.L.T. 407 (K.Jwala 
Narasimha Reddy Vs. Narayana Reddy), has held thus : 
"where suspicion arises from the nature of the case put forward 
by the person claiming under the Will, he alone should remove that 
suspicion which his case creates. If, however, suspicion against the Will 
arises from the facts and circumstances of the case put forth by the 
opposite side, then the court should see whether those facts and 
circumstances giving rise to such a suspicion are proved before calling 
upon the claimant under the Will to explain or remove such a suspicion. 
The intention of the testator as declared in the Will disposing his property 
is of paramount importance. The very first question to be considered is 
whether the dispositions in the Will are natural, fair, reasonable and 
probable. That goes a long way in effecting the theory of vitiating 
suspicious circumstances. xxx xxx 
"The suspicions on the basis of which a Will can be invalidated should be 
legitimate and well founded. They must be inherent in the transaction 
itself which is challenged. Mere conflict of testimony cannot be raised to 
the level of legitimate and well-grounded suspicious circumstances which 
are capable of vitiating the execution of the Will itself." 
(emphasis supplied) 

We have already referred to 1990 (3) SCJ 588 : (AIR 1990 SC 1742) (supra). In 
that case, their Lordships held that although freedom to bequeath one's own 
property amongst Hindus is absolute both in extent and person, including rank 
stranger, yet to have testamentary capacity or a disposable mind what is required 
of propounder to establish is that the testator at time of disposition knew and 
understood the property he was disposing and persons who were to be 
beneficiaries of his disposition. Prudence, however, requires reason for denying 
benefit to those who too were entitled to bounty of testator as they had similar 
claims on him. (emphasis supplied). Absence of it may not invalidate a Will but it 
shrounds the disposition with suspicion as it does not give any inkling to the mind 
of the testator, to enable the Court to judge if the disposition was voluntary act. 
From this, it is clear that if reason is provided in the Will itself for disinheriting a 
heir or for giving only a lesser share, that removes the suspicious circumstances." 

(q) 2001 (2) CTC 713 (Division Bench of Madras High Court) (Ramachandran.R. Vs. 

G.Hariharan): 

"43. The learned counsel then contended that the respondent filed untrue 
affidavit of assets and that the properties are of very substantial value and he has 
purposely undervalued the house value. As pointed out in the ruling of this Court 
reported in Vyjanthimala Bali Vs. Rattan Chaman Bali, 1990 (1) L.W. 27 the under-
valuation of the estate is a matter left to the concern of the Revenue Authority by 
the Legislature. The provisions of Sections 55 to 59 of the Tamil Nadu Court Fees 
and Suits Valuation Act contain the necessary safeguards. It is not for the Court to 
worry about the same. This decision is also applicable to the case on hand and will 
be an answer to the contentions raised by the appellant relating to the valuation of 
the property."

15. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants contended that 

S.V.Ramakrishnan is the father of the defendants and as alleged by the plaintiff, the plaintiff's 

mother S.V.R.Saroja is not the wife of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan. Even as per the recitals 

in the Will, the deceased Ramakrishnan stated that they were living as husband and wife, even 

though there was not marriage between them. It is further contended that even according to the 

documents exhibited by the plaintiff in the T.O.S., S.V.Ramakrishnan died intestate with regard to 

the suit items 3 and 4, which are not the properties of S.V.Ramakrishnan and those items would 

not form part of the Will, since there is bald allegation in the Will with regard to the properties and 

hence, the defendants pray that the Letters of Administration may not be granted to the plaintiff. 

The plaintiff has under-valued the suit properties, and therefore, it is prayed that A.No.4456 of 

2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, filed by the second defendant to direct the plaintiff to pray proper 

Court fees according to the market value of the suit properties, may be allowed. 

16. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants further submitted that the 

executant of the Will, namely testator S.V.Ramakrishnan died on 31.12.1980 and Ex.P-23 Death 

Certificate has been filed by the plaintiff in that regard, but the present O.P.No.367 of 2008 for 

grant of Letters of Administration of the Will was filed initially only on 18.12.2006 and 

subsequently, it was re-presented, and therefore, after nearly 26 years, the said O.P. was filed, 

and on contest by the defendants, the said O.P. was converted into T.O.S.No.2 of 2009. It is their 

further contention that the ruling of the First Bench of this Court in O.S.A.Nos.10 and 72 of 2013, 

dated 07.01.2016, which is relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff, may not be 

applicable to the facts of the present case, as the latest judgments rendered by the Supreme 

Court with regard to the point of limitation, were not considered. They also contended that the 

plaintiff had knowledge about the Will long back, i.e. even on the death of the death of the 

executant of the Will, namely S.V.Ramakrishnan, which was on 31.12.1980 and the O.P. (T.O.S) 

has not been fled within three years from the date of the knowledge of the Will, and therefore, 

they prayed that the T.O.S. may be dismissed as time barred.

17. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants further contended that the suit 

properties are not the properties of late S.V.Ramakrishnan, as he was not the absolute owner with 

regard to the same, and the properties are family ancestral properties and S.V.Ramakrishnan 

acquired the properties from his adoptive father, etc., and hence, he has no right to execute the 

Will with regard to the joint family properties. They further contended that the plaintiff's mother is 

not S.V.R.Saroja as contended by her, and the marriage invitation of S.V.Ramakrishnan with the 

defendants' mother, namely Rajalakshmi, is marked as Ex.D-1. 

18. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants further submitted that the suit 

items 3 and 4 are not covered by the suit properties in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, as the same are the 

suit properties in the suit filed in C.S.No.43 of 1962 before this Court, by the plaintiff's father along 

with the second defendant against one Buhari and another, and the copy of the plaint in 

C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-71 = Ex.D-13; the copy of the decree, dated 10.11.1965 

passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-72 = Ex.D-14. As against the said decree, dated 

10.11.1965 passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962, the appeals in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 were 

preferred, which were disposed of by the Division Bench of this Court on 10.05.1972, against 

which, Civil Appeal in C.A.No.224 of 1974 was preferred before the Supreme Court. The copy of 

the affidavit filed in I.A.No.2 of 2008 in C.A.No.224 of 1974 filed before the Supreme Court is 

marked as Ex.P-78. The judgment dated 17.04.1995 passed by the Supreme Court in C.A.No.224 

of 1974 is marked as Ex.P-28, with amended cause title therein, which is marked as Ex.P-29. By 

the said judgment in C.A.No.224 of 1974, the Supreme Court restored the order of the learned 

single Judge passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962. In the said Civil Appeal before the Supreme Court, the 

plaintiff and others were impleded as parties only as legal representatives of the deceased 

S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar, but not based upon the Will executed by S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar, 

and hence, the plaintiff cannot now claim title to items 3 and 4 of the suit properties as beneficiary 

under Ex.P-1 Will. Subsequently E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 was preferred by 

S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar (since deceased) and S.V.Matha Prasad, the second defendant herein 

and the copy of the affidavit filed by the second defendant herein in the said E.P.No.48 of 1997 is 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


50 

marked as Ex.D-17. The copy of the order, dated 03.07.2000 passed in A.Nos.1106 to 1108 of 

2000 in E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.D-5 and the order dated 

07.07.2000 passed in the said E.P. is marked as Ex.D-6. The counter affidavit filed by the second 

defendant herein in A.Nos.2872 and 2873 of 2000 in E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is 

marked as Ex.P-55. The copy of the order dated 24.08.2000 passed in A.Nos.2872 and 2873 of 

2000 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-56 = Ex.D-18. The tampered copy of E.P.No.48 of 

1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 with additions and deletions, is marked as Ex.D-20. Ex.D-8 is the 

letter dated 23.02.2007 issued by the Registrar General of this Court to the second defendant 

regarding the tampering of records in E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962. 

19. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants further contended that Ex.D-7 

is the order dated 17.04.2003 passed by the Supreme Court in S.L.P.(CC).No.895 of 2003 filed by 

the second defendant against the judgment dated 11.04.2001 (Ex.D-19) passed by the Division 

Bench of this Court in O.S.A.No.372 of 2000. Ex.D-10 is the order dated 24.03.2011 passed by 

this Court in W.P.No.2015 of 2008 filed by the second defendant herein against plaintiff and 

others. The learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants also submitted that Ex.D-16 is 

the copy of the affidavit filed before the Supreme Court in S.L.P.(CC).No.7242 of 1981 filed by the 

legal representatives of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar against Buhari. Ex.D-21, dated 

06.12.1982 is the compromise decree passed in C.S.No.469 of 1981 filed by M/s.Lakshmi 

Builders against the second defendant herein and others. Ex.D-22, dated 31.10.1998 is the copy 

of the deed of assignment executed by the plaintiff herein in favour of Mr.Lal Chand Menghraj and 

Chimandar Menghraj. Ex.D-23 = Ex.P-18, dated 21.10.1989 is the copy of the deed of sale 

executed by the plaintiff herein and others and the second defendant in favour of one Padmavathi. 

Ex.D-24 series are: the copy of the Legal Heirship Certificate of the defendants' father, the copy 

of the extract from the Permanent Land Register (Patta) issued by Tahsildar, Purasaiwalkam-

Perambur Taluk and the copy of the order passed by the Special Commissioner and 

Commissioner of Land Reforms, Chepauk. Ex.D-25 is the copy of the counter filed by the 

respondent Nos.21 to 24 before the Supreme Court in S.L.P.(Civil).No.13783 to 13876 of 2008.

20. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants submitted that item Nos.3 

and 4 of the suit properties have not been included in the Will, even though it is admitted by the 

plaintiff that S.V.Ramakrishnan died intestate and has not executed any Will as regards item 

Nos.3 and 4 and the said fact is supported by subsequent documents like the order passed by the 

Supreme Court and the E.P. proceedings before this Court. They also submitted that the plaintiff 

has not independent right even as regards item Nos.1 and 2 of the suit properties, since they are 

undivided joint family properties. From the above documents, it is clear the Will was not executed 

by the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and therefore, they prayed that the Letters of Administration 

proceedings in O.P.(T.O.S) may be dismissed as time barred. In support of their submissions, 

learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants relied on the following decisions: 

(a) 2007 (2) SCC 230 (Raghunath Rai Bareja Vs. Punjab National Bank): 

"29. Learned counsel for the respondent-Bank submitted that it will be 
very unfair if the appellant who is a guarantor of the loan, and director of the 
Company which took the loan, avoids paying the debt. While we fully agree with 
the learned counsel that equity is wholly in favour of the respondent-Bank, since 
obviously a Bank should be allowed to recover its debts, we must, however, state 
that it is well settled that when there is a conflict between law and equity, it is the 
law which has to prevail, in accordance with the Latin maxim "dura lex sed lex", 
which means "the law is hard, but it is the law". Equity can only supplement the 
law, but it cannot supplant or override it. 

30. Thus, in Madamanchi Ramappa Vs. Muthaluru Bojjappa (AIR 1963 
SC 1633),(vide AIR p.1637, para 12) this Court observed : 
"....... what is administered in Courts is justice according to law, 
and considerations of fair play and equity however important they may be, 
must yield to clear and express provisions of the law." 

31. In Council for Indian School Certificate Examination Vs. Isha Mittal 
(2000 (7) SCC 521) (vide SCC p.522, para 4) this Court observed : 
"....... Considerations of equity cannot prevail and do not permit a 
High Court to pass an order contrary to the law." 

32. Similarly in P.M.Latha Vs. State of Kerala (2003 (3) SCC 541 : 2003 
SCC (L & S) 339) (vide SCC p.546, para 13) this Court observed : 
"13. Equity and law are twin brothers and law should be applied 
and interpreted equitably, but equity cannot override written or settled 
law". 
(emphasis supplied) 

33. In Laxminarayan R.Bhattad Vs. State of Maharashtra (2003 (5) SCC 
413) (vide SCC p.436, para 73) this Court observed : 
"73. It is now well settled that when there is a conflict between 
law and equity the former shall prevail." 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


52 

(emphasis supplied) 

34. Similarly in Nasiruddin Vs. Sita Ram Agarwal (2003 (2) SCC 577 : 
AIR 2003 SC 1543) (vide SCC p.588, para 35) this Court observed : 
"35. In a case where the statutory provision is plain and 
unambiguous, the court shall not interpret the same in a different 
manner, only because of harsh consequences arising therefrom." 

35. Similarly in E.Palanisamy Vs. Palanisamy (2003 (1) SCC 123) (vide 
SCC p.127, para 5) this Court observed : 
"Equitable considerations have no place where the statute 
contained express provisions." 

36. In India House Vs. Kishan N.Lalwani (2003 (9) SCC 393) (vide SCC 
p.398, para 7) this Court held that : 
"The period of limitation statutorily prescribed has to be strictly 
adhered to and cannot be relaxed or departed from for equitable 
considerations." 
(emphasis supplied)" 

(b) 2003 (1) SCC 730 (Jinia Keotin Vs. Kumar Sitaram Manjhi): 

"4. We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel 
on either side. The Hindu Marriage Act underwent important changes by virtue of 
the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, which came into force with effect 
from 27.5.1976. Under the ordinary law, a child for being treated as legitimate 
must be born in lawful wedlock. If the marriage itself is void on account of 
contravention of the statutory prescription, any child born of such marriage would 
have the effect, per se, or on being so declared or annulled, as the case may be, 
of bastardizing the children born of the parties to such marriage. Polygamy, which 
was permissible and widely prevalent among the Hindus in the past and 
considered to have evil effects on society, came to be put an end to by the 
mandate of the Parliament in enacting the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The 
legitimate status of the children which depended very much upon the marriage 
between their parents being valid or void, thus turned on the act of parents over 
which the innocent child had no hold or control. But, for no fault of it, the innocent 
baby had to suffer a permanent set back in life and in the eyes of society by being 
treated as illegitimate. A laudable and noble act of the legislature indeed in 
enacting Section 16 to put an end to a great social evil. At the same time, Section 
16 of the Act, while engrafting a rule of fiction in ordaining the children, though 
illegitimate, to be treated as legitimate, notwithstanding that the marriage was void 
or voidable chose also to confine its application, so far as succession or 
inheritance by such children are concerned to the properties of the parents only. 
5. So far as Section 16 of the Act is concerned, though it was enacted to 
legitimise children, who would otherwise suffer by becoming illegitimate, at the 
same time it expressly provide in sub-section (3) by engrafting a provision with a 
non obstante clause stipulating specifically that nothing contained in sub-section 
(1) or sub-section (2) shall be construed as conferring upon any child of a 
marriage, which is null and void or which is annulled by a decree a nullity under 
Section 12, "any rights in or to the property of any person, other than the parents, 
in any case where, but for the passing of this Act, such child would have been 
incapable of possessing or acquiring any such rights by reason of his not being 
the legitimate child of his parents." In the light of such an express mandate of the 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


53 

legislature itself, there is no room for according upon such children who but for 
Section 16 would have been branded as illegitimate any further rights than 
envisaged therein by resorting to any presumptive or inferential process of 
reasoning, having recourse to the mere object or purpose of enacting Section 16 
of the Act. Any attempt to do so would amount to doing not only violence to the 
provision specifically engrafted in sub-section (3) of Section 16 of the Act but also 
would attempt to court relegislating on the subject under the guise of 
interpretation, against even the will expressed in the enactment itself. 
Consequently, we are unable to countenance the submissions on behalf of the 
appellants. The view taken by the courts below cannot be considered to suffer 
from any serious infirmity to call for our interference, in this appeal." 

(c) 1995 (6) SCC 213 (Kashibai Vs. Parwatibai): 

"10. This brings us to the question of the Will alleged to have been 
executed by deceased Lachiram in favour of his grandson Purshottam, Defendant 
3. Section 68 of Evidence Act relates to the proof of execution of document 
required by law to be attested. Admittedly, a Deed of Will is one of such 
documents which necessarily require by law to be attested. Section 68 of the 
Evidence Act contemplates that if a document is required by law to be attested, it 
shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called 
for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive, and 
subject to the process of the court and capable of giving evidence. A reading of 
Section 68 will show that 'attestation' and 'execution' are two different acts one 
following the other. There can be no valid execution of a document which under 
the law is required to be attested without the proof of its due attestation and if due 
attestation is also not proved, the fact of execution is of no avail. Section 63 of the 
Indian Succession Act, 1925 also lays down certain rules with regard to the 
execution of unprivileged Wills. Clause (c) of Section 63 provides that the Will 
shall be attested by two or more witnesses, each one of whom has seen the 
testator sign or affix his mark to the Will or has seen some other person sign the 
Will, in the presence and by the direction of the testator, or has received from the 
testator a personal acknowledgement of his signature or mark or the signature of 
such other person; and each of the witnesses should sign the Will in the presence 
of the testator, but it shall not be necessary that more than one witness be present 
at the same time and no particular form of attestation shall be necessary. 
11. Here we may also take note of the definition of the expression 
'attested' as contained in Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act which reads as 
under: 
"3. 'attested', in relation to an instrument, means and shall be 
deemed always to have meant attested by two or more witnesses each of 
whom has seen the executant sign or affix his mark to the instrument, or 
has seen some other person sign the instrument in the presence and by 
the direction of the executant, or has received from the executant a 
personal acknowledgement of his signature or mark, or of the signature of 
such other person, and each of whom has signed the instrument in the 
presence of the executant; but it shall not be necessary that more than 
one of such witnesses shall have been present at the same time, and no 
particular form of attestation shall be necessary." 

Having regard to the aforementioned definition an attesting witness is a person 
who in the presence of an executant of a document puts his signature or mark 
after he has either seen the executant himself or someone on direction of the 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


54 

executant has put his signature or affixed his mark on the document so required to 
be attested or after he has received from the executant a personal 
acknowledgement of his signature or mark or the signature or mark of such other 
person. In the present case the trial court after a close scrutiny and analysis of the 
evidence of Defendant 1, Smt Parvati Bai, Vir Bhadra, Sheikh Nabi, Shivraj and 
Gyanoba Patil who are witnesses to the Will recorded the finding that none of them 
deposed that Lachiram had signed the said Will before them and they had attested 
it. None of them except Sheikh Nabi even deposed as to when the talk about the 
execution of Will was held. The witness Sheikh Nabi, however, deposed that the 
talk about the Will also took place at the time of the talk about the adoption. But 
this witness too did not depose that deceased Lachiram had signed the alleged 
Will in his presence. In the absence of such evidence it is difficult to accept that 
the execution of the alleged Will was proved in accordance with law as required by 
Section 68 of the Evidence Act read with Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act 
and Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act. It may be true as observed by the 
High Court that law does not emphasise that the witness must use the language of 
the section to prove the requisite merits thereof but it is also not permissible to 
assume something which is required by law to be specifically proved. The High 
Court simply assumed that Lachiram must have put his signature on the Will Deed 
in the presence of the attesting witness Sheikh Nabi simply because the Deed of 
Adoption is admitted by the witness to have been executed on the same day. The 
High Court committed a serious error in making the observations that broad 
parameters of Nabi's evidence would show that Lachiram executed the Will in his 
presence, that he signed the Will being part of the execution of the testament and 
this evidence in its correct background would go to show that what was required 
under Section 63 has been carried out in the execution of the Will. With respect to 
the High Court we may say that these findings of the High Court are clearly based 
on assumptions and surmises and, totally against the weight of the evidence on 
record. The trial court on a close and thorough analysis of the entire evidence 
came to a proper conclusion that the Will has not been proved in accordance with 
law which finding has been further affirmed by the lower appellate court after an 
independent reappraisal of entire evidence with which we find ourselves in 
agreement as there was hardly any scope or a valid reason for the High Court to 
interfere with." 

(d) 2008 (12) SCC 577 (Kamlesh Babu Vs. Lajpat Rai Sharma): 

"16. Having considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective 
parties, the decisions cited by them and the relevant law on the subject, we are 
unable to accept Ms.Srivastava's submissions mainly on two counts. Firstly, the 
facts disclosed clearly indicate that neither the first appellate court nor the High 
Court took notice of Section 3(1) of the Limitation Act, 1963, which reads as 
follows: 
"3. Bar of limitation.--(1) Subject to the provisions contained in Sections 4 
to 24 (inclusive), every suit instituted, appeal preferred, and application 
made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed although limitation has 
not been set up as a defence." 
Even in the decision of this Court in Darshan Singh case (State of Punjab Vs. 
Darshan Singh -2004 (1) SCC 328), the said provision does not appear to have 
been brought to the notice of the Hon'ble Judges who decided the matter. 

17. It is well settled that Section 3(1) of the Limitation Act casts a duty 
upon the court to dismiss a suit or an appeal or an application, if made after the 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


55 

prescribed period, although, limitation is not set up as a defence. 
... ... 
21. It is no doubt true, as was pointed out by this Court in Balasaria 
Construction (P) Ltd. (Balasaria Construction (P). Ltd. Vs. Hanuman Seva Trust -
2006 (5) SCC 658) and also in Narne Rama Murthy case (Narne Rama Murthy Vs. 
Ravula Somasundaram -2005 (6) SCC 614), that if the plea of limitation is a mixed 
question of law and fact, the same cannot be raised at the appellate stage. We 
have no problem with the said proposition of law. What we are concerned with is 
whether the said proposition is applicable to the facts of this case. In this case the 
plea of limitation had been raised in the written statement and though no specific 
issue was framed in respect thereof, a decision was given thereupon by the 
learned trial court. 
22. Apart from Section 3(1) of the Limitation Act, even Order 7 Rule 11(d) 
of the Code of Civil Procedure casts a mandate upon the court to reject a plaint 
where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law, in 
this case by the law of limitation. Further, as far back as in 1943, the Privy Council 
in Lachhmi Sewak Sahu Vs. Ram Rup Sahu (AIR 1944 PC 24) held that a point of 
limitation is prima facie admissible even in the court of last resort, although it had 
not been taken in the lower courts. 
23. The reasoning behind the said proposition is that certain questions 
relating to the jurisdiction of a court, including limitation, goes to the very root of the 
court's jurisdiction to entertain and decide a matter, as otherwise, the decision 
rendered without jurisdiction will be a nullity. ... ... " 

(e) 2008 (8) SCC 463 (Kunvarjeet Singh Khandpur Vs. Kirandeep Kaur): 

"11. In Kerala SEB Vs. T.P.Kunhaliumma (1976 (4) SCC 634) it was inter 
alia observed as follows: (SCC pp.638 & 39, para 18 & 22): 
"18. The alteration of the division as well as the change in the 
collocation of words in Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 compared 
with Article 181 of the 1908 Limitation Act shows that applications 
contemplated under Article 137 are not applications confined to the Code 
of Civil Procedure. In the 1908 Limitation Act there was no division 
between applications in specified cases and other applications as in the 
1963 Limitation Act. The words "any other application" under Article 137 
cannot be said on the principle of ejusdem generis to be applications under 
the Civil Procedure Code other than those mentioned in Part I of the third 
division. Any other application under Article 137 would be petition or any 
application under any Act. But it has to be an application to a court for the 
reason that Sections 4 and 5 of the 1963 Limitation Act speak of expiry of 
prescribed period when court is closed and extension of prescribed period 
if applicant or the appellant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause 
for not preferring the appeal or making the application during such period. 
* 
* 
* 
22. The conclusion we reach is that Article 137 of the 1963 
Limitation Act will apply to any petition or application filed under any Act to 
a civil court. With respect we differ from the view taken by the two-Judge 
bench of this Court in Athani Municipal Council case (Town Municipal 
Council, Athani Vs. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, 1969 (1) SCC 873) 
and hold that Article 137 of the 1963 Limitation Act is not confined to 
applications contemplated by or under the Code of Civil Procedure. The 
petition in the present case was to the District Judge as a court. The 
petition was one contemplated by the Telegraph Act for judicial decision. 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


56 

The petition is an application falling within the scope of Article 137 of the 
1963 Limitation Act." 

In terms of the aforesaid judgment any application to Civil Court under the Act is 
covered by Article 137. The application is made in terms of Section 264 of the Act 
to the District Judge. Section 2(bb) of the Act defines the District Judge to be the 
Judge of the Principal Civil Court. 
12. Further in S.S. Rathore Vs. State of M.P. (1989 (4) SCC 582 : 1990 
SCC (L & S) 50 : 1989 (11) ATC 913) it was inter-alia stated as follows: (SCC 
p.585, para 5) 
"5. Appellant's counsel placed before us the residuary Article 113 
and had referred to a few decisions of some High Courts where in a 
situation as here reliance was placed on that article. It is unnecessary to 
refer to those decisions as on the authority of the judgment of this Court in 
the case of Pierce Leslie & Co. Ltd. Vs. Violet Ouchterlony Wapshare 
(AIR 1969 SC 843) it must be held that Article 113 of the Act of 1963, 
corresponding to Article 120 of the old Act, is a general one and would 
apply to suits to which no other article in the schedule applies." 

13. Article 137 of the Limitation Act reads as follows: 

Description of suit 
Period of limitation 
Time from which 
period begins to run 

137. 
Any 
other 
application for which no 
period of limitation is 
provided elsewhere in 
this Division. 

Three years 

When the right to 
apply accrues 

The crucial expression in the petition (sic Article) is "right to apply". In view of what 
has been stated by this Court, Article 137 is clearly applicable to the petition for 
grant of Letters of Administration. As rightly observed by the High Court in such 
proceedings the application merely seeks recognition from the Court to perform a 
duty because of the nature of the proceedings it is a continuing right. The Division 
Bench of the Delhi High Court referred to several decisions. One of them was 
S.Krishnaswami Vs. E.Ramiah (AIR 1991 Madras 214). In para 17 of the said 
judgment it was noted as follows: (AIR p.222) 
"17. In a proceeding, or in other words, in an application filed for 
grant of probate or letters of administration, no right is asserted or claimed 
by the applicant. The applicant only seeks recognition of the Court to 
perform a duty. Probate or letter of Administration issued by a competent 
Court is conclusive proof of the legal character throughout the world. An 
assessment of the relevant provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 
does not convey a meaning that by the Proceedings filed for grant of 
probate or letters of administration, no rights of the applicant are settled or 
secured in the legal sense. The author of the testament has cast the duty 
with regard to the administration of his estate, and the applicant for probate 
or letters of administration only seeks the permission of the Court to 
perform that duty. There is only a seeking of recognition from the Court to 
perform the duty. That duty is only moral and it is not legal. There is no law 
which compels the applicant to file the proceedings for probate or letters of 
administration. With a view to discharge the moral duty, the applicant seeks

57 

recognition from the Court to perform the duty. It will be legitimate to 
conclude that the proceedings filed for grant of probate or letters of 
administration is not an action in law. Hence, it is very difficult to and it will 
not be in order to construe the proceedings for grant of probate or letters of 
administration as applications coming within the meaning of an 'application' 
under Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963." 

14. Though the nature of the petition has been rightly described by the 
High Court, it was not correct in observing that the application for grant of probate 
or letters of Administration is not covered by Article 137 of the Limitation Act. Same 
is not correct in view of what has been stated in Kerala SEB case (supra). 
15. Similarly reference was made to a decision of the Bombay High Court 
in Vasudev Daulatram Sadarangani Vs. Sajni Prem Lalwani (AIR 1983 Bom. 268). 
Para 16 reads as follows: (AIR p.270) 
"16. Rejecting Mr.Dalpatrai's contention, I summarise my 
conclusions thus:--
(a) under the Limitation Act no period is advisedly 
prescribed within which an application for probate, letters of 
administration or succession certificate must be made; 
(b) the assumption that under Article 137 the right to apply 
necessarily accrues on the date of the death of the deceased, is 
unwarranted; 
(c) such an application is for the Court's permission to 
perform a legal duty created by a Will or for recognition as a 
testamentary trustee and is a continuous right which can be 
exercised any time after the death of the deceased, as long as the 
right to do so survives and the object of the trust exists or any part 
of the trust, if created, remains to be executed; 
(d) the right to apply would accrue when it becomes 
necessary to apply which may not necessarily be within 3 years 
form the date of he deceased's death. 
(e) delay beyond 3 years after the deceased's death would 
arouse suspicion and greater the delay, greater would be the 
suspicion; 
(f) such delay must be explained, but cannot be equated 
with the absolute bar of limitation; and 
(g) once execution and attestation are proved, suspicion of 
delay no longer operates". 
Conclusion 'b' is not correct while the conclusion 'c' is the correct position of law." 

(f) 1990 (2) SCC 42 (Patasibai Vs. Ratanlal): 

"13. On the admitted facts appearing from the record itself, learned 
counsel for the respondent, was unable to show that all or any of these 
averments in the plaint disclose a cause of action giving rise to a triable issue. 
In fact, Shri Salve was unable to dispute the inevitable consequence that the 
plaint was liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11, CPC on these 
averments. All that Shri Salve contended was that the court did not in fact 
reject the plaint under Order VII Rule 11, CPC and summons having been 
issued, the trial must proceed. In our opinion, it makes no difference that the 
trial court failed to perform its duty and proceeded to issue summons without 
carefully reading the plaint and the High Court also overlooked this fatal defect. 
Since the plaint suffers from this fatal defect, the mere issuance of summons 
by the trial court does not require that the trial should proceed even when no 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


58 

triable issue is shown to arise. Permitting the continuance of such a suit is 
tantamount to licensing frivolous and vexatious litigation. This cannot be done. 
14. It being beyond dispute that the plaint averments do not disclose a 
cause of action, the plaint is liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11, CPC 
without going into the applicability of Order XXIII Rule 3-A, CPC to the present 
suit. Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary to adopt the technical 
course of directing the trial court to make the consequential order of rejecting 
the plaint and, instead, we adopt the practical course of making that order in 
this proceeding itself to avoid any needless delay in conclusion of this futile 
litigation." 

(g) 2004 (8) SCC 229 (Krishna Bahadur Vs. Purna Theatre): 

"9. The principle of waiver although is akin to the principle of estoppel; 
the difference between the two, however, is that whereas estoppel is not a 
cause of action; it is a rule of evidence; waiver is contractual and may 
constitute a cause of action; it is an agreement between the parties and a party 
fully knowing of its rights has agreed not to assert a right for a consideration." 

(h) 2004 (13) SCC 792 (A.P.SRTC Vs. S.Jayaram): 

"5. It was next submitted that the respondent should be deemed to have 
waived his rights under Circular No. 45/81 by submitting tender in response to the 
notice inviting tenders in the year 1984 and he must be held bound by the terms 
of the contract which he entered into pursuant to the tender submitted by him. 
The High Court has formed an opinion that the respondent cannot be deemed to 
have waived the right or the benefit available to him under Circular No. 45/81 
because he was not even aware of the existence of the circular. To constitute 
waiver there must be an intentional relinquishment of a known right or the 
voluntary relinquishment or abandonment of a known existing legal right or 
conduct such as warrants an inference of the relinquishment of a known right or 
privilege (Basheshar Nath Vs. CIT --AIR 1959 SC 149). Moreover, the circular 
itself stipulates the Corporation making an offer to the contractors for taking 
benefit of the policy decision and it is undisputed that the Corporation never made 
such an offer to the respondent. Inasmuch as there is a failure on the part of the 
Corporation to extend the benefit of the circular to the respondent, the 
Corporation cannot be permitted to take shelter behind its own wrong." 

(i) 1987 (Supp) SCC 663 (Samar Singh Vs. Kedar Nath): 

"5. The above view was reiterated by this Court in Bhagwati Prasad Dixit 
Vs. Rajiv Gandhi (1986 (4) SCC 78 : 1986 SCC (Cri) 399) and Dhartipakar 
Madan Lal Agarwal Vs. Rajiv Gandhi (1987 Supp.SCC 93). If an election petition 
does not disclose cause of action, it can be dismissed summarily at the threshold 
of the proceeding under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If an 
election petition can be summarily rejected at the threshold of the proceeding we 
do not see any reason as to why the same cannot be rejected at any stage of 
subsequent proceeding. If after framing of issues basic defect in the election 
petition persists (absence of cause of action) it is always open to the contesting 
respondent to insist that the petition be rejected, under Order 7 Rule 11 and the 
court would be acting within its jurisdiction, in considering the objection. Order 7 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


59 

Rule 11 does not place any restriction or limitation on the exercise of court's 
power; it does not either expressly or by necessary implication provide that power 
under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC should be exercised at a particular stage only. In the 
absence of any restriction placed by the statutory provision, it is open to the court 
to exercise that power at any stage. While it is true that ordinarily preliminary 
objection to the maintainability of the petition on the ground of absence of cause 
of action should be raised by the respondent as early as possible but if a party 
raises objections after filing written statement the preliminary objection cannot be 
ignored. If the election petition does not disclose any cause of action, the 
respondent's right to raise objection to the maintainability of the petition, or the 
court's power to consider the objection is not affected adversely merely because 
the objection is raised after filing of written statement or framing of issues. The 
court would be acting within its jurisdiction in exercise of its power under Order 7 
Rule 11 in rejecting the same even after settlement of issues." 

(j) 1999 (3) CTC 136 (Madras High Court) (Singaram @ Velayudha Udayar Vs. 

Subramaniam): 

"18. Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act had been enacted to confer a 
right of inheritance on the illegitimate child born out of void or voidable marriage 
from out of the individual properties of their father. The section before amendment 
dealing with the children of void marriages provided that if a decree of nullity was 
passed, the children begotten or conceived before the decree would have been 
the legitimate children of the parties to the marriage, if it had been dissolved. As 
the old provision contemplated the necessity of a decree of nullity under Section 
11 which took into its fold only the marriages in contravention of the conditions in 
classes (i) (iv) and (v) of Section 5. The proviso to the old section is now 
incorporated as sub-section (3) of the said Act. 
19. Sub-section (3) provides that in case of a child of a marriage which is 
null and void or which is annulled by a decree of nullity under Section 12 though 
the child may be a illegitimate child under sub-section (1) or (2) the child would be 
entitled only to possess or acquire rights in or to any property of its parents and 
not to those of others, in fact, it means such child would not have the status of a 
legitimate so far as the persons other than the parents are concerned. 
20. A thorough reading of Section 16 makes it clear that there should be 
a void or voidable marriage between the parents of the individual who claims the 
status of an illegitimate child to get a share from out of the estate of his father. If 
there is no proof of any marriage, then the children born cannot also be treated as 
illegitimate children entitled for a share. In the judgment reported in Muthayya Vs. 
Kamu, 1981 (I) MLJ 107 it has been held as follows: 
"The result is there is no proof of any marriage between the first 
plaintiff and Meenakshisundaram and that the children born cannot also 
be treated as legitimate children." 
... ... 
22. In the case on hand there is absolutely no evidence to establish the 
question of marriage between Nainamalai and the fourth defendant. More so, both 
the courts below have concurrently, on a question of fact, held that there was no 
marriage at all in any form between the said Nainamalai and the fourth defendant. 
When there is no marriage, the fourth defendant can be only a concubine of the 
said Nainamalai. Section 16 of the said Act do not deal with the rights of the 
children through the concubinage. 
.. ... 
25. Even in considering this argument of the learned senior counsel for 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


60 

the appellant, it has to be considered that the presumption of the marriage can be 
drawn by the long co-habitation of the man and the woman and their living 
together and they have been treated by their relatives and the society as husband 
and wife. 
26. It is rather unfortunate that the fourth defendants who claims the 
status of the second wife and the fifth defendant Arunachalam who claims to be 
the legitimate son of the said Nainamalai have not filed any written statement 
claiming such plea, The third defendant, the mother of the first defendant and his 
brother Nainamalai even though stated that Nainamalai married the fourth 
defendant, no particulars with regard to the marriage is forthcoming. In the written 
statement filed by the third defendant, adopted by the second defendant, it is 
stated that Nainamalai lived with the fourth defendant,No particulars have been 
stated with regard to the time of desertion by the second plaintiff, the first wife of 
Nainamalai and the period for which the fourth defendant and Nainamalai lived 
together. Here also it may be pertinent to note that living together means they 
ought to have been lived together for considerably a long period and just the 
paramour visiting the place of the concubine cannot be considered to be living 
together and which confers a right of inheritance to the children as illegitimate one. 
Merely D.W.3 village Karnam has stated that after the death of Nainamalai the 
property was divided among his two wives, it cannot be said that the relatives of 
the said Nainamalai and the fourth defendant have treated them as husband and 
wife. In the absence of any evidence to show that the relatives of both the parties 
or the society at large have treated them as husband and wife, no such 
presumption can be drawn." 

(k) AIR 1991 Madras 214 (Division Bench of Madras High Court) (S.Krishnaswami and 

etc., etc., Vs. E.Devarajan and others): 

"17. In a proceeding, or in other words, in an application filed for grant of 
probate or letters of administration, no right is asserted or claimed by the 
applicant. The applicant only seeks recognition of the Court to perform a duty. 
Probate or letter of Administration issued by a competent Court is conclusive 
proof of the legal character throughout the world. An assessment of the relevant 
provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 does not convey a meaning that by 
the Proceedings filed for grant of probate or letters of administration, no rights of 
the applicant are settled or secured in the legal sense. The author of the 
testament has cast the duty with regard to the administration of his estate, and the 
applicant for probate or letters of administration only seeks the permission of the 
Court to perform that duty. There is only a seeking of recognition from the Court to 
perform the duty. That duty is only moral and it is not legal. There is no law which 
compels the applicant to file the proceedings for probate or letters of 
administration. With a view to discharge the moral duty, the applicant seeks 
recognition from the Court to perform the duty. It will be legitimate to conclude that 
the proceedings filed for grant of probate or letters of administration is not an 
action in law. Hence, it is very difficult to and it will not be in order to construe the 
proceedings for grant of probate or letters of administration as applications 
coming with the meaning of an 'application' under Art.137 of the Limitation Act, 
1963. 
... .... ... 
20. We have now, as per our preceding discussion, settled the question 
and we hold that Art.137 of the Limitation Act would not apply to proceedings filed 
for grant of probate or letters of administration with or without the Will annexed. 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


61 

Before concluding, we must point out that though the proceedings filed for grant of 
probate or letters of administration may not come within the mischief of Art.137 of 
the Limitation Act, 1963, yet the delay aspect is relevant to test the genuineness of 
the Will propounded. Delay in taking steps gives rise to suspicion and the longer 
the delay the stronger the suspicion. .. ... " 

(l) 1989 (2) LW 319 (Madras High Court) (Sakunthala Vs. Minor Vijayalakshmi): 

" 15. The Parliament thought fit to change the position by introducing the 
Limitation Act No. 36 of 1963 which replaced the Act of 1908. As per the 
preamble, the new Act is to consolidate and amend the law for the Limitation of 
suits and other proceedings and purposes connected therewith. Even the 
definition of 'Applicant' was changed, which indicated that the Act is intended to 
apply to proceedings under the Indian Succession Act also. While in the earlier 
Act an 'Applicant' was defined as 'including any person from or through whom an 
applicant derives his right to apply', the present Act defines an 'applicant' as 
follows:-
"applicant" includes:-
(i) a petitioner; 
(ii) any person from or through whom an applicant derives his right to 
apply? 
(iii) any person whose estate is represented by the applicant as executor. 
administrator or other representative." 
The term 'application' is defined for the first time in this Act as including a petition. 
Thus, there is a clear indication that Original Petitions which may not be covered 
by the Code of Civil Procedure would also be within the purview of the present 
Act. 
16. Art.137 of Act 36 of 1963 is the provision corresponding to Art. 181 
of the previous Act. There is a significant change in the language in column (1). 
Art. 137 is as follows: 

Description of suit 
Period of limitation 
Time from which 
period begins to run 

137. 
Any 
other 
application for which no 
period of limitation is 
provided elsewhere in 
this Division. 

Three years 

When the right to 
apply accrues 

The language of Art. 137 also makes it clear that the Article is not confined to the 
applications under the Code of Civil procedure. Though there was a conflict of 
opinions among the Courts in this country as to the applicability of the Article to 
applications filed under provisions other than the Code of Civil Procedure, the 
controversy was set at rest by the apex Court of the country in The Kerala State 
Electricity Board, Trivandrum Vs. T.P.Kunhaliumma (AIR 1977 SC 282). The law is 
stated in unmistakable terms in paragraph 18, 21 and 22 of the Judgment, which 
are extracted hereunder : 
"18. The alteration of the Division as well as the change in the 
application in Art.137 of the Limitation Act 1963 compared with Art.181 of 
the 1908 Limitation Act shows that applications contemplated under 
Art.137 are not applications confined to the Code of Civil Procedure. In 
the 1908 Limitation Act there was no division between applications in 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


62 

specified cases and other applications as in the 1963 Limitation Act. The 
words 'any other application under Art.137 cannot be said on the principle 
of ejusdem generies to be application under the Civil Procedure Code 
other than those mentioned in Part I of the third Division. Any other 
application under Art.137 would be petition or any application under any 
Act. But it has to be an application to a Court for the reason that S. 4 and 
5 of the 1963 Limitation Act speak of expiry of prescribed period when 
Court is closed and extension of prescribed period if applicant or the 
appellant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring 
the appeal cr making the application during such period.

21. The changed definition of the words 'applicant' and 
'application' contained in S.2(a) and 2(b) of the 1963 Limitation Act 
indicates the object of the Limitation Act to include petitions, original or 
otherwise, under special laws. The interpretation which was given to 
Art.181 of the 1908 Limitation Act on the principles of ejusdem geuerise is 
not applicable with regard to Art.137 of the 1963 Limitation Act. Art.137 
stands in isolation from all other Articles in Part I of the third division. This 
Court in Nityananda Joshi's case (AIR 1970 SC 209), has rightly thrown 
doubt on the two Judge Bench decision of this Court in Anthani Municipal 
Council case (AIR 1969 SC 1335), where this Court construed Art.137 to 
be referable to applications under the Civil Procedure Code. Art.137 
includes petitions within the word 'applications'. These petitions and 
applications can be under any special Act as in the present case. 
22. The conclusion we reach is that Art.137 of the 1963 Limitation 
Act will apply to any petition or application filed under any Act to a civil 
Court. With respect we differ from the view taken by the two Judge Bench 
of this Court in Anthani Municipal Council case (AIR 1969 SC 1335), and 
hold that Art.137 of the 1963 Limitation Act is not confined to applications 
contemplated by or under the Code of Civil Procedure. The petition in the 
present case was to the District Judge as a Court. The petition was one 
contemplated by the Telegraph Act for judicial decision. The petition is an 
application falling within the scope of Art.137 of the 1963 Limitation Act." 

17. After the pronouncement of the Supreme Court, it will be futile to 
contend that Art.137 does not apply to applications for probate, Letters of 
Administration etc. Whatever may be the nature of the proceeding, so long as it is 
an application to a Court, it will be governed by Art.137 of the Limitation Act. "No 
authority has been placed before me taking a contrary view. The judgment of the 
Patna Bench in Ramanand Thakur's case (AIR 1982 Patna 87), on which reliance 
is placed by the plaintiff is also on the footing that Art.137 of the Limitation Act will 
apply to an application for grant of probate or Letters of Administration. But, the 
Bench proceeded to hold that in the case of an application for grant of probate or 
Letters of Administration, it is difficult to find out when the right to apply accrues 
and unless that date can be fixed, there is no question of starting of the period of 
limitation. With respect to learned Judges who constituted the Bench, I do not 
agree. There can be no question of any difficulty at all in finding out as to when 
the right to apply accrues in any case. Even if there is any difficulty in fixing the 
date, that will not take away the application from the purview of the Article which 
has been held to apply to the application. In so far as column (3) of the Article is 
concerned, the Court has to decide on the facts and circumstances of each case 
as to when the right to apply for the relief prayed for in the application accrued to 
the applicant therein. It has been repeatedly held that for the purposes of the third 
column, the relevant date is the date on which the right accrued for the first time. 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


63 

... ... .. 
21. I am afraid, there is a fallacy in the reasoning The word used in the 
third column is 'accrues'. The term 'accrue' has been defined in the Oxford 
Dictionary as "to arise or spring as a natural growth or result; to grow, grow up". 
A right which has accrued cannot be said to accrue every day until it is exercised. 
In the absence of a provision for limitation, every right will continue to subsist till it 
is actually exercised. For example, a creditor has a right to recover the money 
due to him from his debtor. His right continues to exist so long as the debtor does 
not repay. If there is no provision in the Limitation Act prescribing a time limit for 
instituting a proceeding for recovery of the money due to the creditor, the creditor 
can file a suit or other proceeding at any time he chooses. In that case also it can 
be said that his right to recover the money arises every day. But, the Limitation 
Act has prescribed a period with in which the creditor is bound to file a suit for 
recovery of the money and by the third column in the Schedule, the relevant date 
from which the limitation begins to run is also fixed by the statute. Similarly, in the 
case of a trespass, the owner of the property has a right to recover possession 
The commencement of the right was on the date of trespass. It will never end if 
there is no provision in the Limitation Act prescribing a period of Limitation for 
instituting a proceeding for recovery of possession. In that case also it can be 
said that his right to recover possession arises from day to day and every 
moment so long as the trespasser continues to be in possession. Hence, it will be 
fallacious to keep out a particular type of application from the scope of Art. 137 of 
the Limitation Act on the basis of the reasoning that the right to apply accrues 
from day to day and every moment. If on a reference to the language in the third 
column, the date on which the right to apply accrues for the first time is fixed, 
then the right comes to an end at the end of three years therefrom. There can be 
no escape from that position. 
22. The probable reason for which the statutes of limitation passed in the 
19th century excluded from their purview the proceedings for probate or Letters 
of Administration etc., as suggested by Muttusami Ayyar,J, is caught hold of by 
the Patna Bench in Ramanad Thakur's case (AIR 1982 Patna 87) as well as a 
single Judge of the Bombay High Court in a later case, to which I will refer 
presently. I have already referred to the fact that the question which arose before 
the great Judge did not turn on the interpretation of column 3 of the Schedule. 
Having found that the provisions of the entire Act as it stood then exempted 
applications for probate from the operation thereof, the learned Judge in his 
wisdom ventured to give a reason which could have probably prompted the 
Legislature to make such an exemption. It should not also be forgotten that the 
observation made by the learned Judge is applicable only to an application for 
probate at the instance of an executor. The position with reference to an executor 
does not arise for my consideration in the present case. The discussion of the 
question in this case confines itself to applications for Letters of Administration. A 
legatee who applies for Letters of Administration can by no stretch of imagination 
be compared to a trustee or be called a testamentary trustee. It cannot be said 
that he is seeking permission of the Court to perform a duty created by the will, 
for, no duty is imposed upon the legatee by the will. Even if it is so, the application 
to this Court is one for grant of Letters of Administration with the will annexed. 
The right to apply for the said relief accrued in favour of the applicant more than a 
decade before the presentation of the application. On the facts of this case, the 
relevant dates have already been set out and for the purpose of convenience, 
they are repeated here. The testator died on 12.2.1944. The two executors 
appointed under the will died before 1970 (the exact date does not appear in the 
records). The first beneficiary Rajambal died on 27.3.1970. Even assuming that 
the right of the plaintiff to apply for Letters of administration did not accrue on any 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


64 

earlier date, it cannot be denied that it accrued on 27.3.1970, on the death of 
Rajambal. Even if it can be said by any process of reasoning of which I am not 
aware, the right to apply did not accrue on that date, the date could not be later 
than 1.10.1973 when the plaintiff's brother Nithyanandham sold the property to 
defendants 4 and 5. The plaintiff, who was aware of the fact, filed a suit in the 
City Civil Court in 1974 and the claim put forward by her under the will was 
contested immediately in 1976 by the defendants therein. In spite of that, the 
plaintiff did not choose to present the application for probate till 9.11.1983. Unless 
the Court closes its eyes to the provisions of Art.137 of the Limitation Act and 
ignores the same altogether, the present proceeding instituted by the plaintiff 
cannot be held to be in time. 
23. There is a judgment of a single Judge of the Bombay High Court 
which was not cited by either counsel in this case. That is a decision by Lentin. J., 
in Vasudev Daulatram Sadarangani Vs. Sajni Prem Lalwani (AIR 1983 Bombay 
268). The learned Judge held that under the Limitation Act 1963, no period is 
advisedly prescribed within which a petition for probate or Letters of 
administration or succession certificate must be made and that the right to apply 
under Art. 137 of the Act would accrue when it becomes necessary to apply 
which need not necessarily be within three years from the date of death of the 
deceased. It is seen that paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment are alone 
approved for reporting by the Bombay High Court and they alone find a place in 
the report. Hence, it is not possible to know the facts of the case, particularly as 
to whether the application before the learned Judge was one for probate or letters 
of administration. The Learned Judge drew inspiration from the judgment of 
Muttusami Ayyar, J. in Gnanamuthu Upadesi's case (ILR 17 Mad.379), and took 
the view that the right to apply may accrue as and when it becomes necessary to 
apply. With respect to the learned Judge, I do not know how the proposition laid 
down by the Learned Judge flows from the observation made by Muttusami 
Ayyar, J. in Gnanamuthu Upades's case (ILR 17 Mad. 379). The reasoning is 
also not correct. The decision of the Supreme Court in The Kerala State 
Electricity Board, Trivandium Vs. T.V.Kunhaliumma (AIR 1977 SC 282), was 
brought to the notice of the Learned Judge. Yet, he took the view that the 
observations made by the Supreme Court will have nothing to do with the 
exercise of a continuous right of an executor seeking the Court's permission to 
perform the duties cast on him by the Will. If the case before the Learned Judge 
related to an application for probate by an executor, I will have nothing to do with 
it. As stated already, I am not called upon to decide in this case, the question of 
limitation for filing an application for probate by an executor. If the judgment of 
Lentin,J. pertained to an application for letters of administration, I express my 
dissent with the view taken by the learned Judge. In my opinion, the Judgment 
runs counter to the ruling of the Supreme Court in the Kerala State Electricity 
Board's case (AIR 1977 SC 282). 
.... ... 
27. Reliance was placed by the plaintiff on the provisions of 0.25, R. 9 of 
the Original Side Rules. The rule is in the following terms:-
"In any case where probate or letters of Administration is for the 
first time applied for after the lapse of three years, from the death of the 
deceased, the reason for the delay shall be explained in the petition." 

The rule remains unamended even after the passing of the Limitation Act 36 of 
1963. In any event, a provision in the Original Side rules cannot override the 
provision in the Limitation Act. Once it is held that Art. 137 of the Limitation Act 
will apply and the present proceeding is barred by time, 0.25, R.9 of the Original 
side Rules will not help the plaintiff in any manner."

21. Upon hearing the learned counsel appearing for both parties and perusing the 

records, it is seen that the following facts are admitted by both sides: 

S.V.Ramakrishnan married Rajalakshmi and their marriage invitation is marked as 

Ex.D-1. The first defendant is their daughter and the second defendant is their son. The plaintiff-

N.Renuka Devi, R.Vijayalakshmi @ R.Vijaya and R.S.P.Dhanurmathi are the daughters and 

S.V.R.Ramprasad is the son of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and S.V.R.Saroja, the second

22. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff contended that Late S.V.Ramakrishnan 

executed the Will on 15.07.1970 out of free consent and in a sound and disposing state of mind in 

the presence of two attesting witnesses, namely T.S.Ramadoss and Dr.R.Paul Doraiswamy and 

the Will was duly registered on the next day, i.e. 16.07.1970 in the Sub-Registrar Office. It is 

useful to quote the contents of Ex.P-1 Will executed by the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan, dated 

15.07.1970, registered on 16.07.1970, which reads as follows: 

"I, S.V.RAMAKRISHNAN, son of S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar, Hindu, aged 
50 years, residing at " Ramamandiram" No.471, Poonamalle High Road, Madras, 
make this Last Will and Testament the day month and year written below: 
I am now 50 years old and am keeping indifferent health. My first wife, 
Rajalakshmi, died in March 1952, leaving behind a son, Matha Prasad, and a 
daughter Lalitha. Matha Prasad and myself entered into a family arrangement in 
May, 1969 and he has left me. My daughter, Lalitha, married against my wishes, 
and hence I do not propose to leave anything to her. 
I am living with Srimathi Saroja, and we are living as husband and wife, 
even though there has not been a marriage between us. I have two daughters 
and a son through her. I want to make provision for them and after careful 
deliberation have decided to execute this Will. 
It will not be possible now to detail the properties, immoveables, 
moveable, cash, etc., that I may die possessed of. Hence I do not propose to 
detail them. 
All the properties, immoveable, cash in Bank, Securities, moveables, 
such as furniture, paintings, shares, etc., I hereby bequeath as follows:-
All the properties on the date of my death shall be taken over by the 
Official Trustee, or such officer or person appointed by Court, and he shall deal 
with them as follows:-
(a) The Official Trustee shall pay Rs.200/-a month to Srimathi Saroja 
who is living with me as my wife. 
(b) The Official Trustee shall pay for the education and maintenance of 
my children through Saroja, i.e. Vijaya, Rama Prasad and Renuka Devi. 
(c) The properties shall be held by the Official Trustee till my youngest 
daughter Renuka completes the age of 18. Then a sum of Rupees one Lakh or 
property worth a Lakh of rupees shall be given to Vijaya and Rama Prasad. The 
remainder shall be handed over to Renuka Devi. Renuka Devi shall pay Rs.200/-
per month to her mother, Saroja, for her maintenance. The properties handed 
over to Renuka Devi shall be enjoyed by her for life and shall be inherited 
absolutely by her children. 
In case any of my above children leave the Hindu fold or marry a non-
Hindu, they will not be entitled to the Legacy conferred by me. On such 
disqualification, the Legacy will be taken equally by my other children through 
Saroja. 
My son, Matha Prasad, or my daughter, Lalitha, shall not be entitled to 
any share or interest in the properties left by me. 
My last rites shall be performed by Rama Prasad. 
I hereby revoke all the previous Wills executed by me. This Will shall take 
effect only after my lifetime and I reserve the rights to modify or cancel this Will. 
In witness whereof, I, the said S.V.Ramakrishnan, have to this my Last 
Will and Testament set my name this 15th day of July, One Thousand Nine

23. From the above extracted contents of the Will, it is clear that the Will was executed 

by S.V.Ramakrishnan on 15.07.1970 and it was registered on 16.07.1970 as Document No.39 of 

1970. Since both the attesting witnesses to the Will, namely T.S.Ramadoss and Dr.R.Paul 

Doraiswamy, died, for proving the Will, on the side of the plaintiff, P.W.2 B.Murali Kumar, the 

grand-son of T.S.Ramadoss, was examined and he deposed in his chief-examination as follows: 

"I am the grandson of T.S.Ramadoss. I am well acquainted with his 
signature. I am filing proof affidavit before the Hon'ble Court and the same may 
be treated as part of my evidence. Ex.P30 is the third party affidavit filed by me 
along with OP. My grandfather T.S.Ramadoss was the Correspondent in 
Jeevarathinammal High School Trust, Thiruverkadu. Ex.P-31 is the letter dated 
26.07.1984 written by the Managing Trustee and Correspondent of 
Jeevarathinammal High School Trust, Thiruverkadu to Mrs.Jaya Srinivasan 
acknowledging the receipt of donation. (The witness was shown the xerox copy 
of the Will dated 15.07.1970 and was asked to identify the signature of his 
grandfather. The witness has identified the signature of his grandfather as 
attesting witness No.1). Ex.P-32 is the xerox copy of the Will dated 15.07.1970 
executed by Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan in which the signature of T.S.Ramadoss is 
found as attesting witness No.1 (The original of Ex.P-32 is marked as Ex.P-1)." 

24. Further, P.W.2 in his cross-examination has stated as follows: 

" .... .... The writing at page 3 of Ex.P-1 Will, namely "Mr.T.S.Ramadoss, 
son of late T.Sadagopan, Sridevi Upsagar Sridevi Karumariyamman 
devasthanam, Thiruverkadu, Madras-56" is the handwriting of my grandfather 
Mr.T.S.Ramadoss. The signature found at page 2 of the Will Ex.P-1 as an 
attesting witness No.1 is that of my grandfather Mr.T.S.Ramadoss. I deny the 
suggestion that the signature of my grandfather in Ex.P1 as well as his signature 
found at Ex.P-31 are not one and the same. I deny the suggestion that the name 
and address of Mr.T.S.Ramadoss written at page 3 of the Will Ex.P-1 is not in the 
handwriting of my grandfather. I deny the suggestion that since I happened to be 
the friend of Ramprasad, son of S.V.Ramakrishnan, I have come to Court to 
given evidence in their favour. " 

25. Furthermore, in order to prove the signature of another attesting witness to the Will, 

namely, Dr.R.Paul Doraiswamy, to the Will, P.W.5 Dr.Philip Rajanna Doraiswamy was examined 

and in his chief-examination, he has stated as follows: 

"I am filing my proof affidavit before this Hon'ble Court and the same may 
be treated as part of my evidence. I know the signature of my father Dr.Paul 
Rajanna Doraiswamy. The Will Ex.P-1 was shown to the witness and was asked 
to identify his father's signature therein. The witness has identified his father's 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


69 

signature in Ex.P-1 as attesting witness No.2. Ex.P-37 is the cumulative record 
issued to me by Don Bosco Matriculation School, Madras-8 in which my father 
has signed in the column intended for parents signature at page 3. Ex.P-38 is the 
third party affidavit signed and filed along with O.P.No.367/2008 which is 
converted as T.O.S.No.2/2009." 

26. Further, P.W.5 in his cross-examination, has stated as follows: 

"Dr.R.Paul Doraiswamy had two children. I am the youngest. My elder 
sister is a doctor. She is a citizen of USA. My father died on 30.04.1979. I met 
Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan. Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan was my father's friend and at that 
time, I was about 18 years of old and I know Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan and used to 
address him as uncle. Both Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan as well as my father did not 
mention about the existence of the Will executed by Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan. The 
signature of my father Dr.Paul Doraiswamy in Ex.P-1 as well as Ex.P-37 is the 
same and they do not differ. ... ...." 

27. On a reading of the above evidence of P.Ws.2 and 5, it is seen that they have filed 

third party affidavits in the O.P. in Exs.P-30 and P-38 respectively. P.W.2 is the grand-son of the 

attesting witness to the Will, namely T.S.Ramadoss and P.W.2 has identified the signature of 

T.S.Ramadoss in Ex.P-1 Will. P.W.5 is the son of another attesting witness to the Will, namely 

Dr.R.Paul Doraiswamy and P.W.5 has identified the signature of Dr.R.Paud Doraiswamy in 

Ex.P-1 Will. In order to prove the signature of the attesting witness--T.S.Ramadoss, P.W.2 has 

produced the donation receipt, which is marked as Ex.P-31, in which, the signature of the said 

T.S.Ramadoss if found. Similarly, P.W.5 also produced the cumulative record issued to him by 

Don Bosco Matriculation School, Chennai, which is marked as Ex.P-37, in which P.W.5's father, 

i.e. Dr.R.Paul Doraiswamy has signed in the column intended for parents signature. Thus, it is 

clear that the signatures of both the attesting witness in the above said respective documents, are 

the same as found in Ex.P-1 Will. Therefore, the signatures of both the attesting witness to the 

Will, have been proved by P.W.2 and P.W.5 respectively. It is admitted that both the attesting 

witness to the Will, are not alive at the time of examination of witness in the T.O.S. Even though 

the Will was registered by the Sub-Registrar, on a reading of the Will, it is clear that the Sub-

Registrar has gone to the private residence of the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan at Door No.471, 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


70 

Poonamallee High Road, Madras-10 and in his presence, the Will was executed and it was later 

on registered as Document No.39 of 1970 in the Sub-Registrar's Office on 16.07.1970 before the 

Sub-Registrar, Purasawalkam, who has also signed therein. Therefore, Ex.P-1 Will is proved by 

the plaintiff by adducing oral and documentary evidence regarding the execution of the Will and 

the signatures of the attesting witness therein, even though the attesting witness are not alive. 

28. Even though the Will was executed in 1970, it was produced in the Court in the O.P. 

proceedings only in 2008, i.e. more than 30 years after the execution of the Will and even though 

P.Ws.2 and 5 were cross-examined on the side of the defendants, they have not denied that the 

signatures of the attesting to the Will, are not that of the respective attesting witness. 

29. The main allegation raised by the defendants in their written statement is that the Will 

was executed by the testator upon undue influence. It is admitted case of both sides that 

S.V.Ramakrishnan, at the time of execution of the Will, was aged about 50 years and the main 

beneficiary mentioned in the Will is Renuka Devi, who is the plaintiff herein and at that time, she 

has not completed the age of 18 years. Therefore, it is clear that there cannot be any undue 

influence by the beneficiary against S.V.Ramakrishnan to get the Will executed in her favour. 

Therefore, the argument of the learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants that the 

Will is obtained by undue influence, cannot be accepted. 

30. Further, there is a specific clause in the Will regarding exclusion of the defendants, 

namely Lalitha and Matha Prasad. Moreover, the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan has executed the 

Will out of free consent and in a sound and disposing state of mind, without any influence of any 

party. In the above circumstances, it has to be held that Ex.P-1 Will executed by 

S.V.Ramakrishnan is proved in accordance with law before this Court. 

31. From the specific averments made in Ex.P-1 Will, it is seen that there is description of 

any property. In the Will, it is specifically stated that, "It will not be possible now to detail the 

properties, immovable, movable, cash, etc., that I may die possessed of. Hence I do not propose 

to detail them." It is further stated in the Will as follows: 

All the properties, immoveable, cash in Bank, Securities, moveables, 
such as furniture, paintings, shares, etc., I hereby bequeath as follows:-

http://www.judis.nic.in 


71 

All the properties on the date of my death shall be taken over by the 
Official Trustee, or such officer or person appointed by Court, and he shall deal 
with them as follows:-
(a) The Official Trustee shall pay Rs.200/-a month to Srimathi Saroja 
who is living with me as my wife. 
(b) The Official Trustee shall pay for the education and maintenance of 
my children through Saroja, i.e. Vijaya, Rama Prasad and Renuka Devi. 
(c) The properties shall be held by the Official Trustee till my youngest 
daughter Renuka completes the age of 18. Then a sum of Rupees one Lakh or 
property worth a Lakh of rupees shall be given to Vijaya and Rama Prasad. The 
remainder shall be handed over to Renuka Devi. Renuka Devi shall pay Rs.200/-
per month to her mother, Saroja, for her maintenance. The properties handed 
over to Renuka Devi shall be enjoyed by her for life and shall be inherited 
absolutely by her children. 
In case any of my above children leave the Hindu fold or marry a non-
Hindu, they will not be entitled to the Legacy conferred by me. On such 
disqualification, the Legacy will be taken equally by my other children through 
Saroja. ..... ..." 

32. Hence, as per the above recitals in Ex.P-1 Will, it is clear that it does not contain any 

list of properties--movables, immovables, cash, etc., and the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan has 

given certain conditions in the Will, as extracted above, regarding the devolving of the properties 

to the beneficiary/beneficiaries on the date of his death. It is seen that there are four suit 

properties in the T.O.S (as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along with O.P). Regarding 

item Nos.3 and 4 of the suit properties, which are mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along 

with O.P. (T.O.S), on verification of the records, i.e. the copy of the judgment, dated 10.11.1965 in 

C.S.No.43 of 1962, marked in Ex.P-72 = Ex.D-14, it is seen that item No.1 mentioned in suit 

schedule property in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is item No.4 as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed 

along with O.P (T.O.S) and item No.2 mentioned in the suit schedule in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is item 

No.3 as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along with O.P (T.O.S). It is admitted by both 

sides that at the time of execution of the Will, those items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (affidavit 

of assets filed along with O.P (T.O.S) ) are the respective suit schedule properties in C.S.No.43 of 

1962 and C.S.No.43 of 1962 was pending in the stage of appeal before the Supreme Court, as 

detailed in the earlier paragraphs of this judgment and the Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974 was 

disposed of by the Supreme Court on 17.04.1995. Ex.P-29 is the copy of the said judgment, dated 

17.04.1995 rendered by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974, whereas the Will is 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


72 

dated 15.07.1970 and in the meantime, the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan died on 31.12.1980. 

Therefore, upto the date of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974, 

both the plaintiff and the defendants have no right, title or interest over the suit properties in item 

Nos.3 and 4. Hence, it is clear that S.V.Ramakrishnan has not possessed of item Nos.3 and 4 of 

the suit properties in T.O.S (O.P) at the time of execution of the Will, which does not even contain 

any specific properties that he might have been possessed of at the time of his death. Therefore, 

this Court is of the considered view that items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (as mentioned in the 

affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P) are not covered under Ex.P-1 Will, since they are not 

specifically stated in the Will. 

33. On the side of the plaintiff, they have produced Ex.P-11 copy of the registered family 

settlement deed in Document No.1305 of 1970, dated 22.05.1969, entered into between the 

plaintiff's father and the second defendant. In the said Ex.P-11 family settlement deed, the 

deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan was shown as party of the first part and his son-Matha Prasad, who 

is the second defendant herein, was shown as party of the second part. In the said Ex.P-11 family 

settlement deed, it is stated as follows: 

"... .... the parties herein being members of an ancient and respectable 
family have with a view to avoid wasteful litigation and for the sake of peace and 
preservation of the honour and dignity of the family have after prolonged 
discussions agreed to settle their differences as evidenced by this family 
Arrangement and agreement Now by this deed witnesseth (1) the party of the 
second part shall hereafter possess and enjoy the the properties set out in the 
schedule here to as full owner thereof and shall take the same absolutely with all 
powers of alienation such as sale gift mortgage will or otherwise in full quit and 
final settlement of all his claims. (2) The party of the first part releases and 
relinquishes all his rights title and interest in the properties mentioned in schedule 
hereunder. The party of the second part shall seize the properties mentioned in 
the schedule hereunder and shall possess and enjoy the same absolutely and the 
party of the first part shall not in any way interfere in respect of the properties 
mentioned in the schedule hereunder. (3) The party of the second part shall also 
be entitled to withdraw a sum of Rs.45,000/-only from and out of the additional 
compensation now awarded in A.S.No.428 of 1963 high court, Madras. He shall 
not be entitled to any further sum or to costs of the appeal. (4) The party of the 
second part shall have no manner of right title interest or claim to the properties or 
offices following from the estate of S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar and now held by 
the party of the first part or any property immoveable moveable compensation 
costs cash amounts in Court Deposit etc or to any office held now by the party of 
the first part or that he may get as a result of the litigation now pending except the 
properties that are mentioned in the schedule hereunder and the sum of 
Rs.45,000/-mentioned in clause 3 supra the party of the second part hereby 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


73 

releases and relinquishes all right title benefit or claim that he may have to all 
other properties inmoveable and moveable now held by the party of the first part 
and to all the properties offices rights title benefits claims compensations costs 
amounts in Court deposit etc. that the party of first part may get himself and or out 
of the benefits following from the estate of S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar and or as a 
result of the litigations now pending the party of second party also hereby releases 
and relinquishes in favour of the party of first part all the properties benefit cost 
etc. that may be got in litigations now pending in which the party of the second 
part is a party. The party of the second part shall not also be a heir to the estate of 
the party of the first part. .... ..." 

34. Further, on a perusal of the schedule mentioned properties in Ex.P-11 family 

settlement deed, it is seen that item Nos.1 and 2 of the suit properties herein (i.e. affidavit of 

assets in O.P.No.367 of 2008 / T.O.S.No.2 of 2009) are not stated as properties in the said family 

settlement deed as belonging to Late S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar. Further, after the said family 

settlement deed, the second defendant herein, namely S.V.Matha Prasad has filed a suit in 

C.S.No.99 of 1971 against the father of the plaintiff and the defendants herein, namely 

S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and the plaint copy in C.S.No.99 of 1971 is marked as Ex.P-12. The 

said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 was filed for declaration that the plaintiff therein (S.V.Matha 

Prasad) is entitled to one half in the joint family properties of Late Sri.S.V.Ramaswami Mudaliar, 

described in the schedules therein and also for other reliefs. In the said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971, 

the defendant therein, namely S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar has filed written statement, the copy of 

which is marked as Ex.P-13. In the said written statement, S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar has stated 

in paragraph 21 that, "The plaintiff cannot maintain this action unless and until settlement deed 

executed by him is set aside. The present suit is therefore not maintainable." Subsequently, the 

said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 was dismissed as not pressed being settled out of Court, on 

30.10.1972, which is marked as Ex.P-14. 

35. Therefore, from the above documents, it is clear that the second defendant herein has 

released and relinquished his rights as per Ex.P-11 family settlement deed and hence, he has no 

right or claim over the properties even allotted to S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar, who was the father 

of the plaintiff and the defendants herein. Thus, the argument of the learned Senior Counsels 

appearing for the defendants that items 1 and 2 of the suit properties in T.O.S. are joint family 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


74 

properties and the parties are entitled for partition of the same, and that the testator 

S.V.Ramakrishnan cannot bequeath the properties by way of the Will executed by him, is not 

sustainable. As already stated, Ex.P-11 family settlement deed was executed between the father-

S.V.Ramakrishnan and son-Matha Prasad (second defendant herein) and subsequently, the 

second defendant-S.V.Matha Prasad filed C.S.No.99 of 1971, which was dismissed as not 

pressed being settled out of Court, which is evident from Ex.P-14 judgment copy in C.S.No.99 of 

1971, dated 30.10.1972. In view of all these facts, the argument of the learned Senior Counsels 

appearing for the defendants that the item Nos.1 and 2 of the suit properties in T.O.S. were in the 

hands of the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan and they cannot be treated as his separate properties 

and they are joint family properties and that the defendants have every right and share in the 

properties and they cannot be bequeathed by the testator, is not acceptable. 

36. After the death of the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan on 31.12.1980, Mrs.Saroja and 

others, including the plaintiff and the defendants herein, executed the following sale deeds (Exs.P-

15 to P-18) and the relevant portion of the recitals therein are extracted hereunder : 

(i) Sale deed, dated 01.07.1983 in favour of M/s.Kumaran I lam --copy of which is 
marked as Ex.P-15:-

37. On a reading of the above said four sale deeds in Exs.P-15 to P-18, more particularly, 

Ex.P-15 sale deed, dated 01.07.1983, it is clear that S.V.Ramakrishnan's wife, namely Saroja and 

her children, including the plaintiff and the defendants herein, have jointly executed the sale deed 

in favour of the respective parties. It is also stated in the said sale deed that the first vendor 

therein (Saroja) is the second wife of the testator in this T.O.S., namely late S.V.Ramakrishnan, 

who died on 31.12.1980, leaving behind him the vendors 1 to 7 (Saroja, Vijaya, Rama Prasad, 

Renuka Devi (plaintiff), Dhanurmathi, Lalitha (first defendant) and Matha Prasad (second 

defendant) ) as specified in the said sale deed as legal heirs/children of late S.V.Ramakrishnan 

and it is specifically stated that the first vendor-Saroja is the second wife of the said 

S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and the second to fourth vendors are children of the said 

S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar through the first vendor-Saroja. It is also further clear from the said 

sale deed that late S.V.Ramakrishna executed the Will, dated 15.07.1970, nominating the above 

said first to fifth vendors as his legatees and it is specifically stated therein that the Will is yet to be 

probated. It is also stated in the said sale deed that the terms of the agreement of sale executed 

by late S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar, dated 30.07.1980, were confirmed in writing by a Rectification 

Deed as specified therein. It is further stated in the said sale deed that the Sixth vendor (Lalitha) 

and the seventh vendor (Matha Prasad) are also the children of late S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar 

through his first wife--Rajalakshmi, who died in March 1952 and claimed that they are legal 

representatives of late S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar. Hence, it is clear that there is a mention of the 

Will, dated 15.07.1970 in the said sale deed and the names of the defendants 1 and 2 herein 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


79 

have been specified in those sale deeds as co-executants of the relevant documents. 

38. It is further to be noted that M/s.Lakshmi Builders, represented by its partner, filed a 

Civil Suit before this Court in C.S.No.469 of 1981, against Saroja and her children and another, 

including the plaintiff and the defendants 1 and 2 herein, for specific performance and the copy of 

the plaint in the said C.S.No.469 of 1981 is marked as Ex.P-25 and the copies of the orders, 

dated 17.03.1982 and 12.02.1997 passed in the said C.S.No.469 of 1981 are marked as Exs.P-

26 and 27, which are based on compromise between the parties and settled out of Court. Hence, 

it is clear that after the death of the testator S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar, M/s.Lakshmi Builders 

filed the said suit against the heirs of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and subsequently, 

the said suit was disposed of based on the compromise between the parties and settled out of 

Court, which is evident from the above said orders passed in the said suit in C.S.No.469 of 1981, 

which is marked as Exs.P-26 and P-27. 

39. It is further seen that the first defendant herein filed a Civil Suit before this Court 

seeking permission to sue as an indigent person, declaration, permanent injuctions, directions 

etc., against the plaintiff herein and the second defendant herein and others, and the copy of the 

plaint in the said Civil Suit is marked as Ex.P-45. It is also seen that the present defendants filed 

a suit in O.S.No.6784 of 1996 before the City Civil Court, Madras, against Rama Prasad, Saroja, 

Vijaya and Renuka Devi (plaintiff herein) for declaration that the plaintiffs therein (defendants 

herein) are the legal heirs of late S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and as such, they have all legal 

rights over all the properties left by the said S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and also for consequential 

injunction restraining the defendants therein (plaintiff herein and others) from in any manner 

interfering with any of the properties left by the said S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and the copy of 

the plaint in that suit in O.S.No.6784 of 1996 is marked as Ex.P-46 and the clean copy of the 

plaint fled in O.S.No.6784 of 1996 is marked as Ex.P-53. The copy of the written statement filed 

by the defendants 1 and 2 therein, namely Ram Prasad and Saroja in O.S.No.6784 of 1996 is 

marked as Ex.P-47. Subsequently, by order dated 01.08.2007 (Ex.P-48), the plaint in said suit in 

O.S.No.6784 of 1996 was returned for being presented before a proper forum, as that Court had 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


80 

no pecuniary jurisdiction to try the suit. Therefore, it is clear that after the death of the testator 

S.V.Ramakrishnan, both the defendants herein have filed the said suit in O.S.No.6784 of 1996, 

which was returned for presentation before proper forum. But, there is no evidence placed on 

record before this Court to show that the said plaint in O.S.No.6784 of 1996 was subsequently re-

presented before proper Court. 

40. As already observed in the earlier paragraphs, the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and 

the second defendant-S.V.Mathaprasad earlier filed a suit in C.S.No.43 of 1962 before this Court 

against Buhari and another, for re-conveyance of the properties mentioned therein, for directions, 

etc., the copy of the plaint in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-71 = Ex.D-13; the said suit in 

C.S.No.43 of 1962 was decreed by this Court and the copy of the decree, dated 10.11.1965 

passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-72 = Ex.D-14. As against the said decree, dated 

10.11.1965 passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962, the appeals in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 were 

preferred, which were disposed of by the Division Bench of this Court on 10.05.1972, against 

which, Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974 was preferred before the Supreme Court. Though the said suit 

in C.S.No.43 of 1962 was initially decreed by the learned single Judge of this Court, the same was 

disposed of the Division Bench of this Court in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966, but subsequently, the 

Supreme Court in the said Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974, by judgment dated 17.04.1995, set aside 

the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court and restored the judgment of the learned single 

Judge of this Court in the said Civil Suit No.43 of 1962. The judgment dated 17.04.1995 passed 

by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974 is marked as Ex.P-28, with amended cause 

title therein, which is marked as Ex.P-29. In this regard, it is worthwhile to extract the prayer and 

decree, dated 10.11.1965 passed by the learned single Judge of this Court in the said Civil Suit 

No.43 of 1962, in which the second defendant herein was the co-plaintiff: 

Prayer in C.S.No.43 of 1962: 

"Suit praying for Judgment and Decree: 

(i) directing the defendants or the first defendant with the concurrence of 
the second defendant to re-convey the properties described in Schedule 'A' 
hereunder to the plaintiffs or to the first plaintiff receiving the sum of Rs.1,15,500/-
and on such terms as to this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper; 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


81 

(ii) directing the defendants to deliver possession of the 'A' Schedule 
properties to the plaintiffs on such re-conveyance; 
(iii) directing the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the income from the said 
properties as and from the date of the plaint; 
(iv) directing the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the costs of the suit; 
(v) and pass such further or other orders as may be just and proper in the 
circumstances of the case." 

Decree, dated 10.11.1965 in C.S.No.43 of 1962: 

It is declared, ordered and decreed as follows: 

(1) That plaintiff herein is entitled to specific performance of the 
agreement dated 24.03.1959 entered into with the plaintiff by defendants herein, 
to re-convey the properties set out in the Schedule hereunder; 
(2) That the defendants herein do (a) execute a proper re-conveyance of 
the properties more particularly described in the Schedule hereunder, in favour of 
the plaintiff herein according to the agreement aforesaid dated 24.03.1959 and 
(b) deliver possession to the said plaintiff herein, the said properties as set out in 
the said Schedule hereunder, immediately after such re-conveyance; 
(3) that the income in respect of the aforesaid properties from 23.03.1962 
(the date of the plaint) till date of delivery of possession and the same shall be 
ascertained in due course; 
(4) that the defendants herein, shall be entitled to withdraw the sum of 
Rs.1,15,500/-(Rupees one lakh fifteen thousand and five hundred only) now in 
Court deposit, after they execute the sale deed as directed in Clause (2) supra; 
(5) That the defendants, do also pay to the plaintiffs herein the costs of 
the suit when taxed and noted in the margin hereof, and 
(6) That the defendants do bear their own costs in this suit. " 

41. Subsequent to the above said judgment of the Supreme Court in the said Civil Appeal, 

by which the above extracted judgment/decree of the learned single Judge of this Court in 

C.S.No.43 of 1962 was restored, E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 was preferred by 

S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar (since deceased) and S.V.Matha Prasad, the second defendant 

herein, and the order dated 07.07.2000 passed in the said E.P. is marked as Ex.D-6 and in the 

said E.P., various applications were filed and disposed of by this Court. 

42. Therefore, as per the above judgment of the Supreme Court in the said Civil Appeal, 

by which, the said judgment of the learned single Judge of this Court was restored, the present 

second defendant-S.V.Matha Prasad is a joint decree-holder for items 3 and 4 of the suit 

properties (affidavit of assets in O.P.) in this T.O.S., which are the very same suit properties in the 

said suit in C.S.No.43 of 1962, which is not disputed by either side and ultimately, the decree 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


82 

dated 10.11.1965 passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is being enforced against the defendants therein 

in C.S.No.43 of 1962. It has been already held by this Court that items 3 and 4 in the present suit 

properties in the T.O.S. (as specified in the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P), are not the 

properties possessed of by late S.V.Ramakrishna as on the date of his death, and hence, as far 

as the remaining suit properties in items 1 and 2 in the T.O.S. (as specified in the affidavit of 

assets filed along with the O.P), the legal heirs of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, including the 

plaintiff herein and the defendants herein, are entitled to their respective shares and get the 

benefits therein out of the same. 

43. In this case, admittedly S.V.Saroja had been living as the second wife of the 

deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, the testator. Even the deceased-testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan has 

specifically mentioned in his Will Ex.P-1 that they were living as husband and wife, even though 

there was no marriage between them and there is no specific mention in Ex.P-1 Will that she is 

the second wife. Further, even though in the sale deeds in Exs.P-15 to P-18, there is a mention 

that she is the second wife of late S.V.Ramakrishnan and since it is also stated in one of those 

sale deeds that the Will is yet to be probated (i.e. the prayer in the O.P. (T.O.S) is for grant of 

Letters of Administration in respect of the Will), the other disputes between the parties regarding 

title, relevant status of the parties, etc., cannot be gone into and decided by this Court in this 

T.O.S. 

44. In view of the above discussion and observations made, this Court is of the 

considered view that items 1 and 2 of the suit properties in the T.O.S (as mentioned in the 

affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P) are separate properties of the deceased 

S.V.Ramakrishnan and he had every right to execute Ex.P-1 Will. As far as items 3 and 4 of the 

suit properties in the T.O.S (as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P), which 

are the subject matter of suit in C.S.No.43 of 1962 and which were not in possession of the 

deceased-testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan at the time of his death, as specified in Ex.P-1 Will by him, 

those items 3 and 4 are not covered under Ex.P-1 Will. Therefore, as far as items 3 and 4 of the 

suit properties herein, the same have to be dealt with as if the testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan died 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


83 

intestate. 

45. The testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan himself admitted in the Will that Vijaya alias Vijaya 

Lakshmi, Ramprasad and Renuka Devi are his children, and on the side of the plaintiff, their 

respective Birth Certificates have been marked as Exs.P-7 to P-9 and the consent affidavits of 

S.V.R.Saroja (wife of S.V.Ramakrishnan), Vijaya Lakshmi alias Vijaya and S.V.R.Ramprasad, for 

grant of Letters of Administration in favour of the plaintiff, have also been marked as Exs.P-2 to P-

4. Though Dhanurmathi is shown as one of the daughters of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan in 

the affidavit filed in support of the O.P (T.O.S) and her Birth Certificate has also been marked as 

Ex.P-10 in this T.O.S. and that she has also filed her consent affidavit for grant of Letters of 

Administration in favour of the plaintiff, which has been marked as Ex.P-5, there is no mention 

about her in Ex.P-1 Will. 

46. All the above facts clearly show that the plaintiff-Renuka Devi has filed the 

O.P.(T.O.S) for grant of Letters of Administration in her favour based on Ex.P-1 Will executed by 

the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and that, her mother S.V.R.Saroja, her sister Vijaya Lakshmi 

alias Vijaya, her brother S.V.R.Ramprasad and her another sister Dhanurmathi have filed their 

respective consent affidavits for grant of Letters of Administration in favour of the plaintiff, which 

are marked as Exs.P-2 to P-5. As per the Will executed by the testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan, the 

properties handed over to the plaintiff, shall be enjoyed by her for life and they shall be inherited 

absolutely by her children. It is also seen that the children of the plaintiff-Renuka Devi, namely 

N.Dheeraj Kumar and N.Divya Deepa, have also filed consent affidavits for grant of Letters of 

Administration in favour of the plaintiff, which are marked as Exs.P-34 and P-35 respectively. The 

Birth Certificates of the said N.Dheeraj Kumar and N.Divya Deepa have also been marked as 

Exs.P-33 and P-36. Thus, it is clear that except the defendants herein, all the other legal heirs of 

the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, including the children of the plaintiff, have given their respective 

consent affidavits for grant of Letters of Administration in favour of the plaintiff herein. Moreover, 

there are also third party affidavits of P.Ws.2 and 5, who are the grand-son of the attesting 

witness No.1 (T.S.Ramadoss) to the Will and son of the attesting witness No.2 (Dr.R.Paul 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


84 

Doraiswamy), which are marked as Exs.P-30 and P-38 and P.Ws.2 and 5 have confirmed the 

signatures of those attesting witness. 

47. From all the above facts and circumstances of the case, it has to be concluded that 

the plaintiff has proved the Will in accordance with law and she is entitled for grant of Letters of 

Administration in her favour only in respect of items 1 and 2 of the suit properties (i.e. items 1 and 

2 of the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P) and she is not entitled for grant of Letters of 

Administration insofar as items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (i.e. items 3 and 4 of the affidavit of 

assets filed along with O.P). Accordingly, the application filed by the second defendant in 

A.No.4458 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, filed for rejecting the plaint in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 with 

regard to items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along 

with O.P) is allowed and consequently, T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 has to be decreed only to the extent 

indicate above. 

48. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants contended that as far as the 

delay in filing the O.P (T.O.S) by the plaintiff for grant of Letters of Administration in her favour, is 

concerned, it is seen that Ex.P-1 Will was executed by the testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan on 

15.07.1970, which was registered on 16.07.1970 and the testator died on 31.12.1980. It is to be 

noted that the Original Petition in O.P.No.367 of 2008, which was subsequently converted as 

T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, was filed on 18.12.2006 and it was subsequently re-presented on various 

dates. Thus, the O.P. for grant of Letters of Administration is filed by the plaintiff in 2006, i.e. after 

26 years from the date of the death of the testator, which was in 1980. Hence, according to the 

learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants, the delay of 26 years has not been 

explained by the plaintiff. They also contended that the plaintiff had also knowledge about the Will 

even during the pendency of the earlier suit proceedings between the parties and also from the 

relevant documents like sale deeds, etc. Hence, they prayed that the T.O.S. may be dismissed as 

time barred as per Article 137 of the Limitation Act, and hence, they requested for framing 

additional issue on the question of limitation and to decide the same as a preliminary issue, by 

allowing the application in A.No.4533 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, filed by the second 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


85 

defendant during the pendency of this T.O.S. 

49. With regard to the above contention of delay, learned counsel appearing for the 

plaintiff, in reply submitted that since the filing of the O.P. for grant of Letters of Administration is 

only regarding the cause of action, which subsists as of today and though the defendants also 

raised the aspect of limitation in their written statements by stating that the plaintiff has not taken 

steps all these years, Article 137 of the Limitation Act will not apply to the facts of the present 

case. He also contended that since there is no specific period of limitation fixed in the Limitation 

Act, more particularly for filing of O.P. for grant of probate or Letters of Administration, or in any 

law for the time being in force, for filing of the O.P. for grant of probate or Letters of 

Administration, the T.O.S. may not be dismissed as time barred. 

50. In this regard, it is worthwhile to quote Article 137 of the Limitation Act, which reads as 

follows: 

Third Division--Applications 

Part-2--Other Applications

51. Though the learned counsel appearing on both sides relied on various decisions as 

extracted in the earlier part of this judgment, including the point of limitation, learned counsel 

appearing for the plaintiff brought to the notice of this Court, a latest judgment rendered by the 

First Bench of this Court, dated 07.01.2016 in O.S.A.Nos.10 and 72 of 2013, in which the First 

Bench of this Court dealt with various decisions of this Court as well as the Supreme Court on the 

aspect of limitation and paragraph 49 of the said judgment of the First Bench reads as follows: 

"49. In the light of the ratio laid down in the above decisions, it cannot be 
stated that Letters Patent and Rules made thereunder by the High Court for 
regulating the procedure on the Original Side, are subordinate legislation and, 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


86 

therefore, only Limitation Act which is a superior legislation will prevail. On a 
conspectus of the above legal scenario, we conclude that the probate Court has 
been conferred with exclusive jurisdiction and particularly, the conspicuous 
absence of any period of limitation in applying for issuance of probate/Letters of 
Administration makes it clear that the law of limitation will not apply to Sections 
232 and 278 of the Indian Succession Act in respect of proceedings initiated 
before this Court as per the Original Side Rules. In such view of the matter, the 
finding of the learned single Judge holding that Article 137 of the Limitation Act is 
not applicable to the probate proceedings and dismissal of the Original 
Applications, in our considered opinion, require no interference." 

52. In the above case before the First Bench, the O.P. proceedings for grant of Letters of 

Administration was filed under Sections 232 and 278 of the Indian Succession Act and therein, 

there was an objection by the other side that the O.P. proceedings are time barred under Article 

137 of the Limitation Act and on that ground, it was contended that the T.O.S. therein may be 

dismissed. In the case on hand, learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants contended 

that Article 137 of the Limitation Act will apply to the present O.P. filed for grant of Letters of 

Administration and it equally applies even to the cases filed under the relevant Act(s) in Civil 

Courts, and presently, this T.O.S. being tried as a civil suit (i.e. T.O.S.No.2 of 2009), the 

O.P.(T.O.S) filed under the provisions of the Indian Succession Act, may be rejected as time 

barred, by allowing A.No.4533 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 filed by the second defendant for 

framing additional issue on the question of limitation and to decide the said issue as a preliminary 

issue. The above said judgment of the First Bench of this Court is squarely applicable to the facts 

of the present case and is an answer to the above arguments of the learned Senior Counsels 

appearing for the defendants on the point of limitation alleged as per Article 137 of the Limitation 

Act, which is not applicable to probate/Letters of Administration proceedings filed under the 

provisions of the Indian Succession Act. Therefore, the contention of the learned Senior Counsels 

appearing for the defendants that since the Letters of Administration proceedings in this case, had 

not been filed within three years from the date of knowledge of the Will, the same is time barred 

under Article 137 of the Limitation Act, is not sustainable. Hence, for the above stated reasons, 

the said application in A.No.4533 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, is liable to be dismissed and 

accordingly, the same is dismissed. 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


87 

53. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the defendants further contended that the 

plaintiff has totally under-valued the properties and the properties worth more than the Court fee 

paid by the plaintiff in a sum of Rs.2,79,93,000/-, which is not proper as per the market value of 

the properties and that the total market value of the properties mentioned in the suit schedule 

would be Rs.34,85,27,994/-crores, at an increase of 30% in 2008 and therefore, they prayed for 

allowing A.No.4456 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 filed by the second defendant for directing the 

plaintiff to pay proper Court fees according to the market value of the suit properties, which is 

Rs.34,85,27,994/-crores and make up the deficit of the Court fees. 

54. In this case, though on the side of the defendants, such a plea of payment of improper 

Court fees by the plaintiff, had been raised, the defendants have not raised such a plea in the 

written statements filed by them or not adduced evidence or proved the real market value of the 

suit properties. Except the contention raised on behalf of the defendants, there is no other 

material to hold that the properties are under-valued as alleged on behalf of the defendants. Since 

the defendants have failed to prove the appropriate market value of the properties on the date of 

filing of the O.P. (T.O.S), this Court comes to the conclusion that the valuation made by the 

plaintiff in the O.P./T.O.S. is proper and the above contention raised on behalf of the defendants, 

has to be rejected. Accordingly, A.No.4456 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 filed by the second 

defendant for directing the plaintiff to pay proper Court fees according to the market value of the 

suit properties, is dismissed. 

55. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants lastly contended that the 

plaintiff brought on record an agreement of assignment, and in her cross-examination and in the 

said agreement of assignment, she has admitted that the properties are covered by the 

assignment agreement with regard to items 3 and 4 of the suit properties. In the present suit, it is 

already held by this Court in the earlier paragraphs that as far as items 3 and 4 (items 3 and 4 in 

the affidavit of assets filed along with O.P), it has to be treated as if the testator-

S.V.Ramakrishnan died intestate. Hence, the plaintiff is not the legatee. Therefore, the contention 

of the learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants that the recitals in the agreement of 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


88 

assignment tantamounts to a waiver of her rights, if any under the Will, though there are none, 

need not be gone into by this Court, as this Court already held in the earlier paragraphs in this 

T.O.S. that she is not entitled for grant of Letters of Administration with regard to the said items 3 

and 4 of the suit properties. Though it is also contended on the side of the defendants that as 

regards items 3 and 4 of the suit properties, the question as to whether the plaintiff is entitled for 

grant of Letters of Administration or not, will have to be decided only in the suit, after analysing the 

oral and documentary evidence adduced by both sides and in view of the above discussion made 

even in the T.O.S., there is no necessary for rendering a separate finding on the above point in 

A.No.4457 of 2014 and the findings rendered above in the T.O.S. themselves are sufficient. 

Accordingly, A.No.4457 of 2014 is closed. 

56. For all the reasons stated above and on a perusal of the oral and documentary 

evidence available on record and also on a perusal of the decisions extracted in the earlier 

paragraphs, which are relied on by both sides, this Court is of the considered view that Ex.P-1 

Will, dated 15.07.1970 propounded to be the last Will of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, is 

genuine and legally valid only with regard to items 1 and 2 of the suit properties (as mentioned in 

the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P). Issue No.(i) is answered accordingly. 

57. As the Will had been proved by the plaintiff in accordance with law, it has to be held 

that the Will was not obtained by fraud, coercion and exerting undue influence as pleaded by the 

defendants. Issue No.(ii) is answered accordingly. 

58. In view of the above answers to Issue Nos.(i) and (ii), the plaintiff is entitled for grant 

of Letters of Administration as prayed for, only in respect of items 1 and 2 of the suit properties 

(as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P) and she is not entitled for grant of 

Letters of Administration with regard to items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (as mentioned in the 

affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P). Issue Nos.(iii) and (iv) are answered accordingly. 

59. For the foregoing reasons and the findings rendered above: 

(i) T.O.S. is decreed as prayed for only in respect of items 1 and 2 of the suit properties 

(as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P) and the plaintiff is directed to 

http://www.judis.nic.in 


89 

execute a personal bond for a sum of Rs.25,000/-to the satisfaction of the AR(OS-II), High 

Court, Madras. 

(ii) T.O.S. is dismissed with regard to items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (as mentioned in 

the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P). 

(iii) For the reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, A.No.4456 of 

2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is dismissed, A.No.4457 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is closed, 

A.No.4458 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is allowed and A.No.4533 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 

2009 is dismissed. 

(iv) No costs.
