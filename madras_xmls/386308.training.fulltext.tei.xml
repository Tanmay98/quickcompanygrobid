 THE HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE G.CHOCKALINGAM<lb/>
		</p><p>
 JUDGMENT<lb/>
 T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is numbered on conversion of O.P.No.367 of 2008, praying that<lb/>
 Letters of Administration with a Will annexed, may be granted to the plaintiff as the daughter and<lb/>
 one of the legatees under the Will of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, having effect limited to the<lb/>
 State of Tamil Nadu.<lb/>
</p>

<p>2. The case of the plaintiff is as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>(a) The father of the plaintiff is late Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan and he died on 31.12.1980 at<lb/>
 &quot;Ramamandiram&quot; No.868, Poonamallee High Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-600 010, where he was<lb/>
 then ordinarily residing within the State of Tamil Nadu. He executed the last Will and Testament<lb/>
 on 15.07.1970 in the city of Madras, in the presence of two witnesses who signed and attested the<lb/>
 Will. The Will is registered as Document No.39 of 1970 in the office of the Sub-Registrar,<lb/>
 Purasawalkam, Chennai. Both the attesting witnesses, namely Mr.T.S.Ramadoss and Dr.R.Paul<lb/>
 Doraiswamy, are not alive as on date. Hence, third party affidavit has been filed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(b) The properties under the Will have been bequeathed to the plaintiff to be enjoyed for<lb/>
 her lifetime and thereafter, to be inherited absolutely by her children. The plaintiff has one<lb/>
 daughter and one son, viz., N.Divya and N.Dheeraj Kumar and they have given consent in favour<lb/>
 of the plaintiff. The plaintiff continues to be a Hindu and her husband Mr.N.Niranjan Kumar is also<lb/>
 a Hindu. The deceased S.V.Ramakrishan, the testator, has given certain directions for payment<lb/>
 of maintenance to his wife Smt.S.V.R.Sarjoa, the plaintiff&apos;s mother.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(c) Though the Will provides for vesting of properties with the Official Trustee or such<lb/>
 Officer or person appointed by this Court, such vesting was restricted only till the plaintiff<lb/>
 completes the age of 18 years and the plaintiff has completed the age of 18 years on 22.06.1979<lb/>
 and hence, the provision for the Official Trustee to take over the properties as on date, does not<lb/>
 have any force.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(d) By the said Will, the deceased did not appoint any executor and hence, she has filed<lb/>
 the petition for grant of Letters of Administration with the Will annexed. The amount of immovable<lb/>
 assets which are likely to come in the hands of the plaintiff, does not exceed in the aggregate sum<lb/>
 of Rs.2,80,00,000/-and the net amount of assets after deducting all items which the plaintiff by<lb/>
 law allowed to deduct, is only of the value of Rs.2,79,93,000/-. All the other movable assets<lb/>
 mentioned in the Will had been disposed of by the testator himself during his lifetime.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(e) No application has been made to any District Court or delegate or to any other High<lb/>
 Court for the probate of the said Will of the deceased or Letters of Administration with or without<lb/>
 the Will annexed of his property and credit. The plaintiff undertakes to duly administer the property<lb/>
 and credits of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and in any way concerning his Will, by paying first<lb/>
 his debts and then the legacies therein bequeathed so far as the assets will extend and to make<lb/>
 full and true inventory thereof and exhibit the same in this Court within six months from the date of<lb/>
 grant of Letters of Administration with the Will annexed and also to render to this Court a true<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 account of the said property and credits within one year from the said date.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(f) Though the plaintiff was aware of the existence of the Will for all these years, she has<lb/>
 been advised to get the Letters of Administration only recently to safeguard her interest and that<lb/>
 of her children and also the wishes of her deceased father. Further, various litigations relating to<lb/>
 the estate also delayed her to file the petition. Though there is no time limit for filing petition for<lb/>
 Letters of Administration, she explains as stated above, since no laches could be attributed to her.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(g) The deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan has left the following persons as his legal heirs:<lb/>
</p>

<item>(i) Mrs.S.V.R.Saroja -Second wife,<lb/>
</item>

<item>(ii) Mrs.R.Vijayalakshmi @ R.Vijaya -daughter,<lb/>
</item>

<item>(iii) Mr.S.V.R.Ramprasad -son,<lb/>
</item>

<item>(iv) Mrs.N.Renuka Devi -daughter,<lb/>
</item>

<item>(v) Mrs.R.S.P.Dhanurmathi -daughter,<lb/>
</item>

<item>(vi) Mrs.E.Lalitha -daughter and<lb/>
 (vii) Mr.S.V.Mathaprasad @ Pancras Matha Prasad -son.<lb/>
</item>

<p>Mrs.E.Lalitha and Mr.S.V.Mathaprasad @ Pancras Matha Prasad are daughter and son<lb/>
 respectively, of the first wife S.V.Rajalakshmi, who pre-deceased the testator. The parents of the<lb/>
 deceased pre-deceased him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(h) The plaintiff has filed consent affidavits of Smt.S.V.R.Saroja, Mrs.R.Vijayalakshmi,<lb/>
 Mr.S.V.R.Ramprasad and Mrs.R.S.P.Dhanurmathi. The notice has to be issued only to<lb/>
 Mrs.E.Lalitha and Mr.S.V.Mathaprasad @ Pancras Matha Prasad. She prays that Letters of<lb/>
 Administration with the Will annexed may be granted to her as the daughter and one of the<lb/>
 legatees under the Will of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan having effect limited to the State of<lb/>
 Tamil Nadu.<lb/>
</p>

<p>3. The first defendant has filed written statement stating as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>(a) The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts and the same is liable to be<lb/>
 dismissed in-limine. The averment that the first respondent (S.V.R.Saroja) is the wife of late<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnam, is denied and the fact is that Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan was only married to<lb/>
 Smt.Rajalakshmi and the first and second defendants were born out of that wedlock. Smt.Saroja<lb/>
 was never married to late S.V.Ramakrishnan and she was wife of one Mr.A.Ramadoss and had a<lb/>
 child through that marriage. She, with malicious intent, schemed and enticed late<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan to develop illicit intimacy with her. This illicit relationship caused havoc in the<lb/>
 family and was the reason for the defendant&apos;s mother&apos;s mysterious death on 04.03.1952 and also<lb/>
 death of Smt.Vellamal, the adoptive mother of Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan. Mrs.Saroja was pestering<lb/>
 her father to marry her and she also harassed him through a criminal case in the year 1956 and<lb/>
 the defendant&apos;s father was forced to compromise with her. Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan was a dotting<lb/>
 father and he never conceded her demand to marry him. There had been no marriage between<lb/>
 Mrs.Saroja and Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(b) The first defendant had no knowledge of the information contained in paragraphs 3 to<lb/>
 5 of the affidavit filed in support of the petition. It is an admitted fact that the fifth respondent is the<lb/>
 only legitimate daughter and the sixth respondent is the only legitimate son of the deceased<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan. It is true that late Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan died on 31.12.1980 at<lb/>
 &quot;Ramamandiram&quot;, No.868, Poonamalle High Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-600 010. It is absolute false<lb/>
 that late S.V.Ramakrishnan executed a Will in the city of Madras on 15.07.1970. The first<lb/>
 defendant doubts the genuineness of the Will purported to be executed, attested and registered<lb/>
 on 15.07.1970. After driving out the defendants from the household, Mrs.Saroja had complete<lb/>
 control over late S.V.Ramakrishnan and the said Will had been obtained by coercion and undue<lb/>
 influence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(c) The first defendant&apos;s father wanted his property to devolve on his successors. The first<lb/>
 defendant&apos;s father was never married to Mrs.Saroja and her children are illegitimate. The Will<lb/>
 itself states that &quot;I am living with Srimathi Saroja, and we are living as husband and wife, even<lb/>
 though there has not been a marriage between us.&quot; Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan was physically not fit<lb/>
 and mentally not alert and he died after prolonged illness. The first defendant&apos;s father was very<lb/>
 well versed in Court procedures, but the reading of the purported Will shows that it has been<lb/>
 drafted by a layman. There has been a long gap of 10 years between execution of the Will and the<lb/>
 death of the testator. Mrs.Dhanurmathi was born during this period, so, if the Will has been<lb/>
 genuine, the testator would have definitely left a codicil for her benefit. The said Will does not<lb/>
 contain the last Will of the testator.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(d) The first defendant&apos;s late father Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan was residing at Nos.868 and<lb/>
 869, Poonamallee High Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-600 010 and the said property is spread over<lb/>
 sixty grounds and contained a huge building and the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4 executed<lb/>
 sale deeds in respect of the aforesaid property and appropriated the sale proceeds.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(e) The purported Will does not contain any detail of the properties. The deceased<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishan was not the absolute owner of the properties as listed out in the affidavit of<lb/>
 assets and the properties are not his self-earned properties. The properties are ancestral,<lb/>
 coparcenary and the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan took the properties as the adopted son of late<lb/>
 S.Ramaswamy Mudaliar, as per the directions of the Will, dated 10.09.1937, which had been<lb/>
 probated in O.P.No.7 of 1938 in this Court by the executrix Smt.Vellammal, who thereupon<lb/>
 registered a deed of adoption bearing Doc.No.125 of 1938 at the office of the District Registrar,<lb/>
 Chenai-600 001, confirming the said adoption.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(f) A mere reading of the purported Will shows that &apos;all the properties on the date of my<lb/>
 death shall be taken over by the Official Trustee or such officer or person appointed by Court&apos;.<lb/>
 The first respondent-Mrs.Saroja, the mother of the plaintiff, intentionally did not take steps to<lb/>
 inform the Court about the Will after the death of S.V.Ramakrishnan. There is no explanation in<lb/>
 this regard by the plaintiff. All these years, the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4 had been<lb/>
 claiming in the numerous Court cases that a Will, dated 15.07.1970 has been left by late<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan and they are going to probate it, but they never took any steps all these years.<lb/>
 They knew that purported Will does not contain last Will of the testator.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(g) There has been a long gap of 28 years since her father died and now the plaintiff has<lb/>
 come for Letters of Administration and the long delay in probating the Will has not been explained.<lb/>
 The plaintiff has not come before this Court with clean hands and it is for the sole purpose to<lb/>
 delay and deny the benefits to the real legal heirs of late S.V.Ramakrishnan.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(h) The defendant denies that respondents 1 to 4 and the plaintiff are the legal heirs of the<lb/>
 deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan. The defendants are the only legal heirs of the deceased. The<lb/>
 deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan was married to S.V.Rajalakshmi and out of wedlock, defendants<lb/>
 were born. The first respondent was only concubine of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan. She was<lb/>
 never married to him and respondents 2 to 4 and the plaintiff are illegitimate children.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(i) In the affidavit of assets -Annexure-A, I --movables had been given falsely. The<lb/>
 movables like cash, household goods, paintings, shares, gold and silver articles and share<lb/>
 certificates worth several lakhs, had been misappropriated and had not been properly accounted.<lb/>
 The plaintiff has deliberately suppressed the facts in the affidavit of assets filed by her. As per<lb/>
 Annexure-A, II, immovable properties, item No.1 is a family temple, item No.2 is family burial<lb/>
 ground and item Nos.3 and 4 are the ancestral coparcenary properties. Item Nos.3 and 4 were<lb/>
 subject matter of suit in C.S.No.43 of 1962 before this Court, where Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan and his<lb/>
 only son Mr.S.V.Mathaprasad, had been plaintiffs and the said suit was decreed in their favour<lb/>
 and the defendant filed appeal in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 and a Division Bench of this Court<lb/>
 allowed the appeals and set aside the decree of the trial Court. Mr.Ramakrishna Mudaliar<lb/>
 preferred S.L.P. to the Supreme Court. Leave was granted and the appeal was numbered as<lb/>
 C.A.No.224 of 1974, which was allowed by the Supreme Court on 17.04.1995, which upheld the<lb/>
 judgment of the trial Court. E.P.No.48 of 1997 in the said matter is pending before this Court.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(j) The plaintiff along with respondents 1 to 4, inter-meddled with the estate of late<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan and has dealt in excess with properties beyond the scope of the purported<lb/>
 Will. The plaintiff and others executed a sale deed in favour of D.K.Sekar, relating to the property<lb/>
 situated at No.30, Ormes Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-10, representing themselves to be the legal<lb/>
 heirs of late S.V.Ramakrishan, which ended in Court proceedings C.S.Nos.577 to 579 of 1995 by<lb/>
 judgment dated 22.01.2002, wherein it was declared that they cannot claim themselves as legal<lb/>
 heirs of late S.V.Ramakrishnan and as such, the sale was deemed null and void.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(k) The Will dated 15.07.1970 does not contain any of the properties listed out in the<lb/>
 affidavit of assets. Item Nos.1 and 2 of the properties are ancestral family properties, one being a<lb/>
 Ganesha Temple and the other, a family burial ground, which cannot be Willed away to the<lb/>
 plaintiff or respondents 1 to 4. Item Nos.3 and 4 are the subject matter of pending litigations to<lb/>
 which the plaintiff and respondents 1 to 4 have been agitating ever since 1999 and being unable<lb/>
 to prove their legitimacy, have now come forward after 28 years to probate the Will, knowing fully<lb/>
 well that the Will does not contain the said properties and only to deceive the Court. As regards<lb/>
 the properties contained in item Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of assets, during the pendency of the<lb/>
 appeal C.A.No.224 of 1974, the plaintiff and respondents 1 to 4 executed assignment deeds in<lb/>
 favour of M/s.Lalachand Megnraj and Chimandas Megnraj, relinquishing their rights to the said<lb/>
 properties stating that, &quot;Whereas S.V.Ramakrishnan Mudaliar having executed the Will and<lb/>
 testament dt. 15.07.1970 had died intestate in respect of the right to obtain re-conveyance of the<lb/>
 property forming the subject matter of C.A.No.224/74 pending on the file of the Supreme Court.&quot;<lb/>
 The acceptance of this statement by the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4 is confirmation that<lb/>
 the Will does not contain item Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of assets.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(l) The illegitimate children and their mother have been trying all these years to claim in<lb/>
 Court proceedings that they are the legal heirs and has suppressed the Will. But in several<lb/>
 judgments of this Court, it has been upheld that Mrs.Saroja is not legally wedded wife of<lb/>
 Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan and her children are illegitimate. The plaintiff, with the help of her brother,<lb/>
 the third respondent, had been misleading the Courts. The plaintiff has been approbating and<lb/>
 reprobating to suit her needs and the plaintiff, with the aid of the third respondent, has been<lb/>
 abusing the process of Court. The first defendant prays that the suit may be dismissed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>4. The second defendant has filed written statement stating as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>(a) The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts and the same is liable to be<lb/>
 dismissed in-limine. The second defendant denies the allegations contained in paragraphs 2 to 5<lb/>
 of the affidavit filed in support of the petition. It is admitted fact that the fifth and sixth respondents<lb/>
 are the legitimate daughter and legitimate son of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan. It is true that<lb/>
 Sri.S.V.Ramakrishnan died on 31.12.1980. It is true that Sri.S.V.Ramakrishnan executed a Will,<lb/>
 dated 15.07.1970.<lb/>
</p><p>
 (b) The deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan was not the absolute owner of the properties as<lb/>
 listed out in the affidavit of assets and the properties are not his self-earned properties. The<lb/>
 properties are ancestral coparcenary and the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan took the properties as<lb/>
 the adopted son of late S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar as per the directions of the Will, dated<lb/>
 10.09.1937, which had been probated in O.P.No.7 of 1938 in this Court by the executrix<lb/>
 Smt.Vellammal, his wife, who thereupon even registered a deed of adoption bearing Doc.No.125<lb/>
 of 1938, registered at the Office of the District Registrar, Chennai-600 001, confirming the said<lb/>
 adoption. The second defendant&apos;s late father, the said late S.V.Ramakrishnan was residing at<lb/>
 Nos.868 and 869, Poonamallee High Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-600 010, and the property as such<lb/>
 was spread over sixty grounds and contained a huge building and he was living there till his death<lb/>
 on 31.12.1980.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(c) The plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4 executed sale deeds in respect of the<lb/>
 aforesaid property bearing Door Nos.868 and 869, Poonamallee High Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-<lb/>
600 010 and appropriated the sale proceeds. The plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4 have also<lb/>
 appropriated all the movables, such as valuable gold, silver and precious stone jewelleries,<lb/>
 antiques consisting of rare paintings and costly furnitures, cash deposits in Banks and shares<lb/>
 worth several lakhs. The plaintiff deliberately suppressed the facts in the affidavit of assets filed by<lb/>
 her.<lb/></p>

 <p>
 (d) A mere reading of the Will shows that, &quot;all the properties on the date of my death shall<lb/>
 be taken over by the Official Trustee or such officer or person appointed by the Court.&quot; The first<lb/>
 respondent-Smt.Saroja, the mother of the plaintiff, intentionally did not take steps to inform the<lb/>
 Court about the Will on the death of S.V.Ramakrishnan and there seems to be no explanation in<lb/>
 this regard by the plaintiff. This only shows the mala-fide intentions of the first respondent and the<lb/>
 plaintiff.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(e) The household of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishan and his family consisting of his wife<lb/>
 late Smt.Rajalakshmi and his two children, Lalitha (respondent 5) and Matha Prasad (Respondent<lb/>
 6) and his adoptive mother Smt.Vellammal (late), was a peaceful and harmonious household, until<lb/>
 the advent of Saroja, the first respondent, the wife of Mr.A.Ramadoss, into the household.<lb/>
 Smt.Saroja, the first respondent, though married to A.Ramadoss and having a child of her own,<lb/>
 with malicious intent, entered the household of Ramakrishnan being envious of her sister&apos;s<lb/>
 lifestyle and the status that she enjoyed. She schemed and enticed Ramakrishnan to develop illicit<lb/>
 intimacy with her. The first respondent&apos;s behaviour with Ramakrishnan disrupted the peaceful<lb/>
 atmosphere of the family and was the cause of the death of the mother, Rajalakshmi, of<lb/>
 respondents 5 and 6 on 04.03.1952 and later that of their grandmother Vellammal in the same<lb/>
 year in July.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(f) The first respondent even succeeded in bringing about an estrangement between late<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan and his children, viz, the respondents 5 and 6 after the death of their mother<lb/>
 and the first respondent cunningly induced respondent 5--Lalitha to marry her maternal uncle<lb/>
 Mr.Ekambaram much to the displeasure of her father late S.V.Ramakrishnan and also succeeded<lb/>
 in estranging the feeling of the father and son--respondent 6 and his father late<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan. The first respondent thereafter induced and coerced S.V.Ramakrishnan to<lb/>
 execute the Will and it is with great aversion, he consented. The Will itself would bear witness to<lb/>
 the animosity that he bore towards the first respondent--Saroja in stating that, &quot;I am living with<lb/>
 Smt.Saroja and we are living as husband and wife even though there has not been a marriage<lb/>
 between us.&quot; This statement clearly shows that Saroja was not the wife of S.V.Ramakrishnan, but<lb/>
 only a concubine, thereby, she and her children have no inheritable status. This aspect was<lb/>
 confirmed by Court proceedings in C.S.No.108 of 1992 and confirmed in O.S.A.No.47 of 1994<lb/>
 and finally in C.S.Nos.577 to 579 of 1995, by judgment dated 22.01.2002 in relation to a sale deed<lb/>
 executed by the first respondent, the plaintiff and the respondents 2 to 4 to Mr.D.K.Sekar. The first<lb/>
 respondent in her own affidavit before the City Civil Court, Chennai in C.M.P.No.12172 of 1972 in<lb/>
 L.A.C.No.223 of 1959, has admitted to the fact that she is not the wife of late S.V.Ramakrishnan.<lb/>
 In that affidavit, she states, &quot;I, Saroja, daughter of Govindaswamy Mudaliar etc, etc---&quot; and not as<lb/>
 the wife of S.V.Ramakrishnan, and this statement is much after the Will dated 15.07.1970.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(g) Item Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of assets, are the subject matter of E.P.No.48 of 1997<lb/>
 in C.A.No.224 of 1974 in C.S.No.43 of 1962, presently on the file of the Supreme Court of India as<lb/>
 S.L.P.Nos.13783 to 13786 of 2008. The Will has no schedule of properties. It simply states, &quot;It will<lb/>
 not be possible now to detail the properties immovable, movable, cash etc., that I may die<lb/>
 possessed of. Hence I do not propose to detail them.&quot; Neither the Will provides for the fourth<lb/>
 respondent-Dhanurmathi, nor is there a codicil to that effect. The Will neither gives the first<lb/>
 respondent--Saroja the status of a wife, for it states, &quot;I am living with Srimathi Saroja, and we are<lb/>
 living as husband and wife even though there has not been a marriage between us.&quot; This<lb/>
 statement only shows that he accepted her as his concubine, which has been admitted by the first<lb/>
 respondent-Saroja in her own sworn affidavit before the City Civil Court, Chennai in<lb/>
 C.M.P.No.12172 of 1972 in L.A.C.No.223 of 1959, which reads, &quot;I, Saroja, daughter of<lb/>
 Govindaswamy Mudaliar, aged 33 years...&quot; and it further states, &quot;I am the mother and guardian of<lb/>
 Ramprasad, the second claimant. I state that having regard to the facts of the case, and the legal<lb/>
 position, the minor second claimant is not entitled to any right etc.&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>(h) Item Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of assets are the subject matter of appeal Civil<lb/>
 Appeal No.224 of 1974 arising out of O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 as against judgment and decree<lb/>
 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 filed by S.V.Ramakrishnan and this defendant against M/s.Buharis. The<lb/>
 original specific performance suit C.S.No.43 of 1962 filed by this defendant and his late father<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishan, against Mrs.Fathima Buhari and Mr.A.M.B.Buhari, was decreed in their favour.<lb/>
 Thereupon, entailment of litigation of O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 led to appeal Civil Appeal<lb/>
 No.224 of 1974 on the file of the Supreme Court of India. During the pendency of the said Civil<lb/>
 Appeal No.224 of 1974, the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 3 only filed C.M.P.No.7242 of 1981<lb/>
 claiming themselves as legal representatives of the deceased Ramakrishnan by virtue of the<lb/>
 unprobated Will, dated 15.07.1970. During the pendency of the appeal in Civil Appeal No.224 of<lb/>
 1974, the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 3 and also the fourth respondent, executed<lb/>
 assignment deeds in favour of M/s.Lalchand Megnraj and Chimmindas Megnraj, relinquishing<lb/>
 their rights to the said properties, stating that, &quot;Whereas S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar<lb/>
 notwithstanding having executed the Will and Testament dt.15.07.1970 had died intestate in<lb/>
 respect of the right to obtain re-conveyance of the property forming the subject matter of<lb/>
 C.A.No.224/74 pending on the file of the Supreme Court.&quot; Acceptance of this statement by the<lb/>
 plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 4, is confirmation that the Will does not contain item Nos.3 and 4<lb/>
 of the affidavit of assets. Even assuming that the plaintiff could claim vide intestate succession,<lb/>
 she and the respondents 1 to 4 have to prove their legitimacy rights under the provisions of the<lb/>
 Hindu Law.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(i) Appeal in Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974 was allowed by the Supreme Court of India on<lb/>
 17.04.1995 and the trial Court&apos;s judgment and decree was restored and the judgment debtors<lb/>
 M/s.Buharis were directed to re-convey the suit properties in accordance with the trial Court&apos;s<lb/>
 decree in C.S.No.43 of 1962, wherein, this defendant and late S.V.Ramakrishnan alone were<lb/>
 plaintiffs. Under the provisions of Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, the plaintiff and<lb/>
 respondents 1 to 3 could not claim to be decree-holders. In accordance with the order of the<lb/>
 Supreme Court, this defendant filed Execution Petition in E.P.No.48 of 1997, which is still pending<lb/>
 because of frivolous petitions filed by third parties as well as by the respondents 1 to 4 and the<lb/>
 plaintiff herein.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(j) The third respondent, for himself and on behalf of the plaintiff and respondents 1 and 2<lb/>
 and even 4, filed objections to E.P.No.48 of 1997 after nearly five years after the pronouncement<lb/>
 of the judgment by the Apex Court on 17.04.1995, claiming to be the legitimate claimants<lb/>
 suppressing the Will, dated 15.07.1970. However, matters ensued further litigation and was finally<lb/>
 decided on 17.04.2003 in S.L.P.(C).C.C.No.895 of 2003, in which, it is stated that, &quot;It is hereby<lb/>
 clarified that if any suit is filed interse the contending claimants to the ownership of the suit<lb/>
 property then the question of ownership the number of owners and the extent of share shall be<lb/>
 decided in that suit only.&quot; Even after the orders passed by the Apex Court on 17.04.2003, the<lb/>
 plaintiff, though fully aware of the prevailing situations, made no attempt to probate the Will.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(k) The matters relating to item Nos.3 and 4 are still being agitated in the Supreme Court<lb/>
 because of the interference of third parties filing frivolous petitions with the intent to stall<lb/>
 proceedings in the execution proceedings relating to E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962. The<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 plaintiff, with the aid of the respondents 1 to 4, inter-meddled with the estate of late<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan and in excess, has dealt with properties beyond the scope of the so-called<lb/>
 Will. The plaintiff and others who had executed a sale deed relating to property bearing No.30,<lb/>
 Ormes Road, Kilpauk, Chennai-600 010, purporting to be the legal heirs of late<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan to Mr.D.K.Sekar, ended in Court proceedings in C.S.Nos.577 to 579 of 1995<lb/>
 by judgment dated 22.01.2002, wherein it was declared that they cannot claim themselves as<lb/>
 legal heirs of late S.V.Ramakrishnan and as such, the sale was deemed null and void.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(l) The Will, dated 15.07.1970 does not contain any of the properties listed out in the<lb/>
 affidavit of assets. Item Nos.1 and 2 properties are ancestral family properties, one being a<lb/>
 Ganesha Temple and the other, a family burial ground, which incidentally cannot be Willed away<lb/>
 to strangers such as the plaintiff and the respondents 1 to 3 or even to respondent 4. Items 3 and<lb/>
 4 are subject matter of pending suits, to which the plaintiff and respondents 1 to 4 have been<lb/>
 agitating ever since 1999 and being unable to prove their legitimacy to claim the property, have<lb/>
 now come forward after 29 years to probate the Will, knowing fully well that the Will does not<lb/>
 contain the said properties, even at the loss of their status, only to deceive the Court and harass<lb/>
 the respondents 5 and 6 from claiming what rightfully belongs to them and to further stall the<lb/>
 progress of the Execution Petition in E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 in the Master&apos;s<lb/>
 Court.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(m) The statement in the Will that, &quot;All the properties on the date of my death...&quot;, by no<lb/>
 stretch of imagination could include the decree that would be passed 15 years after his death, the<lb/>
 testator could not have envisaged the outcome of the pending suit Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974<lb/>
 arising out of O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 on the file of the Supreme Court of<lb/>
 India in the year 1970. The property had been passed on to M/s.Buharis by the Division Bench<lb/>
 judgment in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966, as such, M/s.Buharis were the owners of the properties<lb/>
 and in possession of the same. The testator did not possess item Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of<lb/>
 assets as set out by the plaintiff, for him to deal with them. The testator died after 10 years after<lb/>
 the execution of the Will, dated 15.07.1970 on 31.12.1980 and he, in no way altered the said Will<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 or annexe a codicil to the said Will in view of the situation prevailing during that period. The<lb/>
 testator does not make any reference to the said pending suit C.A.No.224 of 1974 on the file of<lb/>
 the Supreme Court of India or of its outcome to enable the beneficiaries to lay claim to those<lb/>
 properties.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(n) The plaintiff, with the help of her brother, the third respondent, had been misleading<lb/>
 the Courts and she has been approbating and reprobating to suit her needs. The plaintiff, with the<lb/>
 aid of the third respondent, had been abusing the process of Court. The second defendant prays<lb/>
 that the suit may be dismissed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>5. The plaintiff has filed reply statements separately, denying the averments made in the<lb/>
 written statements filed by defendants 1 and 2.<lb/>
</p>

<p>6. This Court, by order dated 06.11.2009, framed the following issues for consideration in<lb/>
 the suit:<lb/>
</p>

<p>(i) Whether the Will dated 15.07.1970 propounded to be the last Will of<lb/>
 deceased S.V.Rama Krishnan is genuine and legally valid?<lb/>
</p>

<item>(ii) Whether the suit Will was obtained by coercion and exerting undue<lb/>
 influence as pleaded by the defendants ?<lb/>
</item>

<item>(iii) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the grant of Letters of Administration<lb/>
 as prayed for in this suit ? and<lb/>
</item>

<item>(iv) To what other relief the parties are entitled ?<lb/>
</item>

<p>7. During the course of trial, on the side of the plaintiff, the plaintiff was examined as<lb/>
 P.W.1 (N.Renuka Devi) and P.W.2 B.Murali Kumar, P.W.3 N.Dheeraj Kumar, P.W.4 N.Divya<lb/>
 Deepa and P.W.5 Dr.Philip Rajanna Doraiswamy, were examined and Exs.P-1 to P-78 were<lb/>
 marked. On the side of the defendants, the first defendant was examined as D.W.1 (E.Lalitha)<lb/>
 and the second defendant was examined as D.W.2 (S.V.Mathaprasad) and Exs.D-1 to D-25<lb/>
 were marked.<lb/>
</p>

<p>8. During the pendency of T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, the second defendant has filed the<lb/>
 following applications for the relief stated therein:<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 (a) A.No.4456 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is filed to direct the plaintiff to pay proper<lb/>
 Court fees according to the market value of the suit properties which is Rs.34,85,27,994/-crores<lb/>
 and make up the deficit of the Court fees.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(b) A.No.4457 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is filed to pass a decree of dismissal of the<lb/>
 suit filed by the plaintiff on the ground of admission.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(c) A.No.4458 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is filed to reject the plaint in T.O.S.No.2 of<lb/>
 2009 with regard to the properties listed in Annexure-A therein, specially, in regard to immovable<lb/>
 properties Nos.3 and 4 of the affidavit of assets.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(d) A.No.4533 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is filed to frame an additional issue on the<lb/>
 question of limitation and to decide the said same as a preliminary issue.<lb/>
</p>

<p>9. This Court, on a consideration of the pleadings and evidence adduced, both in the suit<lb/>
 and in the above applications, heard the submissions made by learned counsel appearing for the<lb/>
 parties and perused the relevant records.<lb/>
</p>

<p>10. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff contended that the suit schedule properties<lb/>
 belong to late S.V.Ramakrishnan and out of free consent, with sound and disposing state of mind,<lb/>
 he executed the Will on 15.07.1970, which is marked as Ex.P-1. Subsequently, he died on<lb/>
 31.12.1980. His Death Certificate is marked as Ex.P-23. The plaintiff is one of the daughters of<lb/>
 the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and the said Will was executed in favour of the plaintiff with<lb/>
 some conditions. Learned counsel for the plaintiff further contended that the first defendant is<lb/>
 another daughter of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and the second defendant is his son. The<lb/>
 wife of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan is S.V.R.Saroja and his first wife S.V.Rajalakshmi died.<lb/>
 The said was executed by late S.V.Ramakrishnan in the city of Chennai in the presence of two<lb/>
 attesting witnesses, both of whom died. The Will was registered in the Office of the Sub-Registrar,<lb/>
 Purasawalkam, Chennai, as Document No.39 of 1970. Since both the witnesses are not alive, in<lb/>
 order of prove their signatures, the close relatives of the attesting witnesses, namely P.W.2<lb/>
 B.Murali Kumar and P.W.4 N.Divya Deepa were examined. In the said Will, it is stated that after<lb/>
 the death of the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan, the properties were vested with the Office Trustee or<lb/>
 such Office or person appointed by this Court and the said condition was restricted only till the<lb/>
 plaintiff attains majority. In order to grant the Letters of Administration, the consent affidavits of the<lb/>
 children of the plaintiff, i.e. N.Divya Deepa and N.Dheeraj Kumar, have been filed and marked as<lb/>
 Exs.P.-33 and P-34 respectively. Learned counsel for the plaintiff further submitted that the<lb/>
 defendants have no right, title or interest over the suit properties and since they have objected for<lb/>
 grant of Letters of Administration, O.P.No.367 of 2008 earlier filed by the plaintiff, was converted<lb/>
 as T.O.S.No.2 of 2009. The consent affidavits of the wife-S.V.R.Saroja, daughter-R.Vijayalakshim<lb/>
 alias R.Vijaya, son-S.V.R.Ramprasad and another daughter R.S.P.Dhanurmathi, of the deceased<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan, were marked as Exs.P-2 to P-5 respectively. The Birth Certificates of<lb/>
 R.Vijaya, S.V.R.Ramprasad, the plaintiff-N.Renuka Devi and S.V.R.Dhanurmathi, were marked as<lb/>
 Exs.P-7 to 10 respectively. The other son of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, namely the second<lb/>
 defendant herein (S.V.Mathaprasad) filed a suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 against the plaintiff&apos;s father<lb/>
 and the plaint copy of the said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 is marked as Ex.P-12. The copy of the<lb/>
 written statement filed by the plaintiff&apos;s father in the said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 is marked as<lb/>
 Ex.P-13. The copy of the decree, dated 30.10.1972 passed in the said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 is<lb/>
 marked as Ex.P-14.<lb/>
</p>

<p>11. Learned counsel for the plaintiff further contended that the plaintiff&apos;s mother<lb/>
 S.V.R.Saroja execute a sale deed, dated 01.07.1983 in favour of Lakshmi Builders and<lb/>
 M/s.Kumaran Illam and the copy of the same is marked as Ex.P-15. She also executed a sale<lb/>
 deed, dated 15.02.1983 in favour of S.Palanisamy and the copy of the same is marked as Ex.P-<lb/>
16. She also executed a sale deed, dated 09.02.1987, in favour of Mrs.Geetha Ravichandran and<lb/>
 the copy of the same is marked as Ex.P-17. She further executed a sale deed, dated 21.10.1989<lb/>
 in favour of Padmavathi and the copy of the same is marked as Ex.P-18. The son the second<lb/>
 defendant herein, i.e. M.D.Prasad, filed a suit before this Court against S.V.Matha Prasad, the<lb/>
 defendant herein and others, in C.S.No.159 of 2002 and the copy of the plaint in C.S.No.159 of<lb/>
 2002 is marked as Ex.P-24. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff further submitted that<lb/>
 M/s.Lakshmi Builders filed a suit in C.S.No.469 of 1981 before this Court against Mrs.Saroja and<lb/>
 others, and the orders, dated 17.03.1982 and 12.02.1997 passed in C.S.No.469 of 1981 are<lb/>
 marked as Exs.P-26 and P-27. The third party affidavits filed by the plaintiff, along with O.P., is<lb/>
 marked as Exs.P-30 and 38. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff further contended that<lb/>
 the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and S.V.Mathaprasad earlier filed a suit in C.S.No.43 of 1962<lb/>
 before this Court against Buhari and another; the copy of the plaint in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is<lb/>
 marked as Ex.P-71 = Ex.D-13; the copy of the decree, dated 10.11.1965 passed in C.S.No.43 of<lb/>
 1962 is marked as Ex.P-72 = Ex.D-14. As against the said decree, dated 10.11.1965 passed in<lb/>
 C.S.No.43 of 1962, the appeals in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 were preferred, which were<lb/>
 disposed of by the Division Bench of this Court on 10.05.1972, against which, Civil Appeal in<lb/>
 C.A.No.224 of 1974 was preferred before the Supreme Court. The copy of the affidavit filed in<lb/>
 I.A.No.2 of 2008 in Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974 filed before the Supreme Court is marked as<lb/>
 Ex.P-78. The judgment dated 17.04.1995 passed by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.224 of<lb/>
 1974 is marked as Ex.P-28, with amended cause title therein, which is marked as Ex.P-29.<lb/>
 Subsequently E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 was preferred by S.V.Ramakrishna<lb/>
 Mudaliar (since deceased) and S.V.Matha Prasad, the second defendant herein, and the order<lb/>
 dated 07.07.2000 passed in the said E.P. is marked as Ex.D-6. The counter affidavit filed by the<lb/>
 second defendant herein in A.Nos.2872 and 2873 of 2000 in E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of<lb/>
 1962 is marked as Ex.P-55. The copy of the order dated 24.08.2000 passed in A.Nos.2872 and<lb/>
 2873 of 2000 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-56 = Ex.D-18. There are some other suits<lb/>
 filed by various parties and the relevant documents in those suits are marked on the side of the<lb/>
 plaintiff to substantiate their case.<lb/>
</p>

<p>12. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff further submitted that to prove the Will<lb/>
 executed by S.V.Ramakrishnan, on the side of the plaintiff, close relatives of the attesting<lb/>
 witnesses to the Will, namely P.W.2 B.Muralikumar and P.W.5 Dr.Philip Rajanna Doraiswamy,<lb/>
 were examined, who spoke about the signatures of the attesting witness to the Will and its<lb/>
 registration. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff further stated that there is mention about<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 the Will Ex.P-1 in subsequent documents, in which, the defendants are also parties, and hence,<lb/>
 he submitted that the genuineness of the Will cannot be questioned at this stage by the<lb/>
 defendants. He further contended that the only defence raised by the defendants in their case is<lb/>
 that the Will was obtained by undue influence, which has not been proved by the defendants<lb/>
 through evidence. The Will was executed by the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan out of free consent<lb/>
 and while he was in a sound and disposing state of mind, and the Will was duly registered before<lb/>
 the Registrar Office, and hence, the Will has been proved by the plaintiff by adducing evidence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>13. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff also submitted that after the death of the<lb/>
 testator S.V.Ramakrishnan on 31.12.1980, the plaintiff has taken steps to execute the Will by<lb/>
 filing O.P.No.367 of 2008 before this Court for grant of Letters of Administration, and though there<lb/>
 may be some delay, the delay may not defeat the rights of the plaintiff and that, as contended by<lb/>
 the learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants, the T.O.S. may not be dismissed,<lb/>
 since Article 137 of the Limitation Act will not apply to the facts of the present case and in this<lb/>
 regard, he relied on the judgment of the First Bench of this Court in O.S.A.Nos.10 and 72 of 2013,<lb/>
 dated 07.01.2016. Hence, learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff submitted that the T.O.S.<lb/>
 may not be dismissed as time barred. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff also submitted<lb/>
 that even though it is contended on the side of the defendants that the suit properties were under-<lb/>
valued by the plaintiff and no proper Court fee was filed, the defendants have not proved their<lb/>
 case with regard to the market value of the properties by relevant oral or documentary evidence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>14. For all the above reasons, learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff prayed that the<lb/>
 Letters of Administration may be granted in favour of the plaintiff and the T.O.S. may be decreed<lb/>
 as prayed for. In support of his submissions, learned counsel for the plaintiff relied on the<lb/>
 following decisions:<lb/>
</p>

<p>(a) 2005 (1) CTC 304 (SC) (Iridium India Telecom Ltd. Vs. Motorola Inc.):<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;2. This appeal impugns the judgment of the Division Bench of the<lb/>
 High Court of Judicature at Bombay in a letters patent appeal holding that the<lb/>
 amended provision of Order 8, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908<lb/>
 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;CPC&quot;) would not apply to the suits on the original<lb/>
 side of the High Court and that such suits would continue to be governed by<lb/>
 the High Court Original Side Rules.<lb/>
</item>

<item>... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>14. Prior to the establishing of the chartered High Courts by the British<lb/>
 Government in 1862, the civil courts in the Presidency of Bombay were<lb/>
 governed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1859 (Act No.VIII of 1859, which<lb/>
 received the assent of the Governor General on 22.3.1859). This Act, as its<lb/>
 preamble suggests, was &apos;an Act for simplifying the procedure of the Courts of<lb/>
 Civil Judicature not established by Royal Charter&apos; and was not intended to<lb/>
 apply to High Courts established by Royal Charter.<lb/>
</item>

<p>15. The First Letters Patent or Charter establishing High Courts was<lb/>
 accompanied by a Despatch from the Secretary of State on 14.5.1862, and<lb/>
 was in force till revoked by a further Letters Patent on 28.12.1865. The learned<lb/>
 counsel drew our attention to para 36 of the Despatch, which explains the<lb/>
 purpose of Clause 37 in the First Letters Patent. The said paragraph 36 of the<lb/>
 Despatch reads as under:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;36. Clause 37 is a very important one, and there<lb/>
 is little doubt, will prove a very salutary provision. It has,<lb/>
 therefore, been inserted, although the change introduced<lb/>
 is somewhat greater and more substantial than is<lb/>
 generally aimed at in this Charter. It extends to the High<lb/>
 Court the Code of Civil Procedure enacted by the<lb/>
 legislature of India for the Court, not established by Royal<lb/>
 Charter, and thus accomplishes the object so long<lb/>
 contemplated of substituting one simple Code of<lb/>
 Procedure for the various systems (corresponding to its<lb/>
 common law, equity and admiralty jurisdiction) which have<lb/>
 been in operation in the Supreme Court since the date of<lb/>
 its establishment.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>16. It is therefore seen that Clause 37 of the Letters Patent was<lb/>
 intended to extend to the High Courts the Code of Civil Procedure enacted<lb/>
 by the Legislature of India for the Courts other than the Courts established<lb/>
 by the Royal Charter. The intention was to substitute one simple Code of<lb/>
 Procedure for the various systems which had been in operation in the<lb/>
 Supreme Court since the date of its establishment.<lb/>
</item>

<item>17. Clause 37 of the Letters Patent of 1865, which deals with &quot;civil<lb/>
 procedure and regulation of proceedings&quot;, reads as follows:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;37. And we do further ordain that it shall be lawful for the<lb/>
 said High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal, from time<lb/>
 to time, to make rules and orders for the purpose of regulating all<lb/>
 proceedings in civil cases which may be brought before the said<lb/>
 High Court, including proceedings in its Admiralty, Vice-Admiralty,<lb/>
 Testamentary,<lb/>
 Intestate<lb/>
 and<lb/>
 Matrimonial<lb/>
 Jurisdictions,<lb/>
 respectively:<lb/>
</item>

<item>Provided that the said High Court shall be guided in<lb/>
 making such rules and orders as far as possible, by the provisions<lb/>
 of the Code of Civil Procedure, being an Act passed by the<lb/>
 Governor-General-in-Council, and being Act No.VIII of 1859, and<lb/>
 the provisions of any law which has been made amending or<lb/>
 altering the same, by competent legislative authority for India.&quot;<lb/>
 (Letters Patents of the three High Courts, namely, Calcutta,<lb/>
 Bombay and Madras are identically worded.)<lb/>
</item>

<item>18. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1877 (Act No.X of 1877), which<lb/>
 received the assent of the Governor General on 30.3.1877, and was<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 thereafter brought into force with effect from 1.10.1877, was &quot;an Act to<lb/>
 consolidate and amend the laws relating to the procedure of the Court of<lb/>
 Civil Judicature&quot;. Part IX of this Act contained special rules relating to the<lb/>
 Chartered High Courts. Chapter XLVIII of the Act applied only to the<lb/>
 Chartered High Courts. Section 632 of the Civil Procedure Code of 1877,<lb/>
 in express words, provided: &quot;except as provided in this Chapter the<lb/>
 provisions of this Code apply to such High Courts&quot;. Section 638 was the<lb/>
 exception to the general rule and provided as under:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;The following portions of this Code shall not apply to the<lb/>
 High Court in the exercise of its ordinary or extraordinary original<lb/>
 civil jurisdiction, namely, Sections 16 and 17, Sections 54,<lb/>
 Clauses (a) and (b), 57, 119, 160, 182 to 185 (both inclusive),<lb/>
 187, 189, 190, 191, 192 (so far as relates to the manner of taking<lb/>
 evidence), 198 to 206 (both inclusive), 261, and so much of<lb/>
 Section 409 as relates to the making of a memorandum; and<lb/>
 Section 579 shall not apply to the High Court in the exercise of its<lb/>
 appellate jurisdiction.<lb/>
 Nothing in this Code shall extend or apply to any High Court in the<lb/>
 exercise of its jurisdiction as an Insolvency Court.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>19. The Legislature recognised the special role assigned to the<lb/>
 chartered High Courts and exempted them from the application of several<lb/>
 provisions of the Code in the exercise of their ordinary or extraordinary<lb/>
 civil jurisdiction for the simple reason that those jurisdictions were<lb/>
 governed by the procedure prescribed by the rules made in exercise of<lb/>
 the powers of the Chartered High Courts under Clause 37 of the Letters<lb/>
 Patent. Interestingly, Section 652 of this Act itself empowered the High<lb/>
 Courts to make rules &apos;consistent with this Code to regulate any matter<lb/>
 connected with the procedure of the Courts of Civil Judicature subject to<lb/>
 its superintendence&apos;, suggesting that consistency with the Code was a<lb/>
 sine qua non only when making rules for the subordinate Courts.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>32. There cannot be any doubt about the principle of harmonious<lb/>
 construction. However, what confronts us is not a mere question of two<lb/>
 independent provisions of the CPC being in conflict. The provisions of the<lb/>
 CPC, which we have extracted, and the historical development of the<lb/>
 different sections to which we have referred, do not suggest a situation of<lb/>
 mere conflict. They seem to suggest that, throughout, the Legislature had<lb/>
 made a distinction between the proceedings in other civil Courts and the<lb/>
 proceedings on the Original Side of the Chartered High Courts. This<lb/>
 distinction was made for good historical reasons and it had continued<lb/>
 unabated, as we have noticed, through the consolidating Acts, and<lb/>
 continued unaffected even through the last amendment of the CPC in the<lb/>
 year 2002. In the face of this body of evidence, it is difficult to accede to<lb/>
 the contention of the appellant that the force of the non-obstante clause is<lb/>
 merely declaratory and not intended to operate as a declared exception to<lb/>
 the general body of the CPC.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>35. Reference was made to A.G.Varadarajulu and Anr. Vs. State<lb/>
 of Tamil Nadu and Ors., AIR 1998 SC 1388, at para 16. This judgment<lb/>
 merely followed the observations made in Aswini Kumar (supra) -Aswini<lb/>
 Kumar Ghosh Vs. Arabinda Bose,1953 SCR (1) 377 and Madhav Rao<lb/>
 Scindia Vs. Union of India, 1971 (1) SCC 85 at p.139. There is no doubt<lb/>
 that where the non obstante clause is widely worded, &quot;a search has,<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 therefore, to be made with a view to determining which provision answers<lb/>
 the description and which does not&quot;. The historical development of the law<lb/>
 suggests that the non obstante clause in Section 129 is intended to<lb/>
 bypass the entire body of the Code so far as the rules made by the<lb/>
 Chartered High Court for regulating the procedure on its Original Side are<lb/>
 concerned.<lb/>
 .. ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>47. Finally, it was argued by Mr.Jethmalani that the Letters Patent,<lb/>
 and the rules made thereunder by the High Court for regulating its<lb/>
 procedure on the Original Side, were subordinate legislation and,<lb/>
 therefore, must give way to the superior legislation, namely, the<lb/>
 substantive provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. There are two<lb/>
 difficulties in accepting this argument. In the first place, Section 2(18) of<lb/>
 the CPC defines &quot;rules&quot; to mean &quot;rules and forms contained in the First<lb/>
 Schedule or made under Section 122 or Section 125&quot;. The conspicuous<lb/>
 absence of reference to the rules regulating the procedure to be followed<lb/>
 on the Original Side of a Chartered High Court makes it clear that those<lb/>
 rules are not &quot;rules&quot; as defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.<lb/>
 Secondly, it is not possible to accept the contention that the Letters Patent<lb/>
 and rules made thereunder, which are recognised and specifically<lb/>
 protected by Section 129, are relegated to a subordinate status, as<lb/>
 contended by the learned counsel. We might usefully refer to the<lb/>
 observations of the Constitutional Bench of this Court in P.S.Santhappan<lb/>
</item>

<item>(Dead) by LRs. Vs. Andhra Bank Ltd. &amp; Ors., JT 2004 (8) SC 464. With<lb/>
 reference to Letters Patent, this is what the Constitution Bench said:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;148. It was next submitted that Clause 44 of the<lb/>
 Letters Patent showed that Letters Patent were subject to<lb/>
 amendment and alteration. It was submitted that this showed<lb/>
 that a Letters Patent was a subordinate or subservient piece of<lb/>
 law. Undoubtedly, Clause 44 permits amendment or alteration<lb/>
 of Letters Patent, but then which legislation is not subject to<lb/>
 amendment or alteration? CPC is also subject to amendments<lb/>
 and alterations. In fact it has been amended on a number of<lb/>
 occasions. The only unalterable provisions are the basic<lb/>
 structure of our Constitution. Merely because there is a<lb/>
 provision for amendment does not mean that, in the absence<lb/>
 of an amendment or a contrary provision, the Letters Patent is<lb/>
 to be ignored. To submit that a Letters Patent is a subordinate<lb/>
 piece of legislation is to not understand the true nature of a<lb/>
 Letters Patent. As has been held in Vinita Khanolkar&apos;s, JT 1997<lb/>
</item>

<item>(9) SC 490 case and Sharda Devi&apos;s, JT 2002 (3) SC 43 case a<lb/>
 Letters Patent is the Charter of the High Court. As held in<lb/>
 Shah Babulal Khimaji&apos;s, 1982 (1) SCR 187 case a Letters<lb/>
 Patent is the specific law under which a High Court derives its<lb/>
 powers. It is not any subordinate piece of legislation. As set out<lb/>
 in aforementioned two cases a Letters Patent cannot be<lb/>
 excluded by implication. Further it is settled law that between a<lb/>
 special law and a general law the special law will always<lb/>
 prevail. A Letters Patent is a special law for the concerned<lb/>
 High Court. Civil Procedure Code is a general law applicable to<lb/>
 all Courts. It is well settled law, that in the event of a conflict<lb/>
 between a special law and a general law, the special law must<lb/>
 always prevail. We see no conflict between Letters Patent and<lb/>
 Section 104 but if there was any conflict between a Letters<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 Patent and the Civil Procedure Code then the provisions of the<lb/>
 Letters Patent would always prevail unless there was a specific<lb/>
 exclusion. This is also clear from Section 4 of the Civil<lb/>
 Procedure Code which provides that nothing in the Code shall<lb/>
 limit or affect any special law. As set out in Section 4 CPC only<lb/>
 a specific provision to the contrary can exclude the special law.<lb/>
 The specific provision would be a provision like Section 100-A.&quot;<lb/>

<p>(b) 2014 (4) SCC 434 (R.Unnikrishnan Vs. V.K. Mahanudevan):<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;19. It is trite that law favours finality to binding judicial decisions<lb/>
 pronounced by courts that are competent to deal with the subject-matter.<lb/>
 Public interest is against individuals being vexed twice over with the same<lb/>
 kind of litigation. The binding character of the judgments pronounced by the<lb/>
 courts of competent jurisdiction has always been treated as an essential<lb/>
 part of the rule of law which is the basis of the administration of justice in<lb/>
 this country. We may gainfully refer to the decision of the Constitution<lb/>
 Bench of this Court in Daryao Vs. State of U.P. (AIR 1961 SC 1457) where<lb/>
 the Court succinctly summed up the law in the following words: (AIR<lb/>
 p.1462, paras 9 &amp; 11)<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;9. … It is in the interest of the public at large that<lb/>
 a finality should attach to the binding decisions<lb/>
 pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction, and it is<lb/>
 also in the public interest that individuals should not be<lb/>
 vexed twice over with the same kind of litigation.<lb/>
 *<lb/>
 *<lb/>
 *<lb/>
</item>

<item>11. … The binding character of judgments<lb/>
 pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction is itself an<lb/>
 essential part of the rule of law, and the rule of law<lb/>
 obviously is the basis of the administration of justice on<lb/>
 which the Constitution lays so much emphasis.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>20. That even erroneous decisions can operate as res judicata is<lb/>
 also fairly well settled by a long line of decisions rendered by this Court. In<lb/>
 Mohanlal Goenka Vs. Benoy Kishna Mukherjee (AIR 1953 SC 65) this<lb/>
 Court observed: (AIR p.72, para 23)<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;23. There is ample authority for the proposition<lb/>
 that even an erroneous decision on a question of law<lb/>
 operates as &apos;res judicata&apos; between the parties to it. The<lb/>
 correctness or otherwise of a judicial decision has no<lb/>
 bearing upon the question whether or not it operates as<lb/>
 &apos;res judicata&apos;. &quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>21. Similarly, in State of W.B. Vs. Hemant Kumar Bhattacharjee<lb/>
 (AIR 1966 SC 1061 : 1966 Cri.L.J. 805) this Court reiterated the above<lb/>
 principles in the following words: (AIR p.1066, para 14)<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;14. … A wrong decision by a court having<lb/>
 jurisdiction is as much binding between the parties as a<lb/>
 right one and may be superseded only by appeals to<lb/>
 higher tribunals or other procedure like review which the<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 law provides.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>22. The recent decision of this Court in Kalinga Mining Corpn. Vs.<lb/>
 Union of India (2013 (5) SCC 252 : 2013 (2) SCC (Civ) 797) is a timely<lb/>
 reminder of the very same principle. The following passage in this regard is<lb/>
 apposite: (SCC pp.267-68, para 44)<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;44. … In our opinion, if the parties are allowed to<lb/>
 reagitate issues which have been decided by a court of<lb/>
 competent jurisdiction on a subsequent change in the law<lb/>
 then all earlier litigation relevant thereto would always<lb/>
 remain in a state of flux. In such circumstances, every<lb/>
 time either a statute or a provision thereof is declared<lb/>
 ultra vires, it would have the result of reopening of the<lb/>
 decided matters within the period of limitation following<lb/>
 the date of such decision.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>23. In Mathura Prasad Bajoo Jaiswal Vs. Dossibai N.B.Jeejeebhoy<lb/>
 (1970 (1) SCC 613) this Court held that for the application of the rule of res<lb/>
 judicata, the court is not concerned with the correctness or otherwise of the<lb/>
 earlier judgment. The matter in issue if one purely of fact decided in the<lb/>
 earlier proceedings by a competent court must in any subsequent litigation<lb/>
 between the same parties be recorded as finally decided and cannot be<lb/>
 reopened. That is true even in regard to mixed questions of law and fact<lb/>
 determined in the earlier proceeding between the same parties which<lb/>
 cannot be revised or reopened in a subsequent proceeding between the<lb/>
 same parties. Having said that we must add that the only exception to the<lb/>
 doctrine of res judicata is &quot;fraud&quot; that vitiates the decision and renders it a<lb/>
 nullity. This Court has in more than one decision held that fraud renders any<lb/>
 judgment, decree or order a nullity and non est in the eye of the law. In<lb/>
 A.V.Papayya Sastry Vs. State of A.P. (2007 (4) SCC 221), &quot;fraud&quot; was<lb/>
 defined by this Court in the following words: (SCC pp.231-32, para 26)<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;26. Fraud may be defined as an act of deliberate<lb/>
 deception with the design of securing some unfair or<lb/>
 undeserved benefit by taking undue advantage of another.<lb/>
 In fraud one gains at the loss [and cost] of another. Even<lb/>
 most solemn proceedings stand vitiated if they are<lb/>
 actuated by fraud. Fraud is thus an extrinsic collateral act<lb/>
 which vitiates all judicial acts, whether in rem or in<lb/>
 personam. The principle of &apos;finality of litigation&apos; cannot be<lb/>
 stretched to the extent of an absurdity that it can be utilised<lb/>
 as an engine of oppression by dishonest and fraudulent<lb/>
 litigants.&quot;<lb/>

</item>

<item>16. The controversy pertaining to the provisions contained in Order<lb/>
 14 Rule 2, had come up for consideration before this Court in Major<lb/>
 S.S.Khanna Vs. Brig.F.J.Dillon, AIR 1964 SC 497 : 1964 (4) SCR 409,<lb/>
 wherein it has been ruled thus:<lb/>
</item>

<item>http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
</item>

<p>&quot;Under Order 14, Rule 2, where issues both of law and of<lb/>
 fact arise in the same Suit, and the Court is of opinion that the case<lb/>
 or any part thereof may be disposed of on the issue of law only, it<lb/>
 shall try those issues first, and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit,<lb/>
 postpone the settlement of the issues of fact until after the issues of<lb/>
 law have been determined. The jurisdiction to try issues of law apart<lb/>
 from the issues of fact may be exercised only where in the opinion<lb/>
 of the Court the whole Suit may be disposed of on the issues of law<lb/>
 alone, but the Code confers no jurisdiction upon the Court to try a<lb/>
 Suit on mixed issues of law and fact as Preliminary issues. Normally<lb/>
 all issues in a Suit should be tried by the Court: not to do so,<lb/>
 especially when the decision on issues even of law depends upon<lb/>
 the decision of issues of fact, would result in a lop-sided trial of the<lb/>
 Suit&quot;.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
 18. In Ramesh D.Desai and others Vs. Bipin Vadilal Mehta and<lb/>
 others, 2006 (5) SCC 638, while dealing with the issue of limitation, the Court<lb/>
 opined that a plea of limitation cannot be decided as an abstract principle of<lb/>
 law divorced from facts as in every case the starting point of limitation has to<lb/>
 be ascertained which is entirely a question of fact. The Court further<lb/>
 proceeded to state that a plea of limitation is a mixed question of fact and<lb/>
 law. On a plain consideration of the language employed in sub-rule (2) of<lb/>
 Order 14 it can be stated with certitude that when an issue requires an inquiry<lb/>
 into facts it cannot be tried as a Preliminary issue. In the said Judgment the<lb/>
 Court opined as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;13. Sub-rule (2) of Order 14, Rule 2, C.P.C., lays down<lb/>
 that where issues both of law and of fact arise in the same Suit, and<lb/>
 the Court is of the opinion that the case or any part thereof may be<lb/>
 disposed of on an issue of law only, it may try that issue first if that<lb/>
 issue relates to (a) the jurisdiction of the Court, or (b) a bar to the<lb/>
 Suit created by any law for the time being in force. The provisions<lb/>
 of this Rule came up for consideration before this Court in Major<lb/>
 S.S.Khanna Vs. Brig.F.J.Dillon and it was held as under: (SCR<lb/>
 p.</item>

<p>421)<lb/>
 &quot;Under Order 14, Rule 2, Code of Civil Procedure<lb/>
 where issues both of law and of fact arise in the same Suit,<lb/>
 and the Court is of opinion that the case or any part thereof<lb/>
 may be disposed of on the issues of law only, it shall try<lb/>
 those issues first, and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit,<lb/>
 postpone the settlement of the issues of fact until after the<lb/>
 issues of law have been determined. The jurisdiction to try<lb/>
 issues of law apart from the issues of fact may be exercised<lb/>
 only where in the opinion of the Court the whole Suit may be<lb/>
 disposed of on the issues of law alone, but the Code confers<lb/>
 no jurisdiction upon the Court to try a Suit on mixed issues of<lb/>
 law and fact as preliminary issues. Normally all the issues in<lb/>
 a Suit should be tried by the Court; not to do so, especially<lb/>
 when the decision on issues even of law depend upon the<lb/>
 decision of issues of fact, would result in a lopsided trial of<lb/>
 the Suit&quot;.<lb/>
 Though there has been a slight amendment in the language of<lb/>
 Order 14, Rule 2, C.P.C., by the amending Act, 1976 but the<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 principle enunciated in the above quoted decision still holds good<lb/>
 and there can be no departure from the principle that the Code<lb/>
 confers no jurisdiction upon the Court to try a Suit on mixed issues<lb/>
 of law and fact as a Preliminary issue and where the decision on<lb/>
 issue of law depends upon decision of fact, it cannot be tried as a<lb/>
 preliminary issue&quot;.<lb/>
</p>

<item>19. In the case at hand, we find that unless there is determination<lb/>
 of the fact which would not protect the Plaintiff under Section 10 of the<lb/>
 Limitation Act the Suit cannot be dismissed on the ground of limitation. It is<lb/>
 not a case which will come within the ambit and sweep of Order 14, Rule 2,<lb/>
 which would enable the Court to frame a Preliminary issue to adjudicate<lb/>
 thereof. The learned Single Judge, as it appears, has remained totally<lb/>
 oblivious of the said fact and adjudicated the issue as if it falls under Order<lb/>
 14, Rule 2. We repeat that on the scheme of Section 10 of the Limitation<lb/>
 Act we find certain facts are to be established to throw the lis from the<lb/>
 sphere of the said provision so that it would come within the concept of<lb/>
 limitation. The Division Bench has fallen into some error without<lb/>
 appreciating the facts in proper perspective. That apart, the Division<lb/>
 Bench, by taking recourse of Articles 92 to 96 without appreciating the<lb/>
 factum that it uses the words &quot;transferred by the trustee for a valuable<lb/>
 consideration&quot; in that event the limitation would be twelve years but in the<lb/>
 instant case the asseveration of the Plaintiff is that the Trustee had created<lb/>
 three Settlement Deeds in favour of his two daughters and a grand-<lb/>
daughter. The issue of consideration has not yet emerged. This settlement<lb/>
 made by the father was whether for consideration or not has to be gone<lb/>
 into and similarly whether the property belongs to the Trust as Trust is<lb/>
 understood within the meaning of Section 10 of the Limitation Act has also<lb/>
 to be gone into. Ergo, there can be no shadow of doubt that the Issue No.1<lb/>
 that was framed by the learned Single Judge was an issue that pertained to<lb/>
 fact and law and hence, could not have been adjudicated as a Preliminary<lb/>
 Issue. Therefore, the impugned Order is wholly unsustainable.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(d) 2014 (6) CTC 80 (SC) (Leela Rajagopal Vs. Kamala Menon Cocharan):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;10. A Will may have certain features and may have been executed<lb/>
 in certain circumstances which may appear to be somewhat unnatural. Such<lb/>
 unusual features appearing in a Will or the unnatural circumstances<lb/>
 surrounding its execution will definitely justify a close scrutiny before the<lb/>
 same can be accepted. It is the overall assessment of the Court on the basis<lb/>
 of such scrutiny; the cumulative effect of the unusual features and<lb/>
 circumstances which would weigh with the Court in the determination<lb/>
 required to be made by it. The judicial verdict, in the last resort, will be on the<lb/>
 basis of a consideration of all the unusual features and suspicious<lb/>
 circumstances put together and not on the impact of any single feature that<lb/>
 may be found in a Will or a singular circumstance that may appear from the<lb/>
 process leading to its execution or registration. This, is the essence of the<lb/>
 repeated pronouncements made by this Court on the subject including the<lb/>
 decisions referred to and relied upon before us.<lb/>
</item>

<item>11. In the present case, a close reading of the will indicates its clear<lb/>
 language, and its unambiguous purport and effect. The mind of the testator<lb/>
 is clearly discernible and the reasons for exclusion of the sons is apparent<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 from the will itself. Insofar as the place of execution is concerned, the<lb/>
 inconsistency appearing in the verification filed along with the application for<lb/>
 probate by PW 3 and the oral evidence of the said witness tendered in court<lb/>
 is capable of being understood in the light of the fact that the verification is in<lb/>
 a standard form (Form No. 55) prescribed by the Madras High Court on the<lb/>
 Original Side, as already noticed. Besides, in the facts of the present case<lb/>
 the participation of the first respondent in the execution and registration of<lb/>
 the Will cannot be said to be a circumstance that would warrant an adverse<lb/>
 conclusion. The conduct of the first respondent in summoning her friend<lb/>
 (PW.3) to be an attesting witness and in taking the testator to the office of<lb/>
 the Sub-Registrar should, again, not warrant any adverse conclusion. It also<lb/>
 cannot escape notice that the Will dated 11.1.1982 is identical with the<lb/>
 contents of the earlier Will dated 28.12.1981. Insofar as the execution of the<lb/>
 Will dated 28.12.1981 and its registration is concerned no active<lb/>
 participation has been attributed to the first respondent. The change of the<lb/>
 Attesting Witnesses and the non-examination of Seetha Padmanabhan, who<lb/>
 had attested the second Will dated 11.1.1982 has been sufficiently<lb/>
 explained.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>13. All the unusual and allegedly suspicious circumstances being<lb/>
 capable of being understood in the manner indicated above, we cannot find<lb/>
 any fault with the conclusions reached by the High Court while reversing the<lb/>
 judgment of the learned Trial Court.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(e) AIR 1974 SC 1999 (Surendra Pal and others Vs. Dr.(Mrs.)Saraswati Arora and<lb/>
 another):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;9. The Appellate Court agreeing with the trial Judge held that<lb/>
 Respondent 1 was merely present at the time of the execution of the Will<lb/>
 and did not have anything to do with its execution. The case of Appellant 1<lb/>
 was that as a condition of the marriage arrangement, the Will was<lb/>
 executed and because of that Bhim Sain made no provision for the<lb/>
 maintenance of his aged mother or for the maintenance and marriage of<lb/>
 his youngest daughter Rita who was then studying. Instead he gave away<lb/>
 the entire property to Respondent 1 which is a suspicious circumstance<lb/>
 and raises an inference of undue influence. This submission was clearly<lb/>
 negatived, and on the evidence there can be no gainsaying the fact that<lb/>
 the conclusions to which both the Courts have come to are unassailable. It<lb/>
 is not for us to fathom the motivations of a man. His actions and reactions<lb/>
 are unpredictable as they depend upon so many circumstances. There is,<lb/>
 however, always some dominant and impelling circumstance which<lb/>
 motivates a man&apos;s action though in some cases even a trivial and trifling<lb/>
 cause impels him to act in a particular way which a majority of others may<lb/>
 not do. At times psychological factors and the frame of mind in which he is,<lb/>
 may determine his action.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>14. Apart from general considerations emerging from the nature of<lb/>
 a Will and the circumstances which not infrequently surround the<lb/>
 execution of it, there are other matters which are peculiar to the times and<lb/>
 the society and perhaps even to the person making the Will and his or her<lb/>
 family. Inferences arising from relationships between a testator and a<lb/>
 legatee are certainly so dependent upon the peculiarities of the society or<lb/>
 community to which the testator and the legatee belong, their habits and<lb/>
 customs, their values, their mores, their ways of thinking and feeling, their<lb/>
 susceptibilities to particular kinds of pressures, influences, or inducements<lb/>
 that it seems very difficult to reduce them to a general rule applicable at all<lb/>
 times and everywhere so as to raise a presumption of undue influence<lb/>
 from a particular type of relationship. The only kinds of relationship giving<lb/>
 rise to such presumptions are those contemplated in Section 111 of the<lb/>
 Evidence Act. Any other presumption from a relationship must, to be<lb/>
 acceptable, be capable of being raised only under Section 114 of the<lb/>
 Evidence Act. Such presumptions of fact are really optional inferences<lb/>
 from proof of a frequently recurring set of facts which make a particular<lb/>
 inference from such facts reasonable and natural. If a particular situation<lb/>
 arising from a set of facts, which may raise a presumption elsewhere, is<lb/>
 exceptional or unusual here, there could be no question here of applying a<lb/>
 presumption arising from a common or natural course of events. A<lb/>
 suggested inference of undue influence would then be a matter of proof on<lb/>
 the particular facts of the case before the Court. This, we think is the<lb/>
 correct legal position here.<lb/>
</item>

<item>15. The case before us could certainly not fall within Section 111<lb/>
 of the Evidence Act. There is no presumption of law or fact in this country<lb/>
 that a woman to whom a man is engaged to be married is in a position to<lb/>
 dominate his will so as to over-ride his own real intentions. It is not mere<lb/>
 influence, but undue influence, which has to be proved by the party which<lb/>
 sets up such a case. We think that a plea of undue influence, where set<lb/>
 up, is a special plea. Section 103 of the Evidence Act places the burden of<lb/>
 substantiating such a plea on the party which sets it up.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>17. In the instant case, there was no suggestion that the testator<lb/>
 was feeble minded or so completely deprived of his power of independent<lb/>
 thought and judgment as to faithfully carry out the wishes of the lady to<lb/>
 whom he became engaged and then married. In fact, it appears that it was<lb/>
 he who might have offered the inducement voluntarily to the lady<lb/>
 concerned to agree to share his life. Upon the facts of such a case, no<lb/>
 presumption of the kind urged before us on behalf of the appellant could,<lb/>
 in our opinion reasonably arise in any country, at any time, in any society.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>20. We have also no doubt that the Will was genuine. All the<lb/>
 formalities required were fully satisfied, it was executed by the testator in a<lb/>
 sound disposing mind and it was duly attested as required by law.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(f) AIR 1955 SC 363 (Naresh Charan Das Gupta v. Paresh Charan Das Gupta and<lb/>
 another):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;5. The facts so far as they are material for this issue, may now be<lb/>
 stated. The testator was a police officer and retired in 1927 as Deputy<lb/>
 Superintendent of Police. Paresh Charan, the elder son, was married in<lb/>
 1925, and lived all along with his parents with his wife and children.<lb/>
 Nirmala, the wife of the testator, died in 1929, and thereafter it was the wife<lb/>
 of Paresh Charan that was maintaining the home. Naresh Charan studied<lb/>
 up to I.A., but in 1920 discontinued his studies and got into employment in<lb/>
 the workshop of Tata &amp; Co., at Jamshedpur on a petty salary; and the<lb/>
 evidence is that thereafter he was practically living apart from the family. In<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 1928 he married one Shantimayi, who was a widow having some children<lb/>
 by her first husband. She belonged to the Kayastha caste, whereas Naresh<lb/>
 Charan belonged to the Baid caste. The testator was strongly opposed to<lb/>
 this intercaste marriage, and did his best to stop it but without success. The<lb/>
 correspondence that followed between the appellant and his father during<lb/>
 this period clearly shows that the father felt very sore over this alliance, and<lb/>
 wrote that it could not pain him even if his son died.<lb/>
</item>

<item>6. With this background, we may turn to the will. The relevant<lb/>
 recitals therein are as follows:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;My younger son Sri Naresh Charan Das Gupta is behaving<lb/>
 badly with me and without my knowledge and consent he has married<lb/>
 a girl of a different caste and she has given birth to two female<lb/>
 children and one male child. In these circumstances my said son Sri<lb/>
 Naresh Charan Das Gupta and his son Sreeman Arun Gupta and the<lb/>
 two daughters or any other son or daughter who may be born to him,<lb/>
 will not be entitled to perform my sradh or to offer me pindas. For all<lb/>
 these reasons I deprive my second son Sri Naresh Charan and his<lb/>
 son Sreeman Arun Gupta and his two daughters and any other sons<lb/>
 or daughters who may be born to him as well as Naresh&apos;s wife<lb/>
 Sreemati Santi of inheritance from me and from all my movable and<lb/>
 immovable properties, ancestral as well as self-acquired. They shall<lb/>
 not get any share or interest or possession in any of my aforesaid<lb/>
 properties&quot;.<lb/>
</item>

<item>It is not disputed that these recitals accord with what the testator had<lb/>
 expressed in the correspondence at the time of the marriage and for some<lb/>
 years thereafter. But it is argued that since then, more than a decade had<lb/>
 passed before the will was executed, and that during this period the natural<lb/>
 affection of the testator for his son had reasserted itself, that he had<lb/>
 forgiven and forgotten the past, and that when the will was actually<lb/>
 executed, the recitals above extracted did not correctly reflect the then mind<lb/>
 of the testator.<lb/>
</item>

<item>6a. We have been taken through the entire correspondence that<lb/>
 passed between the testator and the appellant and the members of his<lb/>
 family. It shows that the testator was solicitous about the welfare of the<lb/>
 appellant, and was enquiring about his health and sending him on<lb/>
 occasions medicines; that he was affectionately disposed towards his<lb/>
 children and was sending them presents of cloth; that latterly he had so far<lb/>
 modified his attitude towards the wife of the appellant as to invite her and<lb/>
 her children to Calcutta; that he himself stayed with them for some time at<lb/>
 Jamshedpur and was giving advice to the appellant on matters connected<lb/>
 with his employment. It was argued that there was thus a gradual change of<lb/>
 heart on the part of the father towards the appellant and the members of his<lb/>
 family, that the recitals in the will could not be reconciled with this change of<lb/>
 attitude, and that they must have been inspired by the first respondent.<lb/>
 We are unable to agree. It is one thing for a father who feels that he has<lb/>
 been wronged by a disobedient son to wish him well in life, and quite<lb/>
 another thing to give him any of his properties. In the whole of the<lb/>
 correspondence which has been read to us, there is nothing to suggest that<lb/>
 he wanted the appellant to share in the estate. On the other hand, there are<lb/>
 indications that even when the appellant was in financial difficulties, the<lb/>
 testator considered that he was under no sort of obligation to come to his<lb/>
 help. Vide Exs.5(c) and C(1). It may be mentioned that after making the will<lb/>
 on 28-11-1943, the testator continued to correspond with the appellant and<lb/>
 the members of his family precisely in the same terms as before. Vide<lb/>
 Exs.B(2), C(4) and A(10). That shows that the two currents of natural<lb/>
 affection and settlement of properties flowed in distinct channels, and that<lb/>
 the change in the course of the one had no effect on the direction of the<lb/>
 other.<lb/>
</item>

<item>7. The testator, it is clear from the correspondence, was a man of<lb/>
 strong will, determined and unshakable in his resolutions. He wrote of<lb/>
 himself in Ex.C(34) that &quot;I am one-third conservative, one-third liberal and<lb/>
 one-third autocratic&quot;. He was very solicitous about the family prestige and<lb/>
 reputation, and felt deeply hurt when his son entered into a marriage which<lb/>
 was viewed by his community with disfavour. In Ex.6(c) he wrote,<lb/>
 &quot;You broke our hearts for a woman who has no right to be in my house.&quot;<lb/>
 And as late as 25-12-1941 he wrote to the appellant that if his wife and<lb/>
 children came to live with him &quot;they must prepare themselves to meet<lb/>
 uncalled for taunts and unpleasant enquiries which may be made by our<lb/>
 near and distant village relations in our society who will come to see us&quot;.<lb/>
 (Vide Exhibit C(37)).<lb/>
 There cannot, therefore, be any doubt that the testator was all along<lb/>
 smarting under a sense of social humiliation by reason of the inter-caste-<lb/>
marriage, and that the recitals in the will were manifestations of a sore in<lb/>
 his heart which had remained unhealed to the last.<lb/>
</item>

<item>8. It was also argued that the dispositions in the will were unnatural<lb/>
 in that the appellant had been practically disinherited and his children<lb/>
 altogether ignored. This by itself cannot lead to any inference of undue<lb/>
 influence on the part of the first respondent. Having regard to the character<lb/>
 of the testator and his feelings in the matter it is not a matter for surprise<lb/>
 that he should have cut off the appellant with a small legacy. It must also be<lb/>
 mentioned that the net value of the assets as given in the Probate petition is<lb/>
 Rs.23,865-10-9, and if the other legacies and charges are deducted, what<lb/>
 was bequeathed to the first respondent cannot be said to be very<lb/>
 considerable. It also appears that at that time his salary was Rs.60/-per<lb/>
 mensem and that he had a number of children, whereas the appellant is<lb/>
 stated to have had a basic salary of Rs.250/-per mensem then.<lb/>
 Respondent 1, his wife and children have all along been dependents of the<lb/>
 testator, whereas the appellant had lived apart from him from 1920. And it<lb/>
 is not unnatural for the testator so to order the distribution of his estate as to<lb/>
 secure the continuance of the existing state of affairs. The terms of the will,<lb/>
 therefore, cannot be relied on as intrinsic evidence of undue influence, as<lb/>
 contended for by the appellant.<lb/>
</item>

<item>9. Then there is the evidence of Indira, the daughter of the testator,<lb/>
 which was taken on commission. She deposed that the testator had told her<lb/>
 that there were troubles in the house, that the elder son had objection to<lb/>
 stay with the younger one, &quot;because if they live together, there will be social<lb/>
 trouble regarding his daughter&apos;s marriage&quot;, and that he therefore wanted to<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 make a will She went on to add that the father subsequently wanted to alter<lb/>
 the will and sent for her repeatedly for discussions, but that she generally<lb/>
 excused herself, because she did not like to intervene in the matter, and<lb/>
 that on those occasions, he told her, &quot;At present this will stand, but I want to<lb/>
 modify it in future&quot;.<lb/>
</item>

<item>Indira also deposed that the first respondent and his wife used to tell the<lb/>
 testator that there was no change in the conduct of the appellant, that he<lb/>
 was extravagant in his habits and incurred debts, and that he had taken<lb/>
 away some articles. We do not consider that it is safe to act on this<lb/>
 evidence. It is clear from Ex.1 that Indira and her husband had taken sides<lb/>
 with the appellant as against the first respondent, and wrote to him that in<lb/>
 spite of the will the appellant &quot;should have his share as early as possible in<lb/>
 order to avoid further complication&quot;, though it may be noted that they<lb/>
 insisted on their rights under the will. Stripped of all its embellishments, the<lb/>
 evidence of Indira, if true, comes only to this that the first respondent told<lb/>
 his father that he could not live under the same roof with his brother, and<lb/>
 that in view of that attitude, the testator gave no share to the appellant in<lb/>
 the house. We are unable to see any undue influence in this. The first<lb/>
 respondent was entitled to put forward his views in the matter, and so long<lb/>
 as the ultimate decision lay with the testator and his mental capacity was<lb/>
 unimpaired, there can be no question of undue influence.<lb/>
</item>

<item>10. It is elementary law that it is not every influence which is<lb/>
 brought to bear on a testator that can be characterised as &quot;undue&quot;. It is<lb/>
 open to a person to plead his case before the testator and to persuade him<lb/>
 to make a disposition in his favour. And if the testator retains his mental<lb/>
 capacity, and there is no element of fraud or coercion-it has often been<lb/>
 observed that undue influence may in the last analysis be brought under<lb/>
 one or the other of these two categories-the will cannot be attacked on the<lb/>
 ground of undue influence. The law was thus stated by Lord Penzance in<lb/>
 &apos;Hall Vs. Hall (1868) 1 P and D 481 at p.482 (C):<lb/>
 &quot;But all influences are not unlawful. Persuasion, appeals to<lb/>
 the affections or ties of kindred, to a sentiment of gratitude for past<lb/>
 services, or pity for future destitution, or the like,-these are all<lb/>
 legitimate and may be fairly pressed on a testator. On the other hand,<lb/>
 pressure of whatever character, whether acting on the fears or the<lb/>
 hopes, if so exerted as to overpower the volition without convincing<lb/>
 the judgment, is a species of restraint under which no valid will can be<lb/>
 made. Importunity or threats, such as the testator has the courage to<lb/>
 resist, moral command asserted and yielded to for the sake of peace<lb/>
 and quiet, or of escaping from distress of mind or social discomfort,-<lb/>
these, if carried to a degree in which the free play of the testator&apos;s<lb/>
 judgment, discretion, or wishes is overborne, will constitute undue<lb/>
 influence, though no force is either used or threatened. In a word, a<lb/>
 testator may be led, but not driven; and his will must be the offspring<lb/>
 of his own volition, and not the record of some one else&apos;s.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>Section 61 of the Indian Succession Act (Act 39 of 1925) enacts that,<lb/>
 &quot;A will or any part of a will, the making of which has been<lb/>
 caused by fraud or coercion, or by such importunity as takes away<lb/>
 the free agency of the testator, is void.&quot;<lb/>
 Illustration (vii) to the section is very instructive, and is as follows:<lb/>
 &quot;A, being in such a state of health as to be capable of<lb/>
 exercising his own judgment and volition, B uses urgent intercession<lb/>
 and persuasion with him to induce him to make a will of a certain<lb/>
 purport. A, in consequence of the intercession and persuasion, but in<lb/>
 the free exercise of his judgment and volition, makes his will in the<lb/>
 manner recommended by B. The will is not rendered invalid by the<lb/>
 intercession and persuasion of B.&quot;<lb/>

<item>(g) 2013 (6) CTC 471 (Madras High Court) (K.Karthik s/o. K.Kalaivanan and another Vs.<lb/>
 Jayanthi Iyengar and others):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;5. The cause of action for filing the present Application is as follows:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;6. I submit that during trial in the abovesaid Suit, the Applicants<lb/>
 herein came to know that after the death of Mr. P.D. Rajagopalan, the<lb/>
 First Respondent herein (Petitioner in the above O.P.No. 842 of 2012)<lb/>
 has forged Mr.P.D.Rajagopalan&apos;s signature and has created a Will, as if<lb/>
 he has bequeathed the abovesaid property in her favour.<lb/>
</item>

<item>7. On enquiries I have come to know that the First Respondent<lb/>
 herein filed the above O.P.No. 842 of 2012 seeking grant of Letters of<lb/>
 Administration with respect of a Will, alleged to have been executed by<lb/>
 the abovesaid P.D. Rejagopalan on 16.6.2000 in favour bequeathing the<lb/>
 abovesaid property in her favour.<lb/>
</item>

<item>8. I submit that the Will dated 16.6.2000 in respect of which the<lb/>
 First Respondent herein has applied for Letters of Administration, is not a<lb/>
 genuine one. I submit that the said Will dated 16.6.2000 is a forged one.<lb/>
 Therefore, the above O.P.No. 842 of 2012 is liable to be dismissed.<lb/>
</item>

<item>9. I submit that under the facts and circumstances stated above,<lb/>
 being absolute owners of the property covered under the alleged Will, the<lb/>
 Applicants herein are proper and necessary parties to the above<lb/>
 O.P.No.842 of 2012. It is therefore just, proper and necessary that the<lb/>
 Applicants herein be impleaded as Respondents Nos. 5 &amp; 6 in the above<lb/>
 O.P.No. 842 of 2012 as otherwise they will be put to irreparable loss and<lb/>
 injury.&quot;<lb/>
 Therefore, the present Application is filed praying to implead the Petitioner in the<lb/>
 Original Petition.<lb/>
</item>

<item>6. This is resisted by the respondent herein and the Petitioner in the<lb/>
 Original Petition, who has filed a detailed Counter, which of course, upto para-18<lb/>
 is not relevant for repudiating the claim on facts which is not required for the<lb/>
 disposal of the present Application. Para-19 of the Counter Affidavit is relied<lb/>
 upon by K.V. Babu, learned Counsel for the Respondent that no caveatable<lb/>
 interest is there for the impleading Applicants and, therefore, the Application has<lb/>
 to be rejected. Learned Counsel for the Respondent relied upon the decision of<lb/>
 the Supreme Court in Kanwarjit Singh Dhillon Vs. Hardayal Singh Dhillon &amp;<lb/>
 Others, 2008(1)CTC 80 (SC) : 2007(11)SCC 357, wherein the Hon&apos;ble Supreme<lb/>
 Court, while relying upon its earlier decision in Chiranjilal Shrilal Goenka Vs.<lb/>
 Jasjit Singh &amp; others, 1993 (2) SCR 454, and pleaded that in a probate, the Court<lb/>
 in exercise of jurisdiction under the Indian Succession Act is not competent to<lb/>
 determine the question of title to the Suit property and for other issues relating to<lb/>
 title. In the said decision, the Supreme Court has held as follows:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;11. In Chramyilal Shrilal Goenka Vs. Jasjit Singh and others,<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 1993 (2) SCC 507, this Court while upholding the above views and<lb/>
 following the earlier decisions of this Court as well as of other High Courts<lb/>
 in India observed in Paragraph 15 at page 515 which runs as under:<lb/>
 &quot;In Ishwardeo Narain Singh Vs. Smt.Kanta Devi (AIR 1954<lb/>
 SC 280) this Court held that the Court of probate is only<lb/>
 concerned with the question as to whether the document put<lb/>
 forward as the last Will and testament of a deceased person was<lb/>
 duly executed and attested in accordance with law and whether at<lb/>
 the time of such execution the testator had sound disposing mind.<lb/>
 The question whether a particular bequest is good or bad is not<lb/>
 within the purview of the Probate Court. Therefore, the only issue<lb/>
 in a Probate proceeding relates to the genuineness and due<lb/>
 execution of the Will and the Court itself is under duty to determine<lb/>
 it and perverse the original Will in its custody. The Succession Act<lb/>
 is a self-contained code insofar as the question of making an<lb/>
 Application for probate, grant or refusal of probate or an Appeal<lb/>
 carried against the decision of the Probate Court. This is clearly<lb/>
 manifested in the fascicule of the provisions of the Act. The<lb/>
 Probate proceedings shall be conducted by the Probate Court in<lb/>
 the manner prescribed in the Act and in no other ways. The grant<lb/>
 of probate with a copy of the Will annexed establishes conclusively<lb/>
 as to the appointment of the Executor and the valid execution of<lb/>
 the Will. Thus, it does no more than establish the factum of the<lb/>
 Will and the legal character of the Executor. Probate Court does<lb/>
 not decide any question of title or of the existence of the property<lb/>
 itself.&quot; &quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>(h) 2005 (1) LW 455 (Division Bench of Madras High Court) (Janaki Devi Vs. R.Vasanthi<lb/>
 and others):<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;27. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that Order 25 Rule 9<lb/>
 of Madras High Court Original Side Rules, is not complied with in this case, and<lb/>
 the non explanation of the delay, with materials should be construed as one of the<lb/>
 unavoidable circumstances, to cast shadow upon the Will, to eclipse the same.<lb/>
 Order 25 Rule 9 of the Madras High Court Original Side Rules says:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;In any case where probate or letters of administration is for first<lb/>
 time applied for after the lapse of three years from the death of the<lb/>
 deceased, the reason for the delay shall be explained in the petition.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>In the case on hand, it cannot be said, that this requirement is not<lb/>
 complied with, since paragraph-7 of the petition gives some explanation, for the<lb/>
 delay. The submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant, that during<lb/>
 the relevant period viz., from September 1984 to June 1989, the plaintiff/first<lb/>
 respondent could not have been in bed rest, since she was attending the Court in<lb/>
 the connected proceedings, fails to inspire us, to reject the explanation offered,<lb/>
 considering the fact that the petitioner had proclaimed and propounded the Will,<lb/>
 as and when occasion had arisen for her to do so. Admittedly, this petition or<lb/>
 plaint has been filed, after three years from the date of death of the testator, since<lb/>
 she died on 22.6.1981. If the plaintiff had been silent, not even whispering about<lb/>
 the Will, when occasion had arisen, then the inaction on the part of the plaintiff for<lb/>
 more than three years in not taking the steps, to probate the Will, could be viewed<lb/>
 with suspicion. In this case, admittedly, on the basis of the Will, probably thinking<lb/>
 that the Will need not be probated, a suit has been filed by the petitioner, before<lb/>
 the District Munsif Court, Villupruam against one Kannan, who was the tenant of<lb/>
 the property, for certain reliefs and in those proceedings, this Will was exhibited<lb/>
 as Ex.A1, thereby showing, the plaintiff had taken action, immediately, to<lb/>
 preserve the property, over which right has been given, indicating that the plaintiff<lb/>
 had no intention, to suppress the Will or conceal the same, from the eyes of<lb/>
 others. True, ultimately the suit has been dismissed on the ground, that the Will<lb/>
 could not be acted upon, as it was not probated and that is why the present case<lb/>
 is filed, though not immediately, but within the reasonable time, explaining the<lb/>
 delay. As held by the Division Bench of this Court, in Ammu Balachandran&apos;s case<lb/>
 (Ammu Balachandran Vs. O.T.Joseph --AIR 1996 Madras 442), if the execution<lb/>
 of the Will is proved, the delay in taking steps to probate the Will, will not loom<lb/>
 large, since Order 25 Rule 9 of Madras High Court Original Side Rules has not<lb/>
 prescribed any period of limitation and probably, it aims to give explanation alone.<lb/>
 .. ..<lb/>
</item>

<item>29. For the reasons which we are going to assign hereunder, the<lb/>
 execution of the Will is duly proved and therefore, on the ground of the delay in<lb/>
 filing the petition for probate alone or letters of administration, entertaining<lb/>
 indelible suspicion, a doubt could not be entertained, as if the Will was fabricated<lb/>
 by the plaintiff. Hence, this defence deserves rejection.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(i) 2014 (15) SCC 578 (Ved Mitra Verma Vs. Dharam Deo Verma):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;12. It is not a fact that the will and its contents had come to light for the<lb/>
 first time after 17 years when the application was filed before the learned trial<lb/>
 court by the present respondent. From the materials on record before the High<lb/>
 Court, it is evident that there was a family dispute between the parties which was<lb/>
 resolved by the local Durbar and the proceedings thereof were recorded in Ext.10.<lb/>
 In the said document, there is a reference to the &quot;deed of agreement&quot; made by<lb/>
 the deceased father in 1974 on the basis of which the appellant was found<lb/>
 entitled to be in possession of the property in question. The aforesaid &quot;deed of<lb/>
 agreement&quot; is, in fact, the will dated 20-11-1974.<lb/>
 ... ....<lb/>
</item>

<item>14. All the alleged suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of<lb/>
 the will being capable of being understood in the manner indicated above and the<lb/>
 requirement of Section 69 of the Evidence Act, 1872 having been satisfied by the<lb/>
 evidence of PW 3, we find that in the present case, the findings and conclusions<lb/>
 recorded by the High Court would not call for any interference. Consequently, and<lb/>
 for the reasons aforesaid, we dismiss the appeal leaving the parties to bear their<lb/>
 own costs.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>(j) 2014 (2) CTC 199 (SC) = 2014 (16) SCC 125 (Surjit Kaur Gill Vs. Adarsh Karu Gill):<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;10. With respect to these submissions, Mr.Divan pointed out that in<lb/>
 fact there is a clear writing of Respondent 1 herein executed on 12-2-1991<lb/>
 which clearly states, amongst others, in Para (d) that she will not claim any<lb/>
 tenancy right or charge on the abovereferred property. In Para (b) of that writing<lb/>
 she agreed to render the accounts with respect to the rental income received<lb/>
 from 1-1-1980 to 30-11-1990. In Para (c) of that writing she states that with<lb/>
 respect to the two mortgages redeemed in her name, she will not claim any<lb/>
 charge as the amounts paid for redeeming the said mortgages were paid from<lb/>
 the estate of Smt.Abnash Kaur. Mr.Divan states that after executing this writing,<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 the disputes between the parties were supposed to get settled, but then<lb/>
 unfortunately it did not happen. Respondent 1 started construction on the<lb/>
 particular property in her own right. This having happened in 1992, the original<lb/>
 plaintiff was constrained to file the suit for the partition of the property belonging<lb/>
 to Smt.Abnash Kaur. Smt.Abnash Kaur having made a will about her property,<lb/>
 the original plaintiff had to see to it as the administrator of the will that the<lb/>
 property is distributed in accordance therewith. This being the position, in his<lb/>
 submission it is Article 58 which is the relevant article for all these prayers, which<lb/>
 provides for a period of three years when the right to sue first accrues. In the<lb/>
 present case, it will be when the dispute arose because of the conduct of<lb/>
 Respondent 1 herein. The issue of limitation is always a mixed question of facts<lb/>
 and law, and therefore, it could not be held that no case was made out for<lb/>
 proceeding for a trial. Mr.C.A.Sundaram submitted that Respondent 1 disputed<lb/>
 the writing dated 12-2-1991 and it had to be forensically tested. This submission<lb/>
 all the more justifies that the trial had to proceed. For deciding an application<lb/>
 under Order 7 Rule 11, one has to look at the plaint and decide whether it<lb/>
 deserved to be rejected on the ground raised. In our view, the view taken by the<lb/>
 Division Bench is clearly erroneous. The appeal is therefore allowed and the<lb/>
 judgment and order of the Division Bench is set aside. The application made<lb/>
 under Order 7 Rule 11 moved by Respondent 1 herein will stand rejected. We<lb/>
 may however clarify that all the observations herein are only for the purpose of<lb/>
 deciding this appeal.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(k) 2010 (2) SCC 162 (Suresh Kumar Bansal Vs. Krishna Bansal):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;14. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going<lb/>
 through the impugned order as well as the application for substitution of the<lb/>
 appellant on the basis of the will alleged to have been executed by the deceased<lb/>
 plaintiff, we are of the view that the impugned order of the High Court is liable to<lb/>
 be interfered with and the application for impleadment filed at the instance of the<lb/>
 appellant on the basis of the will alleged to have been executed by the deceased<lb/>
 plaintiff must be allowed and the appellant must be impleaded in the suit along<lb/>
 with the natural heirs and legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff, subject to<lb/>
 grant of probate by a competent court of law.<lb/>
</item>

<item>15. It is true that in the impugned order, the High Court has made it clear<lb/>
 that the finding regarding genuineness of the will was made only for the purpose<lb/>
 of deciding the application for impleadment filed at the instance of the appellant.<lb/>
 But, in our view, if at this stage, the appellant is not permitted to be impleaded and<lb/>
 in the event an order of eviction is passed ultimately against the respondent<lb/>
 tenant, the tenants will be evicted by the natural heirs and legal representatives of<lb/>
 the deceased plaintiff who thereby shall take possession of the suit premises, but<lb/>
 if ultimately the probate of the alleged will of the deceased plaintiff is granted by<lb/>
 the competent court of law, the suit property would devolve on the appellant but<lb/>
 not on the natural heirs and legal representative of the deceased. Therefore, in<lb/>
 the event of grant of probate in favour of the appellant, he has to take legal<lb/>
 proceeding against the natural heirs and legal representatives of the deceased<lb/>
 plaintiff for recovery of possession of the suit premises from them which would<lb/>
 involve not only huge expenses but also considerable time would be spent to get<lb/>
 the suit premises recovered from the natural heirs and legal representatives of the<lb/>
 deceased plaintiff.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>17. That apart, since the question of genuineness of the will cannot be<lb/>
 conclusively gone into by the court in a proceeding for substitution in a pending<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 eviction suit and in view of the fact that an application was made at the instance of<lb/>
 the appellant for impleadment as a legal representative of the deceased on the<lb/>
 basis of the will which is yet to be probated, in our view, the best course open to<lb/>
 the court is to allow impleadment of the appellant in the eviction proceeding,<lb/>
 thereby permitting him to proceed with the eviction suit along with natural heirs<lb/>
 and legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff, but in case the decree is to be<lb/>
 passed for eviction of the tenant from the suit premises such eviction decree shall<lb/>
 be subject to the grant of probate of the will alleged to have been executed by the<lb/>
 deceased plaintiff.<lb/>
</item>

<item>18. At the same time, it is clear that in case the will of the deceased<lb/>
 plaintiff is found not to be genuine and probate is not granted, the court shall<lb/>
 proceed to grant the eviction decree in favour of Respondent 1 and not in favour<lb/>
 of the appellant. It is well settled that in the event, the will is found to be genuine<lb/>
 and probate is granted, only the appellant would be entitled to get an order of<lb/>
 eviction of the respondent tenants from the suit premises excluding the claim of<lb/>
 the natural heirs and legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff.<lb/>
</item>

<item>19. The Code of Civil Procedure enjoins various provisions only for the<lb/>
 purpose of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings and for adjudicating of related<lb/>
 disputes in the same proceedings, the parties cannot be driven to different courts<lb/>
 or to institute different proceedings touching on different facets of the same major<lb/>
 issue. Such a course of action will result in conflicting judgments and instead of<lb/>
 resolving the disputes, they would end up in creation of confusion and conflict.<lb/>
</item>

<item>20. It is now well settled that determination of the question as to who is<lb/>
 the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff or defendant under Order 22<lb/>
 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure is only for the purpose of bringing legal<lb/>
 representatives on record for the conducting of those legal proceedings only and<lb/>
 does not operate as res judicata and the inter se dispute between the rival legal<lb/>
 representatives has to be independently tried and decided in probate proceedings.<lb/>
 If this is allowed to be carried on for a decision of an eviction suit or other allied<lb/>
 suits, the suits would be delayed, by which only the tenants will be benefited.<lb/>
</item>

<item>21. In order to shorten the litigation and to consider the rival claims of the<lb/>
 parties, in our view, the proper course to follow is to bring all the heirs and legal<lb/>
 representatives of the deceased plaintiff on record including the legal<lb/>
 representatives who are claiming on the basis of the will of the deceased plaintiff<lb/>
 so that all the legal representatives, namely, the appellant and the natural heirs<lb/>
 and legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff can represent the estate of the<lb/>
 deceased for the ultimate benefit of the real legal representatives. If this process<lb/>
 is followed, this would also avoid delay in disposal of the suit.<lb/>
</item>

<item>22. In view of our discussions made hereinabove, we are, therefore, of<lb/>
 the view that the High Court as well as the trial court were not at all justified in<lb/>
 rejecting the application for impleadment filed at the instance of the appellant<lb/>
 based on the alleged will of the deceased plaintiff at this stage of the proceedings.<lb/>
</item>

<item>23. Before parting with this judgment, it is necessary to consider the<lb/>
 decision of this Court in Jaladi Suguna Vs. Satya Sai Central Trust (2008 (8) SCC<lb/>
 521) cited by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant. In Jaladi Suguna, this<lb/>
 Court held that the intestate heir (husband) and the testamentary legatees (nieces<lb/>
 and nephews), seeking impleadment as the heirs of the deceased respondent in<lb/>
 an appeal have to be brought on record before the court can proceed further in<lb/>
 the appeal. Furthermore, in that decision it was also held that a legatee under a<lb/>
 will, who intends to represent the estate of the deceased testator, being an<lb/>
 intermeddler with the estate of the deceased testator, will be a legal<lb/>
 representative.<lb/>
</item>

<item>24. In view of the aforesaid discussions and in view of the decision in<lb/>
 Jaladi Suguna, we are also of the view that in an eviction proceeding, when a<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 legatee under a will intends to represent the interest of the estate of the deceased<lb/>
 testator, he will be a legal representative within the meaning of Section 2(11) of<lb/>
 the Code of Civil Procedure, for which it is not necessary in an eviction suit to<lb/>
 decide whether the will on the basis of which substitution is sought for, is a<lb/>
 suspicious one or that the parties must send the case back to the Probate Court<lb/>
 for a decision whether the will was genuine or not.<lb/>
</item>

<item>25. For the reasons aforesaid, we are of the view that the High Court as<lb/>
 well as the trial court had acted illegally and with material irregularity in the<lb/>
 exercise of their jurisdiction in not impleading not only the natural heirs and legal<lb/>
 representatives of the deceased plaintiff but also the appellant who is claiming his<lb/>
 impleadment on the basis of an alleged will of the deceased plaintiff.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(l) 2012 (6) SCC 430 (A.Shanmugam Vs. Ariya Kshatriya Rajakula Vamsathu Madalaya<lb/>
 Nandhavana Paripalanai Sangam):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;Entire journey of a Judge is to discern the truth<lb/>
 24. The entire journey of a Judge is to discern the truth from the<lb/>
 pleadings, documents and arguments of the parties. Truth is the basis of the<lb/>
 justice delivery system. This Court in Dalip Singh Vs. State of U.P. (2010 (2) SCC<lb/>
 114 : 2010 (1) SCC (Civ) 324) observed that: (SCC p.116, para 1)<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;1. … Truth constituted an integral part of the justice delivery<lb/>
 system which was in vogue in the pre-Independence era and the people<lb/>
 used to feel proud to tell the truth in the courts irrespective of the<lb/>
 consequences. However, post-Independence period has seen drastic<lb/>
 changes in our value system.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>.. ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>26. As stated in the preceding paragraphs, the pleadings are the<lb/>
 foundation of litigation but experience reveals that sufficient attention is not paid<lb/>
 to the pleadings and documents by the judicial officers before dealing with the<lb/>
 case. It is the bounden duty and obligation of the parties to investigate and satisfy<lb/>
 themselves as to the correctness and the authenticity of the matter pleaded.<lb/>
</item>

<p>27. The pleadings must set forth sufficient factual details to the extent<lb/>
 that it reduces the ability to put forward a false or exaggerated claim or defence.<lb/>
 The pleadings must inspire confidence and credibility. If false averments, evasive<lb/>
 denials or false denials are introduced, then the court must carefully look into it<lb/>
 while deciding a case and insist that those who approach the court must<lb/>
 approach it with clean hands.<lb/>
</p>

<item>28. It is imperative that the Judges must have complete grip of the facts<lb/>
 before they start dealing with the case. That would avoid unnecessary delay in<lb/>
 disposal of the cases.<lb/>
</item>

<item>29. Ensuring discovery and production of documents and a proper<lb/>
 admission/denial is imperative for deciding civil cases in a proper perspective. In<lb/>
 relevant cases, the courts should encourage interrogatories to be administered.<lb/>
 Framing of issues<lb/>
</item>

<item>30. Framing of issues is a very important stage of a civil trial. It is<lb/>
 imperative for a Judge to critically examine the pleadings of the parties before<lb/>
 framing of issues. Rule 2 of Order 10 CPC enables the court, in its search for the<lb/>
 truth, to go to the core of the matter and narrow down, or even eliminate the<lb/>
 controversy. Rule 2 of Order 10 reads as under:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;2. Oral examination of party, or companion of party.-(1) At the first<lb/>
 hearing of the suit, the court-<lb/>
</item>

<item>(a) shall, with a view to elucidating matters in controversy in the<lb/>
 suit, examine orally such of the parties to the suit appearing in person or<lb/>
 present in court, as it deems fit; and<lb/>
</item>

<item>(b) may orally examine any person, able to answer any material<lb/>
 question relating to the suit, by whom any party appearing in person or<lb/>
 present in court or his pleader is accompanied.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(2)-(3) *<lb/>
 *<lb/>
 * &quot;<lb/>
 It is a useful procedural device and must be regularly pressed into service.<lb/>
 .. ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>32. If issues are properly framed, the controversy in the case can be<lb/>
 clearly focused and documents can be properly appreciated in that light. The<lb/>
 relevant evidence can also be carefully examined. Careful framing of issues also<lb/>
 helps in proper examination and cross-examination of the witnesses and final<lb/>
 arguments in the case.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>43. On the facts of the present case, the following principles emerge:<lb/>
</item>

<item>43.1. It is the bounden duty of the court to uphold the truth and do justice.<lb/>
</item>

<item>43.2. Every litigant is expected to state truth before the law court whether<lb/>
 it is pleadings, affidavits or evidence. Dishonest and unscrupulous litigants have<lb/>
 no place in law courts.<lb/>
</item>

<item>43.3. The ultimate object of the judicial proceedings is to discern the truth<lb/>
 and do justice. It is imperative that pleadings and all other presentations before<lb/>
 the court should be truthful.<lb/>
</item>

<item>43.4. Once the court discovers falsehood, concealment, distortion,<lb/>
 obstruction or confusion in pleadings and documents, the court should in addition<lb/>
 to full restitution impose appropriate costs. The court must ensure that there is no<lb/>
 incentive for wrongdoer in the temple of justice. Truth is the foundation of justice<lb/>
 and it has to be the common endeavour of all to uphold the truth and no one<lb/>
 should be permitted to pollute the stream of justice.<lb/>
</item>

<item>43.5. It is the bounden obligation of the court to neutralise any unjust<lb/>
 and/or undeserved benefit or advantage obtained by abusing the judicial process.<lb/>
</item>

<item>43.6. The watchman, caretaker or a servant employed to look after the<lb/>
 property can never acquire interest in the property irrespective of his long<lb/>
 possession. The watchman, caretaker or a servant is under an obligation to hand<lb/>
 over the possession forthwith on demand. According to the principles of justice,<lb/>
 equity and good conscience, the courts are not justified in protecting the<lb/>
 possession of a watchman, caretaker or servant who was only allowed to live into<lb/>
 the premises to look after the same.<lb/>
</item>

<item>43.7. The watchman, caretaker or agent holds the property of the<lb/>
 principal only on behalf of the principal. He acquires no right or interest<lb/>
 whatsoever in such property irrespective of his long stay or possession.<lb/>
</item>

<item>43.8. The protection of the court can be granted or extended to the<lb/>
 person who has a valid subsisting rent agreement, lease agreement or licence<lb/>
 agreement in his favour.&quot;<lb/>

<p>(m) 2008 (14) SCC 754 (Babu Singh Vs. Ram Sahai):<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;16. Section 69 of the Act (Evidence Act) reads, thus:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;69. Proof where no attesting witness found.-If no such attesting<lb/>
 witness can be found, or if the document purports to have been executed<lb/>
 in the United Kingdom, it must be proved that the attestation of one<lb/>
 attesting witness at least is in his handwriting, and that the signature of<lb/>
 the person executing the document is in the handwriting of that person.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
</item>

<item>17. It would apply, inter alia, in a case where the attesting witness is<lb/>
 either dead or out of the jurisdiction of the court or kept out of the way by the<lb/>
 adverse party or cannot be traced despite diligent search. Only in that event, the<lb/>
 will may be proved in the manner indicated in Section 69 i.e. by examining<lb/>
 witnesses who were able to prove the handwriting of the testator or executant.<lb/>
 The burden of proof then may be shifted to others.<lb/>
</item>

<item>18. Whereas, however, a will ordinarily must be proved keeping in view<lb/>
 the provisions of Section 63 of the Succession Act and Section 68 of the Act, in<lb/>
 the event the ingredients thereof, as noticed hereinbefore, are brought on record,<lb/>
 strict proof of execution and attestation stands relaxed. However, signature and<lb/>
 handwriting, as contemplated in Section 69, must be proved.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(n) 2012 (8) MLJ 701 (Madras High Court) (R.Sarala Vs. K.S.Mohan):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;15. Per contra, Mr.R.Parthasarathy, learned counsel for the<lb/>
 respondents placed reliance upon Clause 37 of the Letters Patent, where this<lb/>
 court has been given power to frame rules for regulating its own procedure and<lb/>
 in respect of the civil procedure. Insofar as the testamentary proceedings are<lb/>
 concerned, it is governed by Order 25 of the O.S. Rules. Order 25 Rule 9 though<lb/>
 states that if a petition for letters of administration was presented before this<lb/>
 court after a lapse of three years from the date of the death of the deceased, the<lb/>
 reason for the delay has to be explained in the petition. Therefore, he argued that<lb/>
 Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act read with Article 137 of the Limitation<lb/>
 Act will not apply as the petition has been presented under the rules framed<lb/>
 under the Letters Patent.<lb/>
</item>

<p>16. In this context, he placed reliance upon a judgment of the Supreme<lb/>
 Court in Iridium India Telecom Ltd. Vs. Motorola Inc., AIR 2005 SC 514 : 2005 (2)<lb/>
 SCC 145 : 2005 (2) MLJ 97 and referred to the following passages found in<lb/>
 paragraphs 28, 29, 30 and 44, which reads as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;28. It appears to us that this was the real reason why a<lb/>
 distinction was drawn between the proceedings in original jurisdiction<lb/>
 before the chartered High Courts and those in other courts. For historical<lb/>
 reasons this distinction was maintained right from the time the Letters<lb/>
 Patent was issued, and has not been disturbed by the Code of Civil<lb/>
 Procedure, 1908, despite the amendments made in CPC from 1976 to<lb/>
 2002.<lb/>
</item>

<item>29. The learned counsel for the appellant referred to the speech<lb/>
 of the Law Member while introducing the Code of Civil Procedure Bill,<lb/>
 1907, which ultimately resulted in the Code of 1908. Our attention was<lb/>
 drawn to the proceedings of the Council of the Governor General of<lb/>
 India (published in the Gazette of India dated 7-9-1907, pp. 134 to 143).<lb/>
 The only relevant portion is the portion at p. 141 where the Law Member,<lb/>
 who introduced the Bill, referring to clauses 145 and 148 to 150<lb/>
 contained in Parts X and XI of the Bill, explained the need as under:<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;I have already explained the nature of the rule-making<lb/>
 power which is dealt with in Part X of the Bill and in regard to<lb/>
 Part XI (miscellaneous), I would only call attention to Clauses<lb/>
 145 and 148 to 150, which widen the discretion of Courts. They<lb/>
 confer powers to enlarge time and to amend written<lb/>
 proceedings, and they recognise the inherent powers of the<lb/>
 Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of<lb/>
 justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court. In these<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 ways greater elasticity will, it is hoped, be of benefit.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>30. Far from advancing the case of the appellant, the speech of<lb/>
 the Law Member, while introducing the Bill, suggests that it was thought<lb/>
 necessary that the inherent powers of the Court to make appropriate<lb/>
 orders, as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse<lb/>
 of the process of the Court, was retained for the purpose of greater<lb/>
 elasticity.<lb/>
</item>

<item>44. The Full Bench of the High Court of Calcutta in<lb/>
 Manickchand Durgaprasad Vs. Pratabmull Rameswar -AIR 1961<lb/>
 Calcutta 483, had occasion to consider this very contention with regard<lb/>
 to Clause 37 of the Letters Patent and observed: (AIR p. 489, para 13)<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;The restriction upon the power of the Court as<lb/>
 contained in the proviso to Clause 37 of the Letters Patent is<lb/>
 that the rules framed under that clause should, &quot;as far as<lb/>
 possible&quot; be in conformity with the provisions of the Code of<lb/>
 Civil Procedure. This restriction as the phrase &quot;as far as<lb/>
 possible&quot; indicates is merely directory. The provisions of the<lb/>
 Code of Civil Procedure are intended for the purpose of<lb/>
 guidance of this Court in framing rules under Clause 37 of the<lb/>
 Letters Patent. Consequently, if any rule framed by the High<lb/>
 Court under Clause 37 be inconsistent with or confers any<lb/>
 additional power besides what is granted by the Code of Civil<lb/>
 Procedure, the rule framed under Clause 37 will prevail over the<lb/>
 corresponding provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>This we think is the correct view to be taken in interpreting the words &quot;as<lb/>
 far as possible&quot; in Clause 37 of the Letters Patent. This interpretation<lb/>
 would be consistent with the amplitude of the words used in Section 129<lb/>
 CPC by which the High Court is empowered to make rules &quot;not<lb/>
 inconsistent with the Letters Patent to regulate its own procedure in the<lb/>
 exercise of its original jurisdiction as it shall think fit&quot;.<lb/>
</item>

<item>In view of the above, he contended that the argument based upon limitation will<lb/>
 have no application to the case on hand.<lb/>
</item>

<item>17. He also stated that for the purpose of rejecting a petition in terms of<lb/>
 the power under Order 7 Rule 11(d), the Courts are slow in applying the said<lb/>
 provisions for rejecting the petition on the ground of limitation as it is the question<lb/>
 involved in both question of law and facts. For this purpose, he referred to a<lb/>
 judgment of the Supreme Court in Popat and Kotecha Property Vs. State Bank<lb/>
 of India Staff Assn., reported in 2005 (7) SCC 510 and a reference was made to<lb/>
 the following passage found in paragraph 25, which reads as follows :<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;25. When the averments in the plaint are considered in the<lb/>
 background of the principles set out in Sopan Sukhdeo Sable and others<lb/>
 Vs. Assistant Charity Commissioner and others (supra) the inevitable<lb/>
 conclusion is that the Division Bench was not right in holding that Order<lb/>
 7 Rule 11 CPC was applicable to the facts of the case. Diverse claims<lb/>
 were made and the Division Bench was wrong in proceeding with the<lb/>
 assumption that only the non-execution of lease deed was the basic<lb/>
 issue. Even if it is accepted that the other claims were relatable to it they<lb/>
 have independent existence. Whether the collection of amounts by the<lb/>
 respondent was for a period beyond 51 years needs evidence to be<lb/>
 adduced. It is not a case where the suit from statement in the plaint can<lb/>
 be said to be barred by law. The statement in the plaint without addition<lb/>
 or subtraction must show that it is barred by any law to attract<lb/>
 application of Order 7 Rule 11. This is not so in the present case.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>In the light of the above, he sought for dismissal of the two applications.<lb/>
 He further contended that it is only when a citation is issued on the original<lb/>
 petition, the question as to whether it could be tried as a petition for letters of<lb/>
 administration or to be converted into T.O.S., has to be considered.<lb/>
</item>

<item>18.The stand taken by the respondents is well founded. This court do not<lb/>
 incline to accept the contentions of the applicants in rejecting the O.P. even<lb/>
 before the matter could be taken up for appropriate consideration after due<lb/>
 notice to the respondents. Hence both applications will stand dismissed. No<lb/>
 costs. Post the O.P. before the learned Master for compliance regarding<lb/>
 service.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(o) AIR 1989 Madras 111 (Division Bench of Madras High Court) (Philo Peter and another<lb/>
 Vs. Divyanathan and others):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;3. Before considering the legal position emerging out of the above said<lb/>
 decisions, it is necessary to take notice of the relevant provisions in the<lb/>
 Succession Act, 1925. Section 266 of the Act provides that the District Judge<lb/>
 shall have, in relation to the granting of Probate and Letters of Administration, all<lb/>
 the powers and authority as are vested in him in relation to any civil suit. Section<lb/>
 288 lays down that the proceedings of the Court of the District Judge shall, save<lb/>
 as otherwise provided, be regulated, so far as the circumstances of the case<lb/>
 permit, by the Civil Procedure Code. A proceeding for Probate is initiated by the<lb/>
 presentation of an application in that behalf. What are the matters which should<lb/>
 be mentioned in such an application, is provided in Section 276. Similarly, a<lb/>
 proceeding for Letters of Administration is initiated by an application as provided<lb/>
 in Section 278. Section 295, which is the important section to be considered in<lb/>
 these proceedings, reads as follows --<lb/>
&quot;If any case before the District Judge in which there is<lb/>
 contention, the proceedings shall take, as nearly as may be, the form of<lb/>
 a regular suit, according to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure<lb/>
 1908 (5 of 1908), in which the petitioner for probate or letters of<lb/>
 administration, as the case may be, shall be the plaintiff, and the person<lb/>
 who has appeared to oppose the grant shall be the defendant.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>Section 299 provides for an appeal against every order made by the District<lb/>
 Judge.<lb/>
</item>

<item>4. Before construing the scope of Section 295 of the Succession Act, it is<lb/>
 better to refer to Order 25 of the Rules of the Original Side of the High Court,<lb/>
 Madras of 1956. It relates to the Testamentary and Intestate matters and<lb/>
 prescribes a procedure for granting Probate or Letters of Administration or<lb/>
 Succession Certificate. It contains separate provisions for contentious and non-<lb/>
contentious matters, relating to Wills. A Will may be proved either in common<lb/>
 form or in solemn form. In a case where the petitioner wants to prove the Will in<lb/>
 common form, it is enough if he files the Will along with the affidavit of attesting<lb/>
 witnesses. There is a provision for issuing public notice and also notice to the<lb/>
 interested parties. In such cases, anybody intending to oppose the issue of<lb/>
 Probate or Letters of Administration, may enter caveat under Rule 51 of Order 25<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 of the Original Side Rules and file an affidavit in support of the caveat under Rule<lb/>
 22 within eight days of entering the caveat stating the grounds of objection to the<lb/>
 grant of Probate or Letters of Administration. On such contest being made, the<lb/>
 proceeding, which was originated by the original petition, is converted into T.O.S.<lb/>
 In such a case, the plaintiff is bound to pay the required Court-fee as provided in<lb/>
 Article 11(k) of Schedule II of the Tamil Nadu Court-fees and Suits Valuation Act,<lb/>
 1955. Therefore, here, we find that there is a definite procedure prescribed for<lb/>
 converting the petition into a regular suit in which case, the liability for payment of<lb/>
 Court-fee is automatically attracted.<lb/>
</item>

<item>5. A difficulty was felt in construing the real scope of Section 295 of the<lb/>
 Succession Act. There is no difficulty, as long as the petition is not opposed by<lb/>
 any body. But when some body files a caveat and opposes the grant of probate<lb/>
 or Letters of Administration, the question arose whether it should be treated as a<lb/>
 suit and payment of Court-fee can be insisted on that basis. Two contentions<lb/>
 were raised in such matters. One was whether the proceedings can be treated as<lb/>
 a suit when it is not opposed by means of a caveat filed by the opposing parties<lb/>
 even though such opposing parties are respondents in the petition. In considering<lb/>
 this petition, Paul, J. in Nattorajan Vs. Parthasarathi, T.O.S. No.8 of 1972, dt. 06-<lb/>
02-1973, held as follows :-<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;In this case the petitioner himself chooses to prove the Will in<lb/>
 solemn form so that all interested persons may come in, watch and<lb/>
 participate in the proceedings when he can as well apply for probate on<lb/>
 proving the Will in common form to avoid contest. If the proviso to Clause<lb/>
</item>

<item>(2) is extended to cases where a petitioner applying for Probate or Letters<lb/>
 of Administration with a Will annexed wants to prove the Will in the<lb/>
 solemn form, it would encourage such persons to apply for Probate on<lb/>
 proving the Will in common form and avoid any contest in order to avoid<lb/>
 payment of ad valorem Court-fee. It is perhaps this aspect that has led to<lb/>
 no provision being made for payment of ad valorem Court-fee, in cases<lb/>
 coming under Rule 58 of Order 25 of the Original Side Rules. In these<lb/>
 circumstances, I am of the opinion that the petitioner need not pay ad<lb/>
 valorem Court-fee under the proviso to Sub-clause (2) of Article 11(k)(ii)<lb/>
 of Schedule II of the Court-fees and Suits Valuation Act.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>In Flarance Cheliah v. Soundararaj Peter, (1966) 2 Mad LJ 33,<lb/>
 Veeraswami J. as he then was, had to consider a similar position. In that case,<lb/>
 the petitioner herself had impleaded certain persons as respondents who are<lb/>
 likely to oppose the petitioner in the original petition. The learned Judge directed<lb/>
 the petition to be registered as a suit. Regarding the payment of Court-fee on<lb/>
 advalorem basis, the learned Judge held as follows : --<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;But the question is whether for the purpose of the proviso to<lb/>
 Article 11(k) of the Court-fees and Suits Valuation Act, there should be a<lb/>
 formal entry of caveat in order to attract the proviso, for; there is<lb/>
 contention and the application is therefore, to be tried as a suit Merely<lb/>
 because there is no formal entry of caveat, it does not appear that the<lb/>
 proviso is none the less applicable. It is true Article 18 of Schedule II<lb/>
 prescribes a separate Court-fee of Rs.10 on caveat. But merely because<lb/>
 a caveat does not bear stamp, it cannot be said that it is not a caveat,<lb/>
 any more than a plaint which bears less than the required Court-fee<lb/>
 ceases to be a plaint on that account. Where an application for probate<lb/>
 becomes contentious and is tried as a suit, it should be assumed for the<lb/>
 purpose of the proviso that a caveat is impliedly entered.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 This decision was followed by Sengottuvelan,J., in Krishna Iyer Vs.<lb/>
 Krishnamachari, 98 Mad.L.W. 80 : AIR 1985 Mad 346. The learned Judge, after<lb/>
 considering the other decisions, came to the following conclusion : --<lb/>
&quot;A reading of Schedule II, Article 11(k) of the Tamil Nadu Court-<lb/>
fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1955, clearly shows that in case of Wills<lb/>
 not disputed a fixed Court-fee is made payable and where the Wills are<lb/>
 disputed and the matter becomes contentious, a Court-fee of one half of<lb/>
 the ad valorem value is made payable in view of the procedure for such<lb/>
 matters as laid down by the Original Side Rules, 1956, by which if an<lb/>
 objection is taken by means of a caveat an enhanced Court-fees is made<lb/>
 payable. It is also seen that the enhanced Court-fee is made payable &apos;if a<lb/>
 caveat is entered and the application is registered as a suit. In cases<lb/>
 where the contesting respondents were already made parties, the<lb/>
 original petition is registered as a suit straightway as per Order 25, Rule<lb/>
 58 of the Original Side Rules, 1956. Perhaps if the respondents cited in<lb/>
 the original petition do not enter caveat, the petitioner may contend that<lb/>
 in view of the fact that there is no contest no enhanced Court-fee is<lb/>
 payable. But whenever there is contest, whether a caveat is entered or<lb/>
 not, according to the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Court-fees and Suits<lb/>
 Valuation Act, 1955, enhanced Court-fee is payable.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>6. It must be borne in mind that the decisions of Paul J. and<lb/>
 Sengottuvelan J. relate to the proceedings before the Original Side of this Court<lb/>
 and whereas the case decided by Veeraswami J. as he then was, arose out of<lb/>
 the proceedings before the District Judge. In so far as the proceedings relating to<lb/>
 Testamentary and Intestate matters covered under Order 25 of the Original Side<lb/>
 Rules, are concerned, we have already seen that there are&quot; specific provisions<lb/>
 providing for registering a petition as a suit as and when the application is<lb/>
 registered by means of a caveat. In such a case, the Payment of Court-fee is<lb/>
 automatically payable under the Court-fees Act as it stands. We are not<lb/>
 concerned with such matters in this case as the validity of such a procedure is<lb/>
 not being challenged before us. Therefore, we confine ourselves to the short<lb/>
 question relating to the original petitions filed before a District Judge under<lb/>
 Section 295 of the Succession Act only. Viewing from this angle, there cannot be<lb/>
 a real conflict between these decisions. But however, Sengottuvelan,J., has<lb/>
 chosen to differ from. the view expressed by Veeraswami,J., as he then was, in<lb/>
 so far as the payment of Court-fee is concerned, as it has become necessary to<lb/>
 resolve this apparent conflict. It is significant to note that the points now raised<lb/>
 before us to the effect that when there is no provision for registering a petition as<lb/>
 a suit by the District Judge in the Succession Act and as long as the petition is<lb/>
 not registered as a suit, no Court-fee is payable on ad valorem basis, have not<lb/>
 been taken in the earlier decisions.<lb/>
</item>

<item>7. Mr.R.Arunagirinathan, and Miss.M.B.Dominique, learned counsel<lb/>
 appearing for the revision petitioners in these revision petitions contended that<lb/>
 there is absolutely no provision in the Indian Succession Act to convert the<lb/>
 original petition as a suit whenever a caveat is entered by the opposite party.<lb/>
 According to them, what is provided under Section 295 of the Indian Succession<lb/>
 Act is the procedure to be followed when the proceedings become contested The<lb/>
 use of the words &apos;as nearly as may be&apos; in the said section itself indicates that the<lb/>
 proceeding in question was not considered to be exactly the same as a suit. It<lb/>
 was further contended that even if such an extreme interpretation could be given,<lb/>
 the proceeding cannot be treated as a suit in the absence of a caveat being filed<lb/>
 by the opposing party. Learned counsel submitted that the Court-fees Act being a<lb/>
 taxing statute, it has to be strictly construed as it has always been held that liberal<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 construction in favour of the litigant has to be adopted. Learned counsel have<lb/>
 relied on the decisions reported in Panzy Fernandes Vs. M.F.Queoros, AIR 1963<lb/>
 All. 153 (FB) and B.L.Banerjee Vs. Ganguly, AIR 1984 Cal. 16. The other<lb/>
 decisions may not be relevant for the purpose of this case.<lb/>
</item>

<item>8. Per contra, Mr.K.Srinivasan, who is appearing for the respondents in<lb/>
 C.R.R.P.2052 of 1987 and Mr.T.N.Vallinayagam, learned Government Pleader,<lb/>
 submitted that the language of Section 295 of the Indian Succession Act is clear<lb/>
 and mandatory that a petition filed for grant of Probate or Letters of<lb/>
 Administration should be treated as a suit as soon as it is opposed by a<lb/>
 contesting party either by filing a caveat or otherwise. The words found in Section<lb/>
 295 that the proceedings shall take the form of a regular suit and that the<lb/>
 petitioner in such a case is treated as the plaintiff and the persons, who have<lb/>
 appeared to oppose the grant shall be the defendants, denote that for all practical<lb/>
 purposes, the proceeding is nothing but a suit. According to them, if that is not<lb/>
 the intentions, such positive terms would not have been used in the Section.<lb/>
 Mr.Srinivasan, in support of his contentions, relied on the decisions reported in<lb/>
 Kalyanchand Lalchand Vs. Sitabai, ILR 38 Bom 309 : (AIR 1914 Bom 8),<lb/>
 Gangabai Vs. Jaikishindas, AIR 1938 Sind 36 (FB). In re Seethalakshmi, ILR<lb/>
 (1980) 2 Ker 348 and Bai Zabu Khima Vs. Amardas, AIR 1967 Guj. 214, wherein<lb/>
 it was held that contentious probate proceedings must take the form of a suit and<lb/>
 that they constitute a suit within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure.<lb/>
 Further, reliance was placed on the decision in Chotalal Vs. Bai Kabubai, (1898)<lb/>
 ILR 22 Bom. 261, wherein it was held that since the proceeding becomes<lb/>
 contentious, it must be treated as a plaint in a suit and that the suit is governed<lb/>
 as far as practicable by the procedure prescribed in the Civil Procedure Code. It<lb/>
 is a case relating to the Original Side of the Bombay High Court. Reliance was<lb/>
 also placed on the decision reported in Dr.Mrs.I.S.Bose Vs. Mrs.H.N.Judah, AIR<lb/>
 1958 All. 672, which held that contested applications for probate and Letters of<lb/>
 Administration have been classed along with first appeals for the matter of<lb/>
 taxation. We are presently going to see that the same High Court has taken a<lb/>
 different view in a later decision.<lb/>
</item>

<item>9. Learned Government Pleader relied on the decision of this Court in<lb/>
 Noor Mohammad Vs. Mohammad Kareem, AIR 1938 Mad. 502, in which it was<lb/>
 held as follows: --<lb/>
&quot;Under Section 295, where there is contention, the proceeding<lb/>
 must take the form of a regular suit according to the Civil P. C. and in<lb/>
 such a case, it is not open to the Court to refuse to make full enquiry and<lb/>
 to proceed to decide the matter in a summary fashion leaving his<lb/>
 decision subject to modification in a suit to be filed afterwards.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>They have also relied upon the view expressed by Veeraswami,J., as he then<lb/>
 was, and Sengottuvelan,J. in the above said case in support of their contentions,<lb/>
 they urged that whether there is caveat or not, it matters little because what is<lb/>
 intended under the Act is that once there is contest in such proceedings, it should<lb/>
 be treated as a suit. Therefore, according to them, even if there is no formal<lb/>
 caveat, it is enough if the contesting parties are impleaded as respondents in the<lb/>
 petition and they raised a contention opposing the Will. We feel that the principles<lb/>
 laid down in the said rulings are of no help to the respondents as they have not<lb/>
 directly considered the points that are being projected now in these proceedings.<lb/>
 Moreover, we are unable to agree with the reasonings expressed in those<lb/>
 decisions.<lb/>
</item>

<item>10. Since the question raised before us is of some importance relating to<lb/>
 payment of court-fee, we have to carefully analyse the various views in this<lb/>
 connection to find out the actual scope of Section 295 of the Succession Act in so<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 far as payment of court-fee is concerned. In order to find out the meaning of &apos;suit&apos;<lb/>
 found in Section 295 of the Succession Act, which came to be passed in 1925,<lb/>
 we have to see the provisions relating to suits in old Civil Procedure Code of the<lb/>
 year 1859. Section 25 of the old Civil Procedure Code provided as follows: -<lb/>
&quot;all suits shall be commenced by a plaint which.... shall be<lb/>
 presented to the curt by the plaintiff in person or by his recognised agent<lb/>
 or by a pleader duly appointed to act on his behalf.&quot;<lb/>
 Further,Section 26 specified the particulars that are to be furnished in the plaint<lb/>
 Section 27provided the manner in which the plaint was to be signed and verified.<lb/>
 The provisions of the old and new Code of Civil Procedure disclose that a decree<lb/>
 marks the culmination of a proceeding which is described as a suit and which,<lb/>
 according to the Code, is initiated by means of a plaint. But in so far as the<lb/>
 proceedings under the Succession Act are concerned they are not commenced<lb/>
 by the institution of a plaint. But on the other hand, as Sections 278 to 281 of the<lb/>
 said Act show, they are commenced by an &apos;application&apos; or a &apos;petition&apos;.<lb/>
</item>

<item>11. There is another angle from which we have to test the intention of the<lb/>
 Legislature in prescribing the procedure as if it is a suit. Once we hold that the<lb/>
 proceeding under the Act is not a suit, the orders passed in such a petition<lb/>
 cannot be termed as a decree. Though the term &apos;decree&apos; was not defined in the<lb/>
 old Civil Procedure Code of 1859, it was Defined in Section 2(2) of the Civil P. C.<lb/>
 1908, as follows: --<lb/>
&quot;a formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards<lb/>
 the court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties<lb/>
 with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit, and may<lb/>
 be either preliminary or final.&quot;<lb/>

<item>It is, therefore, possible to hold that the use of the term &apos;suit&apos; in the above<lb/>
 definition indicates that a decree under the Civil P.C could only be passed in a<lb/>
 proceeding which could be termed as a &apos;suit&apos;. In this connection, we have to<lb/>
 notice the provisions in Section 299 of the Indian Succession Act, relating to the<lb/>
 filing of appeals and it reads as follows--<lb/>
&quot;299. Appeals from orders of District Judge:--Every order made<lb/>
 by a District Judge by virtue of the powers hereby conferred upon him<lb/>
 shall be subject to appeal to the High Court in accordance with the<lb/>
 provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (5 of 1908), applicable to<lb/>
 appeals.&quot;<lb/>
 Under the said section, every order including the order passed at the final stage<lb/>
 granting the probate made by the District Judge shall be subject to appeal to the<lb/>
 High Court. Even for the final judgment granting the Probate the word that has<lb/>
 been used is &apos;order&apos;. This provision also shows that the proceedings even if they<lb/>
 had become contentious, did not become proceedings in the suit, and unless<lb/>
 there is a suit as provided under the Civil P. C. there can be no decree, except in<lb/>
 cases of certain orders which are expressly included in the definition of decree.<lb/>
 12. The question relating to the meaning of the words &apos;as nearly as may<lb/>
 be&apos; used in Section 295 of the Succession Act, has to be understood in the<lb/>
 context in which it is uses in the Act. A perusal of Section 295 of the Succession<lb/>
 Act, 1925 which corresponds to Section 261 of the Succession Act of 1865, itself<lb/>
 indicates that such a proceeding is not a suit Since the Legislature did not treat<lb/>
 the proceeding itself as a suit, it was found necessary in S.295 of the Act to lay<lb/>
 down that such proceeding should, as nearly as possible take the form of a<lb/>
 regular suit. In this connection, we have to give special meaning to the words &apos;as<lb/>
 nearly as may be&apos; in the section. The use of the said words itself indicates that<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 the proceeding in question was not considered to be exactly the same as a suit.<lb/>
 Again, we have to notice that the fact that the section itself directs that such a<lb/>
 proceeding shall take the form of a regular Suit, indicates that in substance it is<lb/>
 not a suit. It is evident that the Legislature thought fit to make a distinction<lb/>
 between a regular suit and the proceeding under Section 295 of the Act. As there<lb/>
 is basic difference of the two proceedings, it was found necessary to direct that<lb/>
 one was to take the form of the other. It Is also significant to note that such a<lb/>
 direction regarding the change of the form is to be adopted only in cases where<lb/>
 there is contention. Therefore, when there is no contention, the change of form<lb/>
 contemplated in Section 295 of the Act does not come into operation and the<lb/>
 proceedings fully retain their initial form. These principles have been elaborately<lb/>
 considered by a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Panzy Fernandes Vs.<lb/>
 M.F.Queoros, AIR 1963 All. 153 and the learned Judges came to the same<lb/>
 conclusion. We are in respectful agreement with the reasonings of the learned<lb/>
 Judges who decided the said case.<lb/>
</item>

<item>13. We have bestowed our anxious consideration to the meaning of the<lb/>
 words &apos;as nearly as may be&apos; and we are unable to persuade ourselves to come to<lb/>
 a conclusion that the proceeding under Section 295 can be termed to be a<lb/>
 regular suit. The main reason is that if the Legislature had intended that such<lb/>
 proceedings should be treated as suits and not as applications, there is nothing<lb/>
 to prevent the Legislature from making a simple and clear provision to the effect<lb/>
 that such proceedings might be converted into a suit and treated as such. This<lb/>
 inference is strengthened by the fact that in Section 47. C.P. Code, it is laid down<lb/>
 that it is open to a Court to treat a proceeding under that section as a suit and<lb/>
 order payment of additional court-fee. The fact that such a specific provision was<lb/>
 not made in Section 295 of the Succession Act, demonstrates the intention of the<lb/>
 Legislature in clear terms.<lb/>
</item>

<item>14. In this context, we have to consider as to the proper Court-fee<lb/>
 payable in a proceeding under Section 295 of the Succession Act. We have<lb/>
 already seen that the petition filed under the said Act does not become a suit on<lb/>
 a contention being raised by the opposite party. The proceedings are treated as a<lb/>
 regular suit in form only and not in substance. Court-fee is now demanded on the<lb/>
 basis of the provision contained in Article 11, Sub-clause (k) of Schedule II of the<lb/>
 Tamil Nadu Court-fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1955, which provides as follows:-<lb/>
Particulars<lb/>
 Proper fee<lb/>
</item>

<item>(k) (i) Application for Probate or<lb/>
 Letters of Administration to have<lb/>
 effect throughout India<lb/>
 Twenty five rupees<lb/>
</item>

<item>(ii) Application for Probate or<lb/>
 Letters of Administration not falling<lb/>
 under clause (i)<lb/>
 Seventy five paise<lb/>
 (1) If the value of the estate does<lb/>
 not exceed Rs.1000<lb/>
 Seventy five paise<lb/>
</item>

<item>(2) If the value exceeds Rs.1000<lb/>
 Five rupees<lb/>
 Provided that if a caveat is entered and the application is registered as a suit One<lb/>
 half of the scale of fee prescribed in Art.1 of Schedule I on the market value of<lb/>
 the estate less the fee already paid on the application shall be levied.<lb/>
 It is seen that Sub-clause (2) of Clause (ii) provides for payment of one half the<lb/>
 scale of fees prescribed in Article 1 of Schedule 1 on the market value of the<lb/>
 estate when a caveat is entered and the application is registered as a suit.<lb/>
 Therefore, before a party is called upon to pay court-fee under this provision two<lb/>
 conditions must be satisfied, namely, that a caveat must have been entered and<lb/>
 that the application must have been registered as a suit. Unless and until these<lb/>
 conditions are satisfied, there is no warrant for demanding court-fee as if it is a<lb/>
 regular suit. We have already seen that when the proceeding becomes<lb/>
 contentious, it does not become a suit, as such, as contemplated under the Civil<lb/>
 Procedure Code, and that it is considered to be a suit only in form and not in<lb/>
 substance. Therefore, as long as there is no suit in the eye of law, this provision<lb/>
 for payment of court-fee cannot-be invoked. We have also noticed that there is<lb/>
 no provision anywhere in the Succession Act or in the Court-fees Act to register a<lb/>
 petition under the Succession Act as a suit. When there is no such specific<lb/>
 provision in any of these Acts, it is not open to the State to demand court-fee as if<lb/>
 it is a regular suit, on such a petition at any stage of the proceedings.<lb/>
</item>

<item>15. There is one other reason for holding that the said provision under<lb/>
 the Court-fees Act cannot be made applicable to a case of this nature. It is seen<lb/>
 that Article 11(k) of Schedule 11 provides that one-half of the scale of fee<lb/>
 prescribed in Article 1 of Schedule I on the market value of the estate is payable<lb/>
 in the proceedings under the Indian Succession Act, as and when a caveat is<lb/>
 entered and the application is registered as a suit Article 1 in Schedule I provides<lb/>
 for payment of court-fee on the value of the subject-matter of the suit. This<lb/>
 provision of law cannot be made applicable since the subject-matter in dispute in<lb/>
 a proceeding relating to Probate or Letters of Administration is the right of the<lb/>
 grantee to represent the estate of the deceased and as such it is incapable of<lb/>
 valuation. The said provisions contained in the Court-fees Act contemplate<lb/>
 payment of court-fee in cases where the subject-matter is capable of valuation<lb/>
 and not otherwise. It cannot be disputed that the value of the properties<lb/>
 comprised in such applications cannot be taken to be the value for purposes of<lb/>
 payment of court-fee in such applications. The properties as such are not the<lb/>
 subject-matter in dispute here and on the other hand the subject-matter in<lb/>
 dispute is the right to represent the estate of the deceased and not the title to the<lb/>
 said estate. It has to be noted that before an order actually entitling the petitioner<lb/>
 to the grant of Probate or Letters of Administration is passed, he is required to<lb/>
 pay court-fee on the Probate or Letters of Administration on the value of the<lb/>
 estate under Schedule I of the Court-fees Act, Apart from this payment of court-<lb/>
fee, when the petitioner wants to recover the property comprised within the estate<lb/>
 of the deceased he is again required to pay ad valorem court fee on the plaint in<lb/>
 the suit filed for recovery of the property. It is, therefore clearly seen that it would<lb/>
 result in payment of court-fee more than once. It is a well established principle of<lb/>
 law that such fiscal statutes should be construed strictly and whenever there is a<lb/>
 doubt in the matter, an interpretation favourable to the litigants should be<lb/>
 referred. These principles have been clearly laid down in the above said decision<lb/>
 of the Allahabad High Court following the decisions reported in A.V.Fernandez<lb/>
 Vs. State of Kerala and Central India Spinning and Weaving and Manufacturing<lb/>
 Co. Ltd. Vs. Municipal Committee, Wardha., AIR 1958 SC 341. We, therefore,<lb/>
 hold that a proceeding referred to in Section 295 of the Succession Act does not<lb/>
 become a suit in the strict sense of the term even after it becomes contentious<lb/>
 and as such court-fee is not payable as a suit under Article 11(k) of Schedule II to<lb/>
 the Tamil Nadu Court-fees Act.<lb/>
</item>

<item>16. In so far as the decisions rendered by Paul,J., in Natarajan Vs.<lb/>
 Parthasarathi and others T.O.S.No.8 of 1972, dt.6-2-1973 and Sengottuvelan,J.,<lb/>
 in Krishna Iyer Vs. Krishnamachari, 98 Mad.L.W. 80 : (AIR 1985 Mad. 346) are<lb/>
 concerned, they relate to the proceedings in the Original Side of the High Court<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 and as such it cannot be stated that they have taken a different view in so far as<lb/>
 the proceedings taken before the Courts outside the Original jurisdiction of the<lb/>
 High Court As regards the decision of Veeraswami,J., as he then was, in<lb/>
 Flarence Chelliah Vs. Soundararaj Peter, (1965) 2 Mad LJ 33, it is seen that the<lb/>
 question was not raised in the form in which it is raised in these proceedings and,<lb/>
 therefore, the learned Judge had no opportunity to consider the matter from this<lb/>
 angle. The only question that was raised before the learned Judge was whether<lb/>
 the filing of a caveat is a condition precedent for treating the proceedings as a<lb/>
 suit. It was a case where the object ore were impleaded as respondents in the<lb/>
 original petition itself, and, therefore, it was contended that in the absence of a<lb/>
 caveat being entered on their behalf, court-fee was not payable. In dealing with<lb/>
 this question, the learned Judge came to the conclusion that merely because<lb/>
 there was rio formal entry of a caveat, it does not mean that the proviso is none<lb/>
 the less applicable. Even if it is to be construed that the Judge has taken a<lb/>
 different view, we hold that it is no longer a good law.<lb/>
</item>

<item>17. In the result, we answer the reference in the following manner:--<lb/>
When the proceeding initiated on a petition before a District Judge, for grant of<lb/>
 Probate or Letters of Administration, becomes contentious and is required to be<lb/>
 tried in the form of a regular suit according to the provisions of the Civil P. C., it<lb/>
 cannot be considered as a suit in the strict sense of the term and as such ad<lb/>
 valorem court-fee is not payable on such application under Article 11(k) (ii) Sub-<lb/>
clause (2) of Schedule II of the Tamil Nadu Court-fees and Suits Valuation Act,<lb/>
 1955. Since this is the only question to be decided in these two revision petitions,<lb/>
 it is unnecessary to send back them to be disposed of by a learned single Judge<lb/>
 of this court on merits. Therefore, these revision petitions are allowed and the<lb/>
 orders of the lower court are set aside. No costs.&quot;<lb/>

<item>&quot;21. The above are the principles on the basis of which a finding<lb/>
 regarding the genuineness of a Will has to be arrived at. It also follows that if the<lb/>
 provisions of the Will are natural and rationale in character, the question of<lb/>
 challenging the Will on the above grounds loses much of its importance. Further,<lb/>
 if the testator himself has explained the reason why he does not want to provide a<lb/>
 particular heir, a suspicious circumstance cannot be alleged, if the execution is<lb/>
 properly proved.<lb/>
</item>

<item>22. Long delay in producing the Will and getting it probated, if properly<lb/>
 explained, and if the execution and attestation are properly proved also, is of no<lb/>
 avail in granting the probate.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>40. That apart in view of the decision of the Privy Council in AIR 1945 PC<lb/>
 105 (Manindra Chandra Lala Vs. Mahalaxmi Bank Ltd.), the said question also<lb/>
 has to be answered only against the appellant. It was held in that decision thus :--<lb/>
&quot;Delay in applying for probate naturally gives rise to some<lb/>
 suspicion but when the execution and attestation of the Will is proved the<lb/>
 suspicion no longer operates.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>The learned Judge has believed the evidence of P.W.1. Further, we have held<lb/>
 that the Will was properly executed by the testator and also properly attested. In<lb/>
 view of that finding also we find that even if there is any delay, the same is<lb/>
 properly explained and that cannot be treated as a suspicious circumstance for<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 denying a probate.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>42. The same High Court, namely, the Andhra Pradesh High Court, in<lb/>
 another Division Bench Judgment reported in (1978) 1 Andh.L.T. 407 (K.Jwala<lb/>
 Narasimha Reddy Vs. Narayana Reddy), has held thus :<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;where suspicion arises from the nature of the case put forward<lb/>
 by the person claiming under the Will, he alone should remove that<lb/>
 suspicion which his case creates. If, however, suspicion against the Will<lb/>
 arises from the facts and circumstances of the case put forth by the<lb/>
 opposite side, then the court should see whether those facts and<lb/>
 circumstances giving rise to such a suspicion are proved before calling<lb/>
 upon the claimant under the Will to explain or remove such a suspicion.<lb/>
</item>

<item>The intention of the testator as declared in the Will disposing his property<lb/>
 is of paramount importance. The very first question to be considered is<lb/>
 whether the dispositions in the Will are natural, fair, reasonable and<lb/>
 probable. That goes a long way in effecting the theory of vitiating<lb/>
 suspicious circumstances. xxx xxx<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;The suspicions on the basis of which a Will can be invalidated should be<lb/>
 legitimate and well founded. They must be inherent in the transaction<lb/>
 itself which is challenged. Mere conflict of testimony cannot be raised to<lb/>
 the level of legitimate and well-grounded suspicious circumstances which<lb/>
 are capable of vitiating the execution of the Will itself.&quot;<lb/>
 (emphasis supplied)<lb/>
 We have already referred to 1990 (3) SCJ 588 : (AIR 1990 SC 1742) (supra). In<lb/>
 that case, their Lordships held that although freedom to bequeath one&apos;s own<lb/>
 property amongst Hindus is absolute both in extent and person, including rank<lb/>
 stranger, yet to have testamentary capacity or a disposable mind what is required<lb/>
 of propounder to establish is that the testator at time of disposition knew and<lb/>
 understood the property he was disposing and persons who were to be<lb/>
 beneficiaries of his disposition. Prudence, however, requires reason for denying<lb/>
 benefit to those who too were entitled to bounty of testator as they had similar<lb/>
 claims on him. (emphasis supplied). Absence of it may not invalidate a Will but it<lb/>
 shrounds the disposition with suspicion as it does not give any inkling to the mind<lb/>
 of the testator, to enable the Court to judge if the disposition was voluntary act.<lb/>
 From this, it is clear that if reason is provided in the Will itself for disinheriting a<lb/>
 heir or for giving only a lesser share, that removes the suspicious circumstances.&quot;<lb/>

<item>&quot;43. The learned counsel then contended that the respondent filed untrue<lb/>
 affidavit of assets and that the properties are of very substantial value and he has<lb/>
 purposely undervalued the house value. As pointed out in the ruling of this Court<lb/>
 reported in Vyjanthimala Bali Vs. Rattan Chaman Bali, 1990 (1) L.W. 27 the under-<lb/>
valuation of the estate is a matter left to the concern of the Revenue Authority by<lb/>
 the Legislature. The provisions of Sections 55 to 59 of the Tamil Nadu Court Fees<lb/>
 and Suits Valuation Act contain the necessary safeguards. It is not for the Court to<lb/>
 worry about the same. This decision is also applicable to the case on hand and will<lb/>
 be an answer to the contentions raised by the appellant relating to the valuation of<lb/>
 the property.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>15. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants contended that<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan is the father of the defendants and as alleged by the plaintiff, the plaintiff&apos;s<lb/>
 mother S.V.R.Saroja is not the wife of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan. Even as per the recitals<lb/>
 in the Will, the deceased Ramakrishnan stated that they were living as husband and wife, even<lb/>
 though there was not marriage between them. It is further contended that even according to the<lb/>
 documents exhibited by the plaintiff in the T.O.S., S.V.Ramakrishnan died intestate with regard to<lb/>
 the suit items 3 and 4, which are not the properties of S.V.Ramakrishnan and those items would<lb/>
 not form part of the Will, since there is bald allegation in the Will with regard to the properties and<lb/>
 hence, the defendants pray that the Letters of Administration may not be granted to the plaintiff.<lb/>
 The plaintiff has under-valued the suit properties, and therefore, it is prayed that A.No.4456 of<lb/>
 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, filed by the second defendant to direct the plaintiff to pray proper<lb/>
 Court fees according to the market value of the suit properties, may be allowed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>16. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants further submitted that the<lb/>
 executant of the Will, namely testator S.V.Ramakrishnan died on 31.12.1980 and Ex.P-23 Death<lb/>
 Certificate has been filed by the plaintiff in that regard, but the present O.P.No.367 of 2008 for<lb/>
 grant of Letters of Administration of the Will was filed initially only on 18.12.2006 and<lb/>
 subsequently, it was re-presented, and therefore, after nearly 26 years, the said O.P. was filed,<lb/>
 and on contest by the defendants, the said O.P. was converted into T.O.S.No.2 of 2009. It is their<lb/>
 further contention that the ruling of the First Bench of this Court in O.S.A.Nos.10 and 72 of 2013,<lb/>
 dated 07.01.2016, which is relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff, may not be<lb/>
 applicable to the facts of the present case, as the latest judgments rendered by the Supreme<lb/>
 Court with regard to the point of limitation, were not considered. They also contended that the<lb/>
 plaintiff had knowledge about the Will long back, i.e. even on the death of the death of the<lb/>
 executant of the Will, namely S.V.Ramakrishnan, which was on 31.12.1980 and the O.P. (T.O.S)<lb/>
 has not been fled within three years from the date of the knowledge of the Will, and therefore,<lb/>
 they prayed that the T.O.S. may be dismissed as time barred.<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
</p>

<p>17. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants further contended that the suit<lb/>
 properties are not the properties of late S.V.Ramakrishnan, as he was not the absolute owner with<lb/>
 regard to the same, and the properties are family ancestral properties and S.V.Ramakrishnan<lb/>
 acquired the properties from his adoptive father, etc., and hence, he has no right to execute the<lb/>
 Will with regard to the joint family properties. They further contended that the plaintiff&apos;s mother is<lb/>
 not S.V.R.Saroja as contended by her, and the marriage invitation of S.V.Ramakrishnan with the<lb/>
 defendants&apos; mother, namely Rajalakshmi, is marked as Ex.D-1.<lb/>
</p>

<p>18. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants further submitted that the suit<lb/>
 items 3 and 4 are not covered by the suit properties in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, as the same are the<lb/>
 suit properties in the suit filed in C.S.No.43 of 1962 before this Court, by the plaintiff&apos;s father along<lb/>
 with the second defendant against one Buhari and another, and the copy of the plaint in<lb/>
 C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-71 = Ex.D-13; the copy of the decree, dated 10.11.1965<lb/>
 passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-72 = Ex.D-14. As against the said decree, dated<lb/>
 10.11.1965 passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962, the appeals in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 were<lb/>
 preferred, which were disposed of by the Division Bench of this Court on 10.05.1972, against<lb/>
 which, Civil Appeal in C.A.No.224 of 1974 was preferred before the Supreme Court. The copy of<lb/>
 the affidavit filed in I.A.No.2 of 2008 in C.A.No.224 of 1974 filed before the Supreme Court is<lb/>
 marked as Ex.P-78. The judgment dated 17.04.1995 passed by the Supreme Court in C.A.No.224<lb/>
 of 1974 is marked as Ex.P-28, with amended cause title therein, which is marked as Ex.P-29. By<lb/>
 the said judgment in C.A.No.224 of 1974, the Supreme Court restored the order of the learned<lb/>
 single Judge passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962. In the said Civil Appeal before the Supreme Court, the<lb/>
 plaintiff and others were impleded as parties only as legal representatives of the deceased<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar, but not based upon the Will executed by S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar,<lb/>
 and hence, the plaintiff cannot now claim title to items 3 and 4 of the suit properties as beneficiary<lb/>
 under Ex.P-1 Will. Subsequently E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 was preferred by<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar (since deceased) and S.V.Matha Prasad, the second defendant herein<lb/>
 and the copy of the affidavit filed by the second defendant herein in the said E.P.No.48 of 1997 is<lb/>
 marked as Ex.D-17. The copy of the order, dated 03.07.2000 passed in A.Nos.1106 to 1108 of<lb/>
 2000 in E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.D-5 and the order dated<lb/>
 07.07.2000 passed in the said E.P. is marked as Ex.D-6. The counter affidavit filed by the second<lb/>
 defendant herein in A.Nos.2872 and 2873 of 2000 in E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is<lb/>
 marked as Ex.P-55. The copy of the order dated 24.08.2000 passed in A.Nos.2872 and 2873 of<lb/>
 2000 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-56 = Ex.D-18. The tampered copy of E.P.No.48 of<lb/>
 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 with additions and deletions, is marked as Ex.D-20. Ex.D-8 is the<lb/>
 letter dated 23.02.2007 issued by the Registrar General of this Court to the second defendant<lb/>
 regarding the tampering of records in E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962.<lb/>
</p>

<p>19. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants further contended that Ex.D-7<lb/>
 is the order dated 17.04.2003 passed by the Supreme Court in S.L.P.(CC).No.895 of 2003 filed by<lb/>
 the second defendant against the judgment dated 11.04.2001 (Ex.D-19) passed by the Division<lb/>
 Bench of this Court in O.S.A.No.372 of 2000. Ex.D-10 is the order dated 24.03.2011 passed by<lb/>
 this Court in W.P.No.2015 of 2008 filed by the second defendant herein against plaintiff and<lb/>
 others. The learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants also submitted that Ex.D-16 is<lb/>
 the copy of the affidavit filed before the Supreme Court in S.L.P.(CC).No.7242 of 1981 filed by the<lb/>
 legal representatives of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar against Buhari. Ex.D-21, dated<lb/>
 06.12.1982 is the compromise decree passed in C.S.No.469 of 1981 filed by M/s.Lakshmi<lb/>
 Builders against the second defendant herein and others. Ex.D-22, dated 31.10.1998 is the copy<lb/>
 of the deed of assignment executed by the plaintiff herein in favour of Mr.Lal Chand Menghraj and<lb/>
 Chimandar Menghraj. Ex.D-23 = Ex.P-18, dated 21.10.1989 is the copy of the deed of sale<lb/>
 executed by the plaintiff herein and others and the second defendant in favour of one Padmavathi.<lb/>
 Ex.D-24 series are: the copy of the Legal Heirship Certificate of the defendants&apos; father, the copy<lb/>
 of the extract from the Permanent Land Register (Patta) issued by Tahsildar, Purasaiwalkam-<lb/>
Perambur Taluk and the copy of the order passed by the Special Commissioner and<lb/>
 Commissioner of Land Reforms, Chepauk. Ex.D-25 is the copy of the counter filed by the<lb/>
 respondent Nos.21 to 24 before the Supreme Court in S.L.P.(Civil).No.13783 to 13876 of 2008.<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 20. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants submitted that item Nos.3<lb/>
 and 4 of the suit properties have not been included in the Will, even though it is admitted by the<lb/>
 plaintiff that S.V.Ramakrishnan died intestate and has not executed any Will as regards item<lb/>
 Nos.3 and 4 and the said fact is supported by subsequent documents like the order passed by the<lb/>
 Supreme Court and the E.P. proceedings before this Court. They also submitted that the plaintiff<lb/>
 has not independent right even as regards item Nos.1 and 2 of the suit properties, since they are<lb/>
 undivided joint family properties. From the above documents, it is clear the Will was not executed<lb/>
 by the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and therefore, they prayed that the Letters of Administration<lb/>
 proceedings in O.P.(T.O.S) may be dismissed as time barred. In support of their submissions,<lb/>
 learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants relied on the following decisions:<lb/>
</p>

<item>(a) 2007 (2) SCC 230 (Raghunath Rai Bareja Vs. Punjab National Bank):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;29. Learned counsel for the respondent-Bank submitted that it will be<lb/>
 very unfair if the appellant who is a guarantor of the loan, and director of the<lb/>
 Company which took the loan, avoids paying the debt. While we fully agree with<lb/>
 the learned counsel that equity is wholly in favour of the respondent-Bank, since<lb/>
 obviously a Bank should be allowed to recover its debts, we must, however, state<lb/>
 that it is well settled that when there is a conflict between law and equity, it is the<lb/>
 law which has to prevail, in accordance with the Latin maxim &quot;dura lex sed lex&quot;,<lb/>
 which means &quot;the law is hard, but it is the law&quot;. Equity can only supplement the<lb/>
 law, but it cannot supplant or override it.<lb/>
</item>

<item>30. Thus, in Madamanchi Ramappa Vs. Muthaluru Bojjappa (AIR 1963<lb/>
 SC 1633),(vide AIR p.1637, para 12) this Court observed :<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;....... what is administered in Courts is justice according to law,<lb/>
 and considerations of fair play and equity however important they may be,<lb/>
 must yield to clear and express provisions of the law.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(emphasis supplied)<lb/>
</item>

<p>34. Similarly in Nasiruddin Vs. Sita Ram Agarwal (2003 (2) SCC 577 :<lb/>
 AIR 2003 SC 1543) (vide SCC p.588, para 35) this Court observed :<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;35. In a case where the statutory provision is plain and<lb/>
 unambiguous, the court shall not interpret the same in a different<lb/>
 manner, only because of harsh consequences arising therefrom.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>35. Similarly in E.Palanisamy Vs. Palanisamy (2003 (1) SCC 123) (vide<lb/>
 SCC p.127, para 5) this Court observed :<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;Equitable considerations have no place where the statute<lb/>
 contained express provisions.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>36. In India House Vs. Kishan N.Lalwani (2003 (9) SCC 393) (vide SCC<lb/>
 p.398, para 7) this Court held that :<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;The period of limitation statutorily prescribed has to be strictly<lb/>
 adhered to and cannot be relaxed or departed from for equitable<lb/>
 considerations.&quot;<lb/>
 (emphasis supplied)&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(b) 2003 (1) SCC 730 (Jinia Keotin Vs. Kumar Sitaram Manjhi):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;4. We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel<lb/>
 on either side. The Hindu Marriage Act underwent important changes by virtue of<lb/>
 the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, which came into force with effect<lb/>
 from 27.5.1976. Under the ordinary law, a child for being treated as legitimate<lb/>
 must be born in lawful wedlock. If the marriage itself is void on account of<lb/>
 contravention of the statutory prescription, any child born of such marriage would<lb/>
 have the effect, per se, or on being so declared or annulled, as the case may be,<lb/>
 of bastardizing the children born of the parties to such marriage. Polygamy, which<lb/>
 was permissible and widely prevalent among the Hindus in the past and<lb/>
 considered to have evil effects on society, came to be put an end to by the<lb/>
 mandate of the Parliament in enacting the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The<lb/>
 legitimate status of the children which depended very much upon the marriage<lb/>
 between their parents being valid or void, thus turned on the act of parents over<lb/>
 which the innocent child had no hold or control. But, for no fault of it, the innocent<lb/>
 baby had to suffer a permanent set back in life and in the eyes of society by being<lb/>
 treated as illegitimate. A laudable and noble act of the legislature indeed in<lb/>
 enacting Section 16 to put an end to a great social evil. At the same time, Section<lb/>
 16 of the Act, while engrafting a rule of fiction in ordaining the children, though<lb/>
 illegitimate, to be treated as legitimate, notwithstanding that the marriage was void<lb/>
 or voidable chose also to confine its application, so far as succession or<lb/>
 inheritance by such children are concerned to the properties of the parents only.<lb/>
</item>

<item>5. So far as Section 16 of the Act is concerned, though it was enacted to<lb/>
 legitimise children, who would otherwise suffer by becoming illegitimate, at the<lb/>
 same time it expressly provide in sub-section (3) by engrafting a provision with a<lb/>
 non obstante clause stipulating specifically that nothing contained in sub-section<lb/>
 (1) or sub-section (2) shall be construed as conferring upon any child of a<lb/>
 marriage, which is null and void or which is annulled by a decree a nullity under<lb/>
 Section 12, &quot;any rights in or to the property of any person, other than the parents,<lb/>
 in any case where, but for the passing of this Act, such child would have been<lb/>
 incapable of possessing or acquiring any such rights by reason of his not being<lb/>
 the legitimate child of his parents.&quot; In the light of such an express mandate of the<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 legislature itself, there is no room for according upon such children who but for<lb/>
 Section 16 would have been branded as illegitimate any further rights than<lb/>
 envisaged therein by resorting to any presumptive or inferential process of<lb/>
 reasoning, having recourse to the mere object or purpose of enacting Section 16<lb/>
 of the Act. Any attempt to do so would amount to doing not only violence to the<lb/>
 provision specifically engrafted in sub-section (3) of Section 16 of the Act but also<lb/>
 would attempt to court relegislating on the subject under the guise of<lb/>
 interpretation, against even the will expressed in the enactment itself.<lb/>
 Consequently, we are unable to countenance the submissions on behalf of the<lb/>
 appellants. The view taken by the courts below cannot be considered to suffer<lb/>
 from any serious infirmity to call for our interference, in this appeal.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(c) 1995 (6) SCC 213 (Kashibai Vs. Parwatibai):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;10. This brings us to the question of the Will alleged to have been<lb/>
 executed by deceased Lachiram in favour of his grandson Purshottam, Defendant<lb/>
</item>

<item>3. Section 68 of Evidence Act relates to the proof of execution of document<lb/>
 required by law to be attested. Admittedly, a Deed of Will is one of such<lb/>
 documents which necessarily require by law to be attested. Section 68 of the<lb/>
 Evidence Act contemplates that if a document is required by law to be attested, it<lb/>
 shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called<lb/>
 for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive, and<lb/>
 subject to the process of the court and capable of giving evidence. A reading of<lb/>
 Section 68 will show that &apos;attestation&apos; and &apos;execution&apos; are two different acts one<lb/>
 following the other. There can be no valid execution of a document which under<lb/>
 the law is required to be attested without the proof of its due attestation and if due<lb/>
 attestation is also not proved, the fact of execution is of no avail. Section 63 of the<lb/>
 Indian Succession Act, 1925 also lays down certain rules with regard to the<lb/>
 execution of unprivileged Wills. Clause (c) of Section 63 provides that the Will<lb/>
 shall be attested by two or more witnesses, each one of whom has seen the<lb/>
 testator sign or affix his mark to the Will or has seen some other person sign the<lb/>
 Will, in the presence and by the direction of the testator, or has received from the<lb/>
 testator a personal acknowledgement of his signature or mark or the signature of<lb/>
 such other person; and each of the witnesses should sign the Will in the presence<lb/>
 of the testator, but it shall not be necessary that more than one witness be present<lb/>
 at the same time and no particular form of attestation shall be necessary.<lb/>
</item>

<p>11. Here we may also take note of the definition of the expression<lb/>
 &apos;attested&apos; as contained in Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act which reads as<lb/>
 under:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;3. &apos;attested&apos;, in relation to an instrument, means and shall be<lb/>
 deemed always to have meant attested by two or more witnesses each of<lb/>
 whom has seen the executant sign or affix his mark to the instrument, or<lb/>
 has seen some other person sign the instrument in the presence and by<lb/>
 the direction of the executant, or has received from the executant a<lb/>
 personal acknowledgement of his signature or mark, or of the signature of<lb/>
 such other person, and each of whom has signed the instrument in the<lb/>
 presence of the executant; but it shall not be necessary that more than<lb/>
 one of such witnesses shall have been present at the same time, and no<lb/>
 particular form of attestation shall be necessary.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>Having regard to the aforementioned definition an attesting witness is a person<lb/>
 who in the presence of an executant of a document puts his signature or mark<lb/>
 after he has either seen the executant himself or someone on direction of the<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 executant has put his signature or affixed his mark on the document so required to<lb/>
 be attested or after he has received from the executant a personal<lb/>
 acknowledgement of his signature or mark or the signature or mark of such other<lb/>
 person. In the present case the trial court after a close scrutiny and analysis of the<lb/>
 evidence of Defendant 1, Smt Parvati Bai, Vir Bhadra, Sheikh Nabi, Shivraj and<lb/>
 Gyanoba Patil who are witnesses to the Will recorded the finding that none of them<lb/>
 deposed that Lachiram had signed the said Will before them and they had attested<lb/>
 it. None of them except Sheikh Nabi even deposed as to when the talk about the<lb/>
 execution of Will was held. The witness Sheikh Nabi, however, deposed that the<lb/>
 talk about the Will also took place at the time of the talk about the adoption. But<lb/>
 this witness too did not depose that deceased Lachiram had signed the alleged<lb/>
 Will in his presence. In the absence of such evidence it is difficult to accept that<lb/>
 the execution of the alleged Will was proved in accordance with law as required by<lb/>
 Section 68 of the Evidence Act read with Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act<lb/>
 and Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act. It may be true as observed by the<lb/>
 High Court that law does not emphasise that the witness must use the language of<lb/>
 the section to prove the requisite merits thereof but it is also not permissible to<lb/>
 assume something which is required by law to be specifically proved. The High<lb/>
 Court simply assumed that Lachiram must have put his signature on the Will Deed<lb/>
 in the presence of the attesting witness Sheikh Nabi simply because the Deed of<lb/>
 Adoption is admitted by the witness to have been executed on the same day. The<lb/>
 High Court committed a serious error in making the observations that broad<lb/>
 parameters of Nabi&apos;s evidence would show that Lachiram executed the Will in his<lb/>
 presence, that he signed the Will being part of the execution of the testament and<lb/>
 this evidence in its correct background would go to show that what was required<lb/>
 under Section 63 has been carried out in the execution of the Will. With respect to<lb/>
 the High Court we may say that these findings of the High Court are clearly based<lb/>
 on assumptions and surmises and, totally against the weight of the evidence on<lb/>
 record. The trial court on a close and thorough analysis of the entire evidence<lb/>
 came to a proper conclusion that the Will has not been proved in accordance with<lb/>
 law which finding has been further affirmed by the lower appellate court after an<lb/>
 independent reappraisal of entire evidence with which we find ourselves in<lb/>
 agreement as there was hardly any scope or a valid reason for the High Court to<lb/>
 interfere with.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(d) 2008 (12) SCC 577 (Kamlesh Babu Vs. Lajpat Rai Sharma):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;</item>

<p>16. Having considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective<lb/>
 parties, the decisions cited by them and the relevant law on the subject, we are<lb/>
 unable to accept Ms.Srivastava&apos;s submissions mainly on two counts. Firstly, the<lb/>
 facts disclosed clearly indicate that neither the first appellate court nor the High<lb/>
 Court took notice of Section 3(1) of the Limitation Act, 1963, which reads as<lb/>
 follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;3. Bar of limitation.--(1) Subject to the provisions contained in Sections 4<lb/>
 to 24 (inclusive), every suit instituted, appeal preferred, and application<lb/>
 made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed although limitation has<lb/>
 not been set up as a defence.&quot;<lb/>
 Even in the decision of this Court in Darshan Singh case (State of Punjab Vs.<lb/>
 Darshan Singh -2004 (1) SCC 328), the said provision does not appear to have<lb/>
 been brought to the notice of the Hon&apos;ble Judges who decided the matter.<lb/>
</item>

<item>17. It is well settled that Section 3(1) of the Limitation Act casts a duty<lb/>
 upon the court to dismiss a suit or an appeal or an application, if made after the<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 prescribed period, although, limitation is not set up as a defence.<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>21. It is no doubt true, as was pointed out by this Court in Balasaria<lb/>
 Construction (P) Ltd. (Balasaria Construction (P). Ltd. Vs. Hanuman Seva Trust -<lb/>
2006 (5) SCC 658) and also in Narne Rama Murthy case (Narne Rama Murthy Vs.<lb/>
 Ravula Somasundaram -2005 (6) SCC 614), that if the plea of limitation is a mixed<lb/>
 question of law and fact, the same cannot be raised at the appellate stage. We<lb/>
 have no problem with the said proposition of law. What we are concerned with is<lb/>
 whether the said proposition is applicable to the facts of this case. In this case the<lb/>
 plea of limitation had been raised in the written statement and though no specific<lb/>
 issue was framed in respect thereof, a decision was given thereupon by the<lb/>
 learned trial court.<lb/>
</item>

<item>22. Apart from Section 3(1) of the Limitation Act, even Order 7 Rule 11(d)<lb/>
 of the Code of Civil Procedure casts a mandate upon the court to reject a plaint<lb/>
 where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law, in<lb/>
 this case by the law of limitation. Further, as far back as in 1943, the Privy Council<lb/>
 in Lachhmi Sewak Sahu Vs. Ram Rup Sahu (AIR 1944 PC 24) held that a point of<lb/>
 limitation is prima facie admissible even in the court of last resort, although it had<lb/>
 not been taken in the lower courts.<lb/>
</item>

<item>23. The reasoning behind the said proposition is that certain questions<lb/>
 relating to the jurisdiction of a court, including limitation, goes to the very root of the<lb/>
 court&apos;s jurisdiction to entertain and decide a matter, as otherwise, the decision<lb/>
 rendered without jurisdiction will be a nullity. ... ... &quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(e) 2008 (8) SCC 463 (Kunvarjeet Singh Khandpur Vs. Kirandeep Kaur):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;11. In Kerala SEB Vs. T.P.Kunhaliumma (1976 (4) SCC 634) it was inter<lb/>
 alia observed as follows: (SCC pp.638 &amp; 39, para 18 &amp; 22):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;18. The alteration of the division as well as the change in the<lb/>
 collocation of words in Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 compared<lb/>
 with Article 181 of the 1908 Limitation Act shows that applications<lb/>
 contemplated under Article 137 are not applications confined to the Code<lb/>
 of Civil Procedure. In the 1908 Limitation Act there was no division<lb/>
 between applications in specified cases and other applications as in the<lb/>
 1963 Limitation Act. The words &quot;any other application&quot; under Article 137<lb/>
 cannot be said on the principle of ejusdem generis to be applications under<lb/>
 the Civil Procedure Code other than those mentioned in Part I of the third<lb/>
 division. Any other application under Article 137 would be petition or any<lb/>
 application under any Act. But it has to be an application to a court for the<lb/>
 reason that Sections 4 and 5 of the 1963 Limitation Act speak of expiry of<lb/>
 prescribed period when court is closed and extension of prescribed period<lb/>
 if applicant or the appellant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause<lb/>
 for not preferring the appeal or making the application during such period.<lb/>
 *<lb/>
 *<lb/>
 *<lb/>
</item>

<item>22. The conclusion we reach is that Article 137 of the 1963<lb/>
 Limitation Act will apply to any petition or application filed under any Act to<lb/>
 a civil court. With respect we differ from the view taken by the two-Judge<lb/>
 bench of this Court in Athani Municipal Council case (Town Municipal<lb/>
 Council, Athani Vs. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, 1969 (1) SCC 873)<lb/>
 and hold that Article 137 of the 1963 Limitation Act is not confined to<lb/>
 applications contemplated by or under the Code of Civil Procedure. The<lb/>
 petition in the present case was to the District Judge as a court. The<lb/>
 petition was one contemplated by the Telegraph Act for judicial decision.<lb/>
</item>

<item>http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 The petition is an application falling within the scope of Article 137 of the<lb/>
 1963 Limitation Act.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>In terms of the aforesaid judgment any application to Civil Court under the Act is<lb/>
 covered by Article 137. The application is made in terms of Section 264 of the Act<lb/>
 to the District Judge. Section 2(bb) of the Act defines the District Judge to be the<lb/>
 Judge of the Principal Civil Court.<lb/>
 12. Further in S.S. Rathore Vs. State of M.P. (1989 (4) SCC 582 : 1990<lb/>
 SCC (L &amp; S) 50 : 1989 (11) ATC 913) it was inter-alia stated as follows: (SCC<lb/>
 p.585, para 5)<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;5. Appellant&apos;s counsel placed before us the residuary Article 113<lb/>
 and had referred to a few decisions of some High Courts where in a<lb/>
 situation as here reliance was placed on that article. It is unnecessary to<lb/>
 refer to those decisions as on the authority of the judgment of this Court in<lb/>
 the case of Pierce Leslie &amp; Co. Ltd. Vs. Violet Ouchterlony Wapshare<lb/>
 (AIR 1969 SC 843) it must be held that Article 113 of the Act of 1963,<lb/>
 corresponding to Article 120 of the old Act, is a general one and would<lb/>
 apply to suits to which no other article in the schedule applies.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>13. Article 137 of the Limitation Act reads as follows:<lb/>
 Description of suit<lb/>
 Period of limitation<lb/>
 Time from which<lb/>
 period begins to run<lb/>
</item>

<item>137.<lb/>
 Any<lb/>
 other<lb/>
 application for which no<lb/>
 period of limitation is<lb/>
 provided elsewhere in<lb/>
 this Division.<lb/>
</item>

<p>Three years<lb/>
 When the right to<lb/>
 apply accrues<lb/>
 The crucial expression in the petition (sic Article) is &quot;right to apply&quot;. In view of what<lb/>
 has been stated by this Court, Article 137 is clearly applicable to the petition for<lb/>
 grant of Letters of Administration. As rightly observed by the High Court in such<lb/>
 proceedings the application merely seeks recognition from the Court to perform a<lb/>
 duty because of the nature of the proceedings it is a continuing right. The Division<lb/>
 Bench of the Delhi High Court referred to several decisions. One of them was<lb/>
 S.Krishnaswami Vs. E.Ramiah (AIR 1991 Madras 214). In para 17 of the said<lb/>
 judgment it was noted as follows: (AIR p.222)<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;17. In a proceeding, or in other words, in an application filed for<lb/>
 grant of probate or letters of administration, no right is asserted or claimed<lb/>
 by the applicant. The applicant only seeks recognition of the Court to<lb/>
 perform a duty. Probate or letter of Administration issued by a competent<lb/>
 Court is conclusive proof of the legal character throughout the world. An<lb/>
 assessment of the relevant provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925<lb/>
 does not convey a meaning that by the Proceedings filed for grant of<lb/>
 probate or letters of administration, no rights of the applicant are settled or<lb/>
 secured in the legal sense. The author of the testament has cast the duty<lb/>
 with regard to the administration of his estate, and the applicant for probate<lb/>
 or letters of administration only seeks the permission of the Court to<lb/>
 perform that duty. There is only a seeking of recognition from the Court to<lb/>
 perform the duty. That duty is only moral and it is not legal. There is no law<lb/>
 which compels the applicant to file the proceedings for probate or letters of<lb/>
 administration. With a view to discharge the moral duty, the applicant seeks<lb/>
 recognition from the Court to perform the duty. It will be legitimate to<lb/>
 conclude that the proceedings filed for grant of probate or letters of<lb/>
 administration is not an action in law. Hence, it is very difficult to and it will<lb/>
 not be in order to construe the proceedings for grant of probate or letters of<lb/>
 administration as applications coming within the meaning of an &apos;application&apos;<lb/>
 under Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>14. Though the nature of the petition has been rightly described by the<lb/>
 High Court, it was not correct in observing that the application for grant of probate<lb/>
 or letters of Administration is not covered by Article 137 of the Limitation Act. Same<lb/>
 is not correct in view of what has been stated in Kerala SEB case (supra).<lb/>
</item>

<item>15. Similarly reference was made to a decision of the Bombay High Court<lb/>
 in Vasudev Daulatram Sadarangani Vs. Sajni Prem Lalwani (AIR 1983 Bom. 268).<lb/>
 Para 16 reads as follows: (AIR p.270)<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;16. Rejecting Mr.Dalpatrai&apos;s contention, I summarise my<lb/>
 conclusions thus:--<lb/>
</item>

<item>(a) under the Limitation Act no period is advisedly<lb/>
 prescribed within which an application for probate, letters of<lb/>
 administration or succession certificate must be made;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(b) the assumption that under Article 137 the right to apply<lb/>
 necessarily accrues on the date of the death of the deceased, is<lb/>
 unwarranted;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(c) such an application is for the Court&apos;s permission to<lb/>
 perform a legal duty created by a Will or for recognition as a<lb/>
 testamentary trustee and is a continuous right which can be<lb/>
 exercised any time after the death of the deceased, as long as the<lb/>
 right to do so survives and the object of the trust exists or any part<lb/>
 of the trust, if created, remains to be executed;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(d) the right to apply would accrue when it becomes<lb/>
 necessary to apply which may not necessarily be within 3 years<lb/>
 form the date of he deceased&apos;s death.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(e) delay beyond 3 years after the deceased&apos;s death would<lb/>
 arouse suspicion and greater the delay, greater would be the<lb/>
 suspicion;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(f) such delay must be explained, but cannot be equated<lb/>
 with the absolute bar of limitation; and<lb/>
</item>

<item>(g) once execution and attestation are proved, suspicion of<lb/>
 delay no longer operates&quot;.<lb/>
 Conclusion &apos;b&apos; is not correct while the conclusion &apos;c&apos; is the correct position of law.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(f) 1990 (2) SCC 42 (Patasibai Vs. Ratanlal):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;13. On the admitted facts appearing from the record itself, learned<lb/>
 counsel for the respondent, was unable to show that all or any of these<lb/>
 averments in the plaint disclose a cause of action giving rise to a triable issue.<lb/>
 In fact, Shri Salve was unable to dispute the inevitable consequence that the<lb/>
 plaint was liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11, CPC on these<lb/>
 averments. All that Shri Salve contended was that the court did not in fact<lb/>
 reject the plaint under Order VII Rule 11, CPC and summons having been<lb/>
 issued, the trial must proceed. In our opinion, it makes no difference that the<lb/>
 trial court failed to perform its duty and proceeded to issue summons without<lb/>
 carefully reading the plaint and the High Court also overlooked this fatal defect.<lb/>
 Since the plaint suffers from this fatal defect, the mere issuance of summons<lb/>
 by the trial court does not require that the trial should proceed even when no<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 triable issue is shown to arise. Permitting the continuance of such a suit is<lb/>
 tantamount to licensing frivolous and vexatious litigation. This cannot be done.<lb/>
</item>

<item>14. It being beyond dispute that the plaint averments do not disclose a<lb/>
 cause of action, the plaint is liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11, CPC<lb/>
 without going into the applicability of Order XXIII Rule 3-A, CPC to the present<lb/>
 suit. Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary to adopt the technical<lb/>
 course of directing the trial court to make the consequential order of rejecting<lb/>
 the plaint and, instead, we adopt the practical course of making that order in<lb/>
 this proceeding itself to avoid any needless delay in conclusion of this futile<lb/>
 litigation.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>(g) 2004 (8) SCC 229 (Krishna Bahadur Vs. Purna Theatre):<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;9. The principle of waiver although is akin to the principle of estoppel;<lb/>
 the difference between the two, however, is that whereas estoppel is not a<lb/>
 cause of action; it is a rule of evidence; waiver is contractual and may<lb/>
 constitute a cause of action; it is an agreement between the parties and a party<lb/>
 fully knowing of its rights has agreed not to assert a right for a consideration.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(h) 2004 (13) SCC 792 (A.P.SRTC Vs. S.Jayaram):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;5. It was next submitted that the respondent should be deemed to have<lb/>
 waived his rights under Circular No. 45/81 by submitting tender in response to the<lb/>
 notice inviting tenders in the year 1984 and he must be held bound by the terms<lb/>
 of the contract which he entered into pursuant to the tender submitted by him.<lb/>
 The High Court has formed an opinion that the respondent cannot be deemed to<lb/>
 have waived the right or the benefit available to him under Circular No. 45/81<lb/>
 because he was not even aware of the existence of the circular. To constitute<lb/>
 waiver there must be an intentional relinquishment of a known right or the<lb/>
 voluntary relinquishment or abandonment of a known existing legal right or<lb/>
 conduct such as warrants an inference of the relinquishment of a known right or<lb/>
 privilege (Basheshar Nath Vs. CIT --AIR 1959 SC 149). Moreover, the circular<lb/>
 itself stipulates the Corporation making an offer to the contractors for taking<lb/>
 benefit of the policy decision and it is undisputed that the Corporation never made<lb/>
 such an offer to the respondent. Inasmuch as there is a failure on the part of the<lb/>
 Corporation to extend the benefit of the circular to the respondent, the<lb/>
 Corporation cannot be permitted to take shelter behind its own wrong.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(i) 1987 (Supp) SCC 663 (Samar Singh Vs. Kedar Nath):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;5. The above view was reiterated by this Court in Bhagwati Prasad Dixit<lb/>
 Vs. Rajiv Gandhi (1986 (4) SCC 78 : 1986 SCC (Cri) 399) and Dhartipakar<lb/>
 Madan Lal Agarwal Vs. Rajiv Gandhi (1987 Supp.SCC 93). If an election petition<lb/>
 does not disclose cause of action, it can be dismissed summarily at the threshold<lb/>
 of the proceeding under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If an<lb/>
 election petition can be summarily rejected at the threshold of the proceeding we<lb/>
 do not see any reason as to why the same cannot be rejected at any stage of<lb/>
 subsequent proceeding. If after framing of issues basic defect in the election<lb/>
 petition persists (absence of cause of action) it is always open to the contesting<lb/>
 respondent to insist that the petition be rejected, under Order 7 Rule 11 and the<lb/>
 court would be acting within its jurisdiction, in considering the objection. Order 7<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 Rule 11 does not place any restriction or limitation on the exercise of court&apos;s<lb/>
 power; it does not either expressly or by necessary implication provide that power<lb/>
 under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC should be exercised at a particular stage only. In the<lb/>
 absence of any restriction placed by the statutory provision, it is open to the court<lb/>
 to exercise that power at any stage. While it is true that ordinarily preliminary<lb/>
 objection to the maintainability of the petition on the ground of absence of cause<lb/>
 of action should be raised by the respondent as early as possible but if a party<lb/>
 raises objections after filing written statement the preliminary objection cannot be<lb/>
 ignored. If the election petition does not disclose any cause of action, the<lb/>
 respondent&apos;s right to raise objection to the maintainability of the petition, or the<lb/>
 court&apos;s power to consider the objection is not affected adversely merely because<lb/>
 the objection is raised after filing of written statement or framing of issues. The<lb/>
 court would be acting within its jurisdiction in exercise of its power under Order 7<lb/>
 Rule 11 in rejecting the same even after settlement of issues.&quot;<lb/>

<p>(j) 1999 (3) CTC 136 (Madras High Court) (Singaram @ Velayudha Udayar Vs.<lb/>
 Subramaniam):<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;18. Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act had been enacted to confer a<lb/>
 right of inheritance on the illegitimate child born out of void or voidable marriage<lb/>
 from out of the individual properties of their father. The section before amendment<lb/>
 dealing with the children of void marriages provided that if a decree of nullity was<lb/>
 passed, the children begotten or conceived before the decree would have been<lb/>
 the legitimate children of the parties to the marriage, if it had been dissolved. As<lb/>
 the old provision contemplated the necessity of a decree of nullity under Section<lb/>
 11 which took into its fold only the marriages in contravention of the conditions in<lb/>
 classes (i) (iv) and (v) of Section 5. The proviso to the old section is now<lb/>
 incorporated as sub-section (3) of the said Act.<lb/>
</item>

<item>19. Sub-section (3) provides that in case of a child of a marriage which is<lb/>
 null and void or which is annulled by a decree of nullity under Section 12 though<lb/>
 the child may be a illegitimate child under sub-section (1) or (2) the child would be<lb/>
 entitled only to possess or acquire rights in or to any property of its parents and<lb/>
 not to those of others, in fact, it means such child would not have the status of a<lb/>
 legitimate so far as the persons other than the parents are concerned.<lb/>
</item>

<p>20. A thorough reading of Section 16 makes it clear that there should be<lb/>
 a void or voidable marriage between the parents of the individual who claims the<lb/>
 status of an illegitimate child to get a share from out of the estate of his father. If<lb/>
 there is no proof of any marriage, then the children born cannot also be treated as<lb/>
 illegitimate children entitled for a share. In the judgment reported in Muthayya Vs.<lb/>
 Kamu, 1981 (I) MLJ 107 it has been held as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;The result is there is no proof of any marriage between the first<lb/>
 plaintiff and Meenakshisundaram and that the children born cannot also<lb/>
 be treated as legitimate children.&quot;<lb/>
 ... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>22. In the case on hand there is absolutely no evidence to establish the<lb/>
 question of marriage between Nainamalai and the fourth defendant. More so, both<lb/>
 the courts below have concurrently, on a question of fact, held that there was no<lb/>
 marriage at all in any form between the said Nainamalai and the fourth defendant.<lb/>
 When there is no marriage, the fourth defendant can be only a concubine of the<lb/>
 said Nainamalai. Section 16 of the said Act do not deal with the rights of the<lb/>
 children through the concubinage.<lb/>
 .. ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>25. Even in considering this argument of the learned senior counsel for<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 the appellant, it has to be considered that the presumption of the marriage can be<lb/>
 drawn by the long co-habitation of the man and the woman and their living<lb/>
 together and they have been treated by their relatives and the society as husband<lb/>
 and wife.<lb/>
</item>

<item>26. It is rather unfortunate that the fourth defendants who claims the<lb/>
 status of the second wife and the fifth defendant Arunachalam who claims to be<lb/>
 the legitimate son of the said Nainamalai have not filed any written statement<lb/>
 claiming such plea, The third defendant, the mother of the first defendant and his<lb/>
 brother Nainamalai even though stated that Nainamalai married the fourth<lb/>
 defendant, no particulars with regard to the marriage is forthcoming. In the written<lb/>
 statement filed by the third defendant, adopted by the second defendant, it is<lb/>
 stated that Nainamalai lived with the fourth defendant,No particulars have been<lb/>
 stated with regard to the time of desertion by the second plaintiff, the first wife of<lb/>
 Nainamalai and the period for which the fourth defendant and Nainamalai lived<lb/>
 together. Here also it may be pertinent to note that living together means they<lb/>
 ought to have been lived together for considerably a long period and just the<lb/>
 paramour visiting the place of the concubine cannot be considered to be living<lb/>
 together and which confers a right of inheritance to the children as illegitimate one.<lb/>
 Merely D.W.3 village Karnam has stated that after the death of Nainamalai the<lb/>
 property was divided among his two wives, it cannot be said that the relatives of<lb/>
 the said Nainamalai and the fourth defendant have treated them as husband and<lb/>
 wife. In the absence of any evidence to show that the relatives of both the parties<lb/>
 or the society at large have treated them as husband and wife, no such<lb/>
 presumption can be drawn.&quot;<lb/>

 etc., etc., Vs. E.Devarajan and others):<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;17. In a proceeding, or in other words, in an application filed for grant of<lb/>
 probate or letters of administration, no right is asserted or claimed by the<lb/>
 applicant. The applicant only seeks recognition of the Court to perform a duty.<lb/>
 Probate or letter of Administration issued by a competent Court is conclusive<lb/>
 proof of the legal character throughout the world. An assessment of the relevant<lb/>
 provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 does not convey a meaning that by<lb/>
 the Proceedings filed for grant of probate or letters of administration, no rights of<lb/>
 the applicant are settled or secured in the legal sense. The author of the<lb/>
 testament has cast the duty with regard to the administration of his estate, and the<lb/>
 applicant for probate or letters of administration only seeks the permission of the<lb/>
 Court to perform that duty. There is only a seeking of recognition from the Court to<lb/>
 perform the duty. That duty is only moral and it is not legal. There is no law which<lb/>
 compels the applicant to file the proceedings for probate or letters of<lb/>
 administration. With a view to discharge the moral duty, the applicant seeks<lb/>
 recognition from the Court to perform the duty. It will be legitimate to conclude that<lb/>
 the proceedings filed for grant of probate or letters of administration is not an<lb/>
 action in law. Hence, it is very difficult to and it will not be in order to construe the<lb/>
 proceedings for grant of probate or letters of administration as applications<lb/>
 coming with the meaning of an &apos;application&apos; under Art.137 of the Limitation Act,<lb/>
 1963.<lb/>
 ... .... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>20. We have now, as per our preceding discussion, settled the question<lb/>
 and we hold that Art.137 of the Limitation Act would not apply to proceedings filed<lb/>
 for grant of probate or letters of administration with or without the Will annexed.<lb/>
</item>

<item>http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 Before concluding, we must point out that though the proceedings filed for grant of<lb/>
 probate or letters of administration may not come within the mischief of Art.137 of<lb/>
 the Limitation Act, 1963, yet the delay aspect is relevant to test the genuineness of<lb/>
 the Will propounded. Delay in taking steps gives rise to suspicion and the longer<lb/>
 the delay the stronger the suspicion. .. ... &quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(l) 1989 (2) LW 319 (Madras High Court) (Sakunthala Vs. Minor Vijayalakshmi):<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot; 15. The Parliament thought fit to change the position by introducing the<lb/>
 Limitation Act No. 36 of 1963 which replaced the Act of 1908. As per the<lb/>
 preamble, the new Act is to consolidate and amend the law for the Limitation of<lb/>
 suits and other proceedings and purposes connected therewith. Even the<lb/>
 definition of &apos;Applicant&apos; was changed, which indicated that the Act is intended to<lb/>
 apply to proceedings under the Indian Succession Act also. While in the earlier<lb/>
 Act an &apos;Applicant&apos; was defined as &apos;including any person from or through whom an<lb/>
 applicant derives his right to apply&apos;, the present Act defines an &apos;applicant&apos; as<lb/>
 follows:-<lb/>
&quot;applicant&quot; includes:-<lb/>
</item>

<item>(i) a petitioner;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(ii) any person from or through whom an applicant derives his right to<lb/>
 apply?<lb/>
</item>

<item>(iii) any person whose estate is represented by the applicant as executor.<lb/>
 administrator or other representative.&quot;<lb/>
 The term &apos;application&apos; is defined for the first time in this Act as including a petition.<lb/>
 Thus, there is a clear indication that Original Petitions which may not be covered<lb/>
 by the Code of Civil Procedure would also be within the purview of the present<lb/>
 Act.<lb/>
</item>

<item>16. Art.137 of Act 36 of 1963 is the provision corresponding to Art. 181<lb/>
 of the previous Act. There is a significant change in the language in column (1).<lb/>
 Art. 137 is as follows:<lb/>
 Description of suit<lb/>
 Period of limitation<lb/>
 Time from which<lb/>
 period begins to run<lb/>
</item>

<item>137.<lb/>
 Any<lb/>
 other<lb/>
 application for which no<lb/>
 period of limitation is<lb/>
 provided elsewhere in<lb/>
 this Division.<lb/>
</item>

<item>Three years<lb/>
 When the right to<lb/>
 apply accrues<lb/>
 The language of Art. 137 also makes it clear that the Article is not confined to the<lb/>
 applications under the Code of Civil procedure. Though there was a conflict of<lb/>
 opinions among the Courts in this country as to the applicability of the Article to<lb/>
 applications filed under provisions other than the Code of Civil Procedure, the<lb/>
 controversy was set at rest by the apex Court of the country in The Kerala State<lb/>
 Electricity Board, Trivandrum Vs. T.P.Kunhaliumma (AIR 1977 SC 282). The law is<lb/>
 stated in unmistakable terms in paragraph 18, 21 and 22 of the Judgment, which<lb/>
 are extracted hereunder :<lb/>
</item>

<item>&quot;18. The alteration of the Division as well as the change in the<lb/>
 application in Art.137 of the Limitation Act 1963 compared with Art.181 of<lb/>
 the 1908 Limitation Act shows that applications contemplated under<lb/>
 Art.137 are not applications confined to the Code of Civil Procedure. In<lb/>
 the 1908 Limitation Act there was no division between applications in<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 specified cases and other applications as in the 1963 Limitation Act. The<lb/>
 words &apos;any other application under Art.137 cannot be said on the principle<lb/>
 of ejusdem generies to be application under the Civil Procedure Code<lb/>
 other than those mentioned in Part I of the third Division. Any other<lb/>
 application under Art.137 would be petition or any application under any<lb/>
 Act. But it has to be an application to a Court for the reason that S. 4 and<lb/>
 5 of the 1963 Limitation Act speak of expiry of prescribed period when<lb/>
 Court is closed and extension of prescribed period if applicant or the<lb/>
 appellant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring<lb/>
 the appeal cr making the application during such period.<lb/>
 x<lb/>
 x<lb/>
 x<lb/>
 x<lb/>
 x<lb/>
 21. The changed definition of the words &apos;applicant&apos; and<lb/>
 &apos;application&apos; contained in S.2(a) and 2(b) of the 1963 Limitation Act<lb/>
 indicates the object of the Limitation Act to include petitions, original or<lb/>
 otherwise, under special laws. The interpretation which was given to<lb/>
 Art.181 of the 1908 Limitation Act on the principles of ejusdem geuerise is<lb/>
 not applicable with regard to Art.137 of the 1963 Limitation Act. Art.137<lb/>
 stands in isolation from all other Articles in Part I of the third division. This<lb/>
 Court in Nityananda Joshi&apos;s case (AIR 1970 SC 209), has rightly thrown<lb/>
 doubt on the two Judge Bench decision of this Court in Anthani Municipal<lb/>
 Council case (AIR 1969 SC 1335), where this Court construed Art.137 to<lb/>
 be referable to applications under the Civil Procedure Code. Art.137<lb/>
 includes petitions within the word &apos;applications&apos;. These petitions and<lb/>
 applications can be under any special Act as in the present case.<lb/>
</item>

<item>22. The conclusion we reach is that Art.137 of the 1963 Limitation<lb/>
 Act will apply to any petition or application filed under any Act to a civil<lb/>
 Court. With respect we differ from the view taken by the two Judge Bench<lb/>
 of this Court in Anthani Municipal Council case (AIR 1969 SC 1335), and<lb/>
 hold that Art.137 of the 1963 Limitation Act is not confined to applications<lb/>
 contemplated by or under the Code of Civil Procedure. The petition in the<lb/>
 present case was to the District Judge as a Court. The petition was one<lb/>
 contemplated by the Telegraph Act for judicial decision. The petition is an<lb/>
 application falling within the scope of Art.137 of the 1963 Limitation Act.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<item>17. After the pronouncement of the Supreme Court, it will be futile to<lb/>
 contend that Art.137 does not apply to applications for probate, Letters of<lb/>
 Administration etc. Whatever may be the nature of the proceeding, so long as it is<lb/>
 an application to a Court, it will be governed by Art.137 of the Limitation Act. &quot;No<lb/>
 authority has been placed before me taking a contrary view. The judgment of the<lb/>
 Patna Bench in Ramanand Thakur&apos;s case (AIR 1982 Patna 87), on which reliance<lb/>
 is placed by the plaintiff is also on the footing that Art.137 of the Limitation Act will<lb/>
 apply to an application for grant of probate or Letters of Administration. But, the<lb/>
 Bench proceeded to hold that in the case of an application for grant of probate or<lb/>
 Letters of Administration, it is difficult to find out when the right to apply accrues<lb/>
 and unless that date can be fixed, there is no question of starting of the period of<lb/>
 limitation. With respect to learned Judges who constituted the Bench, I do not<lb/>
 agree. There can be no question of any difficulty at all in finding out as to when<lb/>
 the right to apply accrues in any case. Even if there is any difficulty in fixing the<lb/>
 date, that will not take away the application from the purview of the Article which<lb/>
 has been held to apply to the application. In so far as column (3) of the Article is<lb/>
 concerned, the Court has to decide on the facts and circumstances of each case<lb/>
 as to when the right to apply for the relief prayed for in the application accrued to<lb/>
 the applicant therein. It has been repeatedly held that for the purposes of the third<lb/>
 column, the relevant date is the date on which the right accrued for the first time.<lb/>
</item>

<p>http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 ... ... ..<lb/>
 21. I am afraid, there is a fallacy in the reasoning The word used in the<lb/>
 third column is &apos;accrues&apos;. The term &apos;accrue&apos; has been defined in the Oxford<lb/>
 Dictionary as &quot;to arise or spring as a natural growth or result; to grow, grow up&quot;.<lb/>
 A right which has accrued cannot be said to accrue every day until it is exercised.<lb/>
</p>

<item>In the absence of a provision for limitation, every right will continue to subsist till it<lb/>
 is actually exercised. For example, a creditor has a right to recover the money<lb/>
 due to him from his debtor. His right continues to exist so long as the debtor does<lb/>
 not repay. If there is no provision in the Limitation Act prescribing a time limit for<lb/>
 instituting a proceeding for recovery of the money due to the creditor, the creditor<lb/>
 can file a suit or other proceeding at any time he chooses. In that case also it can<lb/>
 be said that his right to recover the money arises every day. But, the Limitation<lb/>
 Act has prescribed a period with in which the creditor is bound to file a suit for<lb/>
 recovery of the money and by the third column in the Schedule, the relevant date<lb/>
 from which the limitation begins to run is also fixed by the statute. Similarly, in the<lb/>
 case of a trespass, the owner of the property has a right to recover possession<lb/>
 The commencement of the right was on the date of trespass. It will never end if<lb/>
 there is no provision in the Limitation Act prescribing a period of Limitation for<lb/>
 instituting a proceeding for recovery of possession. In that case also it can be<lb/>
 said that his right to recover possession arises from day to day and every<lb/>
 moment so long as the trespasser continues to be in possession. Hence, it will be<lb/>
 fallacious to keep out a particular type of application from the scope of Art. 137 of<lb/>
 the Limitation Act on the basis of the reasoning that the right to apply accrues<lb/>
 from day to day and every moment. If on a reference to the language in the third<lb/>
 column, the date on which the right to apply accrues for the first time is fixed,<lb/>
 then the right comes to an end at the end of three years therefrom. There can be<lb/>
 no escape from that position.<lb/>
</item>

<item>22. The probable reason for which the statutes of limitation passed in the<lb/>
 19th century excluded from their purview the proceedings for probate or Letters<lb/>
 of Administration etc., as suggested by Muttusami Ayyar,J, is caught hold of by<lb/>
 the Patna Bench in Ramanad Thakur&apos;s case (AIR 1982 Patna 87) as well as a<lb/>
 single Judge of the Bombay High Court in a later case, to which I will refer<lb/>
 presently. I have already referred to the fact that the question which arose before<lb/>
 the great Judge did not turn on the interpretation of column 3 of the Schedule.<lb/>
 Having found that the provisions of the entire Act as it stood then exempted<lb/>
 applications for probate from the operation thereof, the learned Judge in his<lb/>
 wisdom ventured to give a reason which could have probably prompted the<lb/>
 Legislature to make such an exemption. It should not also be forgotten that the<lb/>
 observation made by the learned Judge is applicable only to an application for<lb/>
 probate at the instance of an executor. The position with reference to an executor<lb/>
 does not arise for my consideration in the present case. The discussion of the<lb/>
 question in this case confines itself to applications for Letters of Administration. A<lb/>
 legatee who applies for Letters of Administration can by no stretch of imagination<lb/>
 be compared to a trustee or be called a testamentary trustee. It cannot be said<lb/>
 that he is seeking permission of the Court to perform a duty created by the will,<lb/>
 for, no duty is imposed upon the legatee by the will. Even if it is so, the application<lb/>
 to this Court is one for grant of Letters of Administration with the will annexed.<lb/>
 The right to apply for the said relief accrued in favour of the applicant more than a<lb/>
 decade before the presentation of the application. On the facts of this case, the<lb/>
 relevant dates have already been set out and for the purpose of convenience,<lb/>
 they are repeated here. The testator died on 12.2.1944. The two executors<lb/>
 appointed under the will died before 1970 (the exact date does not appear in the<lb/>
 records). The first beneficiary Rajambal died on 27.3.1970. Even assuming that<lb/>
 the right of the plaintiff to apply for Letters of administration did not accrue on any<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 earlier date, it cannot be denied that it accrued on 27.3.1970, on the death of<lb/>
 Rajambal. Even if it can be said by any process of reasoning of which I am not<lb/>
 aware, the right to apply did not accrue on that date, the date could not be later<lb/>
 than 1.10.1973 when the plaintiff&apos;s brother Nithyanandham sold the property to<lb/>
 defendants 4 and 5. The plaintiff, who was aware of the fact, filed a suit in the<lb/>
 City Civil Court in 1974 and the claim put forward by her under the will was<lb/>
 contested immediately in 1976 by the defendants therein. In spite of that, the<lb/>
 plaintiff did not choose to present the application for probate till 9.11.1983. Unless<lb/>
 the Court closes its eyes to the provisions of Art.137 of the Limitation Act and<lb/>
 ignores the same altogether, the present proceeding instituted by the plaintiff<lb/>
 cannot be held to be in time.<lb/>
</item>

<item>23. There is a judgment of a single Judge of the Bombay High Court<lb/>
 which was not cited by either counsel in this case. That is a decision by Lentin. J.,<lb/>
 in Vasudev Daulatram Sadarangani Vs. Sajni Prem Lalwani (AIR 1983 Bombay<lb/>
 268). The learned Judge held that under the Limitation Act 1963, no period is<lb/>
 advisedly prescribed within which a petition for probate or Letters of<lb/>
 administration or succession certificate must be made and that the right to apply<lb/>
 under Art. 137 of the Act would accrue when it becomes necessary to apply<lb/>
 which need not necessarily be within three years from the date of death of the<lb/>
 deceased. It is seen that paragraphs 13 to 16 of the judgment are alone<lb/>
 approved for reporting by the Bombay High Court and they alone find a place in<lb/>
 the report. Hence, it is not possible to know the facts of the case, particularly as<lb/>
 to whether the application before the learned Judge was one for probate or letters<lb/>
 of administration. The Learned Judge drew inspiration from the judgment of<lb/>
 Muttusami Ayyar, J. in Gnanamuthu Upadesi&apos;s case (ILR 17 Mad.379), and took<lb/>
 the view that the right to apply may accrue as and when it becomes necessary to<lb/>
 apply. With respect to the learned Judge, I do not know how the proposition laid<lb/>
 down by the Learned Judge flows from the observation made by Muttusami<lb/>
 Ayyar, J. in Gnanamuthu Upades&apos;s case (ILR 17 Mad. 379). The reasoning is<lb/>
 also not correct. The decision of the Supreme Court in The Kerala State<lb/>
 Electricity Board, Trivandium Vs. T.V.Kunhaliumma (AIR 1977 SC 282), was<lb/>
 brought to the notice of the Learned Judge. Yet, he took the view that the<lb/>
 observations made by the Supreme Court will have nothing to do with the<lb/>
 exercise of a continuous right of an executor seeking the Court&apos;s permission to<lb/>
 perform the duties cast on him by the Will. If the case before the Learned Judge<lb/>
 related to an application for probate by an executor, I will have nothing to do with<lb/>
 it. As stated already, I am not called upon to decide in this case, the question of<lb/>
 limitation for filing an application for probate by an executor. If the judgment of<lb/>
 Lentin,J. pertained to an application for letters of administration, I express my<lb/>
 dissent with the view taken by the learned Judge. In my opinion, the Judgment<lb/>
 runs counter to the ruling of the Supreme Court in the Kerala State Electricity<lb/>
 Board&apos;s case (AIR 1977 SC 282).<lb/>
 .... ...<lb/>
</item>

<item>27. Reliance was placed by the plaintiff on the provisions of 0.25, R. 9 of<lb/>
 the Original Side Rules. The rule is in the following terms:-<lb/>
&quot;In any case where probate or letters of Administration is for the<lb/>
 first time applied for after the lapse of three years, from the death of the<lb/>
 deceased, the reason for the delay shall be explained in the petition.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>The rule remains unamended even after the passing of the Limitation Act 36 of<lb/>
 1963. In any event, a provision in the Original Side rules cannot override the<lb/>
 provision in the Limitation Act. Once it is held that Art. 137 of the Limitation Act<lb/>
 will apply and the present proceeding is barred by time, 0.25, R.9 of the Original<lb/>
 side Rules will not help the plaintiff in any manner.&quot;<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
</p>

<p>21. Upon hearing the learned counsel appearing for both parties and perusing the<lb/>
 records, it is seen that the following facts are admitted by both sides:<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan married Rajalakshmi and their marriage invitation is marked as<lb/>
 Ex.D-1. The first defendant is their daughter and the second defendant is their son. The plaintiff-<lb/>
N.Renuka Devi, R.Vijayalakshmi @ R.Vijaya and R.S.P.Dhanurmathi are the daughters and<lb/>
 S.V.R.Ramprasad is the son of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and S.V.R.Saroja, the second<lb/>
 wife of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan. The testator S.V.Ramakrishnan died on 31.12.1980 and<lb/>
 his Death Certificate is marked as Ex.D-23. Late S.V.Ramakrishnan and the second defendant<lb/>
 earlier filed a suit for re-conveyance of the properties mentioned in the suit in C.S.No.43 of 1962<lb/>
 before this Court, against one Buhari and another and the plaint copy in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is<lb/>
 marked as Ex.P-71 = Ex.D-13. The judgment, dated 10.11.1965 rendered in C.S.No.43 of 1962<lb/>
 is marked as Ex.P-72 = Ex.D-14. As against the said judgment, dated 10.11.1965 in C.S.No.43 of<lb/>
 1962, the appeals in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 were preferred, which were disposed of by the<lb/>
 Division Bench of this Court on 10.05.1972, against which, Civil Appeal in C.A.No.224 of 1974<lb/>
 was preferred before the Supreme Court. The copy of the affidavit filed in I.A.No.2 of 2008 in<lb/>
 C.A.No.224 of 1974 filed before the Supreme Court is marked as Ex.P-78. The judgment dated<lb/>
 17.04.1995 passed by the Supreme Court in C.A.No.224 of 1974 is marked as Ex.P-28, with<lb/>
 amended cause title therein, which is marked as Ex.P-29. Subsequently E.P.No.48 of 1997 in<lb/>
 C.S.No.43 of 1962 was preferred by S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar (since deceased) and S.V.Matha<lb/>
 Prasad, the second defendant herein, and the order dated 07.07.2000 passed in the said E.P. is<lb/>
 marked as Ex.D-6. The counter affidavit filed by the second defendant herein in A.Nos.2872 and<lb/>
 2873 of 2000 in E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-55. The copy of the<lb/>
 order dated 24.08.2000 passed in A.Nos.2872 and 2873 of 2000 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked<lb/>
 as Ex.P-56 = Ex.D-18. The suit properties in item Nos.3 and 4 are not specifically included in the<lb/>
 Will and the Will does not contain any specific properties.<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
</p>

<p>22. Learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff contended that Late S.V.Ramakrishnan<lb/>
 executed the Will on 15.07.1970 out of free consent and in a sound and disposing state of mind in<lb/>
 the presence of two attesting witnesses, namely T.S.Ramadoss and Dr.R.Paul Doraiswamy and<lb/>
 the Will was duly registered on the next day, i.e. 16.07.1970 in the Sub-Registrar Office. It is<lb/>
 useful to quote the contents of Ex.P-1 Will executed by the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan, dated<lb/>
 15.07.1970, registered on 16.07.1970, which reads as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;I, S.V.RAMAKRISHNAN, son of S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar, Hindu, aged<lb/>
 50 years, residing at &quot; Ramamandiram&quot; No.471, Poonamalle High Road, Madras,<lb/>
 make this Last Will and Testament the day month and year written below:<lb/>
 I am now 50 years old and am keeping indifferent health. My first wife,<lb/>
 Rajalakshmi, died in March 1952, leaving behind a son, Matha Prasad, and a<lb/>
 daughter Lalitha. Matha Prasad and myself entered into a family arrangement in<lb/>
 May, 1969 and he has left me. My daughter, Lalitha, married against my wishes,<lb/>
 and hence I do not propose to leave anything to her.<lb/>
 I am living with Srimathi Saroja, and we are living as husband and wife,<lb/>
 even though there has not been a marriage between us. I have two daughters<lb/>
 and a son through her. I want to make provision for them and after careful<lb/>
 deliberation have decided to execute this Will.<lb/>
 It will not be possible now to detail the properties, immoveables,<lb/>
 moveable, cash, etc., that I may die possessed of. Hence I do not propose to<lb/>
 detail them.<lb/>
 All the properties, immoveable, cash in Bank, Securities, moveables,<lb/>
 such as furniture, paintings, shares, etc., I hereby bequeath as follows:-<lb/>
All the properties on the date of my death shall be taken over by the<lb/>
 Official Trustee, or such officer or person appointed by Court, and he shall deal<lb/>
 with them as follows:-<lb/>
</item>

<item>(a) The Official Trustee shall pay Rs.200/-a month to Srimathi Saroja<lb/>
 who is living with me as my wife.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(b) The Official Trustee shall pay for the education and maintenance of<lb/>
 my children through Saroja, i.e. Vijaya, Rama Prasad and Renuka Devi.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(c) The properties shall be held by the Official Trustee till my youngest<lb/>
 daughter Renuka completes the age of 18. Then a sum of Rupees one Lakh or<lb/>
 property worth a Lakh of rupees shall be given to Vijaya and Rama Prasad. The<lb/>
 remainder shall be handed over to Renuka Devi. Renuka Devi shall pay Rs.200/-<lb/>
per month to her mother, Saroja, for her maintenance. The properties handed<lb/>
 over to Renuka Devi shall be enjoyed by her for life and shall be inherited<lb/>
 absolutely by her children.<lb/>
 In case any of my above children leave the Hindu fold or marry a non-<lb/>
Hindu, they will not be entitled to the Legacy conferred by me. On such<lb/>
 disqualification, the Legacy will be taken equally by my other children through<lb/>
 Saroja.<lb/>
 My son, Matha Prasad, or my daughter, Lalitha, shall not be entitled to<lb/>
 any share or interest in the properties left by me.<lb/>
 My last rites shall be performed by Rama Prasad.<lb/>
 I hereby revoke all the previous Wills executed by me. This Will shall take<lb/>
 effect only after my lifetime and I reserve the rights to modify or cancel this Will.<lb/>
 In witness whereof, I, the said S.V.Ramakrishnan, have to this my Last<lb/>

<p>23. From the above extracted contents of the Will, it is clear that the Will was executed<lb/>
 by S.V.Ramakrishnan on 15.07.1970 and it was registered on 16.07.1970 as Document No.39 of<lb/>
 1970. Since both the attesting witnesses to the Will, namely T.S.Ramadoss and Dr.R.Paul<lb/>
 Doraiswamy, died, for proving the Will, on the side of the plaintiff, P.W.2 B.Murali Kumar, the<lb/>
 grand-son of T.S.Ramadoss, was examined and he deposed in his chief-examination as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot;I am the grandson of T.S.Ramadoss. I am well acquainted with his<lb/>
 signature. I am filing proof affidavit before the Hon&apos;ble Court and the same may<lb/>
 be treated as part of my evidence. Ex.P30 is the third party affidavit filed by me<lb/>
 along with OP. My grandfather T.S.Ramadoss was the Correspondent in<lb/>
 Jeevarathinammal High School Trust, Thiruverkadu. Ex.P-31 is the letter dated<lb/>
 26.07.1984 written by the Managing Trustee and Correspondent of<lb/>
 Jeevarathinammal High School Trust, Thiruverkadu to Mrs.Jaya Srinivasan<lb/>
 acknowledging the receipt of donation. (The witness was shown the xerox copy<lb/>
 of the Will dated 15.07.1970 and was asked to identify the signature of his<lb/>
 grandfather. The witness has identified the signature of his grandfather as<lb/>
 attesting witness No.1). Ex.P-32 is the xerox copy of the Will dated 15.07.1970<lb/>
 executed by Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan in which the signature of T.S.Ramadoss is<lb/>
 found as attesting witness No.1 (The original of Ex.P-32 is marked as Ex.P-1).&quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>24. Further, P.W.2 in his cross-examination has stated as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>&quot; .... .... The writing at page 3 of Ex.P-1 Will, namely &quot;Mr.T.S.Ramadoss,<lb/>
 son of late T.Sadagopan, Sridevi Upsagar Sridevi Karumariyamman<lb/>
 devasthanam, Thiruverkadu, Madras-56&quot; is the handwriting of my grandfather<lb/>
 Mr.T.S.Ramadoss. The signature found at page 2 of the Will Ex.P-1 as an<lb/>
 attesting witness No.1 is that of my grandfather Mr.T.S.Ramadoss. I deny the<lb/>
 suggestion that the signature of my grandfather in Ex.P1 as well as his signature<lb/>
 found at Ex.P-31 are not one and the same. I deny the suggestion that the name<lb/>
 and address of Mr.T.S.Ramadoss written at page 3 of the Will Ex.P-1 is not in the<lb/>
 handwriting of my grandfather. I deny the suggestion that since I happened to be<lb/>
 the friend of Ramprasad, son of S.V.Ramakrishnan, I have come to Court to<lb/>
 given evidence in their favour. &quot;<lb/>
</p>

<p>25. Furthermore, in order to prove the signature of another attesting witness to the Will,<lb/>
 namely, Dr.R.Paul Doraiswamy, to the Will, P.W.5 Dr.Philip Rajanna Doraiswamy was examined<lb/>
 and in his chief-examination, he has stated as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;I am filing my proof affidavit before this Hon&apos;ble Court and the same may<lb/>
 be treated as part of my evidence. I know the signature of my father Dr.Paul<lb/>
 Rajanna Doraiswamy. The Will Ex.P-1 was shown to the witness and was asked<lb/>
 to identify his father&apos;s signature therein. The witness has identified his father&apos;s<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 signature in Ex.P-1 as attesting witness No.2. Ex.P-37 is the cumulative record<lb/>
 issued to me by Don Bosco Matriculation School, Madras-8 in which my father<lb/>
 has signed in the column intended for parents signature at page 3. Ex.P-38 is the<lb/>
 third party affidavit signed and filed along with O.P.No.367/2008 which is<lb/>
 converted as T.O.S.No.2/2009.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>26. Further, P.W.5 in his cross-examination, has stated as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;Dr.R.Paul Doraiswamy had two children. I am the youngest. My elder<lb/>
 sister is a doctor. She is a citizen of USA. My father died on 30.04.1979. I met<lb/>
 Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan. Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan was my father&apos;s friend and at that<lb/>
 time, I was about 18 years of old and I know Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan and used to<lb/>
 address him as uncle. Both Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan as well as my father did not<lb/>
 mention about the existence of the Will executed by Mr.S.V.Ramakrishnan. The<lb/>
 signature of my father Dr.Paul Doraiswamy in Ex.P-1 as well as Ex.P-37 is the<lb/>
 same and they do not differ. ... ....&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>27. On a reading of the above evidence of P.Ws.2 and 5, it is seen that they have filed<lb/>
 third party affidavits in the O.P. in Exs.P-30 and P-38 respectively. P.W.2 is the grand-son of the<lb/>
 attesting witness to the Will, namely T.S.Ramadoss and P.W.2 has identified the signature of<lb/>
 T.S.Ramadoss in Ex.P-1 Will. P.W.5 is the son of another attesting witness to the Will, namely<lb/>
 Dr.R.Paul Doraiswamy and P.W.5 has identified the signature of Dr.R.Paud Doraiswamy in<lb/>
 Ex.P-1 Will. In order to prove the signature of the attesting witness--T.S.Ramadoss, P.W.2 has<lb/>
 produced the donation receipt, which is marked as Ex.P-31, in which, the signature of the said<lb/>
 T.S.Ramadoss if found. Similarly, P.W.5 also produced the cumulative record issued to him by<lb/>
 Don Bosco Matriculation School, Chennai, which is marked as Ex.P-37, in which P.W.5&apos;s father,<lb/>
 i.e. Dr.R.Paul Doraiswamy has signed in the column intended for parents signature. Thus, it is<lb/>
 clear that the signatures of both the attesting witness in the above said respective documents, are<lb/>
 the same as found in Ex.P-1 Will. Therefore, the signatures of both the attesting witness to the<lb/>
 Will, have been proved by P.W.2 and P.W.5 respectively. It is admitted that both the attesting<lb/>
 witness to the Will, are not alive at the time of examination of witness in the T.O.S. Even though<lb/>
 the Will was registered by the Sub-Registrar, on a reading of the Will, it is clear that the Sub-<lb/>
Registrar has gone to the private residence of the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan at Door No.471,<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 Poonamallee High Road, Madras-10 and in his presence, the Will was executed and it was later<lb/>
 on registered as Document No.39 of 1970 in the Sub-Registrar&apos;s Office on 16.07.1970 before the<lb/>
 Sub-Registrar, Purasawalkam, who has also signed therein. Therefore, Ex.P-1 Will is proved by<lb/>
 the plaintiff by adducing oral and documentary evidence regarding the execution of the Will and<lb/>
 the signatures of the attesting witness therein, even though the attesting witness are not alive.<lb/>
</p>

<p>28. Even though the Will was executed in 1970, it was produced in the Court in the O.P.<lb/>
 proceedings only in 2008, i.e. more than 30 years after the execution of the Will and even though<lb/>
 P.Ws.2 and 5 were cross-examined on the side of the defendants, they have not denied that the<lb/>
 signatures of the attesting to the Will, are not that of the respective attesting witness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>29. The main allegation raised by the defendants in their written statement is that the Will<lb/>
 was executed by the testator upon undue influence. It is admitted case of both sides that<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan, at the time of execution of the Will, was aged about 50 years and the main<lb/>
 beneficiary mentioned in the Will is Renuka Devi, who is the plaintiff herein and at that time, she<lb/>
 has not completed the age of 18 years. Therefore, it is clear that there cannot be any undue<lb/>
 influence by the beneficiary against S.V.Ramakrishnan to get the Will executed in her favour.<lb/>
 Therefore, the argument of the learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants that the<lb/>
 Will is obtained by undue influence, cannot be accepted.<lb/>
</p>

<p>30. Further, there is a specific clause in the Will regarding exclusion of the defendants,<lb/>
 namely Lalitha and Matha Prasad. Moreover, the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan has executed the<lb/>
 Will out of free consent and in a sound and disposing state of mind, without any influence of any<lb/>
 party. In the above circumstances, it has to be held that Ex.P-1 Will executed by<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan is proved in accordance with law before this Court.<lb/>
</p>

<p>31. From the specific averments made in Ex.P-1 Will, it is seen that there is description of<lb/>
 any property. In the Will, it is specifically stated that, &quot;It will not be possible now to detail the<lb/>
 properties, immovable, movable, cash, etc., that I may die possessed of. Hence I do not propose<lb/>
 to detail them.&quot; It is further stated in the Will as follows:<lb/>
 All the properties, immoveable, cash in Bank, Securities, moveables,<lb/>
 such as furniture, paintings, shares, etc., I hereby bequeath as follows:-<lb/>
</p>

<item>http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 All the properties on the date of my death shall be taken over by the<lb/>
 Official Trustee, or such officer or person appointed by Court, and he shall deal<lb/>
 with them as follows:-<lb/>
</item>

<item>(a) The Official Trustee shall pay Rs.200/-a month to Srimathi Saroja<lb/>
 who is living with me as my wife.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(b) The Official Trustee shall pay for the education and maintenance of<lb/>
 my children through Saroja, i.e. Vijaya, Rama Prasad and Renuka Devi.<lb/>
</item>

<item>(c) The properties shall be held by the Official Trustee till my youngest<lb/>
 daughter Renuka completes the age of 18. Then a sum of Rupees one Lakh or<lb/>
 property worth a Lakh of rupees shall be given to Vijaya and Rama Prasad. The<lb/>
 remainder shall be handed over to Renuka Devi. Renuka Devi shall pay Rs.200/-<lb/>
per month to her mother, Saroja, for her maintenance. The properties handed<lb/>
 over to Renuka Devi shall be enjoyed by her for life and shall be inherited<lb/>
 absolutely by her children.<lb/>
 In case any of my above children leave the Hindu fold or marry a non-<lb/>
Hindu, they will not be entitled to the Legacy conferred by me. On such<lb/>
 disqualification, the Legacy will be taken equally by my other children through<lb/>
 Saroja. ..... ...&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>32. Hence, as per the above recitals in Ex.P-1 Will, it is clear that it does not contain any<lb/>
 list of properties--movables, immovables, cash, etc., and the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan has<lb/>
 given certain conditions in the Will, as extracted above, regarding the devolving of the properties<lb/>
 to the beneficiary/beneficiaries on the date of his death. It is seen that there are four suit<lb/>
 properties in the T.O.S (as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along with O.P). Regarding<lb/>
 item Nos.3 and 4 of the suit properties, which are mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along<lb/>
 with O.P. (T.O.S), on verification of the records, i.e. the copy of the judgment, dated 10.11.1965 in<lb/>
 C.S.No.43 of 1962, marked in Ex.P-72 = Ex.D-14, it is seen that item No.1 mentioned in suit<lb/>
 schedule property in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is item No.4 as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed<lb/>
 along with O.P (T.O.S) and item No.2 mentioned in the suit schedule in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is item<lb/>
 No.3 as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along with O.P (T.O.S). It is admitted by both<lb/>
 sides that at the time of execution of the Will, those items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (affidavit<lb/>
 of assets filed along with O.P (T.O.S) ) are the respective suit schedule properties in C.S.No.43 of<lb/>
 1962 and C.S.No.43 of 1962 was pending in the stage of appeal before the Supreme Court, as<lb/>
 detailed in the earlier paragraphs of this judgment and the Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974 was<lb/>
 disposed of by the Supreme Court on 17.04.1995. Ex.P-29 is the copy of the said judgment, dated<lb/>
 17.04.1995 rendered by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974, whereas the Will is<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 dated 15.07.1970 and in the meantime, the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan died on 31.12.1980.<lb/>
 Therefore, upto the date of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974,<lb/>
 both the plaintiff and the defendants have no right, title or interest over the suit properties in item<lb/>
 Nos.3 and 4. Hence, it is clear that S.V.Ramakrishnan has not possessed of item Nos.3 and 4 of<lb/>
 the suit properties in T.O.S (O.P) at the time of execution of the Will, which does not even contain<lb/>
 any specific properties that he might have been possessed of at the time of his death. Therefore,<lb/>
 this Court is of the considered view that items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (as mentioned in the<lb/>
 affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P) are not covered under Ex.P-1 Will, since they are not<lb/>
 specifically stated in the Will.<lb/>
</p>

<p>33. On the side of the plaintiff, they have produced Ex.P-11 copy of the registered family<lb/>
 settlement deed in Document No.1305 of 1970, dated 22.05.1969, entered into between the<lb/>
 plaintiff&apos;s father and the second defendant. In the said Ex.P-11 family settlement deed, the<lb/>
 deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan was shown as party of the first part and his son-Matha Prasad, who<lb/>
 is the second defendant herein, was shown as party of the second part. In the said Ex.P-11 family<lb/>
 settlement deed, it is stated as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;... .... the parties herein being members of an ancient and respectable<lb/>
 family have with a view to avoid wasteful litigation and for the sake of peace and<lb/>
 preservation of the honour and dignity of the family have after prolonged<lb/>
 discussions agreed to settle their differences as evidenced by this family<lb/>
 Arrangement and agreement Now by this deed witnesseth (1) the party of the<lb/>
 second part shall hereafter possess and enjoy the the properties set out in the<lb/>
 schedule here to as full owner thereof and shall take the same absolutely with all<lb/>
 powers of alienation such as sale gift mortgage will or otherwise in full quit and<lb/>
 final settlement of all his claims. (2) The party of the first part releases and<lb/>
 relinquishes all his rights title and interest in the properties mentioned in schedule<lb/>
 hereunder. The party of the second part shall seize the properties mentioned in<lb/>
 the schedule hereunder and shall possess and enjoy the same absolutely and the<lb/>
 party of the first part shall not in any way interfere in respect of the properties<lb/>
 mentioned in the schedule hereunder. (3) The party of the second part shall also<lb/>
 be entitled to withdraw a sum of Rs.45,000/-only from and out of the additional<lb/>
 compensation now awarded in A.S.No.428 of 1963 high court, Madras. He shall<lb/>
 not be entitled to any further sum or to costs of the appeal. (4) The party of the<lb/>
 second part shall have no manner of right title interest or claim to the properties or<lb/>
 offices following from the estate of S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar and now held by<lb/>
 the party of the first part or any property immoveable moveable compensation<lb/>
 costs cash amounts in Court Deposit etc or to any office held now by the party of<lb/>
 the first part or that he may get as a result of the litigation now pending except the<lb/>
 properties that are mentioned in the schedule hereunder and the sum of<lb/>
 Rs.45,000/-mentioned in clause 3 supra the party of the second part hereby<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 releases and relinquishes all right title benefit or claim that he may have to all<lb/>
 other properties inmoveable and moveable now held by the party of the first part<lb/>
 and to all the properties offices rights title benefits claims compensations costs<lb/>
 amounts in Court deposit etc. that the party of first part may get himself and or out<lb/>
 of the benefits following from the estate of S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar and or as a<lb/>
 result of the litigations now pending the party of second party also hereby releases<lb/>
 and relinquishes in favour of the party of first part all the properties benefit cost<lb/>
 etc. that may be got in litigations now pending in which the party of the second<lb/>
 part is a party. The party of the second part shall not also be a heir to the estate of<lb/>
 the party of the first part. .... ...&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>34. Further, on a perusal of the schedule mentioned properties in Ex.P-11 family<lb/>
 settlement deed, it is seen that item Nos.1 and 2 of the suit properties herein (i.e. affidavit of<lb/>
 assets in O.P.No.367 of 2008 / T.O.S.No.2 of 2009) are not stated as properties in the said family<lb/>
 settlement deed as belonging to Late S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar. Further, after the said family<lb/>
 settlement deed, the second defendant herein, namely S.V.Matha Prasad has filed a suit in<lb/>
 C.S.No.99 of 1971 against the father of the plaintiff and the defendants herein, namely<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and the plaint copy in C.S.No.99 of 1971 is marked as Ex.P-12. The<lb/>
 said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 was filed for declaration that the plaintiff therein (S.V.Matha<lb/>
 Prasad) is entitled to one half in the joint family properties of Late Sri.S.V.Ramaswami Mudaliar,<lb/>
 described in the schedules therein and also for other reliefs. In the said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971,<lb/>
 the defendant therein, namely S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar has filed written statement, the copy of<lb/>
 which is marked as Ex.P-13. In the said written statement, S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar has stated<lb/>
 in paragraph 21 that, &quot;The plaintiff cannot maintain this action unless and until settlement deed<lb/>
 executed by him is set aside. The present suit is therefore not maintainable.&quot; Subsequently, the<lb/>
 said suit in C.S.No.99 of 1971 was dismissed as not pressed being settled out of Court, on<lb/>
 30.10.1972, which is marked as Ex.P-14.<lb/>
</p>

<p>35. Therefore, from the above documents, it is clear that the second defendant herein has<lb/>
 released and relinquished his rights as per Ex.P-11 family settlement deed and hence, he has no<lb/>
 right or claim over the properties even allotted to S.V.Ramaswamy Mudaliar, who was the father<lb/>
 of the plaintiff and the defendants herein. Thus, the argument of the learned Senior Counsels<lb/>
 appearing for the defendants that items 1 and 2 of the suit properties in T.O.S. are joint family<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 properties and the parties are entitled for partition of the same, and that the testator<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan cannot bequeath the properties by way of the Will executed by him, is not<lb/>
 sustainable. As already stated, Ex.P-11 family settlement deed was executed between the father-<lb/>
S.V.Ramakrishnan and son-Matha Prasad (second defendant herein) and subsequently, the<lb/>
 second defendant-S.V.Matha Prasad filed C.S.No.99 of 1971, which was dismissed as not<lb/>
 pressed being settled out of Court, which is evident from Ex.P-14 judgment copy in C.S.No.99 of<lb/>
 1971, dated 30.10.1972. In view of all these facts, the argument of the learned Senior Counsels<lb/>
 appearing for the defendants that the item Nos.1 and 2 of the suit properties in T.O.S. were in the<lb/>
 hands of the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan and they cannot be treated as his separate properties<lb/>
 and they are joint family properties and that the defendants have every right and share in the<lb/>
 properties and they cannot be bequeathed by the testator, is not acceptable.<lb/>
</p>

<p>36. After the death of the testator S.V.Ramakrishnan on 31.12.1980, Mrs.Saroja and<lb/>
 others, including the plaintiff and the defendants herein, executed the following sale deeds (Exs.P-<lb/>
15 to P-18) and the relevant portion of the recitals therein are extracted hereunder :<lb/>
</p>

 marked as Ex.P-15:-<lb/>

</p>

<p>37. On a reading of the above said four sale deeds in Exs.P-15 to P-18, more particularly,<lb/>
 Ex.P-15 sale deed, dated 01.07.1983, it is clear that S.V.Ramakrishnan&apos;s wife, namely Saroja and<lb/>
 her children, including the plaintiff and the defendants herein, have jointly executed the sale deed<lb/>
 in favour of the respective parties. It is also stated in the said sale deed that the first vendor<lb/>
 therein (Saroja) is the second wife of the testator in this T.O.S., namely late S.V.Ramakrishnan,<lb/>
 who died on 31.12.1980, leaving behind him the vendors 1 to 7 (Saroja, Vijaya, Rama Prasad,<lb/>
 Renuka Devi (plaintiff), Dhanurmathi, Lalitha (first defendant) and Matha Prasad (second<lb/>
 defendant) ) as specified in the said sale deed as legal heirs/children of late S.V.Ramakrishnan<lb/>
 and it is specifically stated that the first vendor-Saroja is the second wife of the said<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and the second to fourth vendors are children of the said<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar through the first vendor-Saroja. It is also further clear from the said<lb/>
 sale deed that late S.V.Ramakrishna executed the Will, dated 15.07.1970, nominating the above<lb/>
 said first to fifth vendors as his legatees and it is specifically stated therein that the Will is yet to be<lb/>
 probated. It is also stated in the said sale deed that the terms of the agreement of sale executed<lb/>
 by late S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar, dated 30.07.1980, were confirmed in writing by a Rectification<lb/>
 Deed as specified therein. It is further stated in the said sale deed that the Sixth vendor (Lalitha)<lb/>
 and the seventh vendor (Matha Prasad) are also the children of late S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar<lb/>
 through his first wife--Rajalakshmi, who died in March 1952 and claimed that they are legal<lb/>
 representatives of late S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar. Hence, it is clear that there is a mention of the<lb/>
 Will, dated 15.07.1970 in the said sale deed and the names of the defendants 1 and 2 herein<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 have been specified in those sale deeds as co-executants of the relevant documents.<lb/>
</p>

<p>38. It is further to be noted that M/s.Lakshmi Builders, represented by its partner, filed a<lb/>
 Civil Suit before this Court in C.S.No.469 of 1981, against Saroja and her children and another,<lb/>
 including the plaintiff and the defendants 1 and 2 herein, for specific performance and the copy of<lb/>
 the plaint in the said C.S.No.469 of 1981 is marked as Ex.P-25 and the copies of the orders,<lb/>
 dated 17.03.1982 and 12.02.1997 passed in the said C.S.No.469 of 1981 are marked as Exs.P-<lb/>
26 and 27, which are based on compromise between the parties and settled out of Court. Hence,<lb/>
 it is clear that after the death of the testator S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar, M/s.Lakshmi Builders<lb/>
 filed the said suit against the heirs of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and subsequently,<lb/>
 the said suit was disposed of based on the compromise between the parties and settled out of<lb/>
 Court, which is evident from the above said orders passed in the said suit in C.S.No.469 of 1981,<lb/>
 which is marked as Exs.P-26 and P-27.<lb/>
</p>

<p>39. It is further seen that the first defendant herein filed a Civil Suit before this Court<lb/>
 seeking permission to sue as an indigent person, declaration, permanent injuctions, directions<lb/>
 etc., against the plaintiff herein and the second defendant herein and others, and the copy of the<lb/>
 plaint in the said Civil Suit is marked as Ex.P-45. It is also seen that the present defendants filed<lb/>
 a suit in O.S.No.6784 of 1996 before the City Civil Court, Madras, against Rama Prasad, Saroja,<lb/>
 Vijaya and Renuka Devi (plaintiff herein) for declaration that the plaintiffs therein (defendants<lb/>
 herein) are the legal heirs of late S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and as such, they have all legal<lb/>
 rights over all the properties left by the said S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and also for consequential<lb/>
 injunction restraining the defendants therein (plaintiff herein and others) from in any manner<lb/>
 interfering with any of the properties left by the said S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar and the copy of<lb/>
 the plaint in that suit in O.S.No.6784 of 1996 is marked as Ex.P-46 and the clean copy of the<lb/>
 plaint fled in O.S.No.6784 of 1996 is marked as Ex.P-53. The copy of the written statement filed<lb/>
 by the defendants 1 and 2 therein, namely Ram Prasad and Saroja in O.S.No.6784 of 1996 is<lb/>
 marked as Ex.P-47. Subsequently, by order dated 01.08.2007 (Ex.P-48), the plaint in said suit in<lb/>
 O.S.No.6784 of 1996 was returned for being presented before a proper forum, as that Court had<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 no pecuniary jurisdiction to try the suit. Therefore, it is clear that after the death of the testator<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan, both the defendants herein have filed the said suit in O.S.No.6784 of 1996,<lb/>
 which was returned for presentation before proper forum. But, there is no evidence placed on<lb/>
 record before this Court to show that the said plaint in O.S.No.6784 of 1996 was subsequently re-<lb/>
presented before proper Court.<lb/>
</p>

<p>40. As already observed in the earlier paragraphs, the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and<lb/>
 the second defendant-S.V.Mathaprasad earlier filed a suit in C.S.No.43 of 1962 before this Court<lb/>
 against Buhari and another, for re-conveyance of the properties mentioned therein, for directions,<lb/>
 etc., the copy of the plaint in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-71 = Ex.D-13; the said suit in<lb/>
 C.S.No.43 of 1962 was decreed by this Court and the copy of the decree, dated 10.11.1965<lb/>
 passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is marked as Ex.P-72 = Ex.D-14. As against the said decree, dated<lb/>
 10.11.1965 passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962, the appeals in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966 were<lb/>
 preferred, which were disposed of by the Division Bench of this Court on 10.05.1972, against<lb/>
 which, Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974 was preferred before the Supreme Court. Though the said suit<lb/>
 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 was initially decreed by the learned single Judge of this Court, the same was<lb/>
 disposed of the Division Bench of this Court in O.S.A.Nos.8 and 9 of 1966, but subsequently, the<lb/>
 Supreme Court in the said Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974, by judgment dated 17.04.1995, set aside<lb/>
 the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court and restored the judgment of the learned single<lb/>
 Judge of this Court in the said Civil Suit No.43 of 1962. The judgment dated 17.04.1995 passed<lb/>
 by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.224 of 1974 is marked as Ex.P-28, with amended cause<lb/>
 title therein, which is marked as Ex.P-29. In this regard, it is worthwhile to extract the prayer and<lb/>
 decree, dated 10.11.1965 passed by the learned single Judge of this Court in the said Civil Suit<lb/>
 No.43 of 1962, in which the second defendant herein was the co-plaintiff:<lb/>
 Prayer in C.S.No.43 of 1962:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;Suit praying for Judgment and Decree:<lb/>
</item>

<item>(i) directing the defendants or the first defendant with the concurrence of<lb/>
 the second defendant to re-convey the properties described in Schedule &apos;A&apos;<lb/>
 hereunder to the plaintiffs or to the first plaintiff receiving the sum of Rs.1,15,500/-<lb/>
and on such terms as to this Hon&apos;ble Court may deem fit and proper;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(ii) directing the defendants to deliver possession of the &apos;A&apos; Schedule<lb/>
 properties to the plaintiffs on such re-conveyance;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(iii) directing the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the income from the said<lb/>
 properties as and from the date of the plaint;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(iv) directing the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the costs of the suit;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(v) and pass such further or other orders as may be just and proper in the<lb/>
 circumstances of the case.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>Decree, dated 10.11.1965 in C.S.No.43 of 1962:<lb/>
 It is declared, ordered and decreed as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<p>(1) That plaintiff herein is entitled to specific performance of the<lb/>
 agreement dated 24.03.1959 entered into with the plaintiff by defendants herein,<lb/>
 to re-convey the properties set out in the Schedule hereunder;<lb/>
</p>

<item>(2) That the defendants herein do (a) execute a proper re-conveyance of<lb/>
 the properties more particularly described in the Schedule hereunder, in favour of<lb/>
 the plaintiff herein according to the agreement aforesaid dated 24.03.1959 and<lb/>
</item>

<item>(b) deliver possession to the said plaintiff herein, the said properties as set out in<lb/>
 the said Schedule hereunder, immediately after such re-conveyance;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(3) that the income in respect of the aforesaid properties from 23.03.1962<lb/>
 (the date of the plaint) till date of delivery of possession and the same shall be<lb/>
 ascertained in due course;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(4) that the defendants herein, shall be entitled to withdraw the sum of<lb/>
 Rs.1,15,500/-(Rupees one lakh fifteen thousand and five hundred only) now in<lb/>
 Court deposit, after they execute the sale deed as directed in Clause (2) supra;<lb/>
</item>

<item>(5) That the defendants, do also pay to the plaintiffs herein the costs of<lb/>
 the suit when taxed and noted in the margin hereof, and<lb/>
 (6) That the defendants do bear their own costs in this suit. &quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>41. Subsequent to the above said judgment of the Supreme Court in the said Civil Appeal,<lb/>
 by which the above extracted judgment/decree of the learned single Judge of this Court in<lb/>
 C.S.No.43 of 1962 was restored, E.P.No.48 of 1997 in C.S.No.43 of 1962 was preferred by<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishna Mudaliar (since deceased) and S.V.Matha Prasad, the second defendant<lb/>
 herein, and the order dated 07.07.2000 passed in the said E.P. is marked as Ex.D-6 and in the<lb/>
 said E.P., various applications were filed and disposed of by this Court.<lb/>
</p>

<p>42. Therefore, as per the above judgment of the Supreme Court in the said Civil Appeal,<lb/>
 by which, the said judgment of the learned single Judge of this Court was restored, the present<lb/>
 second defendant-S.V.Matha Prasad is a joint decree-holder for items 3 and 4 of the suit<lb/>
 properties (affidavit of assets in O.P.) in this T.O.S., which are the very same suit properties in the<lb/>
 said suit in C.S.No.43 of 1962, which is not disputed by either side and ultimately, the decree<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 dated 10.11.1965 passed in C.S.No.43 of 1962 is being enforced against the defendants therein<lb/>
 in C.S.No.43 of 1962. It has been already held by this Court that items 3 and 4 in the present suit<lb/>
 properties in the T.O.S. (as specified in the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P), are not the<lb/>
 properties possessed of by late S.V.Ramakrishna as on the date of his death, and hence, as far<lb/>
 as the remaining suit properties in items 1 and 2 in the T.O.S. (as specified in the affidavit of<lb/>
 assets filed along with the O.P), the legal heirs of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, including the<lb/>
 plaintiff herein and the defendants herein, are entitled to their respective shares and get the<lb/>
 benefits therein out of the same.<lb/>
</p>

<p>43. In this case, admittedly S.V.Saroja had been living as the second wife of the<lb/>
 deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, the testator. Even the deceased-testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan has<lb/>
 specifically mentioned in his Will Ex.P-1 that they were living as husband and wife, even though<lb/>
 there was no marriage between them and there is no specific mention in Ex.P-1 Will that she is<lb/>
 the second wife. Further, even though in the sale deeds in Exs.P-15 to P-18, there is a mention<lb/>
 that she is the second wife of late S.V.Ramakrishnan and since it is also stated in one of those<lb/>
 sale deeds that the Will is yet to be probated (i.e. the prayer in the O.P. (T.O.S) is for grant of<lb/>
 Letters of Administration in respect of the Will), the other disputes between the parties regarding<lb/>
 title, relevant status of the parties, etc., cannot be gone into and decided by this Court in this<lb/>
 T.O.S.<lb/>
</p>

<p>44. In view of the above discussion and observations made, this Court is of the<lb/>
 considered view that items 1 and 2 of the suit properties in the T.O.S (as mentioned in the<lb/>
 affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P) are separate properties of the deceased<lb/>
 S.V.Ramakrishnan and he had every right to execute Ex.P-1 Will. As far as items 3 and 4 of the<lb/>
 suit properties in the T.O.S (as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P), which<lb/>
 are the subject matter of suit in C.S.No.43 of 1962 and which were not in possession of the<lb/>
 deceased-testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan at the time of his death, as specified in Ex.P-1 Will by him,<lb/>
 those items 3 and 4 are not covered under Ex.P-1 Will. Therefore, as far as items 3 and 4 of the<lb/>
 suit properties herein, the same have to be dealt with as if the testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan died<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 intestate.<lb/>
</p>

<p>45. The testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan himself admitted in the Will that Vijaya alias Vijaya<lb/>
 Lakshmi, Ramprasad and Renuka Devi are his children, and on the side of the plaintiff, their<lb/>
 respective Birth Certificates have been marked as Exs.P-7 to P-9 and the consent affidavits of<lb/>
 S.V.R.Saroja (wife of S.V.Ramakrishnan), Vijaya Lakshmi alias Vijaya and S.V.R.Ramprasad, for<lb/>
 grant of Letters of Administration in favour of the plaintiff, have also been marked as Exs.P-2 to P-<lb/>
</p>

<p>4. Though Dhanurmathi is shown as one of the daughters of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan in<lb/>
 the affidavit filed in support of the O.P (T.O.S) and her Birth Certificate has also been marked as<lb/>
 Ex.P-10 in this T.O.S. and that she has also filed her consent affidavit for grant of Letters of<lb/>
 Administration in favour of the plaintiff, which has been marked as Ex.P-5, there is no mention<lb/>
 about her in Ex.P-1 Will.<lb/>
</p>

<p>46. All the above facts clearly show that the plaintiff-Renuka Devi has filed the<lb/>
 O.P.(T.O.S) for grant of Letters of Administration in her favour based on Ex.P-1 Will executed by<lb/>
 the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan and that, her mother S.V.R.Saroja, her sister Vijaya Lakshmi<lb/>
 alias Vijaya, her brother S.V.R.Ramprasad and her another sister Dhanurmathi have filed their<lb/>
 respective consent affidavits for grant of Letters of Administration in favour of the plaintiff, which<lb/>
 are marked as Exs.P-2 to P-5. As per the Will executed by the testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan, the<lb/>
 properties handed over to the plaintiff, shall be enjoyed by her for life and they shall be inherited<lb/>
 absolutely by her children. It is also seen that the children of the plaintiff-Renuka Devi, namely<lb/>
 N.Dheeraj Kumar and N.Divya Deepa, have also filed consent affidavits for grant of Letters of<lb/>
 Administration in favour of the plaintiff, which are marked as Exs.P-34 and P-35 respectively. The<lb/>
 Birth Certificates of the said N.Dheeraj Kumar and N.Divya Deepa have also been marked as<lb/>
 Exs.P-33 and P-36. Thus, it is clear that except the defendants herein, all the other legal heirs of<lb/>
 the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, including the children of the plaintiff, have given their respective<lb/>
 consent affidavits for grant of Letters of Administration in favour of the plaintiff herein. Moreover,<lb/>
 there are also third party affidavits of P.Ws.2 and 5, who are the grand-son of the attesting<lb/>
 witness No.1 (T.S.Ramadoss) to the Will and son of the attesting witness No.2 (Dr.R.Paul<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 Doraiswamy), which are marked as Exs.P-30 and P-38 and P.Ws.2 and 5 have confirmed the<lb/>
 signatures of those attesting witness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>47. From all the above facts and circumstances of the case, it has to be concluded that<lb/>
 the plaintiff has proved the Will in accordance with law and she is entitled for grant of Letters of<lb/>
 Administration in her favour only in respect of items 1 and 2 of the suit properties (i.e. items 1 and<lb/>
 2 of the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P) and she is not entitled for grant of Letters of<lb/>
 Administration insofar as items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (i.e. items 3 and 4 of the affidavit of<lb/>
 assets filed along with O.P). Accordingly, the application filed by the second defendant in<lb/>
 A.No.4458 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, filed for rejecting the plaint in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 with<lb/>
 regard to items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along<lb/>
 with O.P) is allowed and consequently, T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 has to be decreed only to the extent<lb/>
 indicate above.<lb/>
</p>

<p>48. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants contended that as far as the<lb/>
 delay in filing the O.P (T.O.S) by the plaintiff for grant of Letters of Administration in her favour, is<lb/>
 concerned, it is seen that Ex.P-1 Will was executed by the testator-S.V.Ramakrishnan on<lb/>
 15.07.1970, which was registered on 16.07.1970 and the testator died on 31.12.1980. It is to be<lb/>
 noted that the Original Petition in O.P.No.367 of 2008, which was subsequently converted as<lb/>
 T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, was filed on 18.12.2006 and it was subsequently re-presented on various<lb/>
 dates. Thus, the O.P. for grant of Letters of Administration is filed by the plaintiff in 2006, i.e. after<lb/>
 26 years from the date of the death of the testator, which was in 1980. Hence, according to the<lb/>
 learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants, the delay of 26 years has not been<lb/>
 explained by the plaintiff. They also contended that the plaintiff had also knowledge about the Will<lb/>
 even during the pendency of the earlier suit proceedings between the parties and also from the<lb/>
 relevant documents like sale deeds, etc. Hence, they prayed that the T.O.S. may be dismissed as<lb/>
 time barred as per Article 137 of the Limitation Act, and hence, they requested for framing<lb/>
 additional issue on the question of limitation and to decide the same as a preliminary issue, by<lb/>
 allowing the application in A.No.4533 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, filed by the second<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 defendant during the pendency of this T.O.S.<lb/>
</p>

<p>49. With regard to the above contention of delay, learned counsel appearing for the<lb/>
 plaintiff, in reply submitted that since the filing of the O.P. for grant of Letters of Administration is<lb/>
 only regarding the cause of action, which subsists as of today and though the defendants also<lb/>
 raised the aspect of limitation in their written statements by stating that the plaintiff has not taken<lb/>
 steps all these years, Article 137 of the Limitation Act will not apply to the facts of the present<lb/>
 case. He also contended that since there is no specific period of limitation fixed in the Limitation<lb/>
 Act, more particularly for filing of O.P. for grant of probate or Letters of Administration, or in any<lb/>
 law for the time being in force, for filing of the O.P. for grant of probate or Letters of<lb/>
 Administration, the T.O.S. may not be dismissed as time barred.<lb/>
</p>

<p>50. In this regard, it is worthwhile to quote Article 137 of the Limitation Act, which reads as<lb/>
 follows:<lb/>
 Third Division--Applications<lb/>
 Part-2--Other Applications<lb/>
 Description of<lb/>

 in this division.<lb/>

 When the right to apply<lb/>
 accrues<lb/>
</p>

<p>51. Though the learned counsel appearing on both sides relied on various decisions as<lb/>
 extracted in the earlier part of this judgment, including the point of limitation, learned counsel<lb/>
 appearing for the plaintiff brought to the notice of this Court, a latest judgment rendered by the<lb/>
 First Bench of this Court, dated 07.01.2016 in O.S.A.Nos.10 and 72 of 2013, in which the First<lb/>
 Bench of this Court dealt with various decisions of this Court as well as the Supreme Court on the<lb/>
 aspect of limitation and paragraph 49 of the said judgment of the First Bench reads as follows:<lb/>
</p>

<item>&quot;49. In the light of the ratio laid down in the above decisions, it cannot be<lb/>
 stated that Letters Patent and Rules made thereunder by the High Court for<lb/>
 regulating the procedure on the Original Side, are subordinate legislation and,<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 therefore, only Limitation Act which is a superior legislation will prevail. On a<lb/>
 conspectus of the above legal scenario, we conclude that the probate Court has<lb/>
 been conferred with exclusive jurisdiction and particularly, the conspicuous<lb/>
 absence of any period of limitation in applying for issuance of probate/Letters of<lb/>
 Administration makes it clear that the law of limitation will not apply to Sections<lb/>
 232 and 278 of the Indian Succession Act in respect of proceedings initiated<lb/>
 before this Court as per the Original Side Rules. In such view of the matter, the<lb/>
 finding of the learned single Judge holding that Article 137 of the Limitation Act is<lb/>
 not applicable to the probate proceedings and dismissal of the Original<lb/>
 Applications, in our considered opinion, require no interference.&quot;<lb/>
</item>

<p>52. In the above case before the First Bench, the O.P. proceedings for grant of Letters of<lb/>
 Administration was filed under Sections 232 and 278 of the Indian Succession Act and therein,<lb/>
 there was an objection by the other side that the O.P. proceedings are time barred under Article<lb/>
 137 of the Limitation Act and on that ground, it was contended that the T.O.S. therein may be<lb/>
 dismissed. In the case on hand, learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants contended<lb/>
 that Article 137 of the Limitation Act will apply to the present O.P. filed for grant of Letters of<lb/>
 Administration and it equally applies even to the cases filed under the relevant Act(s) in Civil<lb/>
 Courts, and presently, this T.O.S. being tried as a civil suit (i.e. T.O.S.No.2 of 2009), the<lb/>
 O.P.(T.O.S) filed under the provisions of the Indian Succession Act, may be rejected as time<lb/>
 barred, by allowing A.No.4533 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 filed by the second defendant for<lb/>
 framing additional issue on the question of limitation and to decide the said issue as a preliminary<lb/>
 issue. The above said judgment of the First Bench of this Court is squarely applicable to the facts<lb/>
 of the present case and is an answer to the above arguments of the learned Senior Counsels<lb/>
 appearing for the defendants on the point of limitation alleged as per Article 137 of the Limitation<lb/>
 Act, which is not applicable to probate/Letters of Administration proceedings filed under the<lb/>
 provisions of the Indian Succession Act. Therefore, the contention of the learned Senior Counsels<lb/>
 appearing for the defendants that since the Letters of Administration proceedings in this case, had<lb/>
 not been filed within three years from the date of knowledge of the Will, the same is time barred<lb/>
 under Article 137 of the Limitation Act, is not sustainable. Hence, for the above stated reasons,<lb/>
 the said application in A.No.4533 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009, is liable to be dismissed and<lb/>
 accordingly, the same is dismissed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>53. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the defendants further contended that the<lb/>
 plaintiff has totally under-valued the properties and the properties worth more than the Court fee<lb/>
 paid by the plaintiff in a sum of Rs.2,79,93,000/-, which is not proper as per the market value of<lb/>
 the properties and that the total market value of the properties mentioned in the suit schedule<lb/>
 would be Rs.34,85,27,994/-crores, at an increase of 30% in 2008 and therefore, they prayed for<lb/>
 allowing A.No.4456 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 filed by the second defendant for directing the<lb/>
 plaintiff to pay proper Court fees according to the market value of the suit properties, which is<lb/>
 Rs.34,85,27,994/-crores and make up the deficit of the Court fees.<lb/>
</p>

<p>54. In this case, though on the side of the defendants, such a plea of payment of improper<lb/>
 Court fees by the plaintiff, had been raised, the defendants have not raised such a plea in the<lb/>
 written statements filed by them or not adduced evidence or proved the real market value of the<lb/>
 suit properties. Except the contention raised on behalf of the defendants, there is no other<lb/>
 material to hold that the properties are under-valued as alleged on behalf of the defendants. Since<lb/>
 the defendants have failed to prove the appropriate market value of the properties on the date of<lb/>
 filing of the O.P. (T.O.S), this Court comes to the conclusion that the valuation made by the<lb/>
 plaintiff in the O.P./T.O.S. is proper and the above contention raised on behalf of the defendants,<lb/>
 has to be rejected. Accordingly, A.No.4456 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 filed by the second<lb/>
 defendant for directing the plaintiff to pay proper Court fees according to the market value of the<lb/>
 suit properties, is dismissed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>55. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants lastly contended that the<lb/>
 plaintiff brought on record an agreement of assignment, and in her cross-examination and in the<lb/>
 said agreement of assignment, she has admitted that the properties are covered by the<lb/>
 assignment agreement with regard to items 3 and 4 of the suit properties. In the present suit, it is<lb/>
 already held by this Court in the earlier paragraphs that as far as items 3 and 4 (items 3 and 4 in<lb/>
 the affidavit of assets filed along with O.P), it has to be treated as if the testator-<lb/>
S.V.Ramakrishnan died intestate. Hence, the plaintiff is not the legatee. Therefore, the contention<lb/>
 of the learned Senior Counsels appearing for the defendants that the recitals in the agreement of<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 assignment tantamounts to a waiver of her rights, if any under the Will, though there are none,<lb/>
 need not be gone into by this Court, as this Court already held in the earlier paragraphs in this<lb/>
 T.O.S. that she is not entitled for grant of Letters of Administration with regard to the said items 3<lb/>
 and 4 of the suit properties. Though it is also contended on the side of the defendants that as<lb/>
 regards items 3 and 4 of the suit properties, the question as to whether the plaintiff is entitled for<lb/>
 grant of Letters of Administration or not, will have to be decided only in the suit, after analysing the<lb/>
 oral and documentary evidence adduced by both sides and in view of the above discussion made<lb/>
 even in the T.O.S., there is no necessary for rendering a separate finding on the above point in<lb/>
 A.No.4457 of 2014 and the findings rendered above in the T.O.S. themselves are sufficient.<lb/>
 Accordingly, A.No.4457 of 2014 is closed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>56. For all the reasons stated above and on a perusal of the oral and documentary<lb/>
 evidence available on record and also on a perusal of the decisions extracted in the earlier<lb/>
 paragraphs, which are relied on by both sides, this Court is of the considered view that Ex.P-1<lb/>
 Will, dated 15.07.1970 propounded to be the last Will of the deceased S.V.Ramakrishnan, is<lb/>
 genuine and legally valid only with regard to items 1 and 2 of the suit properties (as mentioned in<lb/>
 the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P). Issue No.(i) is answered accordingly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>57. As the Will had been proved by the plaintiff in accordance with law, it has to be held<lb/>
 that the Will was not obtained by fraud, coercion and exerting undue influence as pleaded by the<lb/>
 defendants. Issue No.(ii) is answered accordingly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>58. In view of the above answers to Issue Nos.(i) and (ii), the plaintiff is entitled for grant<lb/>
 of Letters of Administration as prayed for, only in respect of items 1 and 2 of the suit properties<lb/>
 (as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P) and she is not entitled for grant of<lb/>
 Letters of Administration with regard to items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (as mentioned in the<lb/>
 affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P). Issue Nos.(iii) and (iv) are answered accordingly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>59. For the foregoing reasons and the findings rendered above:<lb/>
</p>

<p>(i) T.O.S. is decreed as prayed for only in respect of items 1 and 2 of the suit properties<lb/>
 (as mentioned in the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P) and the plaintiff is directed to<lb/>
 http://www.judis.nic.in<lb/>
 execute a personal bond for a sum of Rs.25,000/-to the satisfaction of the AR(OS-II), High<lb/>
 Court, Madras.<lb/>
 (ii) T.O.S. is dismissed with regard to items 3 and 4 of the suit properties (as mentioned in<lb/>
 the affidavit of assets filed along with the O.P).<lb/>
</p>

<p>(iii) For the reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, A.No.4456 of<lb/>
 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is dismissed, A.No.4457 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is closed,<lb/>
 A.No.4458 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of 2009 is allowed and A.No.4533 of 2014 in T.O.S.No.2 of<lb/>
 2009 is dismissed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>(iv) No costs.<lb/>
