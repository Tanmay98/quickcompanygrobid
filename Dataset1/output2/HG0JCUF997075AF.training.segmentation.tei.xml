			<body>child. <lb/>2. <lb/>Before examining the impugned order, we propose to notice <lb/>the essential facts which emerge from the family court record and <lb/>give rise to the present appeal. Marriage between the appellant and <lb/>the respondent no.1 was solemnised on 3 rd December, 2007 in <lb/>accordance with Hindu rites and ceremonies at the Ashoka Hotel, <lb/>Chanakyapuri, New Delhi. <lb/>3. <lb/>At the time of the marriage, H-respondent no. 1 was serving <lb/>as an officer of the Indian Administrative Services (IAS) in the <lb/>Nagaland Cadre and was posted at District Mokokchung, Nagaland <lb/>while the appellant was residing with her parents, continuing her <lb/>studies, and preparing for the civil services examination. The <lb/>appellant also qualified the IAS examination in the year 2009 and <lb/>was allotted the U.P. Cadre of the Indian Administrative Services. <lb/>On this basis, the respondent no.1 applied for change of cadre and, <lb/>in the middle of June, 2011, was relieved of his charge in Nagaland <lb/>and was posted as District Magistrate in Lakhimpur, Kheri District <lb/>in U.P. <lb/>4. <lb/>In July, 2012, the respondent was transferred as a District <lb/>Magistrate, Bareilly while the appellant was appointed as a Chief <lb/>Development Officer of District Lucknow. In February, 2013, the <lb/>appellant was transferred as a District Magistrate, Pilibhit. <lb/>5. <lb/>It appears that a decision was taken by the H &amp; W to seek <lb/>dissolution of their marriage. On the 1 st of October 2014, a joint <lb/>petition was filed by H-the respondent no.1 (as petitioner no.1) and <lb/>W-the appellant (as petitioner no.2) under Section 13B(1) of the <lb/></body>

			<body>Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 seeking dissolution of marriage of the <lb/>parties by a decree of divorce by mutual consent which was <lb/>registered as HMA No.1099/2014 at the court of the Principal <lb/>Judge, Family Courts, Saket, New Delhi. We extract hereunder <lb/>certain material averments made in this joint petition : <lb/>&quot;6. However, while there have been, because of <lb/>temperamental difference and incompatibility, reduced <lb/>time of cohabitation and living together and also <lb/>occupational placements, the parties, for the last one <lb/>year, have been residing separately. <lb/>7. <lb/>That a child named (Baby X) was born on <lb/>6.10.2013 at Lucknow and the child is in custody of the <lb/>mother at Sultanpur. <lb/>8. <lb/>That the petitioner no.1 (sic. husband) is <lb/>presently posted as District Magistrate in Aligarh and <lb/>the petitioner no.2 (sic. wife) is posted as District <lb/>Magistrate, Sultanpur. Both the petitioners are well <lb/>settled in life. <lb/>9. <lb/>That due to temperamental differences, parties <lb/>to the present petition have not been able to live in <lb/>cordial atmosphere at the matrimonial home. <lb/>10. That the parties are living separately from each <lb/>other for more than a year and there has been no <lb/>resumption of any cohabitation between them, nor <lb/>there is any chance for the same. <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>13. That the parties have resolved their disputes and <lb/>differences and it has been specifically agreed by the <lb/>petitioner no.1 and petitioner no. 2 that petitioner no.2 <lb/>or her relatives shall not claim anything from petitioner <lb/>no.1 (or his relatives) in any court of law in India and <lb/>outside India. Likewise, petitioner no.1 shall make no <lb/>claim from petitioner no.2 (or her relatives). <lb/>14. That it is agreed between both the parties that <lb/>petitioner no.2 neither be entitled to any amount from <lb/>petitioner no.1 (as she has voluntarily relinquished all <lb/></body>

Similarly, petitioner no.1 has <lb/>relinquished all his claims, past, present and future <lb/>against petitioner no.2. <lb/>15. Considering the welfare of the child, she would <lb/>grow up exclusively in the custody of mother, i.e., <lb/>petitioner no.2 (Baby X). Petitioner no.1 gives up all <lb/>claims to custody even access. He shall not be liable <lb/>for maintenance and education of the child in present <lb/>or future, which shall be borne by petitioner no.2 <lb/>solely. <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>17. That the present petition is not being presented in <lb/>collusion with each other. <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>20. That the parties to the present petition are not <lb/>accessory to nor have connived with each other in <lb/>presenting the present petition.&quot; <lb/>6. <lb/>This petition was verified on solemn affirmation. It was <lb/>supported by an affidavit of both the parties. In para 1 of his <lb/>affidavit, the respondent no.1 husband clearly stated that the <lb/>petition &quot;has been drafted by my counsel at my instructions. I have <lb/>read and understood the contents thereof and hereby state that the <lb/>same are true and correct&quot;. The affidavit also contained <lb/>unequivocal declarations of non-collusion; voluntariness of the <lb/>mutual consent and that he was not an accessory to or have <lb/>connived at with petitioner no.2 in presenting or prosecuting the <lb/>present petition. <lb/>7. <lb/>The above petition contains an absolute admission that a <lb/>child named Baby &apos;X&apos; was born to the parties on 6 th of October <lb/></body>

			<body>2013 who was in custody of the mother who was posted at <lb/>Sultanpur. There is a further admission of fatherhood by the <lb/>respondent no.1 in para 15 of the petition when he unequivocally <lb/>gives up all claims to custody, even to access to the child, and <lb/>abandons responsibility for her maintenance and education which <lb/>was agreed to be borne by the mother alone. The parties clearly <lb/>mentioned that the child would grow up exclusively in the &quot;custody <lb/>of the mother&quot; endorsing the abandonment of custody rights by the <lb/>other party. <lb/>8. <lb/>In the joint statement recorded of the appellant and the <lb/>respondent no.1 on the 1 st of October 2014 by the Principal Judge <lb/>(South-East), Family Courts, Saket, H-the respondent no.1 once <lb/>again declared that &quot;a child named Baby X was born on 6.10.2013 <lb/>at Lucknow and the child is in custody of the mother at Sultanpur&quot;. <lb/>In this statement on oath, H-the respondent no.1 again referred to <lb/>the agreement that the &quot;permanent custody of the minor child baby <lb/>shall remain with the petitioner no.2/wife&quot;. <lb/>9. <lb/>The Family Court had raised an objection with regard to the <lb/>maintainability of the petition in the Family Court at Saket on <lb/>account of territorial jurisdiction. In view of this objection, on the <lb/>22 nd October, 2014, the parties agreed to withdraw the petition with <lb/>opportunity to file a fresh petition before the court having <lb/>competent jurisdiction. The Family Court recorded the statement <lb/>of counsels for the parties and permitted the petition to be <lb/>withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh petition before the court of <lb/>competent jurisdiction. <lb/></body>

			<body>10. On the 31 st of October 2014, the appellant and respondent <lb/>no.1 jointly filed a second petition before the Family Court, Patiala <lb/>House under Section 13B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, <lb/>registered as HMA No.783/2014, for dissolution of their marriage <lb/>by way of decree of divorce by mutual consent which was <lb/>containing the identical averments as paras 6 to 10 and 13 to 15 of <lb/>the first petition, as extracted above. In para 25, the parties <lb/>disclosed the filing of the previous petition being HMA <lb/>No.1099/2014 in the Saket Family Courts. The petition was again <lb/>supported by separate affidavits of the appellant as well as <lb/>respondent no.1. <lb/>In para 13, the respondent no.1 had again declared that the <lb/>parties have resolved their disputes and differences. <lb/>11. It appears that thereafter, the respondent no.1 filed an <lb/>application for withdrawal of the above petition urging that there <lb/>were certain unwritten conditions also, agreed upon between the <lb/>parties, and that he would continue with a criminal complaint <lb/>which stood filed by him against the appellant and the respondent <lb/>no.2 on grounds of adultery and that he was not prepared to <lb/>withdraw the said complaint. The respondent no.1 claimed that he <lb/>had agreed to file a petition by mutual consent purely in the interest <lb/>of the child involved in the case and to bring to an end the <lb/>relationship of the parties which was non-existent on account of <lb/>certain acts attributed to the appellant. In view thereof, the <lb/>respondent no.1 stated that he was withdrawing from the joint <lb/>petition and prayed for its dismissal. As a result, on 9 th January, <lb/></body>

			<body>2015, the Principal Judge, Patiala House, Delhi dismissed the joint <lb/>petition as withdrawn with liberty to the respondent no.1 to file a <lb/>fresh petition for dissolution of marriage under appropriate <lb/>provisions of law. The learned Family Court noted the absence of <lb/>the appellant wife. <lb/>12. It is only thereafter that on or about the 29 th January, 2015, <lb/>the respondent no.1 filed HMA No.3329/2014 before the Principal <lb/>Judge, Family Court, Lucknow under Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu <lb/>Marriage Act for dissolution of marriage of the appellant and <lb/>respondent no.1 by a decree of divorce. In this petition, H-the <lb/>respondent no. 1 levelled allegations of adultery on the part of the <lb/>appellant with a person who was impleaded as a respondent no.2 <lb/>and for the first time denied paternity of the child of the parties <lb/>born on 6 th October, 2013. <lb/>13. This petition was transferred by the Supreme Court of India <lb/>from Lucknow to Delhi vide order dated 23 rd February, 2015 <lb/>passed in Transfer Petition (Civil) No.1886/2014. The appellant <lb/>filed a detailed written statement contesting allegations of the <lb/>appellant and vehemently denying the allegations of adultery. <lb/>14. The appellant has set-up a case that she was subjected to <lb/>grave torture and abuse, both mental and physical, at the hands of <lb/>the respondent no.1; that the parties were cohabiting as husband <lb/>and wife at their postings and that the respondent no.1 husband <lb/>would come and stay at Lucknow or she would go and stay with <lb/>him on leave or whenever visiting his place of posting. The <lb/>appellant has asserted that she conceived from their wedlock and <lb/></body>

			<body>cohabitation and in February, 2013 told the respondent no.1 that <lb/>she was expecting their child. <lb/>The respondent no.1 urges that this information was received <lb/>from her only in April, 2013. <lb/>15. On 6 th of October 2013, the appellant gave birth to a girl <lb/>child at Lucknow. On 18 th October, 2013, a lunch and pooja <lb/>ceremony was organized at the house of the appellant&apos;s parents <lb/>which was attended by the parents of the respondent no.1 and large <lb/>number of his guests. The priest who performed the pooja is stated <lb/>to be an old acquaintance of the respondent no.1 and his parents <lb/>from the time of his posting at Lakhimpur, Kheri District. <lb/>16. The appellant submits that between 9 th and 29 th November, <lb/>2013, the appellant visited Bareilly and stayed with the respondent. <lb/>However, thereafter, the parties could not cohabit with each other. <lb/>17. Replication thereto was filed by the respondent husband <lb/>disputing the allegations of the wife. <lb/>18. Issues were framed in the matter on 24 th August, 2015 and <lb/>the matter proceeded to evidence of the appellant. <lb/>19. The respondent no. 1 thereafter filed his list of witnesses. <lb/>He also filed his examination in chief by way of affidavit dated 29 th <lb/>July, 2015 which was tendered in evidence and he was examined <lb/>extensively on 14 th ; 24 th ; 28 th ; and 29 th September, 2015 when his <lb/>cross examination was concluded. <lb/>20. On the next date of hearing i.e. 16 th October, 2015, the <lb/>evidence of PW-2 Sh. Vikas Verma was recorded and he was <lb/>discharged. <lb/></body>

			<body>21. The matter was posted for the remaining evidence of the <lb/>respondent no.1 on 29 th October, 2015 and 9 th November, 2015. <lb/>22. The next witness was Inspector Vijaymal Singh Yadav who <lb/>was examined as PW-3 on 8 th December, 2015 and discharged. <lb/>23. On the 14 th of October 2015, the husband-respondent no.1 <lb/>filed an application under Section 151 C.P.C. seeking a direction <lb/>for conducting the DNA test of the respondent no.1 and the child to <lb/>ascertain as to whether he was the biological father of the child and <lb/>for a further direction to the appellant to produce the child either in <lb/>court or elsewhere to enable her blood samples to be taken. This <lb/>application was also listed on the above dates. The appellant had <lb/>filed a note dated 4 th of January 2016 opposing the application on <lb/>merits and in law. <lb/>24. This application was allowed by the Family Court by the <lb/>order dated 28 th of January 2016 inter alia directing the appellant to <lb/>bring the child to the office of the Director, CFSL in the CGO <lb/>Complex, Lodhi Road when the respondent no.1 was also directed <lb/>to remain present so that the blood samples could be taken in the <lb/>presence of the parties. <lb/>This order has been assailed by way of the present appeal. <lb/>25. Before examining the rival contentions, we summarise the <lb/>headings under which this matter has been considered : <lb/>I. <lb/>Direction for compelling a medical examination or a <lb/>DNA test to establish any fact -when to be made? <lb/>(paras 26 to 33) <lb/></body>

What is the meaning of &quot;access&quot; and &quot;non-access&quot; <lb/>(paras 44 to 54) <lb/>IV. <lb/>Summation of the principles laid down by judicial <lb/>precedents on consideration of an application for an <lb/>examination (para 55) <lb/>V. <lb/>Prima facie case (paras 56 to 59) <lb/>VI. <lb/>Whether the case of non-access was specifically pleaded <lb/>by the respondent no.1 (paras 60 to 67) <lb/>VII. Whether there is non-traverse by the wife of the <lb/>husband&apos;s pleadings, and thereby, deemed admission <lb/>thereof? (paras 68 to 90) <lb/>VIII. Is the court bound to pass orders premised on admissions <lb/>of parties?

			<body>XII. In the facts of the present case, effect of the presumption <lb/>under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act <lb/>(paras 154 to 168) <lb/>XIII. Ensuring the Constitutional rights of the child <lb/>(paras 169 to 175) <lb/>XIV. Impugned order (paras 176 to 182) <lb/>XV. Conclusion (paras 183 to 184) <lb/>XVI. Result (para 185) <lb/>We now propose to discuss the above in seriatim. <lb/>I. <lb/>Direction for compelling a medical examination or a DNA <lb/>test to establish any fact -when to be made? <lb/>26. In the present case, it is an admitted position that the prayer <lb/>for the DNA examination is made qua a child born during the <lb/>subsistence of a marriage. Such prayer has been judicially <lb/>examined on principles which apply to a prayer for a medical <lb/>examination of a party in a case. Directions for such examinations, <lb/>which are akin to a DNA testing, may be made for a variety of <lb/>reasons. Say for instance, it may be necessary for the court to <lb/>satisfy itself as to whether a party before it suffers from mental <lb/>illness or not either for the purposes of appointment of a guardian <lb/>ad litem in terms of Order XXXII Rule 15 of the Code of Civil <lb/>Procedure or Section 41 of the Mental Health Act,1987 as also for <lb/>the determination under Section 118 of the Indian Evidence Act of <lb/>a person&apos;s competency as a witness. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 12 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>27. DNA testing has come into existence by scientific evolution <lb/>as yet another test utilised for establishing relationships in the <lb/>nature of paternity or shared parentage between parties in litigation. <lb/>Applications for directions to the other party to appear or produce <lb/>off springs or siblings for DNA testing are made by parties seeking <lb/>to establish, either, the factum of the relationship, or, their <lb/>challenge to the relationship. It could be by a person claiming <lb/>parentage or by a person challenging paternity of another. <lb/>28. So far as a challenge to paternity is concerned, it is well <lb/>settled that a rebuttable presumption lies under Section 112 of the <lb/>Indian Evidence Act, 1872 in favour of the paternity of the <lb/>legitimacy of a child born during marriage. For expediency, we <lb/>extract Section 112 which reads as follows : <lb/>&quot;Section 112 in The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 <lb/>112. Birth during marriage, conclusive proof of <lb/>legitimacy.-The fact that any person was born during <lb/>the continuance of a valid marriage between his <lb/>mother and any man, or within two hundred and <lb/>eighty days after its dissolution, the mother remaining <lb/>unmarried, shall be conclusive proof that he is the <lb/>legitimate son of that man, unless it can be shown that <lb/>the parties to the marriage had no access to each other at <lb/>any time when he could have been begotten.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>29. The question which has to be answered in the present case is <lb/>as to the permissibility of a DNA test? On this issue, the <lb/>observations in paras 82 to 85 of the pronouncement in the three <lb/>Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court in AIR 2003 SC 3450, <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<body>Sharda v. Dharampal in the context of a medical examination are <lb/>topical and read thus : <lb/>&quot;80. The matter may be considered from another angle. In <lb/>all such matrimonial cases where divorce is sought, say on <lb/>the ground of impotency, schizophrenia etc. normally <lb/>without there being medical examination, it would be <lb/>difficult to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the <lb/>allegation made by a spouse against the other spouse <lb/>seeking divorce on such a ground, is correct or not. In order <lb/>to substantiate such allegation, the petitioner would always <lb/>insist on medical examination. If the respondent avoids <lb/>such medical examination on the ground that it violates <lb/>his/her right to privacy or for that matter right to personal <lb/>liberty as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of <lb/>India, then it may in most of such cases become impossible <lb/>to arrive at a conclusion. It may render the very grounds on <lb/>which divorce is permissible nugatory. Therefore, when <lb/>there is no right to privacy specifically conferred by Article <lb/>21 of the Constitution of India and with the extensive <lb/>interpretation of the phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot; this right has <lb/>been read into Article 21, it cannot be treated as an absolute <lb/>right. What is emphasized is that some limitations on this <lb/>right have to be imposed and particularly where two <lb/>competing interests clash. In matters of the aforesaid <lb/>nature where the legislature has conferred a right upon <lb/>his spouse to seek divorce on such grounds, it would be <lb/>the right of that spouse which comes in conflict with the <lb/>so-called right to privacy of the respondent. Thus the court <lb/>has to reconcile these competing interests by balancing <lb/>the interests involved. <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>82.It is, however, axiomatic that a court shall not order a <lb/>roving inquiry. It must have sufficient materials before it <lb/>to enable it to exercise its discretion. Exercise of such <lb/>discretion would be subjected to the supervisory <lb/>jurisdiction of the High Court in terms of Section 115 of the <lb/>Code of Civil Procedure and/or Article 227 of the <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 14 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>Constitution of India. Abuse of the discretionary power at <lb/>the hands of a court is not expected. The court must arrive <lb/>at a finding that the applicant has established a strong <lb/>prima facie case before passing such an order. <lb/>83. If despite an order passed by the court, a person refuses <lb/>to submit himself to such medical examination, a strong <lb/>case for drawing an adverse inference would be made out. <lb/>Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act also enables a court <lb/>to draw an adverse inference if the party does not produce <lb/>the relevant evidences in his power and possession. <lb/>84. So viewed, the implicit power of a court to direct <lb/>medical examination of a party to a matrimonial litigation <lb/>in a case of this nature cannot be held to be violative of <lb/>one&apos;s right of privacy. <lb/>85. To sum up, our conclusions are: <lb/>1. A matrimonial court has the power to order a person to <lb/>undergo medical test. <lb/>2. Passing of such an order by the court would not be in <lb/>violation of the right to personal liberty under Article 21 of <lb/>the Indian Constitution. <lb/>3. However, the court should exercise such a power if the <lb/>applicant has a strong prima facie case and there is <lb/>sufficient material before the court. If despite the order of <lb/>the court, the respondent refuses to submit himself to <lb/>medical examination, the court will be entitled to draw an <lb/>adverse inference against him.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>It is therefore, well settled that the court in an appropriate <lb/>case, can direct medical examination of a party to matrimonial <lb/>litigation as well provided that the applicant seeking such <lb/>examination has a &quot;strong prima facie&quot; case and has placed <lb/>&quot;substantial material&quot; on the court record in support of his/her <lb/>case. <lb/></body>

			<body>30. On the same aspect, we may usefully refer to the <lb/>pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (2005) 4 SCC <lb/>449 Sh. Banarasi Dass v. Mrs. Teeku Datta. This case arose in <lb/>the context of succession where a challenge was laid to the <lb/>paternity of the petitioner who claimed to be the daughter of <lb/>deceased who was alleged to have died intestate leaving behind <lb/>five brothers. Originally, only four of the brothers were impleaded, <lb/>out of which two passed away. The petition was filed only against <lb/>two brothers and subsequently, the third brother was also <lb/>impleaded. One of the brothers objected to the grant of the <lb/>succession certificate disputing Mrs. Teeku Datta&apos;s claim of <lb/>paternity. As both the objector&apos;s brother and his wife were dead, <lb/>he sought a DNA examination of the petitioner with the DNA of <lb/>the other respondents. We note hereunder the consideration and <lb/>discussion by the courts in paras 10, 11, 12 and 13 which read thus: <lb/>&quot;10. In matters of this kind the court must have regard <lb/>to Section 112 of the Evidence Act. This section is <lb/>based on the well-known maxim pater is est quem <lb/>nuptiae demonstrant (he is the father whom the <lb/>marriage indicates). The presumption of legitimacy is <lb/>this, that a child born of a married woman is deemed <lb/>to be legitimate, it throws on the person who is <lb/>interested in making out the illegitimacy, the whole <lb/>burden of proving it. The law presumes both that a <lb/>marriage ceremony is valid, and that every person is <lb/>legitimate. Marriage or filiation (parentage) may be <lb/>presumed, the law in general presuming against vice and <lb/>immorality. <lb/>11. It is rebuttable presumption of law that a child born <lb/>during lawful wedlock is legitimate, and that access <lb/>occurred between the parents. This presumption can <lb/></body>

Farooq [(1987) 1 SCC <lb/>624 : 1987 SCC (Cri) 237] this Court held: (SCC p. 629, <lb/>para 12) <lb/>&quot;Section 112 lays down that if a person was born <lb/>during the continuance of a valid marriage between <lb/>his mother and any man or within two hundred and <lb/>eighty days after its dissolution and the mother <lb/>remains unmarried, it shall be taken as conclusive <lb/>proof that he is the legitimate son of that man, unless <lb/>it can be shown that the parties to the marriage had <lb/>no access to each other at any time when he could <lb/>have been begotten. This rule of law based on the <lb/>dictates of justice has always made the courts <lb/>incline towards upholding the legitimacy of a child <lb/>unless the facts are so compulsive and clinching as <lb/>to necessarily warrant a finding that the child could <lb/>not at all have been begotten to the father and as <lb/>such a legitimation of the child would result in rank <lb/>injustice to the father. Courts have always desisted <lb/>from lightly or hastily rendering a verdict and that <lb/>too, on the basis of slender materials, which will <lb/>have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and <lb/>its mother an unchaste woman.&quot; <lb/>The view has been reiterated by this Court in many later <lb/>cases e.g. Amarjit Kaur v.Harbhajan Singh [(2003) 10 <lb/>SCC 228].&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>The presumption of legitimacy thus cannot be disturbed by <lb/>&quot;slender&quot; materials under &quot;compulsive and clinching&quot; facts are <lb/>brought to shake the presumption and call for a DNA examination. <lb/>Proof of non-access was essential. <lb/>31.

			<body>court observed thus : <lb/>&quot;14. .... In order to succeed in the succession application the <lb/>applicant has to adduce cogent and credible evidence in <lb/>support of the application. The respondents, if they so <lb/>choose, can also adduce evidence to oppose grant of <lb/>succession certificate. The trial court erroneously held that <lb/>the documents produced by the respondents were not <lb/>sufficient or relevant for the purpose of adjudication and <lb/>DNA test was conclusive. This is not a correct view. It is <lb/>for the parties to place evidence in support of their <lb/>respective claims and establish their stands. DNA test is <lb/>not to be directed as a matter of routine and only in <lb/>deserving cases such a direction can be given, as was <lb/>noted in Goutam Kundu case [(1993) 3 SCC 418 : 1993 <lb/>SCC (Cri) 928] . Present case does not fall in that category. <lb/>The High Court&apos;s judgment does not suffer from any <lb/>infirmity. We, therefore, uphold it. It is made clear that we <lb/>have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case <lb/>relating to succession application.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>32. The observations of the court in paras 12 and 13 of the <lb/>judgment reported at AIR 2010 SC 2851, Bhabani Prasad Jena v. <lb/>Convenor Secretary, Orissa State Commission for Women &amp; Anr. <lb/>shed valuable light on the issue under consideration and are <lb/>therefore set down in extenso : <lb/>&quot;12.

			<body>DNA test that the son was born from the wedlock of the <lb/>parties. <lb/>13. In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue before <lb/>the court, the use of DNA test is an extremely delicate and <lb/>sensitive aspect. One view is that when modern science <lb/>gives the means of ascertaining the paternity of a child, <lb/>there should not be any hesitation to use those means <lb/>whenever the occasion requires. The other view is that the <lb/>court must be reluctant in the use of such scientific <lb/>advances and tools which result in invasion of right to <lb/>privacy of an individual and may not only be prejudicial to <lb/>the rights of the parties but may have devastating effect on <lb/>the child. Sometimes the result of such scientific test may <lb/>bastardise an innocent child even though his mother and her <lb/>spouse were living together during the time of conception. <lb/>In our view, when there is apparent conflict between the <lb/>right to privacy of a person not to submit himself forcibly <lb/>to medical examination and duty of the court to reach the <lb/>truth, the court must exercise its discretion only after <lb/>balancing the interests of the parties and on due <lb/>consideration whether for a just decision in the matter, <lb/>DNA test is eminently needed. DNA test in a matter <lb/>relating to paternity of a child should not be directed by <lb/>the court as a matter of course or in a routine manner, <lb/>whenever such a request is made. The court has to <lb/>consider diverse aspects including presumption under <lb/>Section 112 of the Evidence Act; pros and cons of such <lb/>order and the test of &quot;eminent need&quot; whether it is not <lb/>possible for the court to reach the truth without use of <lb/>such test.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>33. The conclusiveness of the presumption under Section 112 of <lb/>the Indian Evidence Act, therefore, cannot be disturbed lightly. <lb/>These principles bound the Family Court in the present case <lb/>while considering the application which was filed by the present <lb/></body>

			<body>respondent no.1. <lb/>II. <lb/>Displacement of the conclusive presumption under Section <lb/>112 of the Indian Evidence Act -Standard of proof to do <lb/>so? <lb/>34. Given the weight attached to the presumption of paternity of <lb/>a child born during the subsistence of a marriage under Section <lb/>112, what would be the standards on which such a presumption <lb/>under Section 112 would be rebutted? This issue is also no longer <lb/>res integra and has been discussed by the Supreme Court in the <lb/>judgments reported at AIR 2001 SC 2226 Kamti Devi v. Poshi <lb/>Ram as well as (2009) 12 SCC 454 : AIR 2009 SC 3115 Sham <lb/>Lal alias Kuldeep v. Sanjeev Kumar &amp; Ors. We borrow the words <lb/>of the Supreme Court on this very important aspect. <lb/>35. In AIR 2001 SC 2226 Kamti Devi (Smt.) &amp; Anr. v. Poshi <lb/>Ram, the husband filed a civil suit for decree declaring that he is <lb/>not the father of a child born on 4 th September, 1996 i.e. 15 years <lb/>after the marriage of the parties (in 1975) on the ground that he had <lb/>no access to the appellant during the period when the child would <lb/>have been begotten. The trial court relied on the conclusive <lb/>presumption in Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act and holding <lb/>that the husband had failed to prove that he had no access to his <lb/>wife during the relevant period, dismissed the suit. The first <lb/>appellate court, however, re-evaluated the entire evidence and held <lb/>that the husband had succeeded in discharging the burden of <lb/>rebutting the presumption by proving that he had no access to the <lb/>MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/>Page 20 of 95 <lb/>mother of the child during a very long stretch of time covering the <lb/>relevant period and consequently allowed the appeal and decreed <lb/>the suit. The High Court also refused to interfere with this finding <lb/>on the ground that it was pure question of fact calling for no <lb/>interference by the court in the second appeal under Section 100 of <lb/>the Code of Civil Procedure. Kamti Devi filed a special leave <lb/>petition before the Supreme Court assailing the orders against her. <lb/>36. In its judgment, the Supreme Court has authoritatively laid <lb/>down the impact of presumption of Section 112 of the Indian <lb/>Evidence Act and the manner in which the same can be rebutted in <lb/>paras 9 to 12 of the pronouncement which read in Kamti Devi as <lb/>follows : <lb/>&quot;9. When the legislature chose to employ the expression <lb/>that a certain fact &quot;shall be conclusive proof&quot; of another <lb/>fact, normally the parties are disabled from disrupting such <lb/>proof. This can be discerned from the definition of the <lb/>expression &quot;conclusive proof&quot; in Section 4 of the Act: <lb/>&quot;4. &apos;Conclusive proof&apos;.-When one fact is declared <lb/>by this Act to be conclusive proof of another, the court <lb/>shall, on proof of the one fact, regard the other as <lb/>proved, and shall not allow evidence to be given for the <lb/>purpose of disproving it.&quot; <lb/>10. But Section 112 itself provides an outlet to the party <lb/>who wants to escape from the rigour of that conclusiveness. <lb/>The said outlet is, if it can be shown that the parties had no <lb/>access to each other at the time when the child could have <lb/>been begotten the presumption could be rebutted. In other <lb/>words, the party who wants to dislodge the conclusiveness <lb/>has the burden to show a negative, not merely that he did <lb/>not have the opportunity to approach his wife but that she <lb/>too did not have the opportunity of approaching him <lb/>during the relevant time. Normally, the rule of evidence in <lb/>MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/>Page 21 of 95 <lb/>other instances is that the burden is on the party who <lb/>asserts the positive, but in this instance the burden is cast <lb/>on the party who pleads the negative. The raison d&apos;être is <lb/>the legislative concern against illegitimatizing a child. It is <lb/>a sublime public policy that children should not suffer <lb/>social disability on account of the laches or lapses of <lb/>parents.&quot; <lb/>11. We may remember that Section 112 of the Evidence <lb/>Act was enacted at a time when the modern scientific <lb/>advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well as <lb/>ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not even in <lb/>contemplation of the legislature. The result of a genuine <lb/>DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. But even <lb/>that is not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of <lb/>Section 112 of the Act e.g. if a husband and wife were <lb/>living together during the time of conception but the DNA <lb/>test revealed that the child was not born to the husband, <lb/>the conclusiveness in law would remain irrebuttable. This <lb/>may look hard from the point of view of the husband who <lb/>would be compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of <lb/>which he may be innocent. But even in such a case the <lb/>law leans in favour of the innocent child from being <lb/>bastardised if his mother and her spouse were living <lb/>together during the time of conception. Hence the <lb/>question regarding the degree of proof of non-access for <lb/>rebutting the conclusiveness must be answered in the light <lb/>of what is meant by access or non-access as delineated <lb/>above. <lb/>12. Whether the burden on the husband is as hard as the <lb/>prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused in a trial <lb/>deserves consideration in the above background. The <lb/>standard of proof of prosecution to prove the guilt beyond <lb/>any reasonable doubt belongs to criminal jurisprudence <lb/>whereas the test of preponderance of probabilities belongs <lb/>to civil cases. The reason for insisting on proof beyond <lb/>reasonable doubt in criminal cases is to guard against the <lb/>innocent being convicted and sent to jail if not to extreme <lb/>penalty of death. It would be too hard if that standard is <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 22 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>imported in a civil case for a husband to prove non-access <lb/>as the very concept of non-access is negative in nature. <lb/>But at the same time the test of preponderance of <lb/>probability is too light as that might expose many children <lb/>to the peril of being illegitimatized. If a court declares that <lb/>the husband is not the father of his wife&apos;s child, without <lb/>tracing out its real father the fallout on the child is <lb/>ruinous apart from all the ignominy visiting his mother. <lb/>The bastardised child, when grows up would be socially <lb/>ostracised and can easily fall into wayward life. Hence, by <lb/>way of abundant caution and as a matter of public policy, <lb/>law cannot afford to allow such consequence befalling an <lb/>innocent child on the strength of a mere tilting of <lb/>probability. Its corollary is that the burden of the plaintiff <lb/>husband should be higher than the standard of <lb/>preponderance of probabilities. The standard of proof in <lb/>such cases must at least be of a degree in between the two <lb/>as to ensure that there was no possibility of the child <lb/>being conceived through the plaintiff husband.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>37. In para 11, the Supreme Court has clearly laid down that if <lb/>the husband and wife were living together during the time of <lb/>conception but the DNA test stated that the child was not born to <lb/>the husband, the conclusiveness in law by virtue of Section 112 of <lb/>the Indian Evidence Act would remain irrebuttable. <lb/>38. Some indication of the nature and extent of the scrutiny to be <lb/>conducted by the court, is to be found in paras 14 and 15 of Kamti <lb/>Devi v. Poshi Ram which read thus : <lb/>&quot;14. In the present case the first appellate court, which is <lb/>the final fact-finding court, after evaluating the entire <lb/>evidence, came to the following conclusion: <lb/>&quot;In the present case the plaintiff has examined all the <lb/>evidence which he possibly could do in the <lb/></body>

			<body>circumstances. He has proved by convincing <lb/>evidence, that he did not visit his village or house <lb/>where the defendant was allotted one room. He has <lb/>further proved that the defendant also never visited <lb/>him at Mandi where he had been living for more than <lb/>2 years before the child was born to Kamti Devi. In <lb/>other words he has proved that he had no access or <lb/>opportunity for sexual intercourse with Defendant 1 <lb/>for more than 280 days before Roshan Lal (Defendant <lb/>2) was begotten by Defendant 1. <lb/>15. The said conclusion was reached on the strength of the <lb/>evidence adduced by both sides and the first appellate court <lb/>was satisfied in full measure that the plaintiff husband had <lb/>no opportunity whatsoever to have liaison with the <lb/>defendant mother. The finding thus reached by the first <lb/>appellate court cannot be interfered with in a second appeal <lb/>as no substantial question of law would have flowed out of <lb/>such a finding.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>The reference is to &quot;convincing evidence&quot;; &quot;proved that he <lb/>had no access or opportunity&quot; and the entirety of evidence stood <lb/>placed before the court. <lb/>39. The above principles were reiterated by the Supreme Court <lb/>in Banarsi Dass in the following terms : <lb/>13. We may remember that Section 112 of the Evidence <lb/>Act was enacted at a time when the modern scientific <lb/>advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as <lb/>well as ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not even in <lb/>contemplation of the legislature. The result of a <lb/>genuine DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. <lb/>But even that is not enough to escape from the <lb/>conclusiveness of Section 112 of the Evidence Act e.g. <lb/>if a husband and wife were living together during the <lb/>time of conception but the DNA test revealed that the <lb/></body>

			<body>child was not born to the husband, the conclusiveness <lb/>in law would remain irrebuttable. This may look hard <lb/>from the point of view of the husband who would be <lb/>compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of which <lb/>he may be innocent. But even in such a case the law <lb/>leans in favour of the innocent child from being <lb/>bastardised if his mother and her spouse were living <lb/>together during the time of conception. Hence the <lb/>question regarding the degree of proof of non-access <lb/>for rebutting the conclusiveness must be answered in <lb/>the light of what is meant by access or non-access as <lb/>delineated <lb/>above. <lb/>(See <lb/>Kamti <lb/>Devi v. Poshi <lb/>Ram [(2001) 5 SCC 311 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 892] .)&quot; <lb/>40. In this judgment, the court had reiterated that even the result <lb/>of a genuine DNA test (which revealed that the child was not born <lb/>to the husband) said to be scientifically accurate, is not sufficient to <lb/>displace the conclusiveness of Section 112, if a husband and wife <lb/>were living together at the time of the conception. <lb/>41. We may also advert to the pronouncement of the Supreme <lb/>Court reported at (2009) 12 SCC 454 : AIR 2009 SC 3115 Sham <lb/>Lal alias Kuldeep v. Sanjeev Kumar &amp; Ors., &quot;....once the validity <lb/>of marriage is proved then there is strong presumption about the <lb/>legitimacy of children born from that wedlock.....&quot;. In para 22 of <lb/>the precedent, the Supreme Court has observed that &quot;the <lb/>presumption of legitimacy arises from birth in wedlock and not <lb/>from conception&quot;. <lb/>It was observed that there was no evidence on record in this <lb/>case that Balak Ram at any point of time did not have access to <lb/>Smt. Durgi (mother of the plaintiff and defendant no.4). <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 25 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>42. The further observations of the Supreme Court in paras 39, <lb/>40 and 42 of the pronouncement, on the manner in which the <lb/>presumption under Section 112 can be reubutted, are important and <lb/>read as follows : <lb/>&quot;39.The findings of the High Court on the interpretation <lb/>of Section 112 of the Evidence Act are based on correct <lb/>analysis of Indian and English cases for the last more <lb/>than a century. According to the legislative intention <lb/>and spirit behind Section 112 of the Evidence Act it is <lb/>abundantly clear that once the validity of marriage is <lb/>proved then there is strong presumption about the <lb/>legitimacy of children born from that wedlock. The <lb/>presumption can only be rebutted by a strong, clear, <lb/>satisfying and conclusive evidence. The presumption <lb/>cannot be displaced by mere balance of probabilities or <lb/>any circumstance creating doubt. <lb/>40. In the instant case, admittedly the plaintiff and <lb/>Defendant 4 were born to Smt Durgi during the <lb/>continuance of her valid marriage with the deceased <lb/>Balak Ram. Their marriage was in fact never dissolved. <lb/>There is no evidence on record that the deceased Balak <lb/>Ram at any point of time did not have access to Smt <lb/>Durgi. According to the clear interpretation of Section <lb/>112 of the Evidence Act, there is strong presumption <lb/>about the legitimacy of children born out of <lb/>continuation of the valid marriage. <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>42. It is well-settled principle of law that odiosa et <lb/>inhonesta non sunt in lege praesumenda (nothing odious <lb/>or dishonourable will be presumed by the law). The law <lb/>presumes against vice and immorality. In a civilised <lb/>society it is imperative to presume the legitimacy of a <lb/>child born during continuation of a valid marriage and <lb/>whose parents had &quot;access&quot; to each other. It is <lb/>undesirable to enquire into the paternity of a child <lb/>whose parents &quot;have access&quot; to each other. Section <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 26 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>112 of the Evidence Act is based on presumption of <lb/>public morality and public policy.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>43. The presumption under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence <lb/>Act can be displaced only by such evidence which meets a standard <lb/>higher than preponderance of probabilities, and not by a mere <lb/>preponderance of probabilities. The strong presumption under <lb/>Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act of legitimacy of a child <lb/>born during marriage therefore can only be rebutted by &quot;strong, <lb/>clear, satisfying and conclusive&quot; evidence of &quot;non access&quot;. <lb/>III. What is the meaning of &quot;access&quot;and &quot;non-access&quot; <lb/>44. The present case raises issues which are really first <lb/>principles and fundamentals for consideration of an application <lb/>seeking DNA examination of a sample of a child wherein issue of <lb/>his or her paternity is raised. It is trite that the party seeking the <lb/>test, has to first and foremost make out a prima facie case that the <lb/>alleged father had no access to the mother of the child at the time <lb/>when the child could reasonably have been conceived. <lb/>45. Before examining any other aspect, it becomes necessary to <lb/>examine what would be the meaning of &quot;access&quot; in the context of <lb/>examination of the paternity of the child. <lb/>46. Earlier, the High Courts had held that &quot;access&quot; in an <lb/>examination of a paternity action means actual sexual intercourse <lb/>between the parties. This controversy came to a rest by three Judge <lb/>Bench pronouncement of the Privy Council reported at AIR 1934 <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 27 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>PC 49, Karapaya Servai v. Mayandi wherein it was held that the <lb/>word &quot;access&quot; means &quot;no more than opportunity of intercourse&quot;. <lb/>47. The factual matrix deemed sufficient by the Privy Council to <lb/>presume legitimacy of birth sheds valuable light on the facts before <lb/>us. The same reads thus : <lb/>&quot;The materiality of these facts, however, is that in <lb/>December 1911, the parties were admittedly in touch with <lb/>each other, were residing at all events for a short period <lb/>in reasonable proximity, the wife being in the house of a <lb/>relative of the husband, and that there is nothing in the <lb/>agreement to suggest that she was unfaithful or that the <lb/>parties were on terms of personal hostility, though no <lb/>doubt the presence of the second wife would make an open <lb/>reconciliation difficult. If, therefore, the respondent could <lb/>have been begotton during this period his legitimacy was <lb/>undeniable.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>48. The above legal principle was approved by a three Judge <lb/>Bench of the Supreme Court in the decision reported at AIR 1954 <lb/>SC 176 : 1954 SCR 424 Chilukuri Venkateswarlu v. Chilukuri <lb/>Venkatanarayan. In this case, a suit was filed by Chilukuri <lb/>Venkateswarlu, an infant represented by his maternal uncle as his <lb/>next friend for recovery of possession, on partition of ½ share of <lb/>certain properties, on the allegation that they were joint family <lb/>properties of his father, the defendant nos. 1 and himself. The <lb/>plaintiff was admittedly the son of defendant no.2, a legally <lb/>wedded wife of defendant no.1. The defence put forward by <lb/>defendant no.1 to the plaintiff&apos;s claim, was a denial of his paternity. <lb/>The Supreme Court observed thus : <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 28 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;On the admitted facts of the case, there could be no <lb/>question that the operation of Section 112 of the Indian <lb/>Evidence Act would be attracted and the plaintiff being <lb/>born during the continuance of a lawful wedlock between <lb/>his mother and his alleged father, a conclusive presumption <lb/>of legitimacy would arise, unless it was proved that the <lb/>parties to the marriage had no access to each other at any <lb/>time when he could have been begotten. The point for <lb/>determination, therefore, was whether on the evidence <lb/>adduced-in the case Defendant 1, upon whom the burden of <lb/>proving non-access admittedly lay, had succeeded in <lb/>discharging that burden. xxxx <lb/>It may be stated at the outset that the presumption which <lb/>Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act contemplates is a <lb/>conclusive presumption of law which can be displaced <lb/>only by proof of the particular fact mentioned in the <lb/>section, namely, non-access between the parties to the <lb/>marriage at a time when according to the ordinary course <lb/>of nature the husband could have been the father of the <lb/>child. Access and non-access again connote, as has been <lb/>held by the Privy Council [ Vide Karapaya v. Mayandy, 12 <lb/>Rang 243] , existence and non-existence of opportunities <lb/>for marital intercourse. <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>There is no evidence of any unnatural conduct on the part <lb/>of Defendant 1 towards the plaintiff&apos;s mother at about the <lb/>time when the plaintiff was conceived. <lb/>Apparently for some reason or other, the husband took up <lb/>an unnatural attitude, but this was a subsequent event and <lb/>whether he had really any grievance against his wife, or his <lb/>unnatural behaviour was due to the instigation of his third <lb/>wife, it is not necessary for us to investigate. On the <lb/>evidence, as it stands, we are clearly of opinion that <lb/>Defendant 1 did not succeed in proving that there was no <lb/>opportunity for intercourse between him and Defendant 2 <lb/>at the time when the plaintiff was conceived. He rested his <lb/>whole case upon the allegation of unchastity of the <lb/></body>

			<body>plaintiff&apos;s mother and of the plaintiff being born as the <lb/>result of fornication. <lb/>While rejecting that story, the High Court, in our opinion, <lb/>erred in holding that there was no opportunity for access <lb/>between the parties at the material period, relying mainly <lb/>upon what the husband himself said and did much after the <lb/>estrangement of feelings took place between the parties, no <lb/>matter whatever that was due to.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>49. Mr. Gupta, learned senior counsel for the respondent no.1 <lb/>has submitted that this aspect of the matter has also been <lb/>considered by the Supreme Court in two later judicial precedents <lb/>relied upon by the other side. Our attention is drawn also to the <lb/>pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (1993) 3 SCC <lb/>418:AIR 1993 SC 2295 Goutam Kundu v. State of West Bengal &amp; <lb/>Anr. We extract hereunder the observations of the Supreme Court <lb/>which bind the present consideration : <lb/>&quot;24. This section requires the party disputing the <lb/>paternity to prove non-access in order to dispel the <lb/>presumption. &quot;Access&quot; and &quot;non-access&quot; mean the <lb/>existence or non-existence of opportunities for sexual <lb/>intercourse; it does not mean actual &quot;cohabitation&quot;. <lb/>50. After detailed discussion, the court concluded thus : <lb/>&quot;26. From the above discussion it emerges-<lb/>(1) that courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter <lb/>of course; <lb/>(2) wherever applications are made for such prayers in <lb/>order to have roving inquiry, the prayer for blood test <lb/>cannot be entertained. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<body>(3) There must be a strong prima facie case in that the <lb/>husband must establish non-access in order to dispel the <lb/>presumption arising under Section 112 of the Evidence Act. <lb/>(4) The court must carefully examine as to what would be <lb/>the consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it will <lb/>have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and the <lb/>mother as an unchaste woman. <lb/>(5) No one can be compelled to give sample of blood for <lb/>analysis.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>51. This aspect and the effect of the evidence of access have <lb/>been considered in some detail in another pronouncement of the <lb/>Supreme Court reported at AIR 2001 SC 2226:(2001) 5 SCC 311, <lb/>Kamti Devi (Smt.) &amp; Anr. v. Poshi Ram, relevant portion whereof <lb/>is extracted hereunder : <lb/>&quot;8. Earlier there was a controversy as to what is the true <lb/>import of the word &quot;access&quot; in Section 112 of the Act. <lb/>Some High Courts held that access means actual sexual <lb/>intercourse between the spouses. However, the controversy <lb/>came to a rest when the Privy Council held in Karapaya <lb/>Servai v. Mayandi [AIR 1934 PC 49 : 1934 All LJ 250] <lb/>that the word &quot;access&quot; connotes only existence of <lb/>opportunity for marital intercourse. The said legal <lb/>principle gained approval of this Court when a three-Judge <lb/>Bench held in Chilukuri Venkateswarlu v. Chilukuri <lb/>Venkatanarayana [AIR 1954 SC 176 : 1954 SCR 424] <lb/>that the law has been correctly laid down therein.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>52. It is therefore, settled law that cohabitation of the parties is <lb/>not an essential or only concomitant to establish &quot;access&quot;; that <lb/>&quot;unnatural conduct&quot; of the party or the conduct at the time the <lb/>child was conceived, personal hostility would be pertinent <lb/></body>

			<body>circumstances. Parties being &quot;in touch with each other&quot;, &quot;residing <lb/>for a short period in reasonable proximity&quot; during the period when <lb/>the child was conceived are also material circumstances. <lb/>In fact, at the final consideration, the husband has to <lb/>conclusively establish that there was no access or opportunity at all <lb/>for a liaison with or sexual intercourse between the parties. As <lb/>delineated in Kamti Devi, the husband who challenges paternity of <lb/>a child born during the subsistence of the marriage, has to establish <lb/>with convincing evidence &quot;not merely that he did not have the <lb/>opportunity to approach his wife but that she too did not have the <lb/>opportunity of approaching him during the relevant time&quot;. <lb/>53. Mr. V.K. Gupta, Senior Advocate for the respondent no.1 <lb/>herein has also urged that &quot;access&quot; therefore, actually refers to <lb/>merely opportunity to engage in sexual intercourse. <lb/>54. Let us examine the circumstances on record before the <lb/>Family Court, simply put, &quot;whether there was any opportunity <lb/>available to them for coitus&quot; or had access to each other, as <lb/>required by law. <lb/>IV. Summation of the principles laid down by judicial <lb/>precedents on consideration of an application for an <lb/>examination <lb/>55. So far as the court&apos;s discretion to direct a DNA test is <lb/>concerned, the following principles can be summed out from the <lb/>above enunciation of law placed by both sides which have to guide <lb/>the court&apos;s consideration : <lb/></body>

			<body>(i) <lb/>A rebuttable presumption of legitimacy is attached to a child <lb/>born of a married woman during a subsistence of marriage <lb/>or within 280 days of its severance (Ref.: Section 112 of the <lb/>Indian Evidence Act; AIR 2001 SC 2226, Kamti Devi v. <lb/>Poshi Ram -para 11; (2005) 4 SCC 449, Banarsi Dass v. <lb/>Teeku Datta -para 10; AIR 2009 SC 3115, Sham Lal alias <lb/>Kuldeep v. Sanjeev Kumar &amp; Ors. -para 10) <lb/>(ii) The DNA test is not to be directed as a matter of routine. <lb/>Such direction can be given only in deserving cases (Ref.: <lb/>(2005) 4 SCC 449, Banarsi Dass v. Teeku Datta -para 14). <lb/>(iii) The court must exercise its discretion only after balancing <lb/>the interests of the parties and on due consideration whether <lb/>for a just decision in the matter, DNA test is eminently <lb/>needed. (Ref.: AIR 2003 SC 3450, Sharda v. Dharampal -<lb/>para 80 ; AIR 2010 SC 2851, Bhabani Prasad Jena v. <lb/>Convenor Secretary, Orissa State Commission for Women <lb/>&amp; Anr. -Para 13) <lb/>(iv)(a) There must be a strong prima facie case in that the husband <lb/>must establish non-access in order to dispel the presumption <lb/>arising under Section 112 of the Evidence Act. (Ref.: (1993) <lb/>3 SCC 418:AIR 1993 SC 2295 Goutam Kundu v. State of <lb/>West Bengal &amp; Anr.) <lb/>(iv)(b) The court would exercise discretion, only after balancing the <lb/>interests of the parties and on consideration as to whether <lb/>for a just decision in the matter the DNA test is imminently <lb/>needed i.e. as to whether it is not possible for the court to <lb/>reach the truth without use of such test. For so concluding, <lb/>the court has to consider materials placed by both parties <lb/>and the test shall not be ordered in routine for a roving <lb/>enquiry. <lb/>(v) &quot;Access&quot; and &quot;non-access&quot; mean the existence or non-<lb/>existence of opportunities for sexual intercourse; it does not <lb/>mean actual &quot;cohabitation&quot; (Ref.: AIR 1934 PC 49, <lb/></body>

Mrs. Teeku Datta) <lb/>(viii) The party who wants to dislodge the conclusiveness has the <lb/>burden to show a negative, not merely that he did not have <lb/>the opportunity to approach his wife but that she too did not <lb/>have the opportunity of approaching him during the relevant <lb/>time. (Ref.: AIR 2001 SC 2226, Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram -<lb/>para 10) <lb/>(ix) The presumption under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence <lb/>Act can only be displaced by a strong preponderance of <lb/>evidence, and not by a mere balance of probabilities or on <lb/>the basis of slender material. The standard of proof in such <lb/>cases must be of a degree in between the preponderance of <lb/>probability and proof beyond reasonable doubt by way of <lb/>abundant caution and has a matter of public policy (Ref.: <lb/>AIR 2001 SC 2226, Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram -para 11 &amp; <lb/>12) <lb/>(x) The presumption can only be rebutted by a strong, clear, <lb/>satisfying and conclusive evidence. The presumption cannot <lb/>be displaced by mere balance of probabilities or any <lb/>circumstance creating doubt (Ref.: (2009) 12 SCC 454 : AIR <lb/>2009 SC 3115 Sham Lal alias Kuldeep v.

			<body>(xi) The verdict of displacement of the presumption shall not be <lb/>rendered on the basis of slender materials. If a husband and <lb/>wife were living together during the time of conception but <lb/>the DNA test revealed that the child was not born to the <lb/>husband, the conclusiveness in law would remain <lb/>irrebuttable (Ref.: (2001) 5 SCC 311, Kamti Devi v. Poshi <lb/>Ram -Para 11; (2005) 4 SCC 449, Banarsi Dass v. Teeku <lb/>Datta -para 13). <lb/>(xii) The courts must be inclined towards upholding the <lb/>legitimacy of the child unless the facts are so compulsive and <lb/>clinching as to necessarily warrant a finding that the child <lb/>could not at all have been begotten to the father and as such <lb/>a legitimation of the child would result in rank injustice to <lb/>the father (Ref.: Dukhtar Jahan v. Mohd. Farooq [(1987) 1 <lb/>SCC 624). <lb/>We consider at a later stage in this judgment the precedents <lb/>considering the effect of result of a DNA examination. <lb/>V. <lb/>Prima facie case <lb/>56. From the above enunciation of law by the Supreme Court, it <lb/>is crystal clear that the Family Court had to be satisfied that the <lb/>husband had established a strong prima facie case of non-access to <lb/>dispel the presumption of legitimacy of the child under Section 112 <lb/>of the Indian Evidence Act and only when such strong prima facie <lb/>case had been established, could the court consider the direction for <lb/>the DNA examination. So what constitutes a strong prima facie <lb/>case? <lb/>57. So far as the expression &quot;prima facie case&quot; is concerned, in <lb/>the judgment reported at AIR 1958 SC 79, Martin Burn Ltd. v. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 35 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>R.N. Banerjee, the Supreme Court had observed thus : <lb/>&quot;27. …A prima facie case does not mean a case proved to <lb/>the hilt but a case which can be said to be established if the <lb/>evidence which is led in support of the same were believed. <lb/>While determining whether a prima facie case had been <lb/>made out the relevant consideration is whether on the <lb/>evidence led it was possible to arrive at the conclusion in <lb/>question and not whether that was the only conclusion which <lb/>could be arrived at on that evidence. It may be that the <lb/>Tribunal considering this question may itself have arrived at <lb/>a different conclusion. It has, however, not to substitute its <lb/>own judgment for the judgment in question. It has only got <lb/>to consider whether the view taken is a possible view on the <lb/>evidence on the record. (See Buckingham &amp; Carnatic Co., <lb/>Ltd. [ (1952) Labour Appeal Cases 490] . <lb/>This interpretation was reiterated by the Supreme Court in its <lb/>later pronouncements reported at Bangalore Woollen, Cotton and <lb/>Silk Mills Co. Ltd. V. B Dasappa : AIR 1960 SC 1352 : (1960) 2 <lb/>LLJ 39; Nirmala J. Jhala v. State of Gujarat : (2013) 4 SCC 301 <lb/>and Cholan Roadways Ltd. v. G. Thirugnanasambandam : (2005) <lb/>3 SCC 241. <lb/>58. So what is the prima facie case made out by the husband on <lb/>record as on 16 th October, 2015 when he filed the application u/s <lb/>151 of the CPC for direction to conduct the DNA examination of <lb/>the child? <lb/>59. By that date, the learned Family Court Judge also had the <lb/>pleadings of the parties as well as substantial evidence of the <lb/>respondent no.1 available before him which ought to have formed <lb/>part of the &quot;prima facie&quot; consideration. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 36 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>VI. Whether the case of non-access was specifically pleaded by <lb/>the respondent no.1 <lb/>60. To justify the order for a DNA examination, before anything <lb/>else, the foremost requirement in the present case for establishing <lb/>illegitimacy even prima facie, is a specific pleading of &quot;non-<lb/>access&quot;, that is to say a plea of no opportunity for cohabiting as <lb/>husband and wife and an opportunity of establishing marital <lb/>relations. It therefore, becomes necessary to scrutinize the petition <lb/>filed by the appellant to examine as to whether he had pleaded non-<lb/>access at the relevant time. <lb/>61. Let us see what the respondent no.1 has to say about access <lb/>to his wife in his divorce petition. In para 6 of the divorce petition, <lb/>the respondent no.1 has pointed out that the parties were posted at <lb/>different places; that there was change in her behaviour towards <lb/>him and that she started to avoid him without any rhyme or reasons <lb/>due to which the matrimonial life of the parties &quot;started to fall <lb/>within the periphery of strained relationship and the cohabitation <lb/>between the petitioner and respondent no.1 started to become a <lb/>rare event&quot;. <lb/>In para 7, respondent no.1 states that they resided as husband <lb/>and wife together &quot;as a last occasion at Lucknow&quot;. <lb/>In para 8, the respondent no.1 states that &quot;to save his <lb/>matrimonial life, he made all efforts from his side but the conduct <lb/>of the respondent no.1 (wife) towards the petitioner was pathetic <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 37 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>during this period&quot;. <lb/>62. In para 10, the respondent no.1 has set out his postings <lb/>admitting that from 2011, the parties were posted at different <lb/>places. The respondent no.1 has moved from District Lakhimpuri, <lb/>Kheri District, U.P. in 2011; remained as District Magistrate, <lb/>Bareilly from 2011 to 8 th June, 2014 and thereafter as District <lb/>Magistrate, Aligarh when he filed the petition. <lb/>However, he does admit that the appellant joined his <lb/>company at his places of postings, though it was a &quot;rare entity&quot;. <lb/>The respondent no.1 has attributed neglect to the appellant <lb/>wife who, admittedly, was posted at different places. <lb/>63. It is most important to note that in para 11, the husband has <lb/>stated that from the &quot;period 2011 to December 2013&quot;, the <lb/>appellant and the respondent no.1 &quot;hardly cohabited&quot;. <lb/>64. At the same time, a backhanded statement is made that &quot;from <lb/>the start of the year 2013, even the access to cohabit was denied&quot; <lb/>to him by the appellant. How is &quot;the start of the year 2013&quot; to be <lb/>computed? <lb/>Clearly an indefinite position shows that the <lb/>respondent is not sure of his own case. In fact, it reflects that even <lb/>in the start of the year 2013, the parties were cohabiting and having <lb/>a normal relationship. <lb/>65. From the above pleadings, there can be no manner of doubt <lb/>that the respondent no.1 has not stated that he had no access to the <lb/>appellant wife at the relevant time. On the contrary, he has <lb/>submitted that they were cohabiting from the period 2011 to <lb/>December, 2013 albeit &quot;hardly&quot;. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 38 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>66. It needs no elaborate detailing or consideration of pleadings <lb/>that &quot;rare entity&quot;, &quot;pathetic&quot;, &quot;hardly cohabited&quot;, &quot;hardly&quot; <lb/>cannot be equated to the categorical assertion of no access which <lb/>is required by law to displace the presumption under Section 112 of <lb/>the Indian Evidence Act. Consequently it was not even the <lb/>husband&apos;s clear and unequivocal case in the divorce petition that he <lb/>had no access to his wife at the time when the child of the parties <lb/>could have been conceived. <lb/>67. Baby &apos;X&apos; was born on 6 th of October 2013. The relevant <lb/>period of 280 days i.e. 9 months 7 days prior thereto would take us <lb/>to start of the end of December, 2012/first week January, 2013 <lb/>(covering the &quot;start of the year 2013&quot; as well. The possible period <lb/>of Baby &apos;X&apos; conception would be around 31 st December, 2012. <lb/>It is also the appellant&apos;s case that the parties &quot;hardly <lb/>cohabited&quot; from 2011 to December, 2013. &apos;H&apos; has thus admitted <lb/>&quot;access&quot; at the relevant time. <lb/>VII. Whether there is non-traverse by the wife of the husband&apos;s <lb/>pleadings, and thereby, deemed admission thereof? <lb/>68. It is argued by Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel for <lb/>the respondent no.1 that in her written statement/reply to the <lb/>petition under Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, <lb/>the appellant wife has not specifically denied the averments of the <lb/>appellant. The submission is that there is no averment by her in <lb/>either the reply or the counter claim that there was no denial of <lb/>access during the &quot;relevant time&quot; or that there was physical access <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 39 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>provided to the respondent no.1. In this regard, reference is made <lb/>to the appellant wife&apos;s response to paras 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16 and <lb/>36 of the divorce petition. <lb/>It is submitted that therefore she is deemed to have admitted <lb/>the husband&apos;s case. Mr. V.K. Gupta, ld. Senior Counsel for the <lb/>respondent no.1 has submitted that as a result, nothing further is to <lb/>be examined by the court so far as paternity of the child is <lb/>concerned. <lb/>69. Placing reliance on Rules 3 to 5 of Order VIII of the Code of <lb/>Civil Procedure, Mr. V.K. Gupta, ld. Senior Counsel for the <lb/>respondent no.1 has vehemently urged that the denial by the <lb/>appellant had to be specific; that every allegation in the petition <lb/>which is not denied specifically or by necessary implication, has to <lb/>be taken to be admitted. It is submitted that the appellant wife in <lb/>the present case has failed to specifically deny each and every <lb/>assertion made by the respondent no.1 husband which by necessary <lb/>implication have to be taken to be admitted by her and as a result, <lb/>the wife is deemed to have admitted that the respondent no.1 <lb/>husband had no access to her at the relevant time. <lb/>70. <lb/>Reliance is also placed on Section 58 of the Indian Evidence <lb/>Act, 1872 to contend that such facts which by any rule of pleading <lb/>are deemed to have been admitted, need not be proved. <lb/>71. Mr. Gupta has requested this court to refrain from making <lb/>any comment on the plea of the respondent no.1 -husband <lb/>regarding access to his wife as it is the subject matter of trial before <lb/>the Trial Court and further that no observation should be made on <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 40 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>the conduct of the respondent no.1 husband for the same reason. <lb/>This submission, however, fails to consider the requirement of law <lb/>which mandates that the court has to be satisfied that a person <lb/>seeking DNA examination has to establish a &quot;strong prima facie <lb/>case&quot; as well as inter alia the iminent need for ordering the same, <lb/>in the justice of the case while also evaluating the equity or <lb/>assessing the interest of justice. Admissions, if any, have to be <lb/>examined from this perspective. It needs no elaboration that <lb/>admissions of both sides have to be examined and their effect on <lb/>&quot;prima facie&quot; case evaluated. <lb/>Therefore, during this consideration, the court would need to <lb/>examine the pleadings of the parties in order to ascertain as to <lb/>whether there was a failure to non-traverse of the assertions of the <lb/>plaintiff by the appellant wife and which are the facts which could <lb/>be deemed to have been admitted by her. <lb/>72. In order to avoid prolixity, we extract hereunder some of the <lb/>material assertions in the reply of the appellant wife to the divorce <lb/>petition : <lb/>&quot;4. That the contents of Para 6 to Para 11 of the <lb/>Petition are denied since the same are based on <lb/>incorrect and wrong facts which is nothing but figment <lb/>of imagination of the Petitioner and has been raised <lb/>only to malign the reputation of the Answering <lb/>Respondent and create frivolous and fabricated <lb/>grounds for seeking divorce from the Answering <lb/>Respondent on the ground of adultery which itself is <lb/>totally false and malicious. <lb/>5. <lb/>That the contents of Para 12 of the Petition is <lb/></body>

			<body>denied to the extent that the pregnancy of the Answering <lb/>Respondent was known to the Petitioner ever since the <lb/>Answering Respondent became aware of the same <lb/>through medical examination which was conducted <lb/>sometimes in the month of February 2013, and <lb/>therefore, the averments contrary to the same are not <lb/>accepted as they are false and frivolous. <lb/>6. <lb/>That the contents of Para 13 to Para 16 of the <lb/>Petition are vehemently denied and it is submitted that <lb/>the Petitioner is not only creating a false and <lb/>malicious ground but is stooping so low that he is <lb/>trying to allege that he is not the biological father of <lb/>his own child which is not only unfortunate but also <lb/>shows the dirty and scheming mentality of the <lb/>Petitioner. In fact, it is very painful for the Answering <lb/>Respondent to make this submission before the <lb/>Hon&apos;ble Court that the Petitioner was always eager to <lb/>have a male child and was therefore, pressurizing the <lb/>Answering Respondent to get a sex determination test <lb/>ever since the news of conception had reached him. <lb/>However, the Answering Respondent never agreed to <lb/>this illegitimate demand and always insisted that she <lb/>was happy to have a healthy child, be it a boy or a girl <lb/>but the petitioner always got upset whenever, he was <lb/>told that even a girl child was as precious as a male <lb/>child. As the Petitioner always stressed on the fact that <lb/>in his family tradition the first child has always been a <lb/>male child throughout and therefore, he did not want to <lb/>break this tradition under any circumstances. The <lb/>purpose told by him to the Answering Respondent for <lb/>getting sex determination test was only to ensure that it <lb/>is a male child otherwise his intention was to get the <lb/>child aborted in case of a female child to which the <lb/>Answering Respondent never succumbed. <lb/>7. <lb/>That the contents of Para 17 to Para 24 of the <lb/>Petition are vehemently denied by the Answering <lb/></body>

			<body>Respondent for the reason that the entire averments <lb/>made in these paragraphs are not only false and <lb/>fabricated but have also been done only with a view to <lb/>malign the reputation of the Answering Respondent as <lb/>well as her family and to extract a huge amount of <lb/>money from them as a black mailing tactics so that the <lb/>Answering Respondent and her family may succumb to <lb/>such pressure as their family is one of the most reputed <lb/>and prestigious family of the State of Uttar Pradesh. In <lb/>fact, the perusal of the contents of the aforesaid <lb/>paragraphs also shows the sick mentality of the <lb/>Petitioner who has no hesitation in knowingly making <lb/>such false and wild allegations against his own child <lb/>and wife only with a purpose to convert the said <lb/>allegations into monetary benefits. xxx xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>8. <lb/>That the contents of Para 25 to Para 26 of the <lb/>Petition are vehemently denied. It is submitted that the <lb/>averments made therein are not only false and fabricated <lb/>but also shows the sick and dirty mentality of the <lb/>Petitioner who is not only making wild allegations but is <lb/>also putting words into the mouth of the Answering <lb/>Respondent without substantiating anything on record <lb/>with a view to mentally harass and torture the <lb/>Answering Respondent. It is submitted that there is not <lb/>an iota of truth in the allegations made by the <lb/>Petitioner and he is only trying to create a strong <lb/>ground as well as sympathy for himself. Such conduct <lb/>of the Petitioner should be strongly condemned and the <lb/>ground of adultery raised by him be rejected at the <lb/>outset by this Hon&apos;ble Court. <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>11.

The main <lb/></body>

			<body>purpose of the Petitioner is to extract a huge amount of <lb/>money from the Answering Respondent and her family <lb/>as she is the only child of her parents and therefore, the <lb/>Petitioner is well aware that they would do everything to <lb/>ensure the happiness of their only child and grand child. <lb/>Therefore, in the light of the aforesaid facts and <lb/>circumstances, the ground of adultery taken by the <lb/>Petitioner should not only rejected but also a heavy <lb/>cost should be imposed on the Petitioner for making <lb/>false and fabricated averments and wasting the <lb/>precious time of this Hon&apos;ble Court. However, the <lb/>Answering Respondent prays for grant of divorce from <lb/>the petitioner on the ground of cruelty meted out to her <lb/>by the Petitioner as she will, under no circumstances, <lb/>like to stay with such a person who has such sick, <lb/>pervert and dirty mentality and is a threat to her life <lb/>and her daughter&apos;s life. Further, in view of the <lb/>manner in which the Plaintiff has vilified the <lb/>Answering Respondent and the innocent child, the <lb/>Answering Respondent seeks full and sole custody of <lb/>the child and no legal rights or visitation rights be <lb/>given to the Plaintiff now or in future so that he does <lb/>not further endanger the child&apos;s life and jeopardize her <lb/>in the presence or future.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>73. Before proceeding with the discussion, we may refer to the <lb/>two judgments placed by Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel <lb/>for the respondent no.1 in support of the submission that this court <lb/>must deem the allegations in the divorce petition having been <lb/>admitted by the wife. Mr. Gupta has placed reliance on para 11 of <lb/>the judicial pronouncement reported at AIR 1964 SC 538, Badat &amp; <lb/>Co. Bombay v. East India Trading Co. which reads thus : <lb/>&quot;11. Order 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure prescribes, <lb/>among others, that the plaintiff shall give in the plaint <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 44 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>the facts constituting the cause of action and when it <lb/>arose, and the facts showing that the court has <lb/>jurisdiction. The object is to enable the defendant to <lb/>ascertain from the plaint the necessary facts so that he <lb/>may admit or deny them. Order 8 provides for the <lb/>filling of a written statement, the particulars to be <lb/>contained therein and the manner of doing so; Rules <lb/>3, 4 and 5 thereof are relevant to the present enquiry <lb/>and they reads: <lb/>&quot;Order 8 Rule 3. It shall not be sufficient for a <lb/>defendant in his written statement to deny <lb/>generally the grounds alleged by the plaintiff, but <lb/>the defendant must deal specifically with each <lb/>allegation of fact of which he does not admit the <lb/>truth, except damages. <lb/>Rule 4. Where a defendant denies an allegation of <lb/>fact in the plaint, he must not do so evasively, but <lb/>answer the point of substance. Thus if it is alleged <lb/>that he received a certain sum of money, it shall <lb/>not be sufficient to deny that he received that <lb/>particular amount, but he must deny that he <lb/>received that sum or any part thereof, or else set <lb/>out how much he received. And if an allegation is <lb/>made with diverse circumstances, it shall not be <lb/>sufficient to deny it along with those <lb/>circumstances. <lb/>Rule 5. Every allegation of fact in the plaint, if <lb/>not denied specifically, or by necessary <lb/>implication or stated to be not admitted the <lb/>pleading of the defendant, shall be taken to be <lb/>admitted except as against a person under <lb/>disability. <lb/>Provided that the court may in its discreation require <lb/>any fact so admitted to be proved otherwise than by <lb/>such admission.&quot; <lb/>These three rules form an integrated code dealing with <lb/>the manner in which allegations of fact in the plaint <lb/>should be traversed and the legal consequences <lb/></body>

The written <lb/>statement must deal specifically with each allegation of <lb/>fact in the plaint and when a defendant denies any such <lb/>fact, he must not do so evasively, but answer the point <lb/>of substance. If his denial of a fact is not specific but <lb/>evasive, the said fact shall be taken to be admitted. In <lb/>such an event, the admission itself being proof, no other <lb/>proof is necessary. The first para of Rule 5 is a <lb/>reproduction of Order 19, Rule 13 of the English rules <lb/>made under the Judicature Acts. But in mofussil Courts <lb/>in India, where pleadings were not precisely drawn, it <lb/>was found in practice that if they were strictly construed <lb/>in terms of the said provisions, grave injustice would be <lb/>done to parties with genuine claims. To do justice <lb/>between those parties, for which Courts are intended, <lb/>the rigor of Rule 5 has been modified by the <lb/>introduction of the proviso thereto. Under that proviso <lb/>the court may, in its discretion, require any fact so <lb/>admitted to be proved otherwise than by such <lb/>admission. In the matter of mofussil pleadings, Courts, <lb/>presumably replying upon the said proviso, tolerated <lb/>more laxity in the pleadings in the interest of justice. <lb/>But on the original side of the Bombay High Court, we <lb/>are told, the pleadings are drafted by trained lawyers <lb/>bestowing serious thought and with precision. In <lb/>construing such pleadings the proviso can be invoked <lb/>only in exceptional circumstances to prevent obvious <lb/>injustice to a party or to relieve him from the results of <lb/>an accidental slip or omission, but not to help a party <lb/>who designedly made vague denials and thereafter <lb/>sought to rely upon them for non-suiting the plaintiff. <lb/>The discretion under the proviso must be exercised by <lb/>a court having regard to the justice of a cause with <lb/>particular reference to the nature of the parties, the <lb/>standard of drafting obtaining in a locality, and the <lb/>traditions and conventions of a court wherein such <lb/>pleadings are filed. In this context the decision this <lb/>context the decision in Tildesley v. Harper [ (1878) LR <lb/></body>

			<body>7 Ch D 403] will be useful. There, in an action against a <lb/>lessee to set aside the lease granted under a power, the <lb/>statement of claim stated that the donee of the power <lb/>had received from the lessee a certain sum as a bribe, <lb/>and stated the circumstances; the statement of defence <lb/>denied that that sum had been given, and denied each <lb/>circumstance, but contained no general denial of a bribe <lb/>having been given. The court held, under rules <lb/>corresponding to the aforesaid rules of the Code of Civil <lb/>Procedure, that the giving of the bribe was not <lb/>sufficiently denied and therefore it must be deemed to <lb/>have been admitted. Fry., J. posed the question thus: <lb/>What is the point of substance in the allegations in the <lb/>statement of claim? and answered it as follows: <lb/>&quot;The point of substance is undoubtedly that a bribe was <lb/>given by Anderson to Tildesley, and that point of <lb/>substance is nowhere met … no fair and substantial <lb/>answer is, in my opinion, given to the allegation of <lb/>substance, namely, that there was a bribe. In my opinion <lb/>it is of the highest importance that this rule of pleading <lb/>should be adhered to strictly, and that the court should <lb/>require the defendant, when putting in his statement of <lb/>defence, and the plaintiff, when replying to the <lb/>allegations of the defendant, to state the point of <lb/>substance, and not to give formal denials of the <lb/>allegations contained in the previous pleadings without <lb/>stating the circumstances. As far as I am concerned, I <lb/>mean to give the fullest effect to that rule. I am <lb/>convinced that it is one of the highest benefit to suitors <lb/>in the court. xxx&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>74.

Bombay), may not apply when it <lb/>comes to matters involving close details of sexual relations <lb/>between a husband and wife as in the present case. We examine <lb/>this aspect a little later. And, in any case, the pleadings of the wife <lb/>have to be tested on the same standards as those of the husband. <lb/>75. The second judgment relied upon by Mr. V.K. Gupta <lb/>reported at (2003) 8 SCC 673, Sushil Kumar v. Rakesh Kumar <lb/>relates to an election dispute wherein the Supreme Court was <lb/>considering the question of disqualification of a candidate on <lb/>grounds of age to contest election to the State Legislative <lb/>Assembly. Specific assertions of facts relating to the date of birth, <lb/>names, date of birth of the petitioner and the respondent and his <lb/>elder brother; schooling were made which had not been specifically <lb/>traversed. In this context, the Supreme Court making reference to <lb/>Section 58 of the Indian Evidence Act observed that a fact admitted <lb/>need not be proved. There can be no dispute at all with this well <lb/>settled legal proposition. However, the standards which would <lb/>apply to the pleadings in the election petition cannot apply to the <lb/>pleadings in a matrimonial case. This would be more so as in a <lb/>case as the present one. <lb/>76. Even otherwise, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant <lb/>places reliance on the observations of the Supreme Court in the <lb/>judgment reported at AIR 1976 SC 461, Madan Gopal Kanodia v. <lb/>Mamraj Maniram &amp; Ors. to submit that the scrutiny by the court <lb/>should be meaningful and should not be in such a manner as to <lb/></body>

			<body>defeat a genuine claim. We extract hereunder the observations of <lb/>the Supreme Court in para 26 of this pronouncement which are <lb/>relied upon by the appellant : <lb/>&quot;26. In the written statement filed by the plaintiff under <lb/>Order 6, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the <lb/>particulars and essential details of the 21 bales of cloth <lb/>were clearly mentioned in para 1(b). Further more, <lb/>counsel for the plaintiff gave a statement before the trial <lb/>court on September 5, 1952 where also all the essential <lb/>details regarding the 200 bales of cloth were given. In <lb/>the statement the counsel for the plaintiff admitted that <lb/>the plaintiff had received the sale proceeds of 179 bales <lb/>of cloth and that 21 bales of cloth remained unaccounted <lb/>for. In the evidence also the plaintiff has sought to prove <lb/>the very case set up in the plaint as also in the written <lb/>statement filed later under orders of the Court. We are <lb/>unable to see any substantial variation between the <lb/>pleadings of the plaintiff and the evidence led by him at <lb/>the trial. It is well settled that pleadings are loosely <lb/>drafted in the courts, and the courts should not <lb/>scrutinise the pleadings with such meticulous care so <lb/>as to result in genuine claims being defeated on trivial <lb/>grounds. In our opinion, the finding of the High Court <lb/>that there was wide gap between the pleadings and the <lb/>proof is not at all borne out from the record of the <lb/>present case.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>77. We may also advert to the following observation of the <lb/>Supreme Court in para 51 of the pronouncement reported at AIR <lb/>1952 SC 47, Kedar Lal Seal &amp; Anr. V. Hari Lal Seal with regard <lb/>to the pleadings which were clumsily or inartistically worded : <lb/>&quot;51. I would be slow to throw out a claim on a mere <lb/>technicality of pleading when the substance of the thing <lb/>is there and no prejudice is caused to the other side, <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 49 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>however clumsily or inartistically the plaint may be <lb/>worded. In any event, it is always open to a court to <lb/>give a plaintiff such general or other relief as it deems <lb/>just to the same extent as if it had been asked for, <lb/>provided that occasions no prejudice to the other side <lb/>beyond what can be compensated for in costs.&quot; <lb/>78. On the aspect of the technical view being pressed on behalf <lb/>of the respondent no.1-husband, we are compelled to note the <lb/>observation in para 6 of the judgment reported at (1975) 1 SCC <lb/>774, Sushil Kumar Sen v. State of Bihar of Krishna Iyer J while <lb/>concurring with the majority opinion, had written that &quot;Justice is <lb/>the goal of jurisprudence -processual, as much as substantive&quot;. <lb/>Krishna Iyer, J had noted that &quot;the processual law so dominates in <lb/>certain systems as to overpower substantive rights and substantial <lb/>justice. The humanist rule that procedure should be the handmaid, <lb/>not the mistress, of legal justice compels consideration of vesting a <lb/>residuary power in Judges to act ex debito justiciae where the <lb/>tragic sequel otherwise would be wholly inequitable. xxx. <lb/>Parliament, I hope, will consider the wisdom of making the Judge <lb/>the ultimate guardian of justice by a comprehensive, though <lb/>guardedly worded, provision where the hindrance to rightful relief <lb/>relates to infirmities, even serious, sounding in procedural law. <lb/>Justice is the goal of jurisprudence -processual, as much as <lb/>substantive. While this appeal has to be allowed, for reasons set <lb/>out impeccably by my learned brother, I must sound a pessimistic <lb/>note that it is too puritanical for a legal system to sacrifice the end <lb/>product of equity and good conscience at the altar of processual <lb/></body>

			<body>punctiliousness and it is not too radical to avert a breakdown of <lb/>obvious justice by bending sharply, if need be, the prescriptions of <lb/>procedure. The wages of procedural sin should never be the death <lb/>of rights.&quot; <lb/>Krishna Iyer, J had also noted that &quot;the mortality of justice at <lb/>the hands of law troubles a Judge&apos;s conscience and points an angry <lb/>interrogation at the law reformer.&quot; <lb/>79. It is trite that courts are required to meaningfully construe <lb/>the entire gamut of pleadings before arising at the conclusions and <lb/>outcomes of cases. <lb/>80. There can be no dispute with these authoritative <lb/>pronouncements especially in the context of pleadings in <lb/>matrimonial cases which have to guide our consideration of the <lb/>pleadings of the parties. <lb/>81. There is one more aspect of this matter which over burdened <lb/>courts overlook. Courts get several opportunities to examine <lb/>pleadings, evidence as well as enter into discussions involving <lb/>sexual references. The same could arise in cases as the present <lb/>involving birth of a child during the subsistence of a marriage or <lb/>allegations of impotency or cases involving sexual offences <lb/>including rape, incest, etc; allegations of impotency against a <lb/>spouse in any matrimonial case amongst others. In each of these <lb/>cases, parties are required to plead and disclose what is most <lb/>internal/confidential/intimate to them. <lb/>82. One of us (Gita Mittal, J.) has had the opportunity to <lb/>examine an appeal against a person convicted for offence of rape <lb/></body>

			<body>under Section 376 of the IPC. In the judgment dated 29 th <lb/>September, 2009 entitled Virender v. The State of NCT of Delhi, <lb/>Crl. App.No.121/2008, it was noticed that the conviction rested on <lb/>statements attributed to the child victim. The first was the <lb/>statement recorded by the investigating officer under Section 161 <lb/>of the CrPC; the second recorded by the Metropolitan Magistrate <lb/>under Section 164 of the CrPC and the third to the sessions court <lb/>during the trial. The persons recording the statements of the victim <lb/>in Virender were personnel trained to do so, one being a police <lb/>official recording the statement under Section 161 during <lb/>investigation, two of them being judges of experience and <lb/>expertise, namely, the Metropolitan Magistrate who recorded the <lb/>statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. and lastly, the Additional <lb/>Sessions Judge who recorded the statement during trial who while <lb/>recording the statement of the accused under Section 313 of the <lb/>Cr.P.C. referred to the evidence of his having misbehaved with the <lb/>prosecutrix. <lb/>83. The statements attributed as having made by the victim at <lb/>these three stages, while referring to the acts of the offender, note <lb/>that he had done &quot;gandi harkatein&quot;; &quot;galat kaam&quot; and indulged in <lb/>misbehaviour. These statements hopelessly failed to bring out the <lb/>ingredients of the offence. From this failure to bring out the bare <lb/>ingredients of the offence, one glaring factor had shone through <lb/>which was noted in the following terms : <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 52 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;79. In the instant case, the evidence recorded by the <lb/>learned Metropolitan Magistrate under section 164 of <lb/>the CrPC and by the court appears to suggest <lb/>embarrassment of the court to put questions of any <lb/>kind to the prosecutrix and witness so as to elucidate <lb/>the complete truth from her resulting in, not <lb/>contradictory but incoherent testimony of the child <lb/>victim who has concealed the essential ingredients of <lb/>the offence. Use of appropriate language would enable <lb/>the necessary decency to be maintained in the <lb/>proceedings and the record. <lb/>A judge is require to be mindful that the edifice on <lb/>which the entire structure of the evidence of the <lb/>prosecution stands is the trustworthiness of the <lb/>testimony of the witness. Therefore, the manner and the <lb/>language in which the evidence is recorded is of extreme <lb/>importance. <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>84. The issue with regard to teaching of offences <lb/>regarding sexual assault and rape itself has been a <lb/>source of much discussion. I am informed that there are <lb/>instances of even legal educators being bashful and <lb/>embarrassed about teaching such subjects. Judges and <lb/>counsels are products of the legal education. The <lb/>multi-faceted problem and concerns noticed above are <lb/>not confined to ensuring gender justice in courts alone. <lb/>In this background, it is absolutely imperative that these <lb/>areas of law and the issues which have been raised <lb/>herein are taken up with all seriousness. Perhaps the <lb/>programme of continuing legal education needs to take a <lb/>look on these questions.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>84. We have made a detailed reference to the above for the sole <lb/>reason that, when it comes to matters of deepest intimacy involved <lb/></body>

			<body>in a sexual encounter even in a matter of pain (sexual violence), <lb/>most individuals as victims are hesitant to disclose the details or as <lb/>professionals/experts (lawyers, police, judges) to discuss them in <lb/>public space. Hence, the nature of pleadings in cases involving <lb/>disclosure of intimate details of the sexual life of even partners of a <lb/>marriage. <lb/>85. The same is apparent from the expressions used by the <lb/>husband in the present divorce petition as well. He has made bald <lb/>statements. Whereas, if specific detail was to be insisted upon, he <lb/>was required to state the exact dates and places when he had sought <lb/>to engage in the sexual intimacies with his wife, dates and <lb/>particulars of which attempt or invitation or effort by him was <lb/>spurned or refused by her. He does not do so. The failure to reflect <lb/>in more detail on the parties intimate relationship is a reflection of <lb/>his natural embarrassment to describe close details of the parties <lb/>intimate sexual life and of what must be the most private to them. <lb/>86. We have extracted above the husband&apos;s petition wherein also <lb/>he refers to the alleged extra marital relationship also in extremely <lb/>general terms. No specific details or instances are cited by him. <lb/>Mr. Sethi, learned Senior Counsel would submit that the <lb/>respondent no.1 was himself not sure of his case and has set-up <lb/>contrary pleas in almost every paragraph of his divorce petition <lb/>with regard to access. These varied assertions of access (ranging <lb/>from &quot;hardly&quot;) are spread all over the petition. <lb/>87. Reading of the above would also show that as mandated by <lb/>Rule 4 of Order VIII, the answering party must answer &quot;point of <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 54 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>substance&quot; in the pleadings of the other side. In the case in hand, <lb/>the point of substance, as pressed in the divorce petition is whether <lb/>the appellant wife has committed adultery with the person cited as <lb/>respondent no.2 and whether the child born on 6 th October, 2013 is <lb/>a result of such act of adultery. Put more simply, the appellant <lb/>wife has to deal with matters relating to intimate details of her <lb/>matrimonial life with the respondent no.1 husband and alleged <lb/>extra marital affair with the respondent no.2. <lb/>88. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant <lb/>wife has submitted that the appellant has categorically stated in the <lb/>written statement that the child to whom she had given birth on 6 th <lb/>October, 2013 was the respondent no.1 husband&apos;s. It is submitted <lb/>that she has clearly stated that the allegations of the husband were <lb/>demeaning, defaming, vilifying and false allegations which <lb/>amounted to cruelty. She has categorically denied the adultery <lb/>attributed to her and specifically adverted to &quot;his child&quot;. The <lb/>submission is that the pleadings have to be read as a composite <lb/>whole and not as if each sentence was disjointed. <lb/>89. The scrutiny of the above extract of the written statement <lb/>would show that the wife has categorically denied that she has <lb/>committed any act of adultery, that she has no association at all <lb/>with the respondent no.2. She has repeatedly asserted that <lb/>&quot;incorrect and wrongfacts&quot;; &quot;figment of imagination of the <lb/>petitioner&quot;; &quot;frivolous and fabricated ...ground of adultery&quot; (para <lb/>4); that the child born on 6 th of October 2013 is &quot;his own child&quot;, <lb/>&quot;false and malicious...trying to allege that he is not the biological <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 55 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>father of his own child&quot; (para 6); &quot;false and wild allegations <lb/>against his own child and wife&quot; (para 7); &quot;there is not an iota of <lb/>truth in the allegations made by the petitioner&quot; (para 8); &quot;ground of <lb/>adultery taken by the petitioner should not only be rejected but also <lb/>heavy costs&quot; (para 11). <lb/>In para 6 of the written statement, the anguish of the wife is <lb/>expressed when she has asserted how &quot;painful&quot; it was for her to <lb/>make the submissions. In para 11 of her written statement, the wife <lb/>states that &quot;perusal of the entire petition would show that the <lb/>petitioner has only tried to repeat the false and fabricated facts <lb/>related to this case in one way or other ...&quot;. <lb/>90. In this background, can it be held that the appellant has <lb/>failed to answer the point of substance? The answer has to be in <lb/>the negative. The wife has effectively denied the substantive case <lb/>of the husband and also generally denied each and every assertion <lb/>made by the husband each time he has repeated the allegation. <lb/>The wife&apos;s categorical denial of the allegation of adultery <lb/>and insistence that the child was the biological child of the <lb/>respondent no.1 even at one place coupled with her general denials <lb/>elsewhere in the written statement is sufficient denial in law, more <lb/>so when she asserts pain in having to deal with such allegations in <lb/>the pleadings. There is no requirement in law for the wife to go on <lb/>repeating the same pleas. Clearly even if the appellant has so <lb/>declared in one place, it was sufficient denial of the repetitive plea <lb/>of the respondent no.1. <lb/></body>

			<body>VIII. Is the court bound to pass orders premised on admissions <lb/>of parties? <lb/>91. Without expressing any opinion at this stage of the impact of <lb/>the wife&apos;s pleadings on the bald statements by the husband, the <lb/>proposition pressed by Mr. Gupta, learned senior counsel for the <lb/>husband that the wife has failed to deny the allegations of the <lb/>husband entitling him to the relief, can be tested from yet another <lb/>angle. <lb/>92. Even if the submissions of Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior <lb/>Counsel for the respondent no.1 that the respondent no.1-husband <lb/>had specifically asserted no access, that such fact as well as the fact <lb/>that the child born on 6 th October, 2013 was not born from the <lb/>wedlock and cohabitation of these two parties, was actually <lb/>admitted by the appellant wife, was the family court bound to <lb/>accept this position as admitted and to pass an order based on such <lb/>admission alone? The position in law is clearly to the contrary. <lb/>93. We find that the proviso to Rule 5 of Order VIII itself grants <lb/>discretion to the court to &quot;require any fact so admitted to be proved <lb/>otherwise than by such admission&quot;. A similar discretion is <lb/>reserved to the court even in Section 58 of the Indian Evidence <lb/>Act, 1872 wherein the proviso confers such discretion on the court <lb/>to require facts admitted to be proved &quot;otherwise than by such <lb/>admissions&quot;. The reason for such discretion, in a case like the <lb/>present one, is obvious. <lb/>94. Let us assume a case where the husband&apos;s pleadings qua <lb/>denial or lack of access to the wife to enable her to conceive their <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<body>child was specific. In her response/reply/written statement, instead <lb/>of denying the husband&apos;s plea of &quot;no access&quot;, the wife actually <lb/>admitted the assertions of the husband. <lb/>95. <lb/>The parties may have entered into a conspiracy to establish <lb/>that the child was not theirs for any malafide reasons, say for <lb/>instance, reasons of any tangible benefits arising out of inheritance; <lb/>estate benefits; immigration and citizenship etc.; or to claim any <lb/>benefit provided by law. They could collude to deny paternity or <lb/>relationship. Say, where a government scheme operates to confer <lb/>immovable property benefit on individuals who are not <lb/>related/siblings and it may be financially beneficial for establishing <lb/>that they are not related. In the case of contested matrimonial <lb/>litigation and child custody battles also, parties could falsely agree <lb/>to paternity issues to ensure denial of custody to the husband. <lb/>96. It needs no elaboration that it is the rights of the child which <lb/>are affected by any order accepting such pleadings of the parents. <lb/>Such child is not before the court. In the face of the admissions, <lb/>was the court bound to return a finding that the child was not his? <lb/>The answer has to be an emphatic no. Such finding of the court <lb/>could wreak havoc in the life of Baby &apos;X&apos; who is the innocent party <lb/>not before the court. It could adversely affect, even disentitle, such <lb/>child to rights in immoveable property. <lb/>The court has therefore, to independently ascertain the <lb/>correctness and genuineness of the allegation by one party, <lb/>irrespective of the admission in the pleadings of the other in as <lb/>much as it is the rights of the child involved. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 58 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>97. In the present case, even if the wife&apos;s pleadings could be <lb/>treated as an admission of the husband&apos;s case, the court is bound to <lb/>scrutinize the same with circumspection and require corroboration <lb/>of the admission, if any, by independent evidence to premise a <lb/>court order thereon. <lb/>98. In any event, looked at from any angle, we find that even if it <lb/>could be held that the husband&apos;s pleadings had not been traversed, <lb/>we have noted above that the respondent wife was called upon by <lb/>the husband not to traverse the case of complete non-access but of <lb/>&quot;hardly cohabited&quot; between &quot;2011 to December, 2013&quot;. <lb/>99. We find that in his cross-examination on the 24 th of <lb/>September 2015, the respondent no.1 husband has admitted that <lb/>during official meetings, the appellant wife used to come to his <lb/>residence for lunch or breakfast. The husband has also admitted <lb/>that his mother used to go to stay with the appellant wife during her <lb/>visits to Pilibhit. <lb/>100. In the present case also, the parties though posted in different <lb/>places, were coming together in reasonable proximity with <lb/>opportunity of intercourse. <lb/>101. The petition itself mentions that the parties were posted at <lb/>different places. Hence the statement by the husband that the <lb/>parties from 2011 to December, 2013 &quot;hardly cohabited&quot; i.e. <lb/>reduced opportunity relatable to official postings. But there is no <lb/>averment by the husband that there was no opportunity at all or that <lb/>the wife had no access to him (Ref.: Kamti Devi (Smt.) &amp; Anr. v. <lb/>Poshi Ram) <lb/></body>

			<body>102. Prima facie, the respondent no.1 is unable to support a case <lb/>of no access and instead of supporting the propounded allegations <lb/>of adultery, the circumstances on record and the evidence of the <lb/>respondent no.1 also lean in favour of the presumption under <lb/>Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act. Even if it could be held <lb/>that the wife has admitted such case, it could not be held that the <lb/>wife had stated that the parties had no cohabitation as husband and <lb/>wife during the relevant time. It is not possible to agree with the <lb/>respondent no.1 that there was deemed admission of &quot;no <lb/>cohabitation&quot; or &quot;non-access&quot; by the wife. <lb/>IX. Admissions of paternity by the husband on court records -<lb/>impact on &quot;prima facie case&quot; <lb/>103. An examination as to whether the respondent no.1-husband <lb/>had made out a prima facie case for grant of the prayer for the <lb/>DNA examination, cannot be completed without examining the <lb/>material in the present case in the form of admissions on the part of <lb/>the husband on the record. <lb/>104. It is the admitted case of the husband on 1 st October, 2014 a <lb/>joint petition being HMA No. 1099/2014, was filed in the court of <lb/>Principal Judge, Saket, New Delhi under Section 13B(1) of the <lb/>Hindu Marriage Act. We have extracted above para 7 of this <lb/>petition, wherein the respondent no.1 had unequivocally and <lb/>unconditionally declared that Baby &apos;X&apos; was born to them on 6 th <lb/>October, 2013 who was in custody of the mother at Sultanpur. The <lb/>respondent no. 1 had also referred to the agreement that the <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<body>permanent custody of this child would remain with the wife. <lb/>A joint statement was made in support of the petition <lb/>reiterating and declaring that there was one female child born on 6 th <lb/>October, 2013. This petition came to be withdrawn on account of <lb/>the objection with regard to its maintainability on account of <lb/>territorial jurisdiction of the court. <lb/>105. On 31 st October, 2014, the parties had jointly filed a second <lb/>petition under Section 13B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act which <lb/>was registered as HMA No. 783/2014 before the Family Court, <lb/>Patiala House, New Delhi for the relief of dissolution of their <lb/>marriage by a decree of divorce by mutual consent. This petition <lb/>also contained an identical admission of the birth of the child on 6 th <lb/>October, 2013 in para 7 as well as the agreement with regard to her <lb/>permanent custody. <lb/>106. Both the petitions were supported with affidavits of the <lb/>husband clearly stating that the consent was voluntary and that <lb/>there was no collusion between the parties in the submissions made <lb/>in the petition. <lb/>107. We find that so far as drafting and filing of the petitions <lb/>under the Hindu Marriage Act are concerned, Rules have been <lb/>notified by the Delhi High Court which are captioned as Rules to <lb/>Regulate Proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The <lb/>proceedings are required to be initiated by petitions in the format <lb/>detailed in Rule 5 thereof. So far as contents of the petition are <lb/>concerned, Rule 7 stipulates the particulars required to be given. <lb/>108. We extract hereunder the relevant portion of these rules : <lb/></body>

Contents of petition -In addition to the <lb/>particulars required to be given under Order VII, Rule 1 <lb/>of the Code and Section 20(1)of the Act, all petitions <lb/>under Secs. 9 to 13 shall state-<lb/>(a) the place and date of marriage. <lb/>(b) whether the petitioner and the respondent <lb/>were Hindu by religion at the time of the marriage <lb/>and whether they continue to be so up to the date <lb/>of filing of the petition; <lb/>(c) the name, status and domicile of the wife <lb/>and the husband before the marriage and at the <lb/>time of filing the petition; <lb/>(d) the address where the parties of the <lb/>marriage reside at the time of the presentation of <lb/>the petition and last resided, together; <lb/>(e) the names of children, if any, of the <lb/>marriage, their sex and their dates of birth or <lb/>ages; <lb/>(f) <lb/>if prior to the date of the petition there has <lb/>been any proceeding under the Act between the <lb/>parties to the petition, full particulars thereof. <lb/>(g) the matrimonial office or offences alleged <lb/>or other ground, upon which the relief is sought, <lb/>setting out with sufficient particularity the time <lb/>and places of the acts alleged and other facts <lb/>relied upon, but not the evidence by which they <lb/>are intended to be proved, e.g.-<lb/>xxx <lb/>(iv) in the case of alleged desertion, the date <lb/>and the circumstances in which it began, in the <lb/>case of cruelty the specific acts of cruelty and the <lb/>occasion when and the place where such acts <lb/>were committed.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>109. It is an admitted position that the divorce petitions which <lb/>were filed, were in compliance with the Rules. In both these <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 62 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>petitions, the husband had clearly stated that a child born on the 6 th <lb/>October, 2013. Clearly, as per Rule 7(e), the parties had given <lb/>details of the child &quot;of the marriage&quot;. This is a material admission <lb/>by the husband, not once but twice, on affidavit on judicial record <lb/>as well as on oath in his oral statement dated 1 st of October, 2014 in <lb/>HMA No.1099/2014. <lb/>110. When queried about the impact of this admission, Mr. V.K. <lb/>Gupta, learned senior counsel for the respondent no.1 has asserted <lb/>that it was not open for this court to go into this question and that <lb/>the same was irrelevant for the purposes of adjudicating on the <lb/>prayer for a DNA examination of the child. <lb/>Regrettably we are unable to agree with this submission. <lb/>111. The principles of law governing adjudication on an <lb/>application for DNA examination of a child are well settled. The <lb/>respondent no.1 -husband was bound to have made out a prima <lb/>facie case for grant of such a relief. Admissions of fact by a <lb/>husband are an important part of prima facie consideration of the <lb/>case. In the face of the above admissions, which negate his <lb/>challenge to paternity, the respondent was bound to have rendered <lb/>an explanation for the admissions. No such explanation has been <lb/>tendered before the Family Court. There is not a whit of an <lb/>explanation in the entire divorce petition, or in the application <lb/>seeking the DNA examination. The same has been refused to be <lb/>given before us. <lb/>112. These admissions on judicial record, clearly operate against <lb/>a finding of a prima facie case in favour of the husband. <lb/></body>

			<body>X. <lb/>Conduct of the husband despite his allegations against his <lb/>wife -impact thereof <lb/>113. In a case like the present once, conduct of the parties would <lb/>throw valuable light upon the prima facie consideration. We have <lb/>discussed above that the husband is himself not sure of the case <lb/>which he wants to make out. He himself has doubts about his plea <lb/>of illegitimacy. This is amply borne out from his pleadings about <lb/>his conduct and emotions after learning about the pregnancy of the <lb/>appellant. <lb/>114. The parties are at variance with regard to the date on which <lb/>the respondent no.1-husband learnt about the pregnancy. While the <lb/>respondent no.1 would want the court to believe that he learnt of <lb/>the same only in April, 2013, the appellant-wife has submitted that <lb/>he learnt of the same in February, 2013 after her medical <lb/>examination confirmed the same. <lb/>115. In para 13 of the divorce petition, the respondent no.1 has <lb/>stated that this news &quot;brought a mix bag of emotions&quot; as &quot;on one <lb/>hand he was happy to hear the news of a child coming in his life <lb/>which any normal male would have cherished but on the other <lb/>hand raised a strong level of suspicion in his intriguing mind about <lb/>the paternity of the child&quot;. <lb/>In para 14, the respondent no.1-<lb/>husband refers to &quot;such a whirlpool blowing in the mind of the <lb/>petitioner(husband) about the paternity of the child which has <lb/>raised a very strong doubt&quot;. Later in para 14, the husband has <lb/>referred to the fury of the wife when he doubted her character. <lb/>116. In para 15, reference is made to &quot;doubt&quot; or &quot;suspicion&quot; or <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 64 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;more strong level of suspicion&quot;. In para 17, the husband refers to <lb/>removal of his &quot;doubts&quot;. If there had been no access or <lb/>cohabitation, the husband would not have nursed merely a &quot;doubt&quot; <lb/>but would have had a firm belief that the child was not his. There <lb/>would be no question of &quot;a mix bag of emotions&quot; nor any occasion <lb/>to be &quot;happy to hear the news of a child coming in his life&quot;. If he <lb/>had no access to his wife and had no relations with her, there would <lb/>also be no &quot;whirlpool&quot; in the husband&apos;s mind about the paternity of <lb/>the child but the husband would be absolutely sure that the child <lb/>was not his. <lb/>117. Even in his examination-in-chief on affidavit dated 29 th July, <lb/>2015, the respondent no.1 husband has reiterated the above <lb/>pleadings. <lb/>118. These statements are to be tested against his admitted silence <lb/>with regard to his even nursing a suspicion through the entire <lb/>period of the pregnancy of nine months (and thereafter) when the <lb/>parties not even continued living as they were in the past, but also <lb/>celebrated the pregnancy of the appellant with all normal <lb/>ceremonies in the family of the respondent no.1-husband. <lb/>119. It is stated in her written statement (and admitted by the <lb/>husband in his evidence) that in March, 2013, the religious <lb/>ceremony relating to the pregnancy of the appellant was performed <lb/>at Bareilly in which parents of both the parties had participated. <lb/>His parents had come from Bihar for this purpose while her parents <lb/>had joined them as well! <lb/>120. One more material event inexplicably concealed by the <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 65 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>husband is also brought on record of the case by the wife. It is on <lb/>record that the birth of the child was celebrated by the parties and <lb/>their families and a proper namkaran ceremony was hosted. The <lb/>respondent no.1 husband has claimed in his evidence that he came <lb/>to know the name of the child &quot;Baby X&quot; in the namkaran sanskar <lb/>ceremony which was held in the October end or beginning of <lb/>November, 2015 and that his parents, relatives and he himself had <lb/>participated in the ceremony. The respondent no.1 had denied the <lb/>suggestion that he had invited 150 guests to attend the ceremony. <lb/>121. In his cross-examination, respondent no.1 was confronted <lb/>with seven photographs from the namkaran ceremony which have <lb/>been exhibited on record as PW-1/R-3 to PW-1/R-9. It includes <lb/>five photographs which feature just the respondent no.1-husband <lb/>and his wife (the appellant) with the child. In Ex.PW1/R-3 and <lb/>Ex.PW-1/R-5, featuring the appellant, respondent no.1 and the <lb/>child, the respondent no.1 husband appears extremely happy and is <lb/>holding the child in his arms in an intimate gesture as part of a <lb/>loving family. Ex.PW-1/R-4 appears to be a family photograph <lb/>which includes the couple with their child in the arms of the <lb/>husband and immediate family members of the parties. <lb/>122. Ex.PW-1/R-6 and Ex.PW-1/R-7 feature the appellant with <lb/>two of his friends (including the alleged adulterer). <lb/>The <lb/>photographs display his comfort and, in fact, his bearing reflects <lb/>happiness on the occasion. He has displayed complete comfort <lb/>with the appellant as well as the child and friendship with even the <lb/>alleged adulterer. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 66 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>123. The photograph Ex.PW-1/R-9 shows the respondent no.1 <lb/>with his mother and their Pandit performing the pooja (prayer) <lb/>relating to the namkaran ceremony. In his cross-examination, the <lb/>respondent no.1 has prevaricated suggesting that &quot;one person <lb/>probably&quot; looks like him! <lb/>None of these photographs displays any tension or anger or <lb/>revulsion as would be the normal reaction of any man, if, the <lb/>situation was as has been portrayed. <lb/>124. Let us note two more instances of the reaction of the <lb/>respondent no.1 to the arrival of the child and thereafter. In the <lb/>hearing before us, on the 23 rd of May 2016, a further affidavit was <lb/>sought to be filed by the appellant along with enclosures. The <lb/>same was taken on the record of the present case with the consent <lb/>of the respondent no.1 husband. <lb/>125. On 5 th of July 2016, we were informed by Mr. V.K. Gupta, <lb/>learned Senior Counsel for the respondent no.1 -husband, that <lb/>though there was no objection to the affidavit being taken on <lb/>record, the respondent no.1 was not filing any reply thereto for the <lb/>reason that &quot;the facts stated in the affidavit are irrelevant for the <lb/>purposes of the present appeal&quot; as well as &quot;for the purposes of <lb/>deciding the main divorce petition for the reason that it was <lb/>premised on the allegations of adultery on the part of the <lb/>appellant&quot;. So the appellant&apos;s affidavit and its annexures remain <lb/>undisputed before us. <lb/>126. For the purposes of the present appeal, we are only <lb/>concerned with the question as to whether the respondent no.1 had <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 67 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>established a strong prima facie case in consonance with the <lb/>requirements laid down by the Supreme Court for directing a DNA <lb/>examination of the child born on 6 th October, 2013. The affidavit <lb/>and enclosures stand taken on record with the consent of the <lb/>husband. We are within our jurisdiction to scrutinise the additional <lb/>affidavit and enclosed documents from this perspective alone. <lb/>127. The first document so brought on record is the birth <lb/>certificate dated 22 nd November, 2013 of the child issued by the <lb/>Lucknow Municipal Corporation which contains the name of the <lb/>parents of the child. We find that the birth certificate reflects the <lb/>father&apos;s name as &quot;H&quot; i.e. the respondent no.1 -husband and the <lb/>appellant as the mother of the girl child born on 6 th October, 2013. <lb/>128. The other document placed before us is the passbook issued <lb/>on 2 nd November, 2013 of an Account bearing No.33423970043 <lb/>which was opened in the State Bank of India, Civil Lines, Near <lb/>Kacheri, Bareilly. This passbook is of a saving bank account of the <lb/>child which was opened by the respondent no.1 -husband while he <lb/>was posted as District Magistrate, Bareilly. In the account, against <lb/>the column for name of the child, as it was a minor account, after <lb/>her name, it is mentioned &quot;UNG &apos;H&apos; IAS&quot;. We are informed that <lb/>this means that the child was &quot;under natural guardian &apos;H&apos; IAS&quot;. <lb/>Legally the father of the child is recognised as the natural guardian. <lb/>129. As per the wife&apos;s affidavit, during the namkaran ceremony <lb/>of the child, cash gifts had been received, which totalled <lb/>`1,61,000/-. The respondent no.1 -husband had deposited this <lb/>amount in this saving bank account on the 2 nd of November 2013. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 68 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>Photographs of the parents were also furnished to the bank by the <lb/>respondent no.1 which includes his own photograph as the child&apos;s <lb/>father. <lb/>130. Further subsequently, on the 20 th of November 2013, the <lb/>respondent no.1 had got the name of the appellant -wife also <lb/>added as a joint guardian of the child to continuously make deposit <lb/>for the benefit of the child. <lb/>131. Prima facie, there is substance in the appellant&apos;s contention <lb/>that each of these documents again contain admissions by the <lb/>appellant of his having fathered the child born on 6 th October, <lb/>2013. <lb/>132. Considering the vehemence with which the respondent <lb/>husband is now agitating the plea of adultery, it is inconceivable <lb/>that the husband, an experienced bureaucrat of considerable <lb/>experience, having control over a huge administrative <lb/>establishment and paraphernalia, would not only tolerate the <lb/>deviations of an errant wife, support her through a pregnancy <lb/>(allegedly extra marital) and also celebrate the same by performing <lb/>customary puja upon a wife&apos;s conception as well as the birth of the <lb/>child by a huge celebration. Or to permit his name to feature as <lb/>such child&apos;s birth certificate or to create and operate a bank account <lb/>for her! <lb/>These are behaviour which militates against a &quot;prima facie&quot; <lb/>case in his favour on the plea that he was not the father of the child. <lb/>133. It is important to note that the respondent husband has not <lb/>even remotely suggested any unnatural conduct on the part of his <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 69 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>wife during their marriage. He has made no allegation that she had <lb/>spurned him or found him abhorrent. On the contrary, normal <lb/>civility and relations are reflected and the parties appear to have <lb/>been meeting normally as husband and wife as well as <lb/>professionally in their official residences and official commitments. <lb/>134. In the discussion by the Supreme Court in para 10 of the <lb/>judgment reported at AIR 2001 SC 2226:(2001) 5 SCC 311, Kamti <lb/>Devi (Smt.) &amp; Anr. v. Poshi Ram, what is material is whether there <lb/>was a denial to the wife of access to the husband. No such material <lb/>is on record. <lb/>Concealment and statement of wrong facts -whether impacts <lb/>consideration of prima facie case? <lb/>135. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant <lb/>wife has drawn our attention to para 16 of the divorce petition. <lb/>Here, in an effort to support a plea of non-access, the respondent <lb/>no.1-husband has pleaded that &quot;the denial of access&quot; and &quot;cruel <lb/>conduct&quot; of the wife towards him &quot;continued during the entire <lb/>period of pregnancy also…&quot;. <lb/>136. In the written statement, the appellant-wife has stated that in <lb/>May, 2013, the respondent no.1-husband invited her to visit <lb/>Udaipur where he had made all arrangements for stay etc. in <lb/>Udaipur Vilas Palace Hotel which is a well-known wedding and <lb/>honeymoon destination and that, for the first time, all expenses <lb/>were borne by him. The appellant wife has also asserted that he <lb/>had arranged this Udaipur outing with the intention to persuade her <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 70 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>for a sex determination of the child to which she could not <lb/>reconcile nor accept. The appellant-wife has further pleaded that <lb/>for the first time he spent money lavishly on this outing, that the <lb/>parties came from Bareilly by road to Delhi and from Delhi, caught <lb/>a flight to Udaipur. <lb/>137. The fact that the parties went to Udaipur for holiday from 9 th <lb/>May, 2013 to 13 th May, 2013 has not even been mentioned in the <lb/>divorce petition by the husband. <lb/>However, in his cross <lb/>examination on 24 th September, 2015, this fact has been admitted <lb/>by him. When questioned that the stay of Udaipur must have cost <lb/>him `40,000/-to `50,000/-per day and that he had paid over `2 to <lb/>2.5 lakhs for the entire trip, the husband replied that he does not <lb/>know the tariff, nor does he recollect who had borne the expenses. <lb/>The appellant would suggest prevarication on his part, but this <lb/>aspect does not need to detain us here for a prima facie <lb/>consideration, except to the extent that the husband has concealed <lb/>this trip. The trip is conduct incompatible with that of a husband <lb/>whose wife is pregnant with an outsider&apos;s child. It is urged that on <lb/>the contrary, the trip supports the appellant&apos;s case of a normal <lb/>relationship between the parties. <lb/>During the Udaipur visit, the appellant wife was already <lb/>around three months into her pregnancy. Any reasonable person <lb/>who knew that the child was not his or that his wife was carrying <lb/>on an adulterous relationship would never vacation with her. <lb/>The plea of the husband that he had no access to the wife <lb/>during the duration of the pregnancy is therefore, clearly false. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 71 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>138. The appellant-wife has further asserted that the parties <lb/>continued to visit each other and that even thereafter, they both had <lb/>access to each other on all material time. It is the wife&apos;s assertion <lb/>that on 15 th August, 2013, he specifically came to stay with her at <lb/>her place of posting so that she would not be alone on her birthday <lb/>which happened to fall on 16 th August, 2013. <lb/>139. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel points out that <lb/>the entire case of the respondent no.1 of appellant wife having an <lb/>adulterous relationship with the respondent no.2, hinges on his <lb/>solitary allegation that one of his friend namely, Shri Vikas Verma <lb/>had seen the respondents in &quot;intimate gesture&quot; in the company of <lb/>each other on at least four to five occasions in public places. It is <lb/>stated that &quot;Shri Vikas Verma has himself seen respondent nos.1 <lb/>and 2 at Hotel Manor, Faizabad, P.S. Chinhath, District Lucknow <lb/>and their gestures fully corroborates..........the fact that respondent <lb/>nos.1 and 2 behind back of the petitioner were having an <lb/>extramarital relationship.....&quot;. <lb/>140. Mr. Sethi has drawn our attention to the record and pointed <lb/>out that Shri Vikas Verma was examined as a witness on 16 th of <lb/>October 2015 when he tendered his evidence by way of affidavit <lb/>which was exhibited as Ex.PW2/A. This witness gave an address of <lb/>Lucknow as his address. However, in his cross-examination, this <lb/>witness revealed that his residential address was &quot;241/A, Raiganj, <lb/>South Sarafa Katra, P.S. Rajgath, Gorakhpur&quot; and that he even has <lb/>a jewellery shop situated in Hindi Bazar, Gorakhpur. He also <lb/>disclosed that he had mentioned his father-in-law Shri Rajinder <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 72 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>Verma&apos;s address of Lucknow in his affidavit of evidence. It is <lb/>urged that this witness has clearly given a wrong address to falsely <lb/>justify his presence at Lucknow to support the husband. <lb/>141. In his cross-examination further, Shri Vikas Verma has <lb/>completely disclaimed that he had seen the appellant and the <lb/>respondent no.2 going inside Hotel Mannar! So far as the alleged <lb/>intimacy is concerned, in his cross-examination on 16 th October, <lb/>2015. Shri Verma baldly claimed that he had seen these two <lb/>persons &quot;going inside Hotel Charan&quot;. <lb/>This witness thus not only completely disclaimed the <lb/>contents of his own vague affidavit but also gave no specific date. <lb/>It lends support by the criticism that the respondent no.1 is <lb/>therefore, relying on bald and vague innuendo and suggestion in <lb/>support of his plea of adultery, without any material in support. <lb/>The evidence of Shri Vikas Verma was on the record of the Family <lb/>Court on 28 th January, 2016 for examining whether there was a <lb/>prima facie case in favour of the husband when the application was <lb/>considered and the impugned order passed. <lb/>XI. DNA report dated 23 rd April, 2015 -whether supports a <lb/>prima facie case in favour of the respondent no.1 -<lb/>husband? <lb/>142. The application dated 16 th October, 2015 on which the <lb/>impugned order was passed, in para 3 claims that the divorce <lb/>petition was filed on the act of adultery, &quot;confirmed by the DNA <lb/>report of umbilical cord (dried) belonging to the child delivered by <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 73 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>the respondent no.1&quot; and his blood samples, sent to DNA Lab <lb/>India Genetics Research and Development Centre for DNA test. In <lb/>para 4, the respondent no.1 referred to a DNA test purported to be <lb/>conducted by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Directorate <lb/>of Forensic Science Services, Ministry of Home Affairs, <lb/>Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh under orders of the Additional Chief <lb/>Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow in a criminal complaint filed by the <lb/>respondent no.1 under Section 497 of the IPC. The certified copy <lb/>of this report was filed by the appellant on the court record. <lb/>143. Before the Family Court, the respondent husband has relied <lb/>on a DNA test report dated 23 rd April, 2015. The respondent no.1 <lb/>claims that this is a report of testing of a sample from the husband <lb/>with a sample claimed by the husband to be that of the umbilical <lb/>cord of the child. <lb/>144. The respondent husband has claimed that he first got a <lb/>private DNA test conducted wherein a report dated 21 st November, <lb/>2013 was obtained, but the respondent husband has not placed <lb/>reliance on the report, either before the Family Court or in the <lb/>present appeal. <lb/>145. Before we deal with the report, it is necessary to understand <lb/>the requirements of law for its acceptance. In order to lend <lb/>veracity to a DNA report, even prima facie, first and foremost, the <lb/>person relying on the same has to prove the sources of the samples; <lb/>their confirmed identity, authenticity as well as purity thereof. <lb/>Additionally, the person relying on a scientific report has to make <lb/>out the chain of custody of these samples and to support that it was <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 74 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>only such confirmed samples which were actually tested and that <lb/>the scientific report relates to only the claimed samples, without <lb/>there being any possibility of mistake or tampering or soiling <lb/>thereof. Thus the first and foremost fact which had to be indicated <lb/>was that the report dated 23 rd April, 2015 actually related to <lb/>samples extracted/obtained from the minor child; that it was such <lb/>sample which had actually been sent to the test laboratory; that the <lb/>laboratory had conducted the test on that very sample vis-a-vis pure <lb/>sample from the respondent husband and that the report was <lb/>actually a result of DNA test conducted on the human samples <lb/>obtained from the minor child and the respondent husband. <lb/>We hasten to repeat here that we are at this stage again <lb/>assessing the material which was before the learned Trial Judge at <lb/>the time of passing of the impugned order from a prima facie <lb/>aspect alone. <lb/>146. The respondent no.1&apos;s evidence stood completed on 29 th <lb/>September, 2015 and was before the Family Court when the <lb/>application was considered. In his cross-examination, the appellant <lb/>wife has challenged every facet of the husband&apos;s claim with regard <lb/>to the DNA testing. From the very acquisition of the sample to the <lb/>result have been subjected to a cross-examination. <lb/>147. The respondent no.1 husband nowhere gives any particular <lb/>date on which the alleged sample i.e. the umbilical cord became <lb/>available to him, except to say that it was collected in the hospital. <lb/>He is unable to give definite size of the umbilical cord. So far as <lb/>its preservation was concerned, the respondent no.1 has claimed <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 75 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>that he &quot;collected it through a piece of paper, wrapped the same in <lb/>the paper and put it in my pocket at that time. Thereafter, I put the <lb/>same in an air tight glass jar which I purchased later on, after <lb/>leaving the hospital&quot;. The respondent no.1 claimed that &quot;umbilical <lb/>cord was kept in the same glass jar duly wrapped in a paper for <lb/>more than 1½ years (one and a half years)&quot;. He states that he did <lb/>not inform his parents or in-laws about having taken the cord for <lb/>testing. <lb/>148. Medical texts advise that the umbilical cord falls off after 7 <lb/>to 10 days of birth, sometimes after 5 days. The respondent no.1 <lb/>does not explain that the mother and child remained admitted in <lb/>hospital for such period. <lb/>149. Before us, additional material is pointed out from the trial <lb/>court record which was called for. In order to prove the DNA test <lb/>report, the respondent no.1 examined on 4 th March, 2016 as his <lb/>witness, Shri S. Sathyan, Senior Scientific Officer, Central <lb/>Forensic Science Laboratory, Hyderabad as PW-4. This witness <lb/>refers to a letter dated 25 th February, 2015 received by the CFSL <lb/>from the CMO, Lucknow (Ex.PW-4/1). While requesting the <lb/>Director of the CFSL to get the DNA test done as per the court <lb/>order, the CMO, Lucknow has referred to &quot;the blood sample of <lb/>&quot;H&quot; and the so called umbilical cord of Baby .......&quot;. The Director <lb/>does not confirm the source of the sample. <lb/>150. In his evidence also, PW-4 Shri Sathyan refers to the so <lb/>called umbilical cord. In his cross-examination, the witness clearly <lb/>stated that he was not sure as to whether the tested sample was that <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 76 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>of umbilical cord or not. Prima facie, there is thus, nothing at all to <lb/>connect the sample subjected to the testing, to the child concerned. <lb/>151. Mr. Sethi would urge that even if the husband had actually <lb/>collected the cord of the child, he has wrapped it in paper and <lb/>stored it in an ordinary bottle acquired by him, not a sanitised <lb/>sample bottle. The submission is that for an effective testing <lb/>sample had to be scientifically collected and preserved. It was so <lb/>kept for a long period of one and half years, clearly exposed to <lb/>continuous contamination. Ld. Senior Counsel would submit that <lb/>no reliance can be placed on the DNA report premised on such <lb/>sample for this reason as well. Unfortunately, the question as to <lb/>whether the alleged sample could have got contaminated, if <lb/>maintained or preserved in the manner as has been claimed by the <lb/>respondent no.1 husband, was disallowed. It is urged that even if <lb/>the sample was actually the child&apos;s, there is doubt about its purity <lb/>or effect of impurities on the testing. <lb/>152. Before us it is urged by Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior <lb/>Counsel for the appellant wife, that the DNA report does not <lb/>indicate that it relates to a sample of Baby &apos;X&apos;. Therefore, <lb/>assuming without admitting that the report could be accepted as <lb/>having been proved, it is certainly no proof of the fact that the <lb/>laboratory had conducted a test on a sample which actually <lb/>belonged to the child. At best, the DNA report relied upon by the <lb/>respondent husband had only suggested that a DNA test had been <lb/>conducted on a sample of some tissue which did not match the <lb/>respondent no.1 husband. Simply put, the respondent -husband is <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 77 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>unable to connect the DNA report to the child in question. <lb/>153. In the face of the above, the DNA test report, prima facie <lb/>does not support the husband&apos;s claim that the report establishes that <lb/>it actually relates to a sample of the child. <lb/>XII. In the facts of the present case, effect of the presumption <lb/>under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act <lb/>154. The appellant before us has vehemently urged that in the <lb/>instant case, the presumption of legitimacy of the child is <lb/>irrebuttable and conclusive of the fact. This is for the reason that <lb/>the respondent has failed to make out a case of non-access during <lb/>the relevant period when the child could have been conceived. <lb/>There is no dispute that the child was borne to the parties who were <lb/>married to each other and had access to each other during the <lb/>period of possible conception. <lb/>155. This principle stands reiterated by the Supreme Court in its <lb/>judgment reported at AIR 2010 SC 2851, Bhabani Prasad Jena v. <lb/>Convenor Secretary, Orissa State Commission for Women &amp; Anr. <lb/>In the following para 19 of the judgment, the Supreme Court <lb/>extracted para 13 of (2005) 4 SCC 449, Banarasi Das v. Mrs. <lb/>Teeku Datta &amp; Anr., and again cautioned that the DNA test was <lb/>not to be directed as a matter of routine and that only in deserving <lb/>cases, such a direction should be given : <lb/>&quot;19. In Banarsi Dass v. Teeku Dutta [(2005) 4 SCC 449] <lb/>this Court was concerned with a case arising out of a <lb/>succession certificate. The allegation was that Teeku Dutta <lb/>was not the daughter of the deceased. An application was <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 78 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>made to subject Teeku Dutta to DNA test. The High Court <lb/>held that the trial court being a testamentary court, the <lb/>parties should be left to prove their respective cases on the <lb/>basis of the evidence produced during trial, rather than <lb/>creating evidence by directing DNA test. When the matter <lb/>reached this Court, few decisions of this Court, <lb/>particularly, Goutam Kundu [(1993) 3 SCC 418 : 1993 <lb/>SCC (Cri) 928] were noticed and it was held that even the <lb/>result of a genuine DNA test may not be enough to escape <lb/>from the conclusiveness of Section 112 of the Evidence <lb/>Act like a case where a husband and wife were living <lb/>together during the time of conception. This is what this <lb/>Court said: (Banarsi Dass case [(2005) 4 SCC 449] , SCC <lb/>pp. 454-55, para 13) <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>It was emphasised that DNA test is not to be directed as a <lb/>matter of routine and only in deserving cases such a <lb/>direction can be given.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>156. Ld. Senior Counsel for the appellant has also placed the <lb/>pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at AIR 2015 SC 418 <lb/>Dipanwita Roy v. Ronobroto Roy. In this case, categorical <lb/>assertions that the parties never lived together, that is of &quot;no <lb/>access&quot; were made. The wife was clearly stated to be living in an <lb/>adulterous relationship at another address with another person. In <lb/>para 2 of the judgment, the pleadings of the party were extracted <lb/>which reads thus : <lb/>&quot;2. One of the grounds for seeking divorce was based <lb/>on the alleged adulterous lifestyle of the petitioner wife. <lb/>For his above assertion, the respondent husband made the <lb/>following allegations in Paras 23 to 25 of his petition: <lb/>&quot;23. That since 22-9-2007 the petitioner never lived <lb/>with the respondent and did not share bed at all. On a <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 79 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>very few occasions since then the respondent came to <lb/>the petitioner&apos;s place of residence to collect her things <lb/>and lived there against the will of all to avoid public <lb/>scandal. The petitioner did not turn (sicaway) the <lb/>respondent from house on those occasions. <lb/>24. That by her extravagant lifestyle the respondent <lb/>has incurred heavy debts. Since she has not disclosed <lb/>her present address to bank and has only given the <lb/>address of the petitioner, the men and collection agents <lb/>of different banks are frequently visiting the petitioner&apos;s <lb/>house and harassing the petitioner. They are looking for <lb/>the respondent for recovery of their dues. Notice from <lb/>attorney firms for recovery of dues from the respondent <lb/>and her credit card statements showing heavy debts are <lb/>being sent to the petitioner&apos;s address. The respondent <lb/>purchased one car in 2007 with the petitioner&apos;s uncle, <lb/>Shri Subrata Roy Chowdhary, as the guarantor. The <lb/>respondent has failed to pay the instalments regularly. <lb/>25. That the petitioner states that the respondent has <lb/>gone astray. She is leading a fast life and has lived in <lb/>extra-marital relationship with the said Mr Deven Shah, <lb/>a well-to-do person who too is a career oriented <lb/>gentleman and has given birth to a child as a result of <lb/>her cohabitation with Shri Deven Shah. It is reported <lb/>that the respondent has given birth to a baby very <lb/>recently. The respondent is presently living at the <lb/>address as mentioned in the cause-title of the <lb/>plaint.&quot;(emphasis supplied)&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>There can be no dispute with the above proposition. <lb/>157. It appears from the narration of facts that the petitioner had <lb/>never lived with or shared a bed with her at all (or in any case since <lb/>22-9-07). <lb/>The husband had made &quot;clear and categorical <lb/>assertions&quot;. In paras 10, 11 and 12, the Supreme Court held as <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 80 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>follows : <lb/>&quot;10.It is borne from the decisions rendered by this Court <lb/>in Bhabani Prasad Jena[Bhabani Prasad Jena v. Orissa <lb/>State Commission for Women, (2010) 8 SCC 633 : (2010) <lb/>3 SCC (Civ) 501 : (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 1053] and Nandlal <lb/>Wasudeo Badwaik[Nandlal Wasudeo Badwaik v. Lata <lb/>Nandlal Badwaik, (2014) 2 SCC 576 : (2014) 2 SCC (Civ) <lb/>145 : (2014) 4 SCC (Cri) 65] that depending on the facts <lb/>and circumstances of the case, it would be permissible for <lb/>a court to direct the holding of a DNA examination to <lb/>determine the veracity of the allegation(s) which constitute <lb/>one of the grounds, on which the party concerned would <lb/>either succeed or lose. There can be no dispute, that if the <lb/>direction to hold such a test can be avoided, it should be <lb/>so avoided. The reason, as already recorded in various <lb/>judgments by this Court, is that the legitimacy of a child <lb/>should not be put to peril. <lb/>11. The question that has to be answered in this case is in <lb/>respect of the alleged infidelity of the appellant wife. The <lb/>respondent husband has made clear and categorical <lb/>assertions in the petition filed by him under Section 13 of <lb/>the Hindu Marriage Act, alleging infidelity. He has gone to <lb/>the extent of naming the person who was the father of the <lb/>male child born to the appellant wife. It is in the process of <lb/>substantiating his allegation of infidelity that the <lb/>respondent husband had made an application before the <lb/>Family Court for conducting a DNA test which would <lb/>establish whether or not he had fathered the male child born <lb/>to the appellant wife. The respondent feels that it is only <lb/>possible for him to substantiate the allegations levelled by <lb/>him (of the appellant wife&apos;s infidelity) through a DNA test. <lb/>We agree with him. In our view, but for the DNA test, it <lb/>would be impossible for the respondent husband to <lb/>establish and confirm the assertions made in the pleadings. <lb/>We are therefore satisfied that the direction issued by the <lb/>High Court, as has been extracted hereinabove, was fully <lb/>justified. DNA testing is the most legitimate and <lb/>scientifically perfect means, which the husband could use, <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 81 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>to establish his assertion of infidelity. This should <lb/>simultaneously be taken as the most authentic, rightful and <lb/>correct means also with the wife, for her to rebut the <lb/>assertions made by the respondent husband, and to establish <lb/>that she had not been unfaithful, adulterous or disloyal. If <lb/>the appellant wife is right, she shall be proved to be so. <lb/>12. We would, however, while upholding the order passed <lb/>by the High Court, consider it just and appropriate to <lb/>record a caveat, giving the appellant wife liberty to comply <lb/>with or disregard the order passed by the High Court, <lb/>requiring the holding of the DNA test. In case, she accepts <lb/>the direction issued by the High Court, the DNA test will <lb/>determine conclusively the veracity of accusation levelled <lb/>by the respondent husband against her. In case, she declines <lb/>to comply with the direction issued by the High Court, the <lb/>allegation would be determined by the court concerned by <lb/>drawing a presumption of the nature contemplated in <lb/>Section 114 of the Evidence Act, especially, in terms of <lb/>Illustration (h) thereof. Section 114 as also Illustration (h), <lb/>referred to above, are being extracted hereunder: <lb/>&quot;114.Court may presume existence of certain facts.-<lb/>The court may presume the existence of any fact <lb/>which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being <lb/>had to the common course of natural events, human <lb/>conduct and public and private business, in their <lb/>relation to the facts of the particular case.&quot; <lb/>&quot;Illustration (h)-that if a man refuses to answer a question <lb/>which he is not compelled to answer by law, the answer, if <lb/>given, would be unfavourable to him;&quot; <lb/>This course has been adopted to preserve the right of <lb/>individual privacy to the extent possible. Of course, without <lb/>sacrificing the cause of justice. By adopting the above <lb/>course, the issue of infidelity alone would be determined, <lb/>without expressly disturbing the presumption contemplated <lb/>under Section 112 of the Evidence Act. Even though, as <lb/>already stated above, undoubtedly the issue of legitimacy <lb/>would also be incidentally involved.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 82 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>158. We may note the submissions of Mr. V.K. Gupta, ld. Senior <lb/>Counsel for the respondent insisting that the Supreme Court has <lb/>authoritatively laid down that the DNA test is the only manner of <lb/>establishing a plea of infidelity by one spouse against the other. It <lb/>is urged that, therefore, in a case where a spouse alleges infidelity <lb/>on the part of his wife, medical examination has to be ordered. We <lb/>are unable to agree with this submission. In paras 11 and 12, the <lb/>Supreme Court is concerned with the facts of that particular case. <lb/>The Supreme Court has in fact in para 10 reiterated the same <lb/>caution as was mandated in prior judicial precedents. <lb/>159. The absolute submission and proposition pressed by Mr. <lb/>Gupta may be tested from another angle. What if there were no <lb/>child from the alleged infidelity or the extra marital affair of the <lb/>wife? What about a case where the wife alleges infidelity against <lb/>the husband, with or without there being a child from such <lb/>relationship? The husband (or the wife) has to stand on his own <lb/>feet and establish the allegedly infidelity as per law. <lb/>Accepting the proposition urged by Mr. Gupta would in <lb/>effect, tantamount to laying down the principle that a spouse had to <lb/>merely make an allegation of infidelity (or mental illness or <lb/>impotency), without anything more, and courts would have to <lb/>mandatorily direct scientific (or medical) examination. <lb/>160. It is a first principle of procedural law that a party alleging a <lb/>fact, must prove it. Binding judicial precedents noted above have <lb/>laid down that a party must establish a strong prima facie case <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 83 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>before a court would make an order for the scientific (or medical) <lb/>examination, especially of the intrusive kind as a DNA <lb/>examination. The court cannot conduct a fishing or roving inquiry <lb/>for a party and a DNA test cannot be ordered to gather evidence on <lb/>behalf of a party who has made a bald allegation, without anything <lb/>more. <lb/>161. For this reason, even in Diwanwita Roy, while approving the <lb/>order for the DNA test in the facts of the case, the court has clearly <lb/>declared that the presumption under Section 112 of the Evidence <lb/>Act would not be lightly disturbed. In para 10, the court has noted <lb/>that the order depends &quot;on the facts and circumstances of the case&quot;. <lb/>In para 11, the Supreme Court has noted &quot;the question to be <lb/>answered in this case&quot;. <lb/>162. Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent <lb/>has placed the observations in the judgment of the Supreme Court <lb/>reported at (2014) 2 SCC 576 Nandlal Wasudeo Badwaik v. Lata <lb/>Nandlal Badwaik &amp; Anr. Reliance has been placed on the <lb/>following by ld. Senior Counsel : <lb/>&quot;13. Before we proceed to consider the rival <lb/>submissions, we deem it necessary to understand what <lb/>exactly DNA test is and ultimately its accuracy. All <lb/>living beings are composed of cells which are the <lb/>smallest and basic unit of life. An average human body <lb/>has trillions of cells of different sizes. DNA <lb/>(Deoxyribonucleic Acid), which is found in the <lb/>chromosomes of the cells of living beings, is the <lb/>blueprint of an individual. Human cells contain 46 <lb/>chromosomes and those 46 chromosomes contain a total <lb/>of six billion base pairs in 46 duplex threads of DNA. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 84 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>DNA consists of four nitrogenous bases -adenine, <lb/>thymine, cytosine, guanine and phosphoric acid <lb/>arranged in a regular structure. When two unrelated <lb/>people possessing the same DNA pattern have been <lb/>compared, the chances of complete similarity are 1 in 30 <lb/>billion to 300 billion. Given that the Earth&apos;s population <lb/>is about 5 billion, this test shall have accurate result. It <lb/>has been recognised by this Court in Kamti Devi[Kamti <lb/>Devi v. Poshi Ram, (2001) 5 SCC 311 : 2001 SCC (Cri) <lb/>892] that the result of a genuine DNA test is <lb/>scientifically accurate. It is nobody&apos;s case that the result <lb/>of the DNA test is not genuine and, therefore, we have <lb/>to proceed on an assumption that the result of the DNA <lb/>test is accurate. The DNA test reports show that the <lb/>appellant is not the biological father of the girl child. <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>15. Here, in the present case, the wife had pleaded that <lb/>the husband had access to her and, in fact, the child was <lb/>born in the said wedlock, but the husband had <lb/>specifically pleaded that after his wife left the <lb/>matrimonial home, she did not return and thereafter, he <lb/>had no access to her. The wife has admitted that she had <lb/>left the matrimonial home but again joined her husband. <lb/>Unfortunately, none of the courts below have given any <lb/>finding with regard to this plea of the husband that he <lb/>had or had not any access to his wife at the time when <lb/>the child could have been begotten. <lb/>16. As stated earlier, the DNA test is an accurate test <lb/>and on that basis it is clear that the appellant is not the <lb/>biological father of the girl child. However, at the same <lb/>time, the condition precedent for invocation of Section <lb/>112 of the Evidence Act has been established and no <lb/>finding with regard to the plea of the husband that he <lb/>had no access to his wife at the time when the child <lb/>could have been begotten has been recorded. <lb/>Admittedly, the child has been born during the <lb/>continuance of a valid marriage. Therefore, the <lb/>provisions of Section 112 of the Evidence Act <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 85 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>conclusively prove that Respondent 2 is the daughter of <lb/>the appellant. At the same time, the DNA test reports, <lb/>based on scientific analysis, in no uncertain terms <lb/>suggest that the appellant is not the biological father. In <lb/>such circumstance, which would give way to the other is <lb/>a complex question posed before us.&quot; <lb/>163. It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court has further reiterated <lb/>the conclusiveness of the presumption under Section 112 of the <lb/>Indian Evidence Act in para 14 of the pronouncement in the <lb/>following terms : <lb/>&quot;14. Now we have to consider as to whether the DNA test <lb/>would be sufficient to hold that the appellant is not the <lb/>biological father of Respondent 2, in the face of what has <lb/>been provided under Section 112 of the Evidence Act, <lb/>which reads as follows: <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>From a plain reading of the aforesaid, it is evident that a <lb/>child born during the continuance of a valid marriage <lb/>shall be a conclusive proof that the child is a legitimate <lb/>child of the man to whom the lady giving birth is married. <lb/>The provision makes the legitimacy of the child to be a <lb/>conclusive proof, if the conditions aforesaid are satisfied. <lb/>It can be denied only if it is shown that the parties to the <lb/>marriage had no access to each other at any time when <lb/>the child could have been begotten.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>164. In Nandlal Wasudeo Badwaik, the husband had led <lb/>evidence that after his wife left the matrimonial home, she did not <lb/>return and that he had no access to her when the child could have <lb/>been begotten. The courts below had not given any finding with <lb/>regard to this plea. It is also noteworthy that in this case, the DNA <lb/>testing was done under orders of the court which had not been <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 86 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>opposed by the wife. The DNA test report suggested that the <lb/>appellant was not the biological father. In these circumstances, the <lb/>court held in para 17 that where there was evidence to the contrary, <lb/>the presumption under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act, <lb/>being rebuttable, would yield to conclusive proof. In para 19, the <lb/>court noted that the husband&apos;s plea, that he had no access to the <lb/>wife when the child was begotten, stood proved by the DNA test <lb/>report. <lb/>165. Principles laid down in prior judgments including AIR 1934 <lb/>PC 49, Karapaya Servai v. Mayandi; AIR 1954 SC 176, Chilukuri <lb/>Venkateswarlu v. Chilukuri Venkatanarayan; AIR 1993 SC 2295, <lb/>Goutam Kundu v. State of West Bengal &amp; Anr.; AIR 2001 SC <lb/>2226, Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram; AIR 2003 SC 3450, Sharda v. <lb/>Dharmpal and AIR 2010 SC 2851, Bhabani Prasad Jena v. <lb/>Convenor Secretary, Orissa State Commission for Women &amp; Anr. <lb/>have not been overturned and bind the present consideration. No <lb/>absolute proposition as is contended by Mr. Gupta has been laid <lb/>down in the judicial precedents. <lb/>166. Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant <lb/>has placed reliance on the Single Bench pronouncement in this <lb/>court reported at (2011) 121 DRJ 563, Rohit Shekhar v. Narayan <lb/>Dutt Tiwari in support of his submissions. The consideration in <lb/>this case has to be read in the light of the facts situation in which <lb/>the judgment was rendered. Mr. Rohit Shekhar claimed to be the <lb/>biological son of the defendant no.1 and born out of the <lb/>relationship of defendant no.1 with the defendant no.2. It is an <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 87 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>admitted position that the defendant no.2 was married to a third <lb/>person which marriage was subsisting at the time of birth of the <lb/>plaintiff. The husband of the defendant no.2 had claimed no access <lb/>to the defendant no.2 at the time on which the plaintiff would have <lb/>been conceived. The defendant no.2 -mother was supporting the <lb/>plea of the plaintiff that he was the biological son of the defendant <lb/>no.1. <lb/>167. The application seeking the DNA examination was filed not <lb/>by the father -defendant no.1, but by the plaintiff and sought <lb/>directions to the defendant no.1 to furnish blood samples for a <lb/>DNA comparison with his own samples to establish that the <lb/>defendant no.1 was his father. The court had considered the <lb/>plaintiff&apos;s right to know his roots and noted that the application had <lb/>been filed by an adult person who had moved the court for a <lb/>declaration to determine his or her paternity. The court had <lb/>recognized the well settled position of the jurisdiction to order a <lb/>DNA examination and ordered accordingly. <lb/>This case has no parity with the case in hand. <lb/>168. We have discussed above the pleadings of the husband in the <lb/>present case and concluded their insufficiency from the factual <lb/>matrix brought out before us, the judgments relied upon by the <lb/>appellant would not apply to the present case. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 88 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>XIII. Ensuring the Constitutional rights of the child <lb/>169. Our consideration cannot end here. The inevitable victim of <lb/>an order in a paternity challenge in matrimonial litigation is the <lb/>child who is not before the court. We have noted above that for a <lb/>wide variety reasons (paras 95 to 97) parties may attempt to obtain <lb/>collusive orders on this issue. Any consideration and adjudication <lb/>on this aspect directly impacts the right to life of the child <lb/>guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It is a <lb/>first principle of legal procedure and natural justice, that a person <lb/>affected has a right to be heard. <lb/>170. So far as children are concerned, it is trite that the courts are <lb/>parens patriae and it is the responsibility of the court to ensure the <lb/>welfare and best interest of the child in every proceeding where the <lb/>rights and interest of the child are impacted. Such interest of the <lb/>child has to be ensured independent of the rights and claims of the <lb/>parties to the lis. <lb/>171. As parens patriae, the court is bound to ensure the rights of <lb/>the child which has to include independent and fair representation <lb/>as well as hearing to the child, before passing such order. <lb/>172. Para 81 of the three judge bench pronouncement of the <lb/>Supreme Court reported at AIR 2003 SC 3450 Sharda v. <lb/>Dharmpal sheds some light on the consideration by the court in a <lb/>case involving any issue of the paternity of the child which reads <lb/>thus: <lb/>&quot;81. If for arriving at the satisfaction of the court and <lb/>to protect the right of a party to the lis who may <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 89 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>otherwise be found to be incapable of protecting his <lb/>own interest, the court passes an appropriate order, the <lb/>question of such action being violative of Article 21 of <lb/>the Constitution of India would not arise. The court <lb/>having regard to Article 21 of the Constitution of India <lb/>must also see to it that the right of a person to defend <lb/>himself must be adequately protected.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>173. How can, say, as in a case as the present, the court protect <lb/>the rights of the child in question? This can only be done by <lb/>ensuring independent representation to the child at all stages of the <lb/>case where the aspect of paternity is being considered or is <lb/>involved. <lb/>174. Valuable insight is shed on the standards and parameters <lb/>within which the courts are bound to ensure the rights of the child <lb/>in the &quot;Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council <lb/>of Europe on child -friendly justice&quot;. The Guidelines were <lb/>adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe <lb/>on the 17 th of November 2010. These Guidelines, though not <lb/>binding on the courts in India, but lend valuable guidance to the <lb/>manner in which the rights of the child, if and when in conflict with <lb/>parents, or otherwise in judicial precedents can be adequately <lb/>protected. Reference may usefully be made to Chapter IV <lb/>captioned &quot;Child-friendly justice before, during and after judicial <lb/>proceedings&quot;. Sub-Chapter A of this Chapter deals with &quot;Child-<lb/>friendly justice during judicial proceedings&quot;. We are concerned <lb/>with Section 2 thereof which reads &quot;Legal counsel and <lb/>representation&quot;. The relevant extract thereof reads thus: <lb/></body>

Legal counsel and representation <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>&quot;42. In cases where there are conflicting interests between <lb/>parents and children, the competent authority should <lb/>appoint either a guardian ad litem or another independent <lb/>representative to represent the views and interests of the <lb/>child. <lb/>43. Adequate representation and the right to be represented <lb/>independently from the parents should be guaranteed, <lb/>especially in proceedings where the parents, members of the <lb/>family or caregivers are the alleged offenders. <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx <lb/>xxx&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis by us) <lb/>We are of the view that these are the rights which must be <lb/>ensured to every child in all judicial proceedings independently <lb/>from the parents especially in cases involving parentage and <lb/>identity issues. <lb/>175. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of such case, <lb/>the court would be bound to appropriately appoint a guardian ad <lb/>litem or an amicus curiae to ensure the interest of the child which <lb/>has to include effective representation to him/her, depending on the <lb/>facts and circumstances of the case. <lb/></body>

			<body>XIV. Impugned order <lb/>176. It was imperative for the trial judge who was seized of the <lb/>application for a DNA examination of the minor child in the <lb/>present case on the 28 th of January 2016 to consider the same, on <lb/>the binding parameters set out hereinabove. On that date the court <lb/>had almost the entire case of the respondent no.1 husband before it <lb/>inasmuch as the substantive evidence of the respondent no.1 and <lb/>his main witness also stood recorded. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned <lb/>Senior Counsel for the appellant has carefully taken us through the <lb/>impugned order dated 28 th of January 2016 passed by the learned <lb/>Trial Judge whereby the appellant&apos;s application was allowed and <lb/>the directions were issued to the appellant to produce Baby &apos;X&apos; to <lb/>the office of the Director, CFSL, CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New <lb/>Delhi at 10:30 am on 10 th February, 2016 when the respondent <lb/>no.1would also be present so that samples of the child and the <lb/>respondent no.1 would be obtained by the laboratory in the <lb/>presence of both parties for conducting the DNA test at the expense <lb/>of the husband. Additionally the directions were made that prior <lb/>thereto, the respondent no.1 shall deposit an amount of `1,00,000/-<lb/>by way of demand draft/banker&apos;s cheque in the name of the court <lb/>which would stand forfeited and made over to the appellant in the <lb/>event that the paternity test on the basis of the DNA results shows <lb/>the husband to be the father of the child. In case, the result reveals <lb/>that the respondent no.1 is not the father of the child, the amount <lb/>would be refunded to the respondent no.1. It was further directed <lb/></body>

			<body>that the parties to the petition, their agents, representative or any <lb/>other person acting on their behalf or any entity in print, electronic <lb/>media or internet will not print, publish or telecast any matter <lb/>relating to the case, in any manner without the permission of the <lb/>court. <lb/>177. So far as the reasoning for the order is concerned, we find <lb/>that the trial court has merely noted the bald contention of the <lb/>appellant; the provisions of the Section 112 of the Indian Evidence <lb/>Act. <lb/>The trial court has noted the reliance placed by the appellant <lb/>on the pronouncements in Goutam Kundu v. State of W.B. in (1993) <lb/>3 SC; Miss Renuka Vs. Tammanna AIR 2007 Kant 133; Sunil <lb/>Eknath Trambake Vs. Leelavati Sunil Trambake AIR 2006 Bom <lb/>140; Shri Banarsi Dass Vs. Teeku Datta (2005) 4 SCC 449; Smt. <lb/>Kanti Devi Vs. Poshi Ram (2001) 5 SCC 311 and; Dukhtar Jahan <lb/>Vs. Mohammad Farooq 187 Cr.L.J. 849. <lb/>Reliance has been placed on the extract of the 185 th Report <lb/>of the Law Commission of India and that of the Supreme Court in <lb/>Dipanwita Roy v. Ronobroto Roy. <lb/>178. We find that the appellant had also objected to the DNA test <lb/>report relied upon by the respondent no.1 pointing out that the <lb/>appellant was never joined in the testing and furthermore that the <lb/>child was the third party to the consideration. The plea of <lb/>cohabitation of the appellant and the respondent no.1 is also noted <lb/>as also the denial of the respondent no.1. Without at all recording <lb/>any prima facie conclusions in accordance with law, as noted by us <lb/></body>

			<body>above, simply observing that &quot;keeping in view the facts and <lb/>circumstances of this case and in view of the discussions made <lb/>herein above&quot;, the court recorded its satisfaction that there was a <lb/>need for conducting the DNA test of the petitioner. In our view, <lb/>the Family Court has completely failed to consider the matter, as <lb/>was required in law. The impugned order dated 28 th January, 2016 <lb/>is clearly contrary to the well settled principles noticed by us in the <lb/>above judgments, devoid of reasoning to support the order, fails to <lb/>consider or return a finding that the respondent no.1 had a prima <lb/>facie case in his favour and is legally not sustainable. <lb/>179. The instant case has to be examined from yet another <lb/>perspective. In Bhabani Prasad Jena the Supreme Court has held <lb/>that the court must see whether the justice of the case requires a <lb/>DNA testing and whether there is imminent need to do so. The <lb/>respondent no.1 before us is interested only in dissolution of his <lb/>marriage by decree of divorce. For this purpose, he has on two <lb/>prior occasions filed the petitions for dissolution of marriage by a <lb/>decree of divorce by mutual consent (HMA No. 1099/2014 at Saket <lb/>Courts &amp; HMA No. 783/2014 at Patiala House Courts). <lb/>180. It is to be noted that even the joint statement of the parties <lb/>stood recorded by the Family Court, Saket on 1 st of October, 2014 <lb/>in HMA No. 1099/2014. If it was not for want of territorial <lb/>jurisdiction, these proceedings would have been completed. <lb/>181. In the divorce proceedings before the Family Court, the <lb/>appellant has also filed a counter claim seeking dissolution of <lb/>marriage of the parties by decree of divorce on grounds of cruelty, <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 94 of 95 <lb/></page>

			<body>inter alia on the ground that the pleadings of the respondent no.1 in <lb/>his divorce petition apart from other assertions work cruelty upon <lb/>her. <lb/>So far as the substantive relief which the respondent no.1 <lb/>seeks, there is no imminent need for the directions of a DNA test. <lb/>182. In view of the above, it has to be held that there is no <lb/>imminent need for the DNA test for grant of the substantive relief <lb/>as prayed for by the respondent no.1. <lb/>XV. Conclusion <lb/>183. &apos;H&apos; -respondent no.1 husband has not pleaded &quot;non-access&quot; <lb/>to the appellant wife or &quot;no opportunity&quot; at the time when Baby <lb/>&apos;X&apos; could have been conceived. On the contrary, he has admitted <lb/>&quot;access&quot;. &apos;W&apos; -the appellant wife has effectively denied the pleas <lb/>of adultery. <lb/>184. &apos;H&apos; has failed to make out a prima facie case justifying an <lb/>order for compelling Baby &apos;X&apos; to give a sample for a DNA <lb/>examination. The repeated admissions of paternity by &apos;H&apos; in his <lb/>pleadings, affidavit and his statement on oath in support on judicial <lb/>record militate against a prima facie case in favour of &apos;H&apos; for <lb/>making the order prayed for. The husband &apos;H&apos; has made <lb/>admissions of paternity in public records of the Registrar of Births <lb/>as well as bank record. No explanation was tendered before the ld. <lb/>Family Court Judge or before us. The respondent no.1 has <lb/>concealed material facts; is guilty of mis-statement before the <lb/>Family Court and his conduct post-conception of the child do not <lb/></body>

			<body>support a prima facie case in his favour justifying the impugned <lb/>order. The respondent no.1 has also not established imminent need <lb/>for the order or that such order was at all necessary for a just <lb/>decision of the case. The impugned order is unreasoned, contrary <lb/>to law and unsustainable. <lb/>XVI. Result <lb/>185. As a result, the order dated 28 th January, 2016 is hereby set <lb/>aside and quashed. The appeal is allowed. <lb/>186. We make it clear that nothing herein contained is a final <lb/>expression of opinion on the merits of the controversy. We have <lb/>only taken a prima facie view. The ld. Family Court Judge shall <lb/>proceed in the matter in accordance with law, uninfluenced by any <lb/>observation contained herein. <lb/>187. In view of the order passed in the main appeal, CM <lb/>No.5064/2016 does not survive for adjudication and is hereby <lb/>dismissed. <lb/>Lower Court Record be sent back forthwith. <lb/>GITA MITTAL, J <lb/>I.S.MEHTA, J <lb/>AUGUST 26, 2016 <lb/>aj </body>
