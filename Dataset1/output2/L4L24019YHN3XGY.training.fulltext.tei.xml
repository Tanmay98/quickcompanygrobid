			<p>6.<lb/> The affidavit of Sh.Harvinder Singh dated 8.9.1985 submitted<lb/> before the Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission of Inquiry, as<lb/> already adverted to herein above, forms the basis of the registration of<lb/> both the FIRs in relation to the occurrences stated to have taken place<lb/> on 1.11.1984 in the area of Police Station Janakpuri and in relation to<lb/> the occurrences on 2.11.1984 in the area of Police Station Vikaspuri.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> As regards the incident of 1.11.1984, it has been stated in the<lb/> affidavit dated 8.9.1985 of the complainant, Sh. Harvinder Singh, to<lb/> the effect:<lb/> &quot;Too much smoke was seen from the<lb/> neighbouring colonies at about 11.00 morning of<lb/> 1.11.84. That smoke started coming nearer<lb/> slowly. Meanwhile, a crowd consisting of 200/250<lb/> people at once reached in front of the Gurdwara<lb/> of our colony and set the Gurdwara on fire and<lb/> started looting the things kept in the Gurdwara.<lb/> The people of the mob came by a D.T.C. bus<lb/> boarded on the same bus after looting and<lb/> burning. One white car and the other red driven<lb/> by some leader-brand people were leading the<lb/> mob. The residents of the colony came out when<lb/> mob had gone ahead and started extinguishing the<lb/> fire of the Gurdwara. The mob again came back<lb/> when they were still standing and thinking what to<lb/> do next. They attacked the Sikhs with bricks,<lb/> stones and rods as a result of which we sustained<lb/> injuries. Then they burnt our house.<lb/> On reaching home, I found my father who<lb/> sustained a deep rod injury. He was lying<lb/> unconscious. Whole of his body was blood<lb/> stained. A mob of about 200/250 culprits attacked<lb/> the house of Sardar Nath Singh, the president of<lb/> our colony in the street of our back side, when I<lb/> was still helping my father. They started beating<lb/> the members of his family and set the truck on<lb/> fire, parked outside. I and the members of my<lb/> family were witnessing all the incident peeping<lb/> through the holes of rear door of our house. They<lb/> threw 15/16 years old son of Sh. Nath Singh, alive<lb/> into the burning truck but the residents of the<lb/> colony saved him later on. We were so scared<lb/> that we ran away leaving the doors of the house<lb/> open. My jeejaji (husband of the sister) and my<lb/> father went to the house of one old lady who<lb/> locked the house from the outside. Then we came<lb/> to know that some Hindu brother had got my<lb/> injured mother admitted in to the Rana Nursing<lb/> Home, Rajouri Garden. The noises of burning<lb/> were heard by us while sitting inside the closed<lb/> room. The condition of the father was going to be<lb/> much more poor. All the three of us were hungry<lb/> and helpless in the closed room. We passed the<lb/> night there.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> As regards the incident of 2.11.1984, it was stated in the said<lb/> affidavit:<lb/> &quot;The old mother opened the door at 5.00 morning<lb/> of the 2 nd date and borrowed two cycles from<lb/> somewhere. I started on one cycle with my father<lb/> and the other was driven by my brother-in-law<lb/> and a Hindu boy. We reached Uttam Nagar when<lb/> it struck 7.00 O&apos; clock. A crowd of about<lb/> 200/250 persons surrounded us there in front of<lb/> the office of the cong.(I) Party and started beating<lb/> us with rods. We fell down with the injuries. They<lb/> gave rod blows at my head, legs and hands. The<lb/> blood coming from my head. Meanwhile a noise<lb/> of shouting came, they should be burnt alive with<lb/> Kerosene oil. I started running on hearing it.<lb/> They were going to give me rod blows at the back<lb/> side. I reached near the police post, Uttam Nagar<lb/> running fast. I requested the police with folded<lb/> hands to save my brother-in-law and my father<lb/> who were being beaten by the mob in the opening<lb/> on the road. But they started abusing me and did<lb/> not listen to me, on the other hand, they said &quot;<lb/> you Sikhs deserve such behavior&quot;. The S.P.Said &quot;<lb/> What can we do?&quot; The dead bodies of the Hindus,<lb/> filled in the roads are too coming from Punjab.&quot;<lb/> Blood was coming from my head, hands were not<lb/> in working order. I begged the police for help but<lb/> they refused to help me. I prayed to allow me to<lb/> phone. I phoned the owners of my factory. They<lb/> were also Sardars. I remained lying till 3.00 O&apos;<lb/> Clock at noon. The police refused to provide me<lb/> medical aid in spite of my repeated requests. They<lb/> said, &quot;It will make no difference if you die when<lb/> thousands of Sikhs are dying. The S.P. Uttam<lb/> Nagar, came to the police post at about 3.15<lb/> noon. I requested him to send me to the hospital.<lb/> That S.P. brought some injured mothers and<lb/> children to the police post from the Najafgarh<lb/> side. About 40/50 sardars had reached there till<lb/> 5.00 in the evening. He sent me and two or three<lb/> more injured to Din Dayal Hospital, Hari Nagar.<lb/> My head was stitched and I was again sent to the<lb/> police post, Uttam Nagar, after a short while. My<lb/> masters came to bring me at 8.00 at night. They<lb/> left me and some other Sikhs to the Gurdwara of<lb/> Hari Nagar. Charanjit Singh, a friend mine, took<lb/> me to his house at Hari Nagar, where I was got<lb/> treated medically from a private doctor.<lb/> 2. I saw two or three constables who came to the<lb/> police post with the goods looted from the<lb/> neighbouring shops when I was praying for water<lb/> in the injured condition, in the Police post, Uttam<lb/> Nagar. They had soap cakes, tooth paste and<lb/> honey bottles in their hands. The policemen were<lb/> enjoying and watching sitting carefree when the<lb/> shops of the Sikhs were being looted opposite to<lb/> them. My brother-in-law and my father lost their<lb/> lives during this incident. My sister who had only<lb/> twenty seven days old son at that time, became<lb/> widow. I have been disabled due to the injuries at<lb/> the hands.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>9.<lb/> The letter dated 7.2.1992 of the Secretary of the Delhi<lb/> Administration Committee to examine the cases relating to the riots in<lb/> Delhi during October and November, 1984 addressed to the<lb/> Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi, Raj Niwas, Delhi, puts forth<lb/> the incident of 1.11.1984 and 2.11.1984 as follows:<lb/> &quot;2. The deponent has alleged inter-alia that on 1 st<lb/> November, 1984 a large mob came to their colony<lb/> in a D.T.C. bus and set the Gurdwara on fire and<lb/> looted the same. Sometime after, the mob attacked<lb/> the houses of Sikhs with brick bats, stones and<lb/> iron rods, as a result of which his father also<lb/> sustained a deep injury. The mob also attacked<lb/> the house of S.Nath Singh, the President of their<lb/> colony and the deponent saw that his (Nath Singh)<lb/> house-hold goods were looted and the son of Nath<lb/> Singh was thrown in a burning truck which was<lb/> set on fire by the mob. The boy was however<lb/> saved by the residents of the colony. Feeling<lb/> scared and apprehensive, he along with his father<lb/> and his sister&apos;s husband, went to the house of a<lb/> Hindu and spent the night there. He learnt that<lb/> his injured mother was got admitted in the Rana<lb/> Nursing Home, Rajouri Garden.<lb/> 3. The deponent has further alleged that on 2 nd<lb/> November, 1984 he along with his father and<lb/> brother-in-law proceeded towards Uttam Nagar<lb/> on borrowed cycles. At Uttam Nagar a mob of<lb/> 200-250 persons surrounded them and started<lb/> beating them with rods, as a result he sustained<lb/> injuries on his head, legs and hands. He reached<lb/> police post Uttam Nagar and requested for<lb/> protection but in vain. At about 3.15 p.m. when<lb/> S.P.came to the police post with some other<lb/> injured women and children, he was sent for<lb/> medical aid to Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital,<lb/> Hari Nagar along with others. His brother-in-law<lb/> and his father were killed in the incident and he<lb/> himself was disabled on account of injuries<lb/> sustained by him.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>10. It is further stated in the said letter dated 7.2.1992 that Sh.<lb/> Harvinder Singh had been examined by the Committee who had<lb/> confirmed his affidavit and gave the name of his brother-in-law as<lb/> being Avtar Singh, s/o Raghubir Singh R/o B-I/96, Janakpuri, and that<lb/> the scrutiny of the police records revealed that the incidents narrated<lb/> by them had neither been investigated nor linked in any of the case<lb/> registered at Police Station Najafgarh vide FIRs No. 256/84, 257/84<lb/> and 258/84 relating to the October-November, 1984 riots. In view of<lb/> the injuries as a very serious nature of the crime was revealed in the<lb/> affidavit, the Committee recommended that fresh cases be registered<lb/> regarding the incidents narrated by the deponents with it having been<lb/> observed to the effect that two cases had to be registered one under<lb/> Sections 147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436 of the Indian Penal<lb/> Code, 1860 qua the incident of 1.11.1984 and the other in regard to an<lb/> incident date 2.11.1984 under Sections 147/148/149/302 &amp; 307 of the<lb/> Indian Penal Code, 1860 to be investigated by an independent agency<lb/> other than the local police.<lb/> SUBMISSIONS OF THE PETITIONERS<lb/> 11. Through the petitions it has been submitted that on the scrutiny<lb/> by the SIT which took up the present case along with few other<lb/> cases/FIRs for further investigation of the case records of the previous<lb/> FIR/ complaint made at that relevant time which had been closed and<lb/> it found that the complainant due to fear could not disclose the name<lb/> of the respondent as an accused as the respondent was then very<lb/> influential with a lot of influence in the then Government and that the<lb/> complainant also could not depose fearlessly against the respondent. It<lb/> is further submitted through the petitions that it had also been found<lb/> that at the relevant time when the case was under investigation,<lb/> important and relevant evidences through available had not been<lb/> collected and enquired upon by the then Investigating Team due to the<lb/> reasons best known to them and thus the closure report had been filed.<lb/></p>

			<p>12. The State has further submitted that pursuant to the<lb/> recommendations of the Justice G.P. Mathur Committee on the SIT<lb/> having been constituted with the specific mandate to investigate/re-<lb/>investigate the criminal cases which were filed in the National Capital<lb/> Territory of Delhi in connection with the 1984 anti sikh riots and to<lb/> examine the record afresh, intimation regarding further investigation<lb/> of the case was given to the Court and further investigation was taken<lb/> up and during the course of investigation by the SIT, the complainant,<lb/> Harvinder Singh, was examined afresh and some fresh witnesses were<lb/> also examined under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,<lb/> 1973 for the very first time who corroborated the contents of the FIR<lb/> and the affidavit of the complainant, and that they had never been<lb/> examined by any other agency previously.<lb/></p>

			<p>13. It was further stated through the petitions that it had been<lb/> categorically stated by the complainant and the fresh witnesses that the<lb/> respondent, the then Member of Parliament from the outer Delhi<lb/> constituency had formed an unlawful assembly armed with deadly<lb/> weapons for the purpose of committing criminal acts including rioting,<lb/> arson, murder, causing disharmony and hatred between the different<lb/> religious groups and destruction of properties belonging to the Sikh<lb/> Community during the 1984 riots.<lb/></p>

			<p>14. It was further submitted by the State that despite the Justices<lb/> Jain &amp; Aggarwal Committee having recommended that the<lb/> investigation be conducted by an independent agency other than the<lb/> local police, the investigation of FIR No.227/92 Police Station<lb/> Janakpuri for the incident of 1.11.1984 and of the FIR 264/92, Police<lb/> Station Vikaspuri for the incident of 2.11.1984, the investigation of<lb/> these cases was not handed over to any independent agency as<lb/> recommended and the closure report was filed by the Delhi Police<lb/> through its Riots Cell. The State further submitted that the delay in<lb/> registration of the FIR and non-assigning of the investigation of the<lb/> cases to an independent agency clearly suggests the influence of the<lb/> respondent herein even at that time. It has been submitted through the<lb/> petitions that in the affidavit before the Justice Ranganath Mishra<lb/> Commission of Inquiry, the complainant, i.e., Sh.Harvinder Singh,<lb/> mentioned that some leaders were leading the mob who came in a<lb/> white car but the name of the leader was not disclosed due to<lb/> fear/influence of the respondent herein but in the further investigation<lb/> conducted by the SIT, the complainant had disclosed clearly that the<lb/> leader who came in the white Car was the then Congress-I Member of<lb/> Parliament, Sajjan Kumar, i.e., the respondent herein herein and he<lb/> further deposed that after the assassination of Smt.Indira Gandhi on<lb/> 1.11.1984 during the day time a violent mob led by the respondent<lb/> herein came towards the Gurudwara near Gulab Bagh and that the<lb/> witnesses could clearly identify the respondent amongst the mob<lb/> whom they know very well and the respondent pointed out towards<lb/> the Gurudwara near Gulab Bagh and then the violent mob rushed<lb/> towards the Gurudwara Saheb and started looting and burning the<lb/> property of the Gurudwara and also set the Gurudwara on fire. It was<lb/> also stated by Sh. Harvinder Singh in his affidavit that the rioters led<lb/> by the respondent herein attacked the Sikhs in order to kill them in<lb/> which the complainant, his father Sohan Singh S/o Amar Singh and<lb/> the mother Smt. Jaspal Kaur sustained serious injuries and that the<lb/> violent mob also attacked the houses and shops of the Sikh community<lb/> including the house of one Sardar Nath Singh who was the Pradhan of<lb/> the Gurdwara as well as the Gulab Bagh Colony and the respondent<lb/> also set their truck on fire. It has been further submitted through the<lb/> petition that Gurcharan Singh son of Sardar Nath Singh was thrown in<lb/> the burning truck who was saved by the neighbours. It was further<lb/> submitted through the petitions that on 2.11.1984 the complainant<lb/> along with his injured father and brother-in-law proceeded towards the<lb/> hospital, after remaining in hiding overnight on two bicycles for the<lb/> treatment of his injured father and reached at the main road Uttam<lb/> Nagar Bus Terminal, when about 20/25 persons came from the nearby<lb/> Congress-I office and after the crowd further swelled, they were<lb/> attacked. It was further averred through the petition that the<lb/> complainant&quot;s father Shri Sohan Singh and brother-in-law Sh.Avtar<lb/> Singh were also killed by the mob and set on fire but the complainant<lb/> managed to escape and reached the Police Post Uttam Nagar.<lb/></p>

No specific name of the leaders of the mob,<lb/> who came in the white and the red cars on 1.11.1984, have been<lb/> mentioned in the affidavit dated 8.9.1985 of the complainant. In the<lb/> incident of 2.11.1984 as mentioned in the affidavit dated 8.9.1985 of<lb/> the complainant there is no reference to any person by a specific name<lb/> as being the assaulter or the instigator of assault on him, i.e., the<lb/> complainant. Through the petition it has been submitted that during<lb/> the investigation conducted by the SIT, the complainant and other<lb/> witnesses had disclosed that the leader who came in the white car was<lb/> the then Member of Parliament, Sajjan Kumar, i.e., the applicant,<lb/> whom the witnesses could clearly identify amongst the mob as they<lb/> knew him very well and that the respondent had directed the mob by<lb/> pointing towards the Gurudwara Saheb whereafter the mob started<lb/> looting, burning and damaging the property of the Gurudwara Saheb<lb/> and that the so led mob also set the Gurudwara Saheb on fire and the<lb/> rioters also led by the respondent had attacked the Sikhs in order to<lb/> kill them and that the violent mob /rioters under the leadership of the<lb/> respondent herein, also attacked the house of Sardar Nath Singh the<lb/> Pradhan of the Gurudwara as well as the president of the Gulab Bagh<lb/> Colony.<lb/> STATEMENT UNDER SECTION 164 OF THE CODE OF<lb/> CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, 1973<lb/> 16.

As per this statement of the complainant,<lb/> Harvinder Singh, he went to the house of Tilak Raj, who resides in<lb/> front of his house and requested him to help them as his father&quot;s<lb/> condition was very bad and Tilak Raj got two bicycles arranged and<lb/> also sent a Hindu boy with them and that he made his brother-in-law<lb/> sit on one of the cycles and his brother-in-law tied his father to him i.e.<lb/> the complainant with a Pagdi inasmuch as the complainant&quot;s father<lb/> was very seriously injured and the complainant thus sat with his<lb/> father. He further stated that on the other cycle his brother-in-law and<lb/> the Hindu boy took his father to Uttam Nagar which was at a distance<lb/> of 4 to 5 km from their house but as they were crossing by the<lb/> Congress-I office at Uttam Nagar then the rioters surrounded there and<lb/> started beating them with Sarias. The complainant further stated that<lb/> his brother-in-law Avtar Singh, who was coming on the other cycle<lb/> was also surrounded by the rioters and the rioters were assaulting all<lb/> three of them and that in the meantime a sound came from the truck<lb/> &quot;Aag lagakar maar do, i.e., set on fire and kill&quot; and on hearing this he,<lb/> i.e., the complainant started running blindly and the rioters were<lb/> running behind him and he ran towards the Police Post, Uttam Nagar<lb/> and requested the police personnel that his father and his brother-in-<lb/>law were being assaulted by the rioters on the road but the police did<lb/> not help him and that he continued to cry that his father and brother-<lb/>in-law be saved, but the police personnel started abusing him, saying<lb/> that these Sikhs had killed Indira Gandhi and thus they should be dealt<lb/> with as they were being dealt. He further stated that he was bleeding<lb/> profusely as he had been assaulted with the Sarias on his head and that<lb/> four of his bones of his two arms had also got broken and that his eyes<lb/> had also been seriously injured because of the fist blows given to him<lb/> and that he had asked them that he be provided medical aid but he<lb/> was not provided any medical assistance and rather the police<lb/> personnel were spreading rumors that corpses of Hindus were coming<lb/> in trains from Punjab and after sometime they spread another rumor<lb/> that the Sikhs had put poison into the water tank.<lb/></p>

			<p>19. In his statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973, the complainant Harvinder Singh, also stated that at<lb/> about 2 to 3 p.m. a senior officer whose name he learnt from his<lb/> badge, as V.K. Katna came to the police post and the complainant<lb/> requested him for medical assistance and in the meantime the Officer<lb/> received a wireless message and thus went in his jeep from the spot<lb/> and returned after two hours with a police bus containing 40/50<lb/> injured Sikh men, ladies and children and then put the complainant<lb/> and four other persons into the jeep and took them to the D.D.U<lb/> Hospital Hari Nagar, where due to the lack of doctors, nurses and<lb/> other staff without any anesthesia he was given 14/15 stitches on his<lb/> head and was also treated for his eyes but there was no treatment<lb/> given that day for his broken bones. As per this statement under<lb/> Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 of the<lb/> complainant, the complainant requested the police in the hospital to<lb/> leave him at his friend&quot;s house at Hari Nagar but the police left him<lb/> and the two other injured persons at the Uttam Nagar, Police Post and<lb/> from 7 a.m. till 5 p.m., he remained at the Police Post, Uttam Nagar<lb/> and that he could see from the Police Post that shops near the road<lb/> were being looted and burnt and that the police was sitting as a silent<lb/> spectator and that he also saw some police personnel were taking out<lb/> the looted articles from the shop and brought them to the Police Post.<lb/> As per the statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973 the entire day he continued to remain hungry and<lb/> thirsty and injured at the Police post and despite his repeated requests<lb/> he was given one glass of water and on inquiries at the Police Post, he<lb/> learnt that his father and brother-in-law had been burnt alive and they<lb/> were also not handed over the dead bodies of his father and brother-in-<lb/>law. It was learnt by him subsequently that the police had burnt<lb/> several dead bodies together.<lb/> 20. As per this statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973 at about 9 p.m. the complainant and other persons at<lb/> the Police Post were taken by the complainant&quot;s friend Charanjit Singh<lb/> and his employer Sharan Singh were taken to the Fateh Nagar<lb/> Gurudwara Saheb and on the next day he was treated for his broken<lb/> bones and other injuries. Through the statement under Section 164 of<lb/> the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the complainant stated that he<lb/> would make an appeal to the Court that Sajjan Kumar (the respondent<lb/> herein) and other persons who brought the crowd had killed his father<lb/> Sohan Singh and brother-in-law Avtar Singh and had injured his<lb/> mother and he thus sought action against them and stated that the<lb/> massacre had taken place at the instigation of Sajjan Kumar i.e. the<lb/> respondent herein. He also requested through the statement under<lb/> Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 that a day-to-day<lb/> trial be given in the instant case inasmuch as 32 years had already<lb/> elapsed and he sought that he got justice during his lifetime and sought<lb/> the incarceration of the killers.<lb/> 21. As per the certificate issued by the learned SDJM, District<lb/> Mohali, Punjab, the said statement under Section 164 of the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure, 1973 was as per her belief made voluntarily by<lb/> the complainant Sh. Harvinder Singh in her presence and was read<lb/> over to the complainant Sh.

It has thus been submitted by the State through the SIT that in<lb/> view of the statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973 of the complainant Harvinder Singh and the<lb/> statements of other witnesses under Section 161 of the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure, 1973, the witnesses during investigation had<lb/> clearly identified the respondent herein and the interrogation of the<lb/> respondent herein was required and a notice dated 19.11.2016 was<lb/> issued to the respondent to put in appearance before the Investigating<lb/> Officer of the case on 22.11.2016 at 3 p.m. on which date the<lb/> respondent herein did come with a fleet of advocates to the office of<lb/> the SIT but did not answer any question of the Investigating Officer<lb/> and rather tried to dictate the terms of the investigation and in a tone<lb/> of instruction asked the Investigating Officer of the SIT to give a<lb/> written questionnaire and stated that he would not participate in the<lb/> investigation unless a written questionnaire is given to him and stated<lb/> that he would only give a written reply to the already prepared<lb/> questionnaire. It was further submitted by the State that after all these<lb/> tantrums, the respondent herein left with his advocates and the<lb/> Investigating Officer failed to proceed with his investigation.<lb/> 36. It was further submitted by the SIT that on the next date of<lb/> appearance i.e. on 14.12.2016 in relation which the notice dated<lb/> 5.12.2016 was issued to the respondent, he did not appear on the<lb/> ground of ill health and he was called thus to put in appearance on<lb/> 21.12.2016. It was thus submitted on behalf of the SIT that though the<lb/> respondent has pretended to join the investigation with his fleet of<lb/> advocates, he has in fact not joined the investigation inasmuch as he<lb/> did not cooperate in the same.<lb/> 37. It was further contended on behalf of the petitioner that even<lb/> after the order dated 21.12.2016 of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka<lb/> Courts, on the anticipatory bail applications filed by the applicant, the<lb/> notice dated 2.1.2017 was issued to the accused to join the<lb/> investigation on 4.1.2017 in connection with the FIR No.227/1992,<lb/> Police Station Janakpuri but even then during interrogation, the<lb/> attitude of the respondent was non-cooperative and he did not reply to<lb/> any question asked in connection of the case.<lb/> 38. Further submissions have been made on behalf of the petitioner<lb/> submitting inter alia to the effect:<lb/>  that there was no reason for the respondent/the<lb/> accused to believe that he might be arrested;<lb/>  that the matter was at the stage of investigation<lb/> in relation to a very serious crime and anticipatory<lb/> bail ought not to have been granted by the learned<lb/> ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts;<lb/>  that there is all the reason to believe that the<lb/> accused might or has the capability to influence<lb/> the witness and tamper with the evidences and<lb/> thus invocation of Section 438 of the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure, 1973 would hamper the<lb/> overall investigation;<lb/>  that anticipatory bail is a grant of an<lb/> extraordinary privilege which can be granted only<lb/> in exceptional cases and that the applicant has<lb/> failed to give any exceptional ground for grant of<lb/> anticipatory bail;<lb/>  that it was mandatory on the part of the learned<lb/> ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts to ensure compliance of<lb/> pre-requisite conditions for grant of anticipatory<lb/> bail including the nature and gravity of the<lb/> accusation;<lb/>  that the Court ought to have recorded reasons<lb/> for grant of anticipatory bail which could have<lb/> been granted if the Court was of the prima facie<lb/> view that the applicant had been falsely enroped<lb/> in the case and would not misuse his liberty;<lb/>  that the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts has<lb/> erroneously held the arrest of the applicant for the<lb/> purpose of interrogation after 32 years of the<lb/> incident was not required inasmuch as there was<lb/> nothing to be recovered at the instance of the<lb/> applicant;<lb/>  that the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts had<lb/> failed to appreciate that the complainant had given<lb/> his affidavit dated 8.9.l985 before Justice<lb/> Ranganath Mishra Commission of Inquiry as the<lb/> FIR was registered only after more than seven<lb/> years<lb/> and<lb/> that<lb/> investigation<lb/> despite<lb/> recommendation of the Jain &amp; Agrawal<lb/> Committee had not been handed over to an<lb/> independent agency which itself suggests the<lb/> influence of the respondent and the lackadaisical<lb/> approach of the then investigation agency;<lb/>  it was an admitted fact that the complainant<lb/> and other eye-witnesses who had shifted from<lb/> Delhi to Punjab after riots were apprehensive<lb/> about their life and safety and were not willing to<lb/> visit Delhi due to fear of the respondent and;<lb/>  that it was only after constitution of SIT as an<lb/> independent entity to investigate the 1984 riots<lb/> cases that the complainant and other witnesses<lb/> reposed their faith in the system and gave their<lb/> statement and identified the respondent.<lb/> 39. It has thus been submitted on behalf of the SIT that the<lb/> respondent is a very influential person with muscle and money power<lb/> and it is not possible to proceed with the investigation without keeping<lb/> him in custody and that the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts had failed<lb/> to appreciate that the incident in question had such a serious effect that<lb/> the witnesses had to flee from Delhi and had given their statements<lb/> only after the SIT was constituted.<lb/> 40. It has also been submitted on behalf of the applicant that<lb/> pursuant to investigation being made by the SIT, the respondent is<lb/> required to be confronted with the eye-witnesses, facts and the crime<lb/> spot and in view of the non-cooperative behavior of the respondent, it<lb/> would not be possible for the SIT to proceed smoothly with the<lb/> investigation and the constitution of the SIT would become futile.<lb/> 41. It has also been submitted on behalf of the State that the<lb/> anticipatory bail granted to the applicant has been in derogation of the<lb/> established principles of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.<lb/> 42. Inter alia, apart from seeking that the impugned order dated<lb/> 21.12.2016 of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts in Bail Appln. No.<lb/> 14073/16 in FIR No.264/1992 under Sections 147/148/149/302/207 of<lb/> the Indian Penal Code, 1860, Police Station Vikas Puri and in Bail<lb/> Appln. No. 14072/2016 in FIR No.227/1992, under Sections<lb/> 147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436 of the Indian Penal Code,<lb/> 1860, Police Station Janakpuri be set aside, the applicant through the<lb/> said petition has also sought an expungment of observations made in<lb/> paragraphs No.24 and 26 of the impugned orders dated 21.12.2016.<lb/> IMPUGNED ORDER DATED 21.12.2016<lb/> 43. It is essential to advert to the impugned order dated 21.12.2016<lb/> of the learned ASJ-01 Dwarka qua the Bail Appln. No. 14073/16 and<lb/> Bail Appln. No. 14072/2016 in relation to the FIR Nos. 264/1992<lb/> Police Station Vikas Puri and 227/1992 Police Station Janakpuri<lb/> respectively, vide which it was observed similarly in each to the<lb/> effect:<lb/> FIR No.264/1992 registered at Police Station<lb/> Janakpuri Vikaspuri and FIR No.227/1992<lb/> registered at Police Station Janakpuri.<lb/> &quot;16.<lb/> I have considered the rival submissions<lb/> and have carefully perused the police file and<lb/> reply of the Investigating Officer.<lb/></p>

			<p>17.<lb/> It is an admitted fact between the parties<lb/> that the present FIR was registered in the year<lb/> 1992 on the basis of affidavit dated 09.09.1985 of<lb/> complainant Sh.Harvinder Singh sworn before<lb/> Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission. It is also<lb/> an admitted fact that alleged offence pertains to<lb/> incident dated 01.11.1984 and 02.11.1984. It is<lb/> also an admitted fact that neither complainant<lb/> Sh.Harvinder Singh nor any of the witnesses<lb/> examined by the Special Riot Cell had found any<lb/> evidence to connect the applicant with the offence<lb/> in question. It is also an admitted fact that earlier<lb/> investigation was closed as untraced and the<lb/> closure report was accepted by the Ld.MM on<lb/> 27.08.1994/16.02.1996. It is also an admitted fact<lb/> that from 1994 till examination of witnesses<lb/> including the complainant in the year 2016,<lb/> nothing incriminating had come against the<lb/> applicant.<lb/></p>

			<p>18.<lb/> The deposition made by complainant<lb/> Sh.Harvinder Singh under Section 164 Cr.P.C.<lb/> statement against applicant has been made for the<lb/> first time after 32 years of the incident and in the<lb/> previous affidavit dated 09.09.1985, no such<lb/> allegations were made.<lb/></p>

			<p>19.<lb/> Similarly, some of the witnesses (names<lb/> of witnesses withheld at the &quot;request of<lb/> Ld.Addl.PP for SIT) examined in 2016 under<lb/> Section 161 Cr.P.C. were also examined during<lb/> the course of investigation in the year 1992 and at<lb/> that time, they had not identified the applicant to<lb/> be the person, who had incited the mob to burn<lb/> down the property of the Sikhs or to murder them.<lb/> 20. Some of the witnesses (names of witnesses<lb/> withheld at the request of Ld.Addl.PP for SIT),<lb/> who have been examined under Section<lb/> 161Cr.P.C. happen to be the relatives of the<lb/> witnesses, who were examined in the previous<lb/> investigation and in the previous investigation,<lb/> their relatives had not stated anything<lb/> incriminating against the present applicant.<lb/> Therefore, from where these witnesses have<lb/> derived the information regarding the role of the<lb/> present applicant is also a matter of trial.<lb/> 21. Some of the witnesses (names of witnesses<lb/> withheld at the request of Ld.Addl.PP for SIT),<lb/> who have been examined under Section 161<lb/> Cr.P.C. in 2016 are witnesses of hear-say<lb/> evidence regarding the role of the present<lb/> applicant and their statements do not incriminate<lb/> the present applicant.<lb/> 22.<lb/> Although an explanation has been given<lb/> by the complainant in his statement under Section<lb/> 164 Cr.P.C. as to why he had not named the<lb/> applicant earlier but whether such explanation<lb/> can be believed or not, after 32 years, is a matter<lb/> of trial. However, some of the witnesses examined<lb/> in this case under Section 161 Cr.P.C in 2016,<lb/> have not provided any explanation as to why at<lb/> the time of their earlier examination in the year<lb/> 1992, they did not depose anything against the<lb/> present applicant. This delay of around 24 years<lb/> from the registration of the FIR do not make out<lb/> a case for custodial interrogation of the applicant<lb/> when admittedly at the time of first investigation,<lb/> nothing incriminating had come against the<lb/> present applicant. Nothing has come on record to<lb/> show that applicant, during this course of 24<lb/> years, had threatened or influenced any of the<lb/> witnesses so as to refrain any of them from<lb/> making statement against him. Further, applicant<lb/> is having deep roots in the society and thrice, he<lb/> remained as a member of the Parliament.<lb/> Therefore, chances of applicant fleeing from<lb/> justice are also quite remote.<lb/></p>

			<p>23.<lb/> In the opinion of this court, for the<lb/> purpose of interrogation of the applicant after 32<lb/> years of the incident, arrest of applicant is not<lb/> required as there are no allegations that anything<lb/> used in the commission of offence is to be<lb/> recovered at the instance of the applicant.<lb/> 24. The submission of the Id.counsel for the<lb/> applicant that the case has been re-opened for<lb/> political consideration just to falsely implicate the<lb/> applicant also cannot be ignored and makes out a<lb/> ground for anticipatory bail to the applicant.<lb/></p>

			<p>25.<lb/> The judgments relied upon by the<lb/> Id.counsel for the complainant as well as Ld.Chief<lb/> Public Prosecutor for State delivered in Sajjan<lb/> Kumar&apos;s case (supra) are not applicable to the<lb/> facts of the present case as same pertain to<lb/> framing of charge and none of these judgments<lb/> relied upon, pertain to grant or refusal of<lb/> anticipatory bail where after a delay of 32 years,<lb/> witnesses, who had not deposed anything against<lb/> applicant earlier have turned around to depose<lb/> otherwise.<lb/> 26. There can be no dispute with regard to ratio<lb/> laid down by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court of India<lb/> in the matter of Jai Prakash Singh&apos;s case (supra)<lb/> regarding the principles for grant of anticipatory<lb/> bail relied upon by the Ld.counsel for SIT. In the<lb/> present case also, exceptional circumstances have<lb/> been made out for grant of anticipatory bail as<lb/> there is prima facie material to show that the<lb/> applicant has been falsely enroped in the crime in<lb/> question after 32 years of the incident and his<lb/> chance of mis-using the liberty is also non-<lb/>existent.<lb/> 27. In the facts and circumstances, the<lb/> anticipatory bail application of the applicant is<lb/> allowed. In the event of arrest, lO/SHO concerned<lb/> is directed to release the applicant on bail on his<lb/> furnishing a personal bond in the sum of<lb/> Rs.1,00,000/-with one surety of the like amount<lb/> with the conditions that applicant shall join the<lb/> investigation as and when directed by the lO,<lb/> shall not threaten or influence any of the<lb/> witnesses and shall not leave the country without<lb/> prior permission of the concerned court.&quot;<lb/> ARGUMENTS OF STATE THROUGH SIT<lb/> 44. On behalf of the State, it has been submitted that though the<lb/> parameters of cancellation of regular bail apply also to cases of<lb/> cancellation of anticipatory bail, it was submitted on behalf of the<lb/> State by the then learned ASG Sh. Sanjay Jain that the present case<lb/> was not a normal case which could fall within the domain of a case in<lb/> which anticipatory bail granted could be withdrawn only on violation<lb/> of the conditions imposed by a Court. Inter alia, it was contended on<lb/> behalf of the SIT that this was a case of massacre/genocide in which<lb/> pursuant to the assassination of the then Prime Minister Smt.Indira<lb/> Gandhi the anti Sikh riots had taken place and that the complainant<lb/> alone could not have got the FIR registered.<lb/> 45. During the submissions that were made on behalf of the State<lb/> through the SIT (1984 riots) the learned ASG contended that there was<lb/> a fundamental flaw in the impugned orders of the learned ASJ-01,<lb/> Dwarka Courts, New Delhi granting anticipatory bail to the<lb/> respondent in Bail Appln. No. 14072/2015 and in Bail Appln. No.<lb/> 14073/2015 both dated 21.12.2016 of the learned Additional Sessions<lb/> Judge-01/Special Judge (P.C. Act) (CBI-03), Dwarka Courts in FIR<lb/> No.227/1992, under Sections 147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436<lb/> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, Police Station Janakpuri and FIR<lb/> No.264/1992, under Sections 147/148/149/302/307 of the Indian Penal<lb/> Code, 1860 Police Station Vikaspuri, inasmuchas the seriousness and<lb/> gravity of the offences had not been taken into account, that irrelevant<lb/> considerations had been taken into account and that the factum that the<lb/> complainant and other witnesses had pursuant to the further<lb/> investigation done by the SIT had categorically identified the<lb/> respondent herein as being the leader of the mob, who had got down<lb/> from the white car on 01.11.1984 and on his signaling towards the<lb/> Gurudwara, the mob had moved towards to the Gurudwara and had<lb/> proceeded towards the Gurudwara and had started plundering, looting<lb/> and damaging the same and had set it on fire which had been ignored<lb/> and it was thus submitted on behalf of the petitioner by the SIT that<lb/> the said statements could not have been ignored by the Trial Court at<lb/> the time of consideration of the applications filed by the respondent<lb/> herein seeking grant of anticipatory bail.<lb/> JUDICIAL VERDICTS LAW RELIED UPON BY THE STATE<lb/> 46. It was submitted on behalf of the petitioner placing reliance on<lb/> the verdict of the Hon&quot;ble Apex Court on Adri Dharan Das Vs. State<lb/> of West Bengal (2005) 4 Supreme Court Cases 303 to submit that the<lb/> applicant i.e. the respondent ought to have shown that he had reason to<lb/> believe that he may be arrested in a non-bailable offence and the same<lb/> was required to be founded on reasonable grounds and that, it could be<lb/> so founded only if there is something tangible to go by on the basis of<lb/> which it could be said that the applicant&quot;s apprehension that he may be<lb/> arrested was genuine and that mere fear is not belief for which reason<lb/> it was not enough for the applicant to show that he has some sort of<lb/> vague apprehension that someone is going to make an accusation<lb/> against him in pursuance of which he may be arrested and that the<lb/> grounds on which the belief of the applicant is based that he may be<lb/> arrested in a non-bailable offence must be capable of being examined.<lb/> 47. In the instant case the SIT has sought to submit that there are<lb/> grave allegations against the petitioner in the statements made by the<lb/> complainant and other witnesses whose names have been sought not to<lb/> be disclosed by the SIT for their safety and well being and the State<lb/> has sought the cancellation of grant of anticipatory bail granted vide<lb/> impugned order of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts submitting<lb/> inter alia to the effect that the custodial interrogation of the<lb/> respondent is required.<lb/> 48. Reliance was placed on behalf of the petitioner on the verdict of<lb/> the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court in Kiran Devi Vs. State of Rajasthan and<lb/> Another 1987 (Supp) Supreme Court Cases 549 in which it had been<lb/> laid down to the effect that in a murder case when the investigation<lb/> was incomplete the proper course to adopt was to leave it to the Trial<lb/> Court to do the needful if and when the person concerned was arrested<lb/> in the light of the record available at that point of time and that the<lb/> anticipatory bail ought not to have been granted in a murder case. It<lb/> was thus submitted on behalf of the SIT that as the investigation was<lb/> in progress there was all the reason to believe that the respondent<lb/> might or had the capability to influence witnesses and tamper with the<lb/> evidence and that the discretionary relief under Section 438 of the<lb/> Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 ought not to have been granted.<lb/> 49. Reliance was placed on behalf of the petitioner on the verdict of<lb/> the Hon&quot;ble Apex Court in the Raghuvir Saran Agarwal Vs. State of<lb/> UP and Others (1998) 8 Supreme Court Cases 617 in which in a<lb/> dowry death case anticipatory bail granted by the Court where the<lb/> investigation was still in progress without giving any reasons<lb/> whatsoever, was set aside.<lb/> 50. Placing reliance on the verdict of the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court in<lb/> Jai Prakash Singh Vs. State of Bihar and Another (2012) 4 Supreme<lb/> Court Cases 379 it was contended that the discretion under Section<lb/> 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 should be guided by law<lb/> duly governed by rule and cannot be arbitrary, fanciful or vague and<lb/> the Court must not yield to spasmodic sentiment nor to unregulated<lb/> benevolence and anticipatory bail cannot be granted without recording<lb/> any reason through parameters laid down in judicial pronouncement<lb/> without considering the nature and gravity of the offence specifically<lb/> where the assailants / the accused were named. Reliance was<lb/> specifically placed in para 19 of the said verdict to the effect that : -<lb/>&quot;Parameters for grant of anticipatory bail in a<lb/> serious offence are required to be satisfied and<lb/> further while granting such relief, the court<lb/> must record the reasons therefor. Anticipatory<lb/> bail can be granted only in exceptional<lb/> circumstances where the court is prima facie of<lb/> the view that the applicant has falsely been<lb/> enroped in the crime and would not misuse his<lb/> liberty. (See D.K. Ganesh Babu v. P.T.<lb/> Manokaran, State of Maharshtra v. Modh. Sajid<lb/> Husain Mohd. S. Hussain and Union of India v.<lb/> Padam Narain Aggarwal).&quot;<lb/> 51. The verdict of the Hon&quot;ble Apex Court in Japani Sahoo Vs.<lb/> Chandra Sekhar Mohanty (2007) 7 Supreme Court Cases 394 was<lb/> relied upon on behalf of the State to contend that the observations in<lb/> the impugned order to the effect that the statement under Section 164<lb/> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the statement under<lb/> Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 of the<lb/> complainant and other witnesses recorded in 2016, and to delay in the<lb/> recording of the statements of around 24 years from the registration of<lb/> the FIR did not make a case for custodial interrogation could not have<lb/> been the sole ground to throw away the prosecution version and that<lb/> mere delay in approaching the Court of law by itself is not sufficient<lb/> ground for dismissing the case though it may be a relevant<lb/> circumstance in reaching the final verdict.<lb/> 52. Specific reliance was placed in para 14 of this verdict to the<lb/> effect that : -<lb/>&quot;14. The exercise of judicial discretion in favour<lb/> of the respondents, who are ascribed leadership<lb/> roles, on irrelevant grounds of they having not<lb/> tampered with the evidence or being unlikely to<lb/> commit other offence was highly improper and<lb/> perverse and calls for interference, particularly<lb/> when the investigation is still underway and the<lb/> respondents still hold the status or position from<lb/> where they can influence the witnesses. The<lb/> relevant considerations for grant of anticipatory<lb/> bail, viz. gravity of the offence, status and<lb/> position of the accused persons, stage of<lb/> investigation, likelihood of evidence being<lb/> tampered, wider interest of justice and public at<lb/> large and prima facie case appearing against the<lb/> accused persons as also severity of punishment<lb/> to which they may be exposed, are disregarded in<lb/> the impugned orders making them even more<lb/> vulnerable. The distance in time from the date of<lb/> the alleged offences to the present stage of<lb/> investigation is unfortunate and attributable to<lb/> the failure of law enforcement agencies, but it<lb/> cannot derogate from the requirements of<lb/> bringing to book all the persons who might have<lb/> had a role in rudely disrupting the lives of<lb/> millions of citizens eking out their living in<lb/> harmony in a progressive state of secular<lb/> democratic republic of India, As observed by the<lb/> Supreme Court in its order dated 26.3.2008<lb/> (supra):<lb/> &quot;...Communal harmony is the hallmark of<lb/> democracy.... If in the name of religion people<lb/> are killed, that is absolutely a slur and blot on<lb/> the society governed by the rule of law....<lb/> Religious fanatics really do not belong to any<lb/> religion. They are no better than terrorists who<lb/> kill innocent people for no rhyme or reason....<lb/> And, when the State Government is pursuing the<lb/> proceedings for proper investigation by the SIT<lb/> constituted by the Supreme Court and consisting<lb/> of independent high-ranking and experienced<lb/> officers, the contention without any supporting<lb/> material that there is a conspiracy to frame the<lb/> respondents cannot be countenanced.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>53. A further submission was made on behalf of the SIT, placing<lb/> reliance on the verdict of the Hon&quot;ble High Court of Madras in case<lb/> titled as V.N. Sudhagaran Vs. Enforcement Officer 1997 CriLJ 2630<lb/> to contend that the petitioner therein had been issued summons to join<lb/> the investigation and all that was required was that he should appear<lb/> before the authority and join the investigation proceeding and to assist<lb/> the investigating agency in the matter for which he was summoned<lb/> and that it was not proper to grant anticipatory bail, which amounted<lb/> to imparting fetters on the powers conferred under the Act, as there<lb/> was no accusation and reasonable apprehension of being arrested for a<lb/> non-bailable offence. Reliance was thus placed on observations in para<lb/> 4 of the said verdict tot the effect : -<lb/>&quot;4. The exercise of power under section<lb/> 438 Cr.P.C. contemplates existence of two<lb/> conditions, namely, an existing accusation and<lb/> reasonable apprehension of arrest on the basis<lb/> of such accusation [see Thangapandi Nadar v.<lb/> State, 1982 Mad LJ (Cri) 250].<lb/> &quot;Reason to believe&quot; is much stronger than the<lb/> expression &quot;reason to suspect&quot; and not identical<lb/> with the expression &quot;Knowledge&quot;; Mere &quot;fear&quot;<lb/> is not &quot;belief&quot;. It must be capable of being<lb/> examined by the Court objectively, because, it is<lb/> then alone Court can examine whether applicant<lb/> has reason to believe that he may be arrested. In<lb/> order to successfully invoke the jurisdiction<lb/> under Section 438 Cr.P.C. the petitioner has to<lb/> make out a special case to secure an order of<lb/> anticipatory bail which is of an exceptional type.<lb/> He must prove that the charge levelled against<lb/> him is mala fide and, stems from ulterior motive<lb/> and it is for the petitioner to prima facie<lb/> substantiate his allegation that the charge of<lb/> serious non-bailable offence against him has<lb/> been levelled mala fide [see Mahanthagowda v.<lb/> State of Karnataka, 1978 Cri LJ 1045]. The<lb/> High Court of Kerala in Thayyanbadi Meethal<lb/> Kunhiraman v. Sub-Inspector of Police, Panoor<lb/> (1985 Mad LJ (Cri) 263) : (1985 Cri LJ 1111)<lb/> has held that a mere apprehension of arrest will<lb/> not suffice. That means apprehension must be<lb/> reasonable and based on existing facts.<lb/> Imaginary accusation or future possible<lb/> accusations will not be sufficient. On such<lb/> accusations which are yet to come there cannot<lb/> be any reasonable apprehension of an existing<lb/> threat of arrest. It is a condition, precedent for<lb/> an application under section 438 that there must<lb/> be an existing reasonable apprehension of arrest<lb/> on an existing accusation of having already<lb/> committed a non-bailable offence prior to the<lb/> point of time of filing the application. That<lb/> accusation will have to be specified in the<lb/> application and the direction to be sought for is<lb/> for the release in case of arrest in connection<lb/> with that accusation. In Sankaranarayanan v.<lb/> Sub-Inspector of Police, 1983 M.L.J. (Cri) 13<lb/> this court has held that where the accused<lb/> asserting that he may be arrested, State on the<lb/> other hand contending that so far no case has<lb/> been registered against the petitioner, the grant<lb/> of anticipatory bail on the basis of vague and<lb/> general allegation amounts to harming oneself<lb/> in perpetuity against a possible arrest.&quot;<lb/> Furthermore, it was submitted on behalf of the SIT, that the<lb/> learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts has erroneously held that the case has<lb/> been re-opened for political consideration which is just for false<lb/> implication of the applicant and that the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka<lb/> Courts had failed to appreciate that the SIT has been constituted by<lb/> Ministry of Home Affairs on the recommendation of the Hon&quot;ble<lb/> Justice G.P.Mathur Committee keeping in view all the earlier reports<lb/> of various commissions and committees pertaining to 1984 riots<lb/> formed under earlier governments also, only in order to give justice to<lb/> the victims of 1984 riots. It was reiterated on behalf of the petitioner<lb/> that the SIT is an independent agency having no influence of any kind<lb/> and that the SIT is committed to do a fair investigation on the cases,<lb/> and in furtherance thereof, is in the process of connecting the chain of<lb/> the events of the evidence collected by them and there was absolutely<lb/> no cogent material on record for the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts<lb/> to be persuaded by the accused to the effect that the case has allegedly<lb/> been re-opened due to the political considerations and thus the very<lb/> making of such an observation is an act of judicial impropriety.<lb/> 54. Reliance was placed on behalf of the petitioner on the verdict of<lb/> the case titled as State of Gujarat Vs. Mayaben Surendrabhai<lb/> Kodnani and Another (2010) CriLJ 1095 submitting to the effect that<lb/> Courts shall consider prima facie case the attitude and activities of<lb/> accused while granting anticipatory bail whilst adverting to<lb/> observations in para 11 of the said verdict to the effect :<lb/> &quot;11.<lb/> In the facts emerging from the record, it<lb/> was clear that the respondents were leaders and<lb/> had taken a leadership role in inciting the mob<lb/> which attacked absolutely innocent persons,<lb/> according to the submission. It was also<lb/> submitted that the respondents were, by virtue of<lb/> their position and influence, already kept away<lb/> from the investigating agency of the State and<lb/> hence the apprehension of their wielding<lb/> effective influence on the witnesses was real and<lb/> perfectly plausible. It was also pointed out that<lb/> no sooner their alibis were fully investigated and<lb/> their presence was satisfactorily established by<lb/> independent record of location of their mobile<lb/> phones at the relevant time, they had become<lb/> unavailable to the SIT and approached the<lb/> Court for anticipatory bail, rather than even<lb/> responding to the call of the SIT.&quot;<lb/> Specific reference was to paras 21 &amp; 22 of the said verdict to<lb/> the effect that :<lb/> &quot;21. Considering all the contentions and<lb/> averments made on both sides as also the<lb/> material appearing against the respondents, it is<lb/> clear and not in serious dispute that the<lb/> respondents were, at the relevant time,<lb/> prominent leaders of VHP which had called the<lb/> bandh, or of the party in power and they were<lb/> present at the scenes of offences for some time.<lb/> It is also in evidence that violent mobs had<lb/> gathered with weapons and the atmosphere was<lb/> surcharged with anger and hatred following<lb/> burning of a railway coach along with<lb/> passengers at Godhra on the previous day; and<lb/> 54 burnt bodies being brought to Ahmedabad on<lb/> 28.2.2002. The attitude and activities of the<lb/> respondents in that milieu is not even claimed to<lb/> be towards quelling or controlling the mobs nor<lb/> is it believable that they visited the scenes of<lb/> offences for any personal or private purpose. In<lb/> such circumstances, prima facie, the allegations<lb/> of inciting or encouraging the mobs into wanton<lb/> display of hatred, destruction of properties and<lb/> killing of innocent men, women and children<lb/> produce a chilling picture of communal violence<lb/> on an unprecedented scale, leaving on the<lb/> psyche of ordinary citizens scars which might<lb/> take decades to fade. Therefore, the offences<lb/> which are alleged to have been committed by<lb/> faceless mobs of thousands of persons led by few<lb/> have to be treated as very heinous and having far<lb/> reaching implications. As recently observed by<lb/> the Apex Court in State of Punjab v. Rakesh<lb/> Kumar [2008 (12) SCALE 95<lb/> &quot;...For instance, a murder committed due to<lb/> deep-seated mutual and personal rivalry may not<lb/> call for penalty of death. But an organized crime<lb/> or mass murders of innocent people would call<lb/> for imposition of death sentence as<lb/> deterrence....&quot; While such crimes are<lb/> investigated by one after the other agency and<lb/> matters have reached upto the highest court for<lb/> redressal of grievances about investigation, there<lb/> is no doubting that the belated investigation<lb/> must not be hampered by providing protective<lb/> umbrella to the persons who may be found to be<lb/> involved.<lb/> 22. The exercise of judicial discretion in favour<lb/> of the respondents, who are ascribed leadership<lb/> roles, on irrelevant grounds of they having not<lb/> tampered with the evidence or being unlikely to<lb/> commit other offence was highly improper and<lb/> perverse and calls for interference, particularly<lb/> when the investigation is still underway and the<lb/> respondents still hold the status or position from<lb/> where they can influence the witnesses. The<lb/> relevant considerations for grant of anticipatory<lb/> bail, viz. gravity of the offence, status and<lb/> position of the accused persons, stage of<lb/> investigation, likelihood of evidence being<lb/> tampered, wider interest of justice and public at<lb/> large and prima facie case appearing against the<lb/> accused persons as also severity of punishment<lb/> to which they may be exposed, are disregarded in<lb/> the impugned orders making them even more<lb/> vulnerable. The distance in time from the date of<lb/> the alleged offences to the present stage of<lb/> investigation is unfortunate and attributable to<lb/> the failure of law enforcement agencies, but it<lb/> cannot derogate from the requirements of<lb/> bringing to book all the persons who might have<lb/> had a role in rudely disrupting the lives of<lb/> millions of citizens eking out their living in<lb/> harmony in a progressive state of secular<lb/> democratic republic of India, As observed by the<lb/> Supreme Court in its order dated 26.3.2008<lb/> (supra): &quot;...Communal harmony is the hallmark<lb/> of democracy.... If in the name of religion people<lb/> are killed, that is absolutely a slur and blot on<lb/> the society governed by the rule of law....<lb/> Religious fanatics really do not belong to any<lb/> religion. They are no better than terrorists who<lb/> kill innocent people for no rhyme or reason....&quot;<lb/> And, when the State Government is pursuing the<lb/> proceedings for proper investigation by the SIT<lb/> constituted by the Supreme Court and consisting<lb/> of independent high-ranking and experienced<lb/> officers, the contention without any supporting<lb/> material that there is a conspiracy to frame the<lb/> respondents cannot be countenanced.&quot;<lb/> Reliance was further placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict<lb/> of the Hon&quot;ble Apex Court in the case titled as Pokar Ram Vs. State<lb/> of Rajasthan (1085) 2 SCC 597 to contend that the learned ASJ-01,<lb/> Dwarka Courts had exercised discretion against the established<lb/> principles of law under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973 and that exercise of the discretion under Section 438<lb/> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 has to be guided by law, duly<lb/> governed by rule of law and cannot be arbitrary and vague as has been<lb/> erroneously done. Specific reference was made to the observations in<lb/> para 11 of the said verdict to the effect:<lb/> &quot;The only question which we are called upon to<lb/> decide is whether : the learned Sessions Judge<lb/> was justified in granting anticipatory bail in the<lb/> facts and circumstances of this case?<lb/> Unquestionably, no case was made out for<lb/> granting anticipatory bail in this case. Let it be<lb/> made distinctly clear that status in life, affluence<lb/> or otherwise, are hardly relevant considerations<lb/> while examining the request for granting<lb/> anticipatory bail. Anticipatory bail to some<lb/> extent intrudes in the sphere of investigation of<lb/> crime and the court must be cautious and<lb/> circumspect in exercising such power of a<lb/> discretionary nature. This case amply illustrates<lb/> that the power was exercised sub silentio as to<lb/> reasons or on considerations irrelevant or not<lb/> germane to the determinations. This Court, to<lb/> avoid miscarriage of justice, must interfere.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>55. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the SIT in case titled as<lb/> Prakash Kadam v. Ramprasad Vishwanath Gupta, (2011) 6 SCC 189<lb/> to contend that it is not an absolute rule that considerations of<lb/> cancellation of bail are different from consideration of grant of bail<lb/> and that depends on the facts and circumstances. It has thus been<lb/> contended on behalf of the SIT that even if it be contended on behalf<lb/> of the respondent that he had not misused the grant of anticipatory bail<lb/> as granted by the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts, the same did not<lb/> amount to a consideration of the aspect as to whether the said bail<lb/> ought to have been granted or not, reliance was thus placed on behalf<lb/> of the SIT on the paras 17, 18, 19 &amp; 20 of the said verdict to the<lb/> effect: -<lb/>&quot;17.<lb/> It was contended by learned Counsel<lb/> for the Appellants before us, and it was also<lb/> contended before the High Court, that the<lb/> considerations for cancellation of bail are<lb/> different from the consideration of grant of bail<lb/> vide Bhagirathsingh s/o Mahipat Singh Judeja<lb/> v. State of Gujarat, Dolat Ram and Ors. v. State<lb/> of Haryana and Ramcharan v. State of M.P.<lb/> However, we are of the opinion that that is not<lb/> an absolute rule, and it will depend on the facts<lb/> and circumstances of the case.<lb/></p>

			<p>18.<lb/> In considering whether to cancel the<lb/> bail the Court has also to consider the gravity<lb/> and nature of the offence, prima facie case<lb/> against the accused, the position and standing of<lb/> the accused, etc. If there are very serious<lb/> allegations against the accused his bail may be<lb/> cancelled even if he has not misused the bail<lb/> granted to him. Moreover, the above principle<lb/> applies when the same Court which granted bail<lb/> is approached for canceling the bail. It will not<lb/> apply when the order granting bail is appealed<lb/> against before an appellate/revisional Court.<lb/> 19.<lb/> In our opinion, there is no absolute rule<lb/> that once bail is granted to the accused then it<lb/> can only be cancelled if there is likelihood of<lb/> misuse of the bail. That factor, though no doubt<lb/> important, is not the only factor. There are<lb/> several other factors also which may be seen<lb/> while deciding to cancel the bail.<lb/></p>

			<p>20.<lb/> This is a very serious case and cannot<lb/> be treated like an ordinary case. The accused<lb/> who are policemen are supposed to uphold the<lb/> law, but the allegation against them is that they<lb/> functioned as contract killers. Their version that<lb/> Ramnarayan Gupta was shot in a police<lb/> encounter has been found to be false during the<lb/> investigation. It is true that we are not deciding<lb/> the case finally as that will be done by the trial<lb/> court where the case is pending, but we can<lb/> certainly examine the material on record in<lb/> deciding whether there is a prima facie case<lb/> against the accused which disentitles them to<lb/> bail.&quot;<lb/> 56. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict of<lb/> the Hon&quot;ble Apex Court in case titled as &quot;Ash Mohammad vs Shiv<lb/> Raj Singh @ Lalla Babu &amp; Anr 2012 CriLJ 4670 Criminal Appeal<lb/> No. 1456 of 2012 decided on 20.09.2012 to contend that whilst<lb/> referring to para nos. 18 &amp; 19 in Prakash Kadam v. Ramprasad<lb/> Vishwanath Gupta (supra), the Hon&quot;ble Apex Court had reiterated to<lb/> principles laid down thereunder whilst observing to the effect :<lb/> &quot;18. We have referred to the above authorities<lb/> solely for the purpose of reiterating two<lb/> conceptual principles, namely, factors that are to<lb/> be taken into consideration while exercising<lb/> power of admitting an accused to bail when<lb/> offences are of serious nature, and the<lb/> distinction between cancellation of bail because<lb/> of supervening circumstances and exercise of<lb/> jurisdiction in nullifying an order granting bail<lb/> in an appeal when the bail order is assailed on<lb/> the ground that the same is perverse or based on<lb/> irrelevant considerations or founded on non-<lb/>consideration of the factors which are relevant.<lb/></p>

			<p>19.<lb/> We are absolutely conscious that liberty<lb/> of a person should not be lightly dealt with, for<lb/> deprivation of liberty of a person has immense<lb/> impact on the mind of a person. Incarceration<lb/> creates a concavity in the personality of an<lb/> individual. Sometimes it causes a sense of<lb/> vacuum.<lb/> Needless<lb/> to<lb/> emphasize,<lb/> the<lb/> sacrosanctity of liberty is paramount in a<lb/> civilized society. However, in a democratic body<lb/> polity which is wedded to Rule of Law an<lb/> individual is expected to grow within the social<lb/> restrictions sanctioned by law. The individual<lb/> liberty is restricted by larger social interest and<lb/> its deprivation must have due sanction of law. In<lb/> an orderly society an individual is expected to<lb/> live with dignity having respect for law and also<lb/> giving due respect to others&apos; rights. It is a well<lb/> accepted principle that the concept of liberty is<lb/> not in the realm of absolutism but is a restricted<lb/> one. The cry of the collective for justice, its<lb/> desire for peace and harmony and its necessity<lb/> for security cannot be allowed to be trivialized.<lb/> The life of an individual living in a society<lb/> governed by Rule of Law has to be regulated and<lb/> such Regulations which are the source in law<lb/> subserve the social balance and function as a<lb/> significant instrument for protection of human<lb/> rights and security of the collective. It is because<lb/> fundamentally laws are made for their obedience<lb/> so that every member of the society lives<lb/> peacefully in a society to achieve his individual<lb/> as well as social interest. That is why Edmond<lb/> Burke while discussing about liberty opined, &quot;it<lb/> is regulated freedom&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>20.<lb/> It is also to be kept in mind that<lb/> individual liberty cannot be accentuated to such<lb/> an extent or elevated to such a high pedestal<lb/> which would bring in anarchy or disorder in the<lb/> society. The prospect of greater justice requires<lb/> that law and order should prevail in a civilized<lb/> milieu. True it is, there can be no arithmetical<lb/> formula for fixing the parameters in precise<lb/> exactitude but the adjudication should express<lb/> not only application of mind but also exercise of<lb/> jurisdiction on accepted and established norms.<lb/> Law and order in a society protects the<lb/> established precepts and sees to it that<lb/> contagious crimes do not become epidemic. In<lb/> an organized society the concept of liberty<lb/> basically requires citizens to be responsible and<lb/> not to disturb the tranquility and safety which<lb/> every well-meaning person desires. Not for<lb/> nothing J. Oerter stated:<lb/> Personal liberty is the right to act without<lb/> interference within the limits of the law.<lb/></p>

			<p>21.<lb/> Thus analyzed, it is clear that though<lb/> liberty is a greatly cherished value in the life of<lb/> an individual, it is a controlled and restricted<lb/> one and no element in the society can act in a<lb/> manner by consequence of which the life or<lb/> liberty of others is jeopardized, for the rational<lb/> collective does not countenance an anti-social or<lb/> anti-collective act.&quot;<lb/> 57. Reliance was also placed on the observation in paras 32 &amp; 34 of<lb/> the said verdict of the Hon&quot;ble Apex Court, which are to the effect : -<lb/>&quot;32. We may usefully state that when the citizens<lb/> are scared to lead a peaceful life and this kind of<lb/> offences usher in an impediment in<lb/> establishment of orderly society, the duty of the<lb/> court becomes more pronounced and the burden<lb/> is heavy. There should have been proper analysis<lb/> of the criminal antecedents. Needless to say,<lb/> imposition of conditions is subsequent to the<lb/> order admitting an accused to bail. The question<lb/> should be posed whether the accused deserves to<lb/> be enlarged on bail or not and only thereafter<lb/> issue of imposing conditions would arise. We do<lb/> not deny for a moment that the period of custody<lb/> is a relevant factor but simultaneously the<lb/> totality of circumstances and the criminal<lb/> antecedents are also to be weighed. They are to<lb/> be weighed in the scale of collective cry and<lb/> desire. The societal concern has to be kept in<lb/> view in juxtaposition of individual liberty.<lb/> Regard being had to the said parameter we are<lb/> inclined to think that the social concern in the<lb/> case at hand deserves to be given priority over<lb/> lifting the restriction of liberty of the accused.<lb/></p>

			<p>34.<lb/> We may note with profit that it is not an<lb/> appeal for cancellation of bail as cancellation is<lb/> not<lb/> sought<lb/> because<lb/> of<lb/> supervening<lb/> circumstances. The present one is basically an<lb/> appeal challenging grant of bail where the High<lb/> Court has failed to take into consideration the<lb/> relevant material factors which make the order<lb/> perverse.&quot;<lb/> It was thus submitted on behalf of the petitioner that the present<lb/> petition though couched as being one under Section 439 (2) of the<lb/> Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was also one under Section 482 of<lb/> the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 filed on behalf of the petitioner<lb/> seeking the setting aside of the grant of the anticipatory bail to the<lb/> respondent in Bail Appln. No. 14072/2015 and in Bail Appln. No.<lb/> 14073/2015 both dated 21.12.2016 of the learned Additional Sessions<lb/> Judge-01, Dwarka Courts in FIR No.227/1992, under Sections<lb/> 147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436 of the Indian Penal Code,<lb/> 1860, Police Station Janakpuri and FIR No.264/1992, under Sections<lb/> 147/148/149/302/307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 Police Station<lb/> Vikaspuri granted vide orders dated 21.12.2016 and that both the<lb/> petitions filed were not merely ones seeking cancellation of the bail<lb/> sought because of any supervening circumstances but rather<lb/> challenges to grant of the bail inasmuchas the learned Additional<lb/> Sessions Judge-01, Dwarka Courts had failed to take into<lb/> consideration the material factors which rendered the impugned orders<lb/> perverse.<lb/> 58. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict of<lb/> the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court in the case titled as Dinesh M.N. (S.P.)<lb/> Vs. State of Gujarat (2008) 9 SCC 66 with specific reference to para<lb/> 23 of the said verdict to contend that at the time of grant of bail, the<lb/> Court dealing with an application for the cancellation of bail under<lb/> Section 439 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can consider<lb/> whether irrelevant materials were taken into consideration at the time<lb/> of grant of bail. Even though the re-appreciation of the evidence was<lb/> not called for and it was thus contended as was also observed vide<lb/> para 26 of the said verdict that once it is concluded that the bail was<lb/> granted on untenable grounds, the plea of absence of supervening<lb/> circumstances has no leg to stand.<lb/> 59. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the petitioner on the<lb/> verdict of the Hon&quot;ble Apex Court in the case titled as Neeru Yadav<lb/> Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another (2014) 16 SCC 508 with<lb/> specific reference to para 12 of the said verdict which lays down as<lb/> follows : -<lb/>&quot;12.<lb/> We have referred to certain principles<lb/> to be kept in mind while granting bail, as has<lb/> been laid down by this Court from time to time.<lb/> It is well settled in law that cancellation of bail<lb/> after it is granted because the accused has<lb/> misconducted himself or of some supervening<lb/> circumstances warranting such cancellation<lb/> have occurred is in a different compartment<lb/> altogether than an order granting bail which is<lb/> unjustified, illegal and perverse. If in a case, the<lb/> relevant factors which should have been taken<lb/> into consideration while dealing with the<lb/> application for bail and have not been taken note<lb/> of bail or it is founded on irrelevant<lb/> considerations, indisputably the superior court<lb/> can set aside the order of such a grant of bail.<lb/> Such a case belongs to a different category and<lb/> is in a separate realm. While dealing with a case<lb/> of second nature, the Court does not dwell upon<lb/> the violation of conditions by the accused or the<lb/> supervening circumstances that have happened<lb/> subsequently. It, on the contrary, delves into the<lb/> justifiability and the soundness of the order<lb/> passed by the Court.&quot;<lb/> to contend that if in a case, the relevant factors which have been taken<lb/> into consideration while dealing with the application for bail ought not<lb/> been taken note of and where the grant of bail is founded on irrelevant<lb/> considerations, indisputably the superior court can set aside the order<lb/> of such a grant of bail.<lb/> 60. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict of<lb/> the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court in the case titled as Harbans Kaur and<lb/> Another Vs. State of Haryana (2005) 9 SCC 195 to the effect : -<lb/>&quot;There is no proposition in law that relatives are<lb/> to be treated as untruthful witnesses. On the<lb/> contrary, reason has to be shown when a plea of<lb/> partiality is raised to show that the witnesses had<lb/> reason to shield actual culprit and falsely<lb/> implicate the accused. No evidence has been led<lb/> in this regard. So far as the delay in lodging the<lb/> FIR is concerned, the witnesses have clearly<lb/> stated that after seeing the deceased in an<lb/> injured condition immediate effort was to get<lb/> him hospitalized and get him treated. There<lb/> cannot be any generalization that whenever<lb/> there is a delay in lodging the FIR, the<lb/> prosecution case becomes suspect. Whether<lb/> delay is so long as to throw a cloud of suspicion<lb/> on the seeds of the prosecution case, would<lb/> depend upon the facts of each case. Even a long<lb/> delay can be condoned if the witnesses have no<lb/> motive of implicating the accused and have given<lb/> a plausible reason as to why the report was<lb/> lodged belatedly. In the instant case, this has<lb/> been done. It is to be noted that though there<lb/> was cross-examination at length no infirmity<lb/> was noticed in their evidence. Therefore, the trial<lb/> Court and the High Court were right in relying<lb/> on the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.&quot;<lb/> 61. It was thus submitted on behalf of the petitioner that the<lb/> anticipatory bail granted in Bail Appln. No. 14072/2015 and in Bail<lb/> Appln. No. 14073/2015 both dated 21.12.2016 of the learned<lb/> Additional Sessions Judge-01, Dwarka Courts in FIR No.227/1992,<lb/> under Sections 147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436 of the Indian<lb/> Penal Code, 1860, Police Station Janakpuri and FIR No.264/1992,<lb/> under Sections 147/148/149/302/307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860<lb/> Police Station Vikaspuri as virtually common grounds are urged<lb/> against the respondent in both the FIRs i.e., 227/1992, Police Station<lb/> Janakpuri and 264/1992, Police Station Vikaspuri as virtually similar<lb/> impugned orders dated 21.12.2016 be set aside and the observations<lb/> made in the para 24 &amp; 26 of the impugned orders dated 21.12.2016 in<lb/> relation to both the FIRs above mentioned be expunged.<lb/> RESPONDENT&apos;S CONTENTIONS<lb/> 62. Through the reply submitted on behalf of the respondent and as<lb/> contended by learned counsel for the respondent Sh. Anil Kumar<lb/> Sharma, it was submitted at the very outset that both the cases Crl.<lb/> M.C. 338/2017 and 339/2017 are in respect of FIR No. 227/92 and<lb/> 264/92 registered with Police Stations Janak Puri and Vikas Puri<lb/> respectively but both the aforesaid FIR&apos;s are on the strength of the<lb/> same affidavit dated 08.09.1985 submitted by the complainant before<lb/> Justice Ranganthan Mishra Commission pertaining to the same<lb/> incident and on the same subject matter i.e. both the said FIR&apos;s stated<lb/> the same contents and both the cases were sent for closure by the<lb/> investigating agency of the respective Police Stations and both the<lb/> closure reports were accepted on 16.02.1996 and 27.08.1994<lb/> respectively but the SIT was treating them as two different cases.<lb/> 63. It was further submitted on behalf of the respondent that the SIT<lb/> has no reason to move the application under section 439(2) r/w section<lb/> 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 against the grant of<lb/> anticipatory bail order dated 21.12.2016 neither on the facts nor on the<lb/> law and that the impugned order was neither erroneous nor arbitrary<lb/> nor a blanket one and that the order was comprehensive, reasoned and<lb/> a speaking one taking into consideration the material on record.<lb/> 64. It was also submitted on behalf of the respondent that the<lb/> contention of the prosecution that the respondent had no reason to<lb/> believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed<lb/> a non-bailable offence was erroneous inasmuchas the respondent had<lb/> every reason and apprehension for the same and thus the respondent<lb/> had preferred an application for grant of anticipatory bail in the<lb/> present case. The respondent also submitted that the prosecution had<lb/> stated that there was a likelihood of tampering with the prosecution<lb/> witnesses but there was not a whisper of his involvement in the 1984<lb/> riots cases and that in the year 1990, i.e. after six years of the alleged<lb/> occurrence, the case was registered vide RCl/90/SIV.II/SIC(l), New<lb/> Delhi against the Respondent pertaining to riots that took place on<lb/> 01.11.1984 in the Sultanpuri area in which this Court had granted<lb/> anticipatory bail to the respondent in the case titled as &quot;Sajjan Kumar<lb/> Vs. State&apos;&apos; vide order dated 07.11.1990 which is reported as 43 (1991)<lb/> DLT 888 and that this Court had observed that after the lapse of six<lb/> long years, the respondent could not be allowed to be detained and had<lb/> further observed that for mere interrogation, the arrest of the<lb/> respondent was not at all necessary and that in the above said case, the<lb/> respondent was also acquitted by the then learned Court of the<lb/> Additional Sessions Judge, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi, vide<lb/> order dated 23.12.2002.<lb/> 65. It was further submitted by the respondent that in the year 2005,<lb/> on the recommendation of the Hon&apos;ble Justice Nanavati Commission,<lb/> FIRs no. 250/84, 347/91 and 307/94 of Police Station Sultan Puri and<lb/> 416/84 of Police Station Delhi Cantt. were re-registered as<lb/> RC7(S)/05/SCB-II/DLI/2005, RC8(S)/05/SCB-II, DLI both dated<lb/> 28.11.2005, RC25(S)/05/SCB-I/SCR-I/DLI dated 22.11.2005 in<lb/> respect of Sultan Puri area and RC24 2005 S 2004 dated 22.11.2005<lb/> for the Delhi Cantt area and that in these cases this Court vide its order<lb/> dated 26.02.2010 had granted anticipatory bail in the aforesaid four<lb/> cases whilst observing that it would not be justifiable to detain the<lb/> respondent in custody after the lapse of 25 years of the incident and<lb/> that against the above said order of this Court, a petition for special<lb/> leave to appeal (CrI.) No. 2770 &amp; 2771 of 2010 was preferred and the<lb/> same was dismissed by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court of India vide order<lb/> dated 29.03.2010.<lb/> 66. It was further submitted on behalf of the respondent that in the<lb/> present case, the respondent was named after 32 years of the incident<lb/> and the case was referred by the Ministry of Home Affairs vide its<lb/> order dated 12.02.2015 to re-open after constituting the petitioner i.e.<lb/> the SIT on the recommendation of the Justice G.P. Mathur Committee<lb/> report and the petitioner in-turn had taken up further investigation on<lb/> 11.08.2016 and prior to that the respondent was never named in any of<lb/> the FIRs. It was submitted by the respondent that it can thus not be<lb/> said that the impugned order of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts is<lb/> manifestly erroneous, illegal and perverse and it was submitted that<lb/> rather the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts had rightly appreciated the<lb/> material and rendered just findings where no interference was called<lb/> for and that apparently, no custodial interrogation of the applicant was<lb/> needed and that the Court of learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts had<lb/> rightly observed that for the purpose of interrogation of the applicant<lb/> after 32 years of the incident, arrest of the applicant was not required<lb/> as there were no allegations that anything used in the commission of<lb/> offence was to be recovered at the instance of the applicant. Inter alia<lb/> it was submitted on behalf of the respondent that there was nothing<lb/> that had been stated whether the prosecution has any new material<lb/> which was required to be considered and there was no cogent,<lb/> overwhelming ground and circumstances, which, so required the<lb/> cancellation of the anticipatory granted to the respondent.<lb/> 67. Inter alia it was submitted on behalf of the respondent that he<lb/> had not misused the terms / conditions imposed while granting the bail<lb/> nor had he misused the concession of bail and that the prosecution had<lb/> not mentioned any specific instances of any abuse of liberty by the<lb/> respondent or probable apprehension in relation thereto and that it was<lb/> the case of the prosecution that the respondent had never been named<lb/> earlier when the matter had been sent for a closure.<lb/> 68. It was further contended on behalf of the respondent that the<lb/> contention of the prosecution through the statements under Section<lb/> 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 of witnesses that they<lb/> had corroborated the contents of the FIR and the affidavit of the<lb/> complainant could not be accepted, inasmuchas the said witnesses had<lb/> never been examined before any other agency and thus the contention<lb/> of the petitioner that they have categorically stated and alleged that the<lb/> respondent was an MP from Outer Delhi Constituency and had formed<lb/> an unlawful assembly, armed with deadly weapons for the purpose of<lb/> committing criminal acts including riots, arson, murder causing<lb/> disharmony and hatred between different religious groups and<lb/> destruction of the properties belonging to Sikh community during<lb/> 1984 riots was absolutely incorrect. The respondent further contended<lb/> that in 1990, the Special Riot Cell had been created to investigate the<lb/> cases of the victims of 1984 riots and not a single word was stated in<lb/> the entire petition as to how the Delhi Police was wrong in filing the<lb/> closure report/untraced report in both the cases.<lb/> 69. Inter alia, it has been submitted on behalf of the respondent<lb/> that the contents of the affidavit of the complainant are nowhere<lb/> suggestive of the fact that the leader leading the mob who came in a<lb/> white car was the respondent and thus the petitioner has no reason to<lb/> contend that the name of the leader was not disclosed by the<lb/> complainant due to fear and influence of the respondent and that the<lb/> name of the respondent given now by the complainant after a gap of<lb/> 32 years speaks aloud that he has been named only to target him. It<lb/> has also been submitted on behalf of the respondent that the<lb/> statements made under Sections 161 and 164 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973 of the complainant are weighed on the touchstone of<lb/> trial and admittedly the name of the respondent has been brought forth<lb/> through the said statements for the first time after the constitution of<lb/> the SIT and that prior to the constitution of the SIT neither the<lb/> complainant nor any other witness had ever named the respondent and<lb/> that it was thus apparent that the respondent has been named after<lb/> having been so tutored him.<lb/></p>

			<p>70.<lb/> The respondent through his reply has further categorically<lb/> stated that he had always cooperated with the Investigating Agency<lb/> and stated that he had joined the investigation each time and<lb/> categorically denied that he had gone with the fleet of advocates on<lb/> 22.11.2016 though he was accompanied by his counsel and stated that<lb/> the counsel was nowhere involved in the interrogation proceedings.<lb/> The respondent also denied that he had not answered any of the<lb/> questions of the Investigating Officer though he was interrogated at<lb/> length for about 2 hours. The respondent inter alia denied that he<lb/> tried to dictate the terms of the investigation and also asked the<lb/> Investigating Officer to give a written questionnaire and also denied<lb/> that he would not answer till the questionnaire was given and rather<lb/> requested the Investigating Officer to supply him a copy of the<lb/> complaint/questions, if any, so that he could give appropriate and<lb/> comprehensive reply. It was contended thus on behalf of the<lb/> respondent that if there was a CCTV surveillance in the office of the<lb/> petitioner it must have retained the record. The reply of the respondent<lb/> is accompanied by an affidavit of the respondent dated 27.11.2017.<lb/></p>

			<p>71.<lb/> The respondent has further submitted that the status report filed<lb/> by the petitioner Annexure P-7 supports the apprehension of the<lb/> respondent that the petitioner had made up its mind to arrest him and<lb/> that the SIT had opposed the anticipatory bail tooth and nail and the<lb/> present proceedings under Section 439(2) of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973 also support the intention of the State to arrest him<lb/> and thus the respondent apparently had every reason to believe that he<lb/> would be arrested and thus the prayer made by the respondent seeking<lb/> grant of anticipatory bail was wholly merited. The respondent has<lb/> further categorically denied that there is any likelihood of his<lb/> influencing the witnesses or tampering with the evidence and has<lb/> categorically submitted that the respondent is not even remotely<lb/> connected with the case. The respondent has further contended that<lb/> the FIR was registered in the year 1997 and that in the affidavit dated<lb/> 8.9.1985 of the complainant there were no allegations made against<lb/> the respondent and that the Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission had<lb/> concluded that no responsible person and the authority of the<lb/> Congress-I had hatched any conspiracy organizing large scale rioting,<lb/> etc. and the Commission had itself recommended new Committees to<lb/> be appointed to go through individual cases of omission and non-<lb/>registration of the case by the local police whereupon the Delhi<lb/> Administration by notification of 21.2.1987 had constituted a<lb/> Committee of Hon&quot;ble Mr.Justice M.L.Jain and Mr. A.K.Banerjee, a<lb/> Retired Officer of the IPS, to examine inter alia whether there were<lb/> cases of omission to register or properly investigate offences<lb/> committed in Delhi during the period of the riots from October 31,<lb/> 1984 to November 7, 1984. Pursuant to the recommendation of Jain<lb/> Banerjee Committee a writ petition being W.P.(C) No.3327/1987 was<lb/> preferred by Sh. B.N.Gupta and thereafter on 22.3.1990, the Delhi<lb/> Administration appointed another Committee comprising Hon&quot;ble Mr.<lb/> Justice P.S. Poti, the former Chief Justice of Gujarat High Court and<lb/> Mr.P.A. Rosha, a retired IPS officer whereafter the riot cell was<lb/> constituted which investigated the present case and filed a closure<lb/> report which was accepted on 27.8.1994 by the concerned competent<lb/> Court. The respondent denied that the Riot Cell constituted in 1990<lb/> and which filed the closure reports which were accepted was not an<lb/> independent agency as recommended by the Jain Aggarwal<lb/> Committee and submitted that the petitioner had no reason to blame<lb/> the respondent for delay being under the influence of the respondent.<lb/></p>

			<p>72.<lb/> The respondent has further stated that the shifting of the<lb/> complainant from Delhi to Punjab after the incident is a matter of<lb/> record but denied that the same was due to any fear of the respondent<lb/> or because all the witnesses and the complainant were apprehensive<lb/> about their life and safety and were not willing to visit Delhi due to<lb/> fear of the respondent and that it could not be accepted that the<lb/> complainant and other witnesses got faith in the system only after the<lb/> constitution of the SIT to investigate the cases in relation to the 1984<lb/> riots.<lb/></p>

			<p>73.<lb/> Through the written submissions, the respondent reiterated that<lb/> the FIRs 227/92 and 264/92 are identical and based on a single<lb/> complaint of Harvinder Singh in relation to two different police<lb/> stations, i.e., Janakpuri and Vikaspuri based on the affidavit dated<lb/> 8.9.1985 of Harvinder Singh filed before the Justice Ranganath<lb/> Mishra Commission and that the SIT has treated the FIR of Police<lb/> Station Janakpuri in relation to the incident dated 1.11.1984 and of<lb/> Vikaspuri in relation to the incident of 2.11.1984 but the contents of<lb/> the affidavit contained incidents of both the dates and thus the<lb/> respondent sought to ascertain whether the complaint with Janakpuri<lb/> Police Station would be read to be the portion of the first day and the<lb/> remaining contents for the other date and submitted that this brought<lb/> forth the intention of the SIT, i.e., the petitioner as to how the<lb/> petitioner was trying to multiply one incident.<lb/> 74. The respondent has further contended placing reliance on the<lb/> verdict of the Apex Court Dolat Ram and Others Vs. State of<lb/> Haryana; (1995) 1 SCC 349 (para 4) to contend that there is<lb/> difference between rejection of bail in a non-bailable case at the initial<lb/> stage and the cancellation of bail so granted and that very cogent and<lb/> over whelming circumstances are necessary for orders directing<lb/> cancellation of bail already granted and that the grounds for<lb/> cancellation of bail are (broadly illustrative and not exhaustive). It was<lb/> further contended on behalf of the respondent that no concrete<lb/> material had been produced by the prosecution to show that the<lb/> accused had interfered or attempt to interfere with the due course of<lb/> administration of justice or evasion or attempt to evade the due course<lb/> of justice or that the abuse of the concession granted to the accused in<lb/> any manner. Reliance was placed on the observations in paragraph 4<lb/> of the verdict of the Apex Court which lays down to the effect:<lb/> &quot;4. Rejection of bail in a non-bailable case at the<lb/> initial stage and the cancellation of bail so<lb/> granted, have to be considered and dealt with on<lb/> different basis. Very cogent and overwhelming<lb/> circumstances are necessary for an order<lb/> directing the cancellation of the bail, already<lb/> granted. Generally speaking, the grounds for<lb/> cancellation of bail, broadly (illustrative and not<lb/> exhaustive) are: interference or attempt to<lb/> interfere with the due course of administration of<lb/> Justice or evasion or attempt to evade the due<lb/> course of justice or abuse of the concession<lb/> granted to the accused in any manner. The<lb/> satisfaction of the court, on the basis of material<lb/> placed on the record of the possibility of the<lb/> accused absconding is yet another reason<lb/> justifying the cancellation of bail. However, bail<lb/> once granted should not be cancelled in a<lb/> mechanical manner without considering whether<lb/> any supervening circumstances have rendered it<lb/> no longer conducive to a fair trial to allow the<lb/> accused to retain his freedom by enjoying the<lb/> concession of bail during the trial. These<lb/> principles, it appears, were lost sight of by the<lb/> High Court when it decided to cancel the bail,<lb/> already granted. The High Court it appears to us<lb/> overlooked the distinction of the factors relevant<lb/> for rejecting bail in a nonbailable case in the first<lb/> instance and the cancellation of bail already<lb/> granted.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>75.<lb/> It was also submitted on behalf of the respondent that there was<lb/> no concrete material that had been produced by the petitioner to show<lb/> that the accused had interfered or attempted to interfere with the due<lb/> course of administration of justice by threatening the complainant and<lb/> his family members and the truth will surface when the evidence is<lb/> adduced and in view of the conditions that have been imposed by the<lb/> Sessions Judge for grant of anticipatory bail, the Investigating Agency<lb/> could interrogate the accused, i.e., the respondent effectively and that<lb/> it is settled law that for cancellation of bail the conduct subsequent to<lb/> release on bail and the supervening circumstances alone are relevant.<lb/></p>

			<p>76.<lb/> The respondent has contended that the conditions imposed on<lb/> the respondent at the time of grant of anticipatory bail vide the<lb/> impugned orders were to the effect:<lb/> &quot;(i). Respondent Shall join the investigation as<lb/> and when directed by the I.O.<lb/> (ii)<lb/> Respondent shall not threaten or<lb/> influence any of the witnesses<lb/> (iii) And, shall not leave the country without<lb/> prior permission of the concerned Court.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>77.<lb/> Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondent on the<lb/> verdict of the Apex Court in Padamakar Tukaram Bhavnagre and<lb/> anr. V. State of Maharashtra and Anr. (2012) 122 AIC 237 (SC),<lb/> on para 13 of the said verdict to the effect:<lb/> &quot;13.<lb/> It is true that this Court has held that<lb/> generally speaking the grounds for cancellation of<lb/> bail broadly are interference or attempt to<lb/> interfere with the due course of justice or abuse of<lb/> the concession granted to the accused in any<lb/> manner. This Court has clarified that these<lb/> instances are illustrative and bail can be<lb/> cancelled where the order of bail is perverse<lb/> because it is passed ignoring evidence on record<lb/> or taking into consideration irrelevant material.<lb/> Such vulnerable bail order must be quashed in the<lb/> interest of justice. No such case, however, was<lb/> made out to persuade learned Single Judge to<lb/> quash the anticipatory bail order passed in favour<lb/> of accused 6 &amp; 7. Order granting anticipatory<lb/> bail to them, therefore, deserves to be confirmed.<lb/> We feel that if the conditions imposed by learned<lb/> Sessions Judge are confirmed, it would be<lb/> possible for the investigating agency to<lb/> interrogate the accused effectively.<lb/> 14. In the circumstances, we quash and set aside<lb/> the impugned orders. Anticipatory bail granted to<lb/> the appellants-accused 6 and 7 by learned<lb/> Additional Sessions Judge by order dated<lb/> 23/01/2012 is hereby confirmed. The appellants-<lb/>accused 6 and 7 shall cooperate with the<lb/> investigating agency and abide by the conditions<lb/> imposed on them. Needless to say that it will be<lb/> open to learned Additional Sessions Judge seized<lb/> of the case to vary the conditions if necessary in<lb/> accordance with law. Needless to say further that<lb/> all observations made by us touching the merits of<lb/> the case are prima facie observations and the trial<lb/> court shall decide the case without being<lb/> influenced by them.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>78.<lb/> The respondent has further submitted that the conduct of the<lb/> respondent indicated that he had fully cooperated and was fully<lb/> cooperating with Investigating Agency, inasmuch as the respondent<lb/> was granted bail on 21.12.2016 and had been summoned by the<lb/> petitioner to join the investigation on 21.12.2016 itself at 3 p.m. and<lb/> admittedly the respondent had gone to join the investigation at the<lb/> petitioner&quot;s office on 21.12.2016 at 3 p.m. but the Investigating<lb/> Officer was not there and had gone to the Court to collect the case file<lb/> and the order. The respondent had never been summoned by the<lb/> Investigating Agency for interrogation till date and thus there is no<lb/> question of non-cooperation by the respondent and that the respondent<lb/> had joined the investigation every time except on 14.12.2016 for<lb/> medical reasons which had been appreciated by the petitioner and had<lb/> been allowed and merely asking for a copy of complaint, document or<lb/> questionnaire to ensure a proper reply cannot be taken as non-<lb/>cooperation by the Investigating Agency.<lb/> 79. The respondent has further contended that it is not the case of<lb/> the petitioner that :<lb/> &quot;a) the respondent will flee away from justice or<lb/> will not be readily available during trial;<lb/> b) or,<lb/> has<lb/> misused<lb/> or<lb/> abused<lb/> the<lb/> concession/liberty granted to him; c) or, has<lb/> interfered or attempt to interfere with the due<lb/> course of administration of justice;<lb/> d) or, has threatened someone or tampered with<lb/> the prosecution witnesses and;<lb/> e) or, has breached some conditions imposed<lb/> upon him while granting the anticipatory bail.&quot;<lb/> 80. The respondent further contends that there is no material<lb/> suggestive of cancellation of bail and that it has not been disputed by<lb/> the petitioner that the respondent has been named for the first time<lb/> after 32 years of the incident and that the first case was registered<lb/> against the respondent in the year 1990 vide RC-1/90/SIV.II/SIC(1)<lb/> and that the respondent had been granted bail in this case on 7.11.1990<lb/> by this Court in the case titled Sajjan Kumar V. State in Crl.Misc.<lb/> (Main) No.2073/1990 though similar stereotyped allegations had been<lb/> levelled with specific reference to para 6 of the verdict wherein the<lb/> contentions of the Investigating Agency were set forth to the effect:<lb/> &quot;(6) The submission of the learned counsel for the<lb/> respondent is that the petitioner is politically a<lb/> powerful and influential person who can directly<lb/> or indirectly interfere in the course of<lb/> investigation. Considering the seriousness of the<lb/> offence and keeping in view the events that<lb/> happened on 11th September, 1990, coupled with<lb/> the fact that it has taken six long years to start<lb/> investigation, there is every likelihood that if the<lb/> petitioner is allowed to remain at large, no<lb/> witness will come forward and depose about the<lb/> events concerning this case. This potential threat<lb/> to the prosecution witnesses, who have already<lb/> experienced a haul cast during the riots will<lb/> prevent them from bringing to book the accused<lb/> and others charged of committing acts of brutality<lb/> against the community. Under the circumstances,<lb/> it is a fit case where the anticipatory bail be not<lb/> confirmed.&quot;<lb/> and the observations of this Court in para 29, 30, 31 and 32 in this<lb/> verdict were relied upon which are to the effect:-<lb/>&quot;(29) Before parting with this case, we may note<lb/> that the basic rule for an applicant who seeks his<lb/> enlargement on bail from the court may be tersely<lb/> put as bail, not jail, except where there are<lb/> circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing<lb/> from Justice or throttling the course of justice or<lb/> creating other trouble in the shape of repeating<lb/> offences or intimidating witnesses and the like.<lb/> …………………………………………………………<lb/> ……………………………………………...<lb/> 30. The considerations which weigh with the<lb/> Courts while granting bail either under Section<lb/> 438 or Section 439 Criminal Procedure Code are<lb/> :-<lb/>(1) The nature and gravity of the circumstances in<lb/> which the offence is committed;<lb/> (2) The position and the status of the accused with<lb/> reference to the victim and the witnesses;<lb/> (3) The likelihood of the accused fleeing from<lb/> justice;<lb/> (4) Of repeating the offence;<lb/> (5) Of jeopardising his own life being faced with a<lb/> grim prospect of possible conviction in the case;<lb/> (6) Of tampering with witnesses;<lb/> (7) The history of the case as well as of his<lb/> investigation; and<lb/> (8) Other relevant grounds which may apply to<lb/> the facts and circumstances of a particular case.<lb/> 31. In this case, all these factors were carefully<lb/> taken into consideration when the petitioner was<lb/> initially granted anticipatory bail and are being<lb/> kept in view while disposing of the present<lb/> petition. It is now well settled by a catena of<lb/> judgments of the Supreme Court that this power is<lb/> not to be exercised as if a punishment before trial<lb/> is being imposed. The only material<lb/> considerations in such a situation are whether the<lb/> accused would be readily available for his trial<lb/> and whether he is likely to abuse the discretion<lb/> granted in his favor by tampering with the<lb/> evidence. As observed earlier, there is no material<lb/> on record to suggest that the petitioner who has a<lb/> status in the society, and enjoys good reputation,<lb/> love and affection from the persons at large, is<lb/> likely to repeat the offence, abuse the trust placed<lb/> in him by the court, or avoid the trial.<lb/> 32. After a lapse of 6 long years of the incident,<lb/> the petitioner cannot be allowed to be detained,<lb/> particularly when there is no averment that a<lb/> weapon of offence with which the petitioner is<lb/> alleged to have caused any injury to the deceased<lb/> is yet to be recovered for mere interrogation, in<lb/> my opinion, the arrest of the petitioner is not at all<lb/> necessary. Even otherwise, the CBl does not<lb/> appear to be serious in interrogating the<lb/> petitioner. On 27-9-90, when the case was taken<lb/> up, learned counsel for the respondent frankly<lb/> conceded that from the day when the petitioner<lb/> was granted anticipatory bail, he has not been<lb/> summoned for interrogation. It was only<lb/> thereafter that the petitioner was summoned once<lb/> on 28-9-90, and thereafter no attempt has been<lb/> made to further interrogative him.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>81.<lb/> It was also submitted on behalf of the respondent that the<lb/> second time the cases were registered by the CBI in the year 2010 on<lb/> the recommendations of the Nanawati Commission vide RC7 (S)/ 05/<lb/> SCB-II/DLI/2005, RC8(S)/05/SCB-II/DLI, RC25(S)/05/SCB-I//SCR-<lb/>I/DLI and RC24.2005(S) 2004 and that the Hon&quot;ble High Court of<lb/> Delhi granted anticipatory bail vide order dated 26.02.2010 in case<lb/> titled Sajjan Kumar V. The State through C.B.I. (Bail Appln. No.<lb/> 306/2010, 311/2010,312/2010 and 313/2010) and it was submitted<lb/> that in this case too, similar allegations were levelled which are<lb/> levelled now.<lb/></p>

			<p>82.<lb/> Reliance was placed thus on behalf of the petitioner on<lb/> specific paragraphs of this verdict to the effect:-<lb/>&quot;26. As against this, Mr.R.S.Cheema, learned<lb/> senior counsel for respondent has contended that<lb/> petitioners are involved in serious offences of<lb/> murder, arson and rioting. Petitioner Sajjan<lb/> Kumar had organized a mob and targeted the<lb/> persons of Sikh community; instigated the said<lb/> mob to kill and burn the houses of members of<lb/> Sikh community. The incident of arson, looting,<lb/> killing of male members of Sikh community was<lb/> perpetrated in a barbaric, inhuman and cold<lb/> blooded manner, as a consequence whereof<lb/> victims were isolated, felt insecure, threatened<lb/> and at that time had no courage to go before the<lb/> investigating agency or the court to make a<lb/> statement against the culprits. Some of the close<lb/> relatives of the deceased persons had migrated to<lb/> Punjab. They had no courage to return to Delhi,<lb/> so as to make a statement before the court or the<lb/> investigating agency. With the passage of time<lb/> they mustered up the courage and approached the<lb/> Commission and filed their affidavits. All these<lb/> years the truth was not allowed to come to surface<lb/> which shows the pervading influence which the<lb/> local administration had over the whole matter,<lb/> as petitioner Sajjan Kumar was holding high<lb/> political position. Accordingly, delay of 25 years<lb/> in this case will be of no consequence.<lb/> 27. Learned senior counsel has further contended<lb/> that if petitioners are granted bail witnesses will<lb/> not be able to depose freely; the confidence of<lb/> people in the system will erode and a fallacious<lb/> message will go that these petitioners are above<lb/> the law. In case petitioners are granted bail it will<lb/> hamper the fair trial, inasmuch as, the witnesses<lb/> may not come forward to depose in the matter<lb/> and/or they may be threatened or influenced by<lb/> the petitioner. In nutshell, it is contended that in<lb/> the facts of this case, bail cannot be granted.<lb/> 28. From what has been stated hereinbefore, it is<lb/> clear that in respect of the same incident four<lb/> FIRs were registered earlier and the same were<lb/> investigated by the Delhi police and statement of<lb/> witnesses were recorded. In two FIRs, closure<lb/> reports were filed which were duly accepted by<lb/> the learned Metropolitan Magistrate after<lb/> recording statement of complainants. In two other<lb/> FIRs as many as ten charge sheets were filed in<lb/> the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge.<lb/> After full fledged trial accused involved therein,<lb/> were acquitted, which included the petitioners as<lb/> well. So far as petitioner Sajjan Kumar is<lb/> concerned, he was not sent up to face trial in the<lb/> FIRs registered by the Delhi Police. A separate<lb/> case was registered against him in the year 1990<lb/> by CBI pursuant to the recommendation of above-<lb/>referred Committee, wherein role was ascribed to<lb/> him that he had instigated the mob by holding<lb/> public meeting in the Sultanpuri area and<lb/> thereafter, he led the mob which went on rampage<lb/> and burnt the properties; looted the belongings<lb/> and killed several persons belonging to Sikh<lb/> community. However, after a full-fledged trial this<lb/> petitioner was also acquitted in the said case.<lb/> Several witnesses, whose statements have been<lb/> recorded by the CBI had also made statements in<lb/> earlier FIRs. Present FIRs are relating to the<lb/> same incidents which were involved in earlier<lb/> cases. Some more witnesses have come forward<lb/> and made statements implicating the petitioners.<lb/> So far as other witnesses, who are common in<lb/> earlier FIRs as well as in the present FIRs, have<lb/> again made statements implicating the petitioners,<lb/> however, their version had already been tested in<lb/> earlier cases sent for trial. The new witnesses<lb/> have to explain as to why they did not come<lb/> forward earlier, during the trial.<lb/> 29. Be that as it may, the statement of such<lb/> witnesses cannot be brushed aside completely at<lb/> this stage but at the same time, they have to<lb/> explain during trial as to why they had not<lb/> deposed against the petitioner on earlier<lb/> occasions. 25 years have gone by and this delay<lb/> undoubtedly tilts the balance in favour of the<lb/> petitioners, at least for the purpose of grant of<lb/> bail to them.<lb/> 30. I do not find much force in the contentions of<lb/> learned senior counsel that in case petitioners are<lb/> enlarged on bail it will hamper fair trial and<lb/> witnesses may not depose against the petitioners<lb/> due to the fear and threat. Admittedly all along<lb/> for the last 25 years petitioners have remained at<lb/> large as they were not in custody. CBI conducted<lb/> investigation almost for about five years. During<lb/> this period, CBI did not deem it fit to arrest any of<lb/> the petitioners. In spite of petitioners being at<lb/> large, witnesses came forward and made<lb/> statements before the CBI. There is no specific<lb/> allegation against the petitioners of having<lb/> threatened or influenced any of the witnesses, so<lb/> as to refrain any of them from making statement<lb/> against them. Besides this, it is evident from the<lb/> facts narrated herein above that after the<lb/> unfortunate and appalling incident the relatives<lb/> or the family members of victims were not left<lb/> alone to fend for themselves as members of<lb/> various<lb/> Commission/Committees<lb/> including<lb/> eminent jurists had been visiting the affected<lb/> areas and even met the families of the victims<lb/> residing in camps and interacted, counselled,<lb/> encouraged, offered support to them right from<lb/> the beginning.<lb/> 31. Indeed, it is true, that offence with which<lb/> petitioners have been charged by the CBI is of<lb/> grave nature and ordinarily in such cases courts<lb/> would be slow in admitting the accused on<lb/> anticipatory bail, in the face of statements of eye<lb/> witnesses. However, in the peculiar facts and<lb/> circumstances of this case and for the reasons as<lb/> mentioned in the preceding paras hereinabove, I<lb/> am of the view that it would not be justifiable to<lb/> detain the petitioners in custody, after lapse of 25<lb/> years of incident.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>83.<lb/> Inter alia it was submitted on behalf of the respondent that an<lb/> SLP was also preferred against the afore-cited verdict to the Supreme<lb/> Court which was dismissed vide order 29.3.2010 in the case titled<lb/> Jagdish Kaur v. Sajjan Kumar &amp; Ors. Crl.No.2770/2010 and<lb/> 2771/2010, with it having been observed by the Apex Court to the<lb/> effect:<lb/> &quot; Permission to file SLPs is granted.<lb/> In view of the reasons stated in the impugned<lb/> order, we are not inclined to interfere with the<lb/> same. We make it clear that the observation and<lb/> conclusion arrived by the High Court are<lb/> confined only for the disposal of the anticipatory<lb/> bail. At the time of trial the court concerned is<lb/> free to decide the issue on the basis of the<lb/> materials placed and uninfluenced by any of the<lb/> observation made in the impugned order.<lb/> With the above observations, the special leave<lb/> petitions are dismissed.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>84.<lb/> Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondent on the<lb/> verdict of the Supreme Court in Badresh Bipinbhai Seth v. State of<lb/> Gujarat and Anr.; (2016) 1 SCC 152 to contend that bail is not to be<lb/> withheld as a punishment and merely because an accused is charged<lb/> with a serious offence that by itself cannot be a reason to refuse the<lb/> grant of anticipatory bail which is otherwise justified and though it is<lb/> also the obligation of an applicant to make out a case for grant of<lb/> anticipatory bail, that does not mean that he has to make out a special<lb/> case and that a wise exercise of judicial power inevitably takes care of<lb/> evil consequences which are likely to flow out of its intended use.<lb/> Reference was made in this verdict relied upon on behalf of the<lb/> respondent to the judgment of the Division Bench of the SC in<lb/> Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v., State of Maharashtra; 2001 11<lb/> SCC 294 which lays down that the conflicting interests are to be<lb/> balanced while taking a decision as to the bail is to be granted or not<lb/> and reliance was thus placed on observations in para 1 of the<lb/> Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre&apos;s case (supra):<lb/> &quot;1. Leave granted.<lb/> 2. This appeal involves issues of great public<lb/> importance pertaining to the importance of<lb/> individual&apos;s personal liberty and the society&apos;s<lb/> interest.<lb/> 3. The society has a vital interest in grant or<lb/> refusal of bail because every criminal offence is<lb/> the offence against the State. The order granting<lb/> or refusing bail must reflect perfect balance<lb/> between the conflicting interests, namely, sanctity<lb/> of individual liberty and the interest of the society.<lb/> The law of bails dovetails two conflicting interests<lb/> namely, on the one hand, the requirements of<lb/> shielding the society from the hazards of those<lb/> committing crimes and potentiality of repeating<lb/> the same crime while on bail and on the other<lb/> hand absolute adherence of the fundamental<lb/> principle of criminal jurisprudence regarding<lb/> presumption of innocence of an accused until he<lb/> is found guilty and the sanctity of individual<lb/> liberty.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>85.<lb/> Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondent on the<lb/> verdict of the Apex Court in Mahant Chand Nath Yogi V. State of<lb/> Haryana; (2003) 1 SCC 326, to contend that where the anticipatory<lb/> bail has been granted on relevant considerations supported with<lb/> reasons, the same cannot be set aside by holding the grant of<lb/> anticipatory bail erroneous and merely because the submission made<lb/> by the Public Prosector that earlier investigation made by the police<lb/> officers and scrutinized by the superiors was faulty and mala fide, is<lb/> not a ground to be put against an applicant.<lb/> 86. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondent on the<lb/> verdict of the Division Bench of this Court in Brahmanand Gupta v.<lb/> Delhi Administration W.P.(C) No.3337/1987 decided on 4.10.89<lb/> whereby notification No.F-1/PS/HS/87-1227-1244 to 1433 dated<lb/> 23.2.1987 by virtue of which the Lt. Governor had appointed<lb/> Mr.Justice M.L.Jain (Retd.) and Mr.Justice A.K.Banerjee as a<lb/> Committee inter alia to monitor the investigation of criminal cases<lb/> relating to criminal offence which had been committed during the riots<lb/> which had taken place after 31.10.1984 which verdict quashed the said<lb/> notification and vide order dated 8.2.1996 the Civil appeal filed by the<lb/> Citizen Justice Committee and other against this verdict was dismissed<lb/> by the Supreme Court.<lb/> 87. Reliance was also placed on observations in Brahmanand<lb/> Gupta (Supra) on the observations of the Division Bench of this Court<lb/> to the effect :<lb/> &quot;We are however, in agreement with Mr.Gupta<lb/> that the Committee was not authorized to accept<lb/> or act on any fresh allegations against individuals<lb/> pertaining to the said incidents of rioting. In<lb/> other words, whereas it was open to the<lb/> committee to get information where there has<lb/> been omission to register or properly investigate<lb/> offences, the Committee had no jurisdiction to<lb/> accept any affidavits in which fresh allegations<lb/> were levelled for the first time, which allegations<lb/> were not sought to be levelled at the time of or<lb/> soon after the riots had taken place.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>88.<lb/> and it was thus contended on behalf of the respondent that the<lb/> setting up of the SIT vide notification dated 12.2.2016 for the<lb/> investigation of appropriate and serious criminal cases which were<lb/> filed in Delhi in connection with the 1984 riots which had earlier been<lb/> investigated and closed, could not be relied upon.<lb/> ANALYSIS<lb/> 89. On a consideration of the rival submissions on behalf of either<lb/> side, it is essential to observe that the incident in relation to FIR<lb/> 227/92, Police Station Janakpuri relates to the incident dated<lb/> 1.11.1984 at 11 a.m. and the incident in relation to FIR 264/92, Police<lb/> Station Vikaspuri relates to an occurrence of 2.11.1984 at 7 a.m. both<lb/> the FIRs are registered on the basis of the affidavit of the same<lb/> complainant Sh.Harvinder Singh s/o Sh. Sohan Singh dated 8.9.1985<lb/> placed before the Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission in relation to<lb/> which FIRs after investigation by the Special Riot Cell, the cases were<lb/> sent untraced and the closure reports were accepted on 16.2.1996 and<lb/> 27.8.1984 respectively, both of which cases were reopened after the<lb/> Government of India constituted the Special Investigation Team on<lb/> 12.2.2015 for investigation of the cases of the 1984 anti-sikh riots.<lb/> 90. The affidavit of the complainant did not name the respondent as<lb/> an accused and mentions a white coloured car and another red car<lb/> driven by some leader brand people leading the mob on 1.11.1984 at<lb/> 11 a.m. and makes no mention of the presence of any such leaders on<lb/> 2.11.1984. The statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973 of the complainant was recorded on 20.09.2016 in<lb/> the Court of SDJM Dera Bassi Mohali, Punjab after constitution of the<lb/> SIT pursuant to notification with the SIT (1984 riots having been<lb/> noted as a Police Station). Through his statement under Section 164 of<lb/> the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it was stated by the<lb/> complainant that he along with his brother-in-law Avtar Singh had<lb/> come on to the road and had seen a crowd of 100-150 persons coming<lb/> from a distance who had lathis and sarias with them and when the<lb/> crowd came closer, then two cars came from the back and stopped<lb/> near the crowd. One of the said cars was white and the other was<lb/> almost red and from those cars five/six persons got down and one of<lb/> them was the respondent Mr.Sajjan Kumar, a Member of Parliament,<lb/> and the crowd collected around him.<lb/> 91. As per the statement, it was stated by the complainant to the<lb/> effect that in November, 1984, he used to live with his parents and<lb/> brothers and sisters at Delhi in House No. RZ-134-A, Gulab Bagh,<lb/> Near Nawada, New Delhi -69 and that he woke up at about 9 .00 a.m.<lb/> and after his bath at about 11.00 a.m., he came out and saw that there<lb/> was a black smoke spreading in the sky till the fire stopped and that on<lb/> going to the main road he asked the passers-by as to why there was a<lb/> black smoke then he was informed by a passer-by that riots had<lb/> broken out after the death of the then Prime Minister Smt. Indira<lb/> Gandhi and that the vehicles belonging to the Sikh residents and the<lb/> places where they reside had been got set on fire. The complainant<lb/> further stated that at the time of incident he was aged 25 years and<lb/> when he gave his statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973 to the SDJM Dara Bassi, District Mohali, he was<lb/> aged 58 years and that he went home and told his family members<lb/> about the incident. He further stated that his brother-in-law that Avtar<lb/> Singh had also come to his house in the evening he had also come to<lb/> the road and saw a crowd of 100/150 persons coming who were armed<lb/> with lathies and sarias, and that when the crowd came near him then<lb/> they also saw the two cars came from the back and stopped near the<lb/> crown. One car was white and the other car was almost red. It was<lb/> further stated through the affidavit of the complainant that from those<lb/> cars five/six persons got down, one of them being the then Member of<lb/> Parliament, Sajjan Kumar and the entire crowd collected around him.<lb/> As sated in his affidavit at that time itself a DTC bus came and<lb/> stopped near Sajjan Kumar. He further stated that from that DTC bus<lb/> 50/60 persons got down and got mixed in the crowd and that Sajjan<lb/> Kumar gave a signal to those persons and also had a conversation and<lb/> since Sajjan Kumar had given a signal with his hands pointing<lb/> towards the Gurudwara Saheb, the crowd of rioters ran towards the<lb/> Gurudwara Saheb and set it on fire and started looting from the same<lb/> and he, i.e., the complainant and his brother-in-law stood behind the<lb/> wall on the other side of the road and were watching the incident from<lb/> the side of the wall.<lb/> 92. It was further stated by the complainant in the statement that<lb/> they ran till the colony and shouted and informed the residents of the<lb/> colony that the Gurudwara Saheb had been set on fire and that after<lb/> setting the Gurudwara Saheb on fire, Sajjan Kumar, i.e., the<lb/> accused/respondent herein and his associates had sat in two cars and<lb/> the persons coming through the bus boarded the bus and the rioters<lb/> who were on foot went forward. After the rioters went, the residents of<lb/> the colony ran to the Gurudwara and started putting out the fire on the<lb/> Gurudwara and whilst they were putting out the fire, both those card,<lb/> the bus and the mob of rioters suddenly attacked them with Sarias,<lb/> dandas and stones and the residents of the colony ran towards the<lb/> colony. As per the statement of the complainant the mob of rioters<lb/> entered into the colony and his father Sohan Singh s/o Amar Singh<lb/> and mother Jaspal Kaur came into the clutches of the rioters and both<lb/> got injured. He further stated that he somehow dragged his father into<lb/> the house but he had been seriously injured with having been<lb/> repeatedly assaulted with a saria on his head and his mother was also<lb/> injured on the forehead with a brick by having been hit with a brick<lb/> but as she was within the crowd, he could not bring her into the house.<lb/> As per this statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973 of the complainant, the mob of rioters entered into<lb/> the house of Nath Singh which was behind the house of the<lb/> complainant and also set on fire trucks standing outside the house of<lb/> Nath Singh and the rioters Gurcharan Singh s/o Nath Singh aged 15 to<lb/> 16 years and put him into the burning truck in the presence of the<lb/> complainant and on seeing this, he, i.e., the complainant and his<lb/> family members i.e. his brothers, sisters, brother-in-law and his<lb/> injured father left their house open and went into the house in front of<lb/> their house and his sisters entered the house of Tilak Raj in front of<lb/> their house whereas his brother hid in a house in another lane and his<lb/> brother-in-law, injured father and he hid in an old lady&quot;s house and<lb/> that old lady locked them inside the house and herself sat inside the<lb/> temple. That old lady, as per the statement of the complainant, was a<lb/> Hindu and whilst they continued to be locked inside the house, they<lb/> could continuously hear the sound of shouting, bearing and burning<lb/> fires. As per this statement of the complainant under Section 164 of<lb/> the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, after an hour he learnt that<lb/> some Hindu brother had admitted his mother to the Rana Nursing<lb/> Home at Rajauri Garden. He further stated that he along with his<lb/> injured father and brother-in-law hid without food and water<lb/> throughout the night and the next morning at 5 a.m. that old lady<lb/> opened the lock and asked them to run away from there as the rioters<lb/> had learnt of their having been hidden in her house and she also stated<lb/> that they would kill them. As per this statement of the complainant,<lb/> Harvinder Singh, he went to the house of Tilak Raj, who resides in<lb/> front of his house and requested him to help them as his father&quot;s<lb/> condition was very bad and Tilak Raj got two bicycles arranged and<lb/> also sent a Hindu boy with them and that he made his brother-in-law<lb/> sit on one of the cycles and his brother-in-law tied his father to him<lb/> i.e. the complainant with a Pagdi inasmuch as the complainant&quot;s father<lb/> was very seriously injured and the complainant thus sat with his<lb/> father. He further stated that on the other cycle his brother-in-law and<lb/> the Hindu boy took his father to Uttam Nagar which was at a distance<lb/> of 4 to 5 km from their house but as they were crossing by the<lb/> Congress-I office at Uttam Nagar then the rioters surrounded there and<lb/> started beating them with Sarias. The complainant further stated that<lb/> his brother-in-law Avtar Singh, who was coming on the other cycle<lb/> was also surrounded by the rioters and the rioters were assaulting all<lb/> three of them and that in the meantime a sound came from the truck<lb/> &quot;Aag lagakar maar do, i.e., set on fire and kill&quot; and on hearing this he,<lb/> i.e., the complainant started running blindly and the rioters were<lb/> running behind him and he ran towards the Police Post, Uttam Nagar<lb/> and requested the police personnel that his father and his brother-in-<lb/>law were being assaulted by the rioters on the road but the police did<lb/> not help him and that he continued to cry that his father and brother-<lb/>in-law be saved, but the police personnel started abusing him, saying<lb/> that these Sikhs had killed Indira Gandhi and thus they should be dealt<lb/> with as they were being dealt. He further stated that he was bleeding<lb/> profusely as he had been assaulted with the Sarias on his head and that<lb/> four of his bones of his two arms had also got broken and that his eyes<lb/> had also been seriously injured because of the fist blows given to him<lb/> and that he had asked them that he be provided medical aid but he<lb/> was not provided any medical assistance and rather the police<lb/> personnel were spreading rumors that corpses of Hindu were coming<lb/> in trains from Punjab and after sometime they spread another rumor<lb/> that the Sikhs had put poison into the water tank.<lb/> 93. As per this statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973, the complainant Harvinder Singh, also stated that at<lb/> about 2 to 3 p.m. a senior officer whose name he learnt from his<lb/> badge, as V.K.Katna came to the police post and the complainant<lb/> requested him for medical assistance and in the meantime the Officer<lb/> received a wireless message and thus went in his jeep from the spot<lb/> and returned after two hours with a police bus containing 40/50<lb/> injured Sikh men, ladies and children and then put the complainant<lb/> and four other persons into the jeep and took them to the D.D.U<lb/> Hospital Hari Nagar, where due the lack of doctors, nurses and other<lb/> staff without any anesthesia he was given 14/15 stitches on his head<lb/> and was also treated for his eyes but there was no treatment given that<lb/> day for his broken bones. As per his statement under Section 164 of<lb/> the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 of the complainant, the<lb/> complainant requested the police in the hospital to leave him at his<lb/> friend&quot;s house at Hari Nagar but the police left him and two other<lb/> injured persons at the Uttam Nagar, Police Post and from 7 a.m. till 5<lb/> p.m., he remained at the Police Post, Uttam Nagar and that he could<lb/> see from the Police Post that shops near the road were being looted<lb/> and burnt and that the police was sitting as a silent spectator and that<lb/> he also saw some police personnel were taking out the looted articles<lb/> from the shop and brought them to the Police Post. As per the<lb/> statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973<lb/> the entire day he continued to remain hungry and thirsty and injured at<lb/> the Police post and despite his repeated requests he was given one<lb/> glass of water and on inquiries at the Police Post, he learnt that his<lb/> father and brother-in-law had been burnt alive and they were also not<lb/> handed over the dead bodies of his father and brother-in-law. It was<lb/> learnt by him subsequently that the police had burnt several dead<lb/> bodies together.<lb/> 94. As per this statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973 at about 9 p.m. the complainant and other persons at<lb/> the Police Post were taken by the complainant&quot;s friend Charanjit<lb/> Singh and his employer Sharan Singh were taken to the Fateh Nagar<lb/> Gurudwara Saheb and on the next day he was treated for his broken<lb/> bones and other injuries. Through the statement under Section 164 of<lb/> the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the complainant stated that he<lb/> would make an appeal to the Court that Sajjan Kumar (the respondent<lb/> herein) and other persons who brought the crowd had killed his father<lb/> Sohan Singh and brother-in-law Avtar Singh and had injured his<lb/> mother and he thus sought action against them and stated that the<lb/> massacre had taken place at the instigation of Sajjan Kumar i.e. the<lb/> respondent herein. He also requested through the statement under<lb/> Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 that a day-by-<lb/>day trial be given in the instant case inasmuch as 32 years had already<lb/> elapsed and he sought that he got justice during his lifetime and<lb/> sought the incarceration of the killers.&quot;<lb/> 95. Through his statement under Section 164 of the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure, 1973 dated 20.09.2016, no specific averment in<lb/> relation to the presence of the respondent at the spot of occurrence on<lb/> the date 2.11.1984 has been stated. Through his statement under<lb/> Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 dated<lb/> 24.11.2016 adverted to herein above as well, it was stated by the<lb/> complainant to the effect that Sh. Harvinder Singh, his elder sister and<lb/> her husband Avtar Singh came to his house and that he and his<lb/> brother-in-law were outside the house to the main road of Gulab Bagh<lb/> to see the situation and saw 100-125 rioters who were coming towards<lb/> his house and in the meantime two cars, one white car and another car<lb/> the colour of which he did not recall and that he did not know the<lb/> registration numbers of the those two cars which stopped near the<lb/> rioters and the crowd and 5-6 members got down from the each car<lb/> and that his brother-in-law Avtar Singh and he were watching from<lb/> the side of the wall and he saw that one of the persons who got down<lb/> from the car was a person named Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent<lb/> herein, who was known to him previously, inasmuchas had come to<lb/> his mohalla several times and as the complainant Sh. Harvinder<lb/> Singh&quot;s father also used to vote for the Congress and thus his family<lb/> members also used to vote for the Congress and so he was able to<lb/> identify Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein very well and that the<lb/> respondent herein i.e. Sajjan Kumar was standing with the rioters and<lb/> with the movements of his hands was telling them something and soon<lb/> two DTC buses came and stopped near the crowd and several persons<lb/> got down from the bus and that Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent<lb/> herein got into the crowd was identified as being the Congress leader<lb/> and on his signal and pointing out, the crowd again ran towards the<lb/> Gurudwara. It was also stated by this witness that the respondent<lb/> herein i.e. Sajjan Kumar was a leader of the area of the Congress and<lb/> at his instance and signal the rioters went inside Gurudwara and began<lb/> breaking and looting the same and after breaking and setting the<lb/> Gurudwara on fire, the rioters set the Gurudwara on fire and set its<lb/> articles on fire. It was also stated by this witness that apart from Sajjan<lb/> Kumar i.e. the respondent herein he did not recognize any other<lb/> person.<lb/> 96. Through his statement dated 23.12.2016 under Section 161 of<lb/> the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the complainant Sh. Harvinder<lb/> Singh is stated to have seen Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein,<lb/> informed the Investigating Officer and pointed out the place from<lb/> where he had seen in hiding and had also seen the Sajjan Kumar i.e.<lb/> the respondent herein coming from the car and pointing out towards<lb/> the Gurudwara and also pointed out the place where Sajjan Kumar i.e.<lb/> the respondent herein was standing with the crowd though he stated<lb/> that the area had changed since the time of the occurrence with<lb/> construction having been raised.<lb/> 97. Through his statement dated 24.11.2016 in the FIR No. 227/92<lb/> Police Station Janakpuri, one of the witnesses of the prosecution<lb/> (name withheld on the request of SIT) stated that after the<lb/> assassination of the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, riots had<lb/> commenced on 01.11.1984 at about 10.00 a.m. and they had come out<lb/> on to the road to see as to what was happening because his house was<lb/> at the main Nazafgarh Road and held that it could be seen that there<lb/> was smoke of fire at several places and in sometime itself a crowd of<lb/> 100-150 persons came shouting slogans and came towards their<lb/> mohalla and there were two DTC buses which were loaded with<lb/> people also came there and amongst that crowd at that time two cars<lb/> came and stopped near the crowd, the number of which he did not<lb/> know and from one of the cars which was of white colour and other<lb/> car the colour of which car he did not recall and the colour of the other<lb/> case from the white car 3-4 persons came down of which one of them<lb/> was Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein whom he recognized<lb/> from before, who pointed out from his hands towards the Gurudwara<lb/> to the crowd, as a consequence of which the crowd whilst shouting<lb/> slogans went towards the Gurudwara and started breaking the<lb/> Gurudwara and that that time his father was the Pradhan of the<lb/> Gurudwara and of the colony and when he reached the Gurudwara to<lb/> put out the fire then the rioters attacked his father but he somehow<lb/> escaped but the crowd followed his father to his house and attacked<lb/> them and looted their house and started attacking their house and<lb/> breaking the same and also set a truck bearing No. DLL 8770 standing<lb/> behind their house on fire and also set their scooter bearing No. DLU<lb/> 8150 on fire and that the rioters had also taken out his father Nath<lb/> Singh and him and his four brothers from the house and had beaten<lb/> them with Dandas, Lathies and Sariyas as a consequence of which<lb/> they were all injured seriously.<lb/> 98. This witness is also stated to have stated in his statement under<lb/> Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 dated<lb/> 24.11.2016 that in 1986 his father sold the house of Nawada and went<lb/> to Mohali, Punjab with his family and only his elder brother started<lb/> living in a small house with his family and that his one of his brother<lb/> died in 1993 and his father expired on 16.05.1996 and his mother<lb/> expired in 2003 and that he had looked after his brothers. He also<lb/> stated that his brother (name withheld with the request of SIT), who<lb/> had been injured in 1984 riots was still lying disabled due to the<lb/> injuries on the bed.<lb/> 99. Another witness (whose name has also been requested to be<lb/> withheld by the SIT) vide his statement dated 24.11.2016 under<lb/> Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 allegedly stated<lb/> qua the role of the respondent herein i.e. Sajjan Kumar of having<lb/> instructed the crowd on 01.11.1984 to attack on the Gurudwara by<lb/> signaling towards it. This witness in his statement under Section 161<lb/> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 dated 24.11.2016 has further<lb/> stated that apart from Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein, he<lb/> would not be able to identify any other person. He also stated that<lb/> because of his being paralyzed he had not made any complaint and<lb/> had not given his statement earlier. He also stated that he was being<lb/> looked after by his brother (name withheld at the request of the SIT).<lb/></p>

			<p>100. Through his statement under Section 161 of the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure, 1973 dated 05.09.2016 in FIR No. 264/92 Police<lb/> Station Vikaspuri, the complainant Sh. Harvinder Singh inter alia<lb/> stated to the effect that on 01.11.1984, he along with his brother-in-<lb/>law went to the Main Road, Gulab Bagh where about 100-125 a group<lb/> of rioters was seen coming and two cars one white and the other<lb/> colour of which he did not recall were seen coming and they came<lb/> near the rioters and that he does not know the registration numbers of<lb/> those cars and from each of those cars, 5-6 persons got down and he<lb/> and his brother-in-law stood behind the wall and saw Sajjan Kumar<lb/> i.e. the respondent herein getting out from the car and that he had also<lb/> come several times previously to his mohalla and to his house because<lb/> the father of the complainant Sh. Harvinder Singh always used to vote<lb/> for the Congress and thus his family always voted for the Congress<lb/> and that is why he the complainant Sh. Harvinder Singh recognized<lb/> the said Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein very well and he<lb/> came and stood near the road and with the signal of his hands said<lb/> something to the rioters and in the meantime two DTC buses came<lb/> and stopped and from the same also a large number of people got<lb/> down and Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein, the leader of the<lb/> Congress pointed out towards the Gurudwara and just as he did the<lb/> same, the group of rioters started running towards the Gurudwara and<lb/> started causing damage and set it on fire and after setting it up on fire,<lb/> started looting the same and thereafter boarded the DTC bus. It was<lb/> also stated by the complainant Sh. Harvinder Singh that apart from<lb/> Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein he did not recognize any other<lb/> rioters. Through his supplementary statement dated 09.11.2016 in FIR<lb/> No. 264/92 registered with Police Station Vikaspuri, the complainant<lb/> Sh. Harvinder Singh stated that his statement dated 20.09.2016 under<lb/> Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 made after Dera<lb/> Basti Court was correct and that the Hindi translation of the same also<lb/> was to the effect as to what he had stated in his statement under<lb/> Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.<lb/></p>

			<p>101. Through his statement in FIR No.227/1992, registered with<lb/> Police Station Janakpuri dated 23.12.2016, the complainant Sh.<lb/> Harvinder Singh also identified the places of occurrence where he had<lb/> seen Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein on the date of the alleged<lb/> commission of the offence on 01.11.1984.<lb/> 102. Through his statement dated 25.10.2016 under Section 161 of<lb/> the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the witness of the prosecution<lb/> in FIR No. 264/94 PS Vikaapuri (name withheld at the request of the<lb/> SIT) also stated to the effect that on 01.11.1984 at about 10.00 a.m.<lb/> riots had commenced after the assassination of the Prime Minister<lb/> Indira Gandhi and stated that he had seen outside his house which falls<lb/> on the main Nazafgarh Road at different places there was smoke of<lb/> fire and a crowd of 100-150 persons was coming shouting slogans<lb/> towards his mohalla and two DTC buses boarded with people also<lb/> came and at that time two cars came, one of them was of white colour<lb/> in which there were 3-4 persons, who got down, one of them being<lb/> Sajjan Kumar i.e. the Congress M.P., whom he knew from before,<lb/> who got down and went into the crowd and started talking to the<lb/> persons in the crowd and pointed out towards the Gurudwara<lb/> whereafter the crowd started shouting slogans and went towards<lb/> Gurudwara and started attacking the Gurudwara and caused damage<lb/> and set it on fire. He stated further that his father was the Pradhan of<lb/> the colony and of the Gurudwara and on reaching the Gurudwara the<lb/> crowd attacked but somehow his father escaped as a consequence of<lb/> which the crowd followed to his house and attacked at their house also<lb/> and set the truck bearing No. DLL 8770 standing behind their house<lb/> on fire and also set their scooter bearing No. DLU 8150 on fire.<lb/></p>

			<p>103. The statement of another witness of the prosecution under<lb/> Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (name withheld<lb/> at the request of the SIT) dated 25.10.2016 in the FIR No. 264/92 is<lb/> also to the effect that the respondent herein got down from the white<lb/> car on 01.11.1984 when the crowd of rioters had collected and of his<lb/> having pointed out to the Gurudwara as a consequence of which the<lb/> crowd went towards the Gurudwara and caused breakage there. This<lb/> witness also identified Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein whom<lb/> stated that he had seen him several times.<lb/></p>

			<p>104. The presence of the respondent at the time of the incident on<lb/> 2.11.1984 is not mentioned in the statement under Section 164 of the<lb/> Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 of the complainant. The witnesses<lb/> examined by the prosecution under Section 161 of the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure, 1973 also speak of the presence of the respondent<lb/> on 1.11.1984 and not on 2.11.1984. As observed by the learned ASJ-<lb/>01, Dwarka Courts all the statements have been made virtually 32<lb/> years after the incident when for the first time the respondent is named<lb/> as being the leader in question who got down from the white car and<lb/> on his instigation there were attacks made on the Gurudwara and on<lb/> Sikhs.<lb/></p>

			<p>105. In the circumstances of the case the observations of the learned<lb/> ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts that the veracity of allegations levelled<lb/> against the respondent herein can only be determined during trial<lb/> cannot be termed to be erroneous at this stage. To the same effect are<lb/> the observations made by this Court in Sajjan Kumar V. State in 43<lb/> (1991) DLT 88 wherein an affidavit dated 15.7.87 of Anwar Kaur was<lb/> taken up for consideration by the Jain Banerjee Committee appointed<lb/> on 21.2.1987 and before that she did not make any complaint before<lb/> the police from the date of the incident nor before the Justice<lb/> Ranganath Mishra Commission, taking into account the factum that<lb/> that it was contended by the investigating agency that the investigation<lb/> could commence only after six years of the incident as the witnesses<lb/> were afraid and frightened and would not come to testify and that if<lb/> the respondent herein was allowed to remain enlarged on bail, (who is<lb/> also the respondent herein to the present petition), whilst observing<lb/> that bail not jail was the basic rule unless the process of justice was<lb/> sought to be throttled by the applicant by influencing witnesses or<lb/> tampering with the evidence or by creating other trouble in the shape<lb/> of repeating offences, bail ought to be granted and anticipatory bail<lb/> was thus granted to the very same accused arrayed as the respondent<lb/> herein in the said case.<lb/> 106. During the course of the submissions made on behalf of the<lb/> SIT, it was contended that this judgment had been appealed against.<lb/> However, no orders in relation thereto have been submitted before this<lb/> Court.<lb/></p>

			<p>107. To the same effect are the observations of this court, in Sajjan<lb/> Kumar Vs. CBI in Bail application No. 306/2010 which verdict<lb/> significantly has been upheld by the Supreme Court in Crl. M.P. No.<lb/> 6021/2010 vide verdict dated 29.03.2010 i.e. in Jagdish Kaur Vs.<lb/> Sajjan Kumar and Ors. The verdict of the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court in<lb/> Bhadresh Bipinbhai Sheth Vs. State of Gujarat and Another in (2016)<lb/> SCC 152 also spells guidelines on the aspect of grant of cancellation<lb/> of anticipatory bail.<lb/></p>

			<p>108. It is essential to observe that the verdicts relied upon on behalf<lb/> of the petitioner are in facts and circumstances of cases, which are not<lb/> in pari materia with the facts and circumstances of the instant case.<lb/></p>

			<p>109. This is so inasmuchas the verdicts relied upon on behalf of the<lb/> petitioner are on facts distinguishable from the instant case as set forth<lb/> hereinbelow.<lb/></p>

			<p>110. In Adri Dharandas vs. State of West Bengal; ( 2005) 4 SCC<lb/> 303 which has been relied upon on behalf of the SIT on the ground<lb/> that there exist no reason to believe that the respondent may be<lb/> arrested and that mere fear is not belief, and that it was not sufficient<lb/> for the respondent to show that he had some sort of vague<lb/> apprehension that someone is going make an accusation against him in<lb/> pursuance of which he may be arrested, the available record speaks<lb/> eloquently in the form of the petitions Crl. M.C. 339/2017 and<lb/> Crl.M.C. 338/2017 filed by the petitioner herein seeking cancellation<lb/> of anticipatory bail granted to the respondent herein vide orders dated<lb/> 21.12.2016 of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts in Bail Appln. Nos.<lb/> 14072/2015 and 14073/2015 which had been filed on the basis of the<lb/> respondent having been named as an accused by the complainant and<lb/> other witnesses 32 years after the date of incident and thus the<lb/> contention of the respondent that he had the apprehension of his arrest<lb/> and had a reason to believe that he could be arrested cannot be<lb/> rejected.<lb/></p>

			<p>111. The verdict of the Supreme Court in Raghuvir Saran Aggarwal<lb/> v. State of U.P.; (1988) 8 SCC 617 lays down that anticipatory bail<lb/> ought not to be granted without any reason for exercise of such<lb/> jurisdiction or else every person against whom a first information<lb/> report is lodged alleging a serious crime would rush to the High Court<lb/> or the Sessions Court that the case may be considered and may seek<lb/> anticipatory bail which would render the provisions of the Criminal<lb/> Procedure in the matter of arrest, redundant. As regards the<lb/> reliance placed on this verdict which related to a case of a dowry<lb/> death, it is essential to observe that in the instant case, the impugned<lb/> orders dated 21.12.2016 of the learned ASJ-01 South West, Dwarka,<lb/> categorically set forth reasons for the grant of anticipatory bail to the<lb/> effect :<lb/> &quot;17. It is an admitted fact between the parties that<lb/> the present FIR was registered in the year 1992<lb/> on the basis of affidavit dated 09.09.1985 of<lb/> complainant Sh.Harvinder Singh sworn before<lb/> Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission. It is also<lb/> an admitted fact that alleged offence pertains to<lb/> incident dated 01.11.1984 and 02.11.1984. It is<lb/> also an admitted fact that neither complainant<lb/> Sh.Harvinder Singh nor any of the witnesses<lb/> examined by the Special Riot Cell had found any<lb/> evidence to connect the applicant with the offence<lb/> in question. It is also an admitted fact that earlier<lb/> investigation was closed as untraced and the<lb/> closure report was accepted by Ld.MM on<lb/> 27.8.94/16.02.1996. It is also an admitted fact<lb/> that from 1996 till examination of witnesses<lb/> including the complainant in the year 2016,<lb/> nothing incriminating had come against the<lb/> applicant.<lb/> 18. The deposition made by complainant<lb/> Sh.Harvinder Singh under Section 164 Cr.P.C.<lb/> statement against applicant has been made for the<lb/> first time after 32 years of the incident and in the<lb/> previous affidavit dated 09.09.1985, no such<lb/> allegations were made.<lb/> 19. Similarly, some of the witnesses (names of<lb/> witnesses withheld at the request of Ld.Addl.PP<lb/> for SIT) examined in 2016 under Section 161<lb/> Cr.P.C. were also examined during the course of<lb/> investigation in the year 1992 and at that time,<lb/> they had not identified the applicant to be the<lb/> person, who had incited the mob to burn down the<lb/> property of the Sikhs or to murder them.<lb/> 20. Some of the witnesses (names of witnesses<lb/> withheld at the request of Ld.Addl.PP for SIT),<lb/> who have been examined under Section 161<lb/> Cr.P.C. happen to be the relatives of the<lb/> witnesses, who were examined in the previous<lb/> investigation and in the previous investigation,<lb/> their relatives had not stated anything<lb/> incriminating against the present applicant.<lb/> Therefore, from where these witnesses have<lb/> derived the information regarding / the role of the<lb/> present applicant is also a matter of trial.<lb/> 21. Some of the witnesses (names of witnesses<lb/> withheld at the request of Ld.Addl.PP for SIT),<lb/> who have been examined under Section 161<lb/> Cr.P.C. in 2016 are witnesses of hear-say<lb/> evidence regarding the role of the present<lb/> applicant and their statements do not incriminate<lb/> the present applicant.<lb/> 22. Although an explanation has been given by the<lb/> complainant in his statement under Section 164<lb/> Cr.P.C. as to why he had not named the applicant<lb/> earlier but whether such explanation can be<lb/> believed or not, after 32 years, is a matter of trial.<lb/> However, some of the witnesses examined in this<lb/> case under Section 161 Cr.P.C in 2016, have not<lb/> provided any explanation as to why at the time of<lb/> their earlier examination in the year 1992, they<lb/> did not depose anything against the present<lb/> applicant. This delay of around 24 years from the<lb/> registration of the FIR do not make out a case for<lb/> custodial interrogation of the applicant when<lb/> admittedly at the time of first investigation,<lb/> nothing incriminating had come against the<lb/> present applicant. Nothing has come on record to<lb/> show that applicant, during this course of 24<lb/> years, had threatened or influenced any of the<lb/> witnesses so as to refrain any of them from<lb/> making statement against him. Further, applicant<lb/> is having deep roots in the society and thrice, he<lb/> remained as a member of the Parliament.<lb/> Therefore, chances of applicant fleeing from<lb/> justice are also quite remote.<lb/> 23. In the opinion of this court, for the purpose of<lb/> interrogation of the applicant after 32 years of the<lb/> incident, arrest of applicant is not required as<lb/> there are no allegations that anything used in the<lb/> commission of offence is to be recovered at the<lb/> instance of the applicant.<lb/> 24. The submission of the Id.counsel for the<lb/> applicant that the case, has been re-opened for<lb/> political consideration just to falsely implicate the<lb/> applicant also cannot be ignored and makes out a<lb/> ground for anticipatory bail to the applicant.<lb/> 25. The judgments relied upon by the Id.counsel<lb/> for the complainant as -well as Ld.Chief Public<lb/> Prosecutor for State delivered in Sajjan Kumar&apos;s<lb/> case (supra) are not applicable to the facts of the<lb/> present case as same pertain to framing of charge<lb/> and none of these judgments relied upon, pertain<lb/> to grant or refusal of anticipatory bail where after<lb/> a delay of 32 years, witnesses, who had not<lb/> deposed anything against applicant earlier have<lb/> turned around to depose otherwise.<lb/> 26. There can be no dispute with regard to ratio<lb/> laid down by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court of India<lb/> in the matter of Jai Prakash Singh&apos;s case (supra)<lb/> regarding the principles for grant of anticipatory<lb/> bail relied upon by the Id.counsel for SIT. In the<lb/> present case also, exceptional circumstances have<lb/> been made out for grant of anticipatory bail as<lb/> there is prima facie material to show that the<lb/> applicant has been falsely enroped in the crime in<lb/> question after 32 years of the incident and his<lb/> chance of mis-using the liberty is also non-<lb/>existent.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>112. The reliance on the verdict in Jai Prakash v. State of Bihar and<lb/> Anr.; (2012) 4 SCC 379 is thus placed inasmuch as in the said case, it<lb/> was observed that the FIR had been lodged promptly which itself was<lb/> an assurance regarding truth of the informant&quot;s version and that<lb/> undeserved and unwarranted sympathy to an accused was shown,<lb/> which is not so in the instant case that the parameters for grant of<lb/> anticipatory bail had not been applied and rather undeserving and<lb/> unwarranted sympathy had been shown to the accused and it had thus<lb/> been laid down in the facts and circumstances of that case where the<lb/> FIR has been lodged promptly within a period of two hours at the time<lb/> of the incident which had occurred at midnight as mentioned in para<lb/> 11 of the verdict relied upon.<lb/></p>

			<p>113. The verdict in Japani Sahoo vs. Chandra Sekhar Mohanty:<lb/> (2007) 7 SCC 394 is in a case which related to an incident of a threat<lb/> of the payment of a demand of Rs.5,000/-was made by a police<lb/> personnel to the respondent therein claiming that if the complainant<lb/> did not make the payment by the next morning of Rs.5000/-he would<lb/> be booked in cases like NDPS and dacoity whereafter the complainant<lb/> had silently returned home and on the next day had lodged a complaint<lb/> in question before the competent court on the advice of his lawyer and<lb/> it was held that the criminal offence is a wrong against the State and<lb/> the society even if committed against an individual and it was further<lb/> held by the said verdict that normally in serious offences, prosecution<lb/> is launched by the State and the Court of law has no power to throw<lb/> away the prosecution solely on the ground that there has been a delay<lb/> and that mere delay in approaching a court of law would not by itself<lb/> afford a ground for dismissing a case although it may be a relevant<lb/> circumstance in reaching the final verdict. In the instant case the delay<lb/> in naming the respondent is of 32 years. In the case relied upon the<lb/> offence was alleged to have been committed by the accused on 2.2.96<lb/> and the complaint was filed on 5.2.96.<lb/></p>

			<p>114. Reliance placed by the State on the verdict of the Apex Court in<lb/> Sajjan Kumar v. CBI, (2010) 9 SCC 368, vide which the appeal by<lb/> the appellant therein who is the present respondent against the order of<lb/> the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts in State Case 26/10 and appeal<lb/> against order dated 19.7.2010 of the High Court of Delhi whereby the<lb/> order of learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts framing charges under<lb/> Sections 153A/295/302/395/427/436/339/505 was upheld and the<lb/> application which had been filed for discharge by the applicant, i.e.,<lb/> the respondent herein had been declined and it had been observed to<lb/> the effect that in the said case on hand though delay may be a relevant<lb/> ground in the light of materials which were available before the Court<lb/> through CBI, without testing the same at trial the proceedings could<lb/> not be quashed merely on the ground of delay is wholly inapt. In the<lb/> instant case, the petitioner is seeking cancellation of grant of<lb/> anticipatory bail granted to the respondent herein vide orders dated<lb/> 21.12.2016 of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts.<lb/></p>

			<p>115. Reliance is placed on State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors. V. Mohd.<lb/> Sajid Hussain, Mohd. S. Hussain; (2008) 1 SCC 213 to contend that<lb/> even though the respondent may not have been named in the First<lb/> Information Report as laid down in this Court by the Apex Court it<lb/> was sufficient to observe that the FIR may not be encyclopedic and in<lb/> the said case the accused had been absconding and had not cooperated<lb/> with the Investigating Agency and there was also a mistake in relation<lb/> to the age of the prosecutrix who had been allegedly raped and she<lb/> was found to be below the age of 16 years is in facts not in pari<lb/> materia with the instant case, inasmuchas the respondent herein is not<lb/> absconding.<lb/></p>

			<p>116. In Dinesh M.N. v. State of Gujarat; ( 2008) 5 SCC 66 the order<lb/> of grant of bail was held to be vulnerable with it having been held that<lb/> the accused could not take a plea while applying for bail that a person<lb/> whom he killed was a hardened criminal and this was not a factor<lb/> which could be taken into account and irrelevant materials of a<lb/> substantial nature having swayed the trial Court by the fact that the<lb/> deceased had a shady representation and criminal antecedents while<lb/> granting bail to the accused had been taken into account, the<lb/> cancellation of anticipatory bail by the High Court of Gujarat was<lb/> upheld by the Supreme Court observing to the effect that once it was<lb/> concluded that when bail had been granted on untenable grounds, the<lb/> plea of absence of supervening circumstances had no legs to stand on<lb/> and in that case it was held that irrelevant materials had been taken<lb/> into account and relevant materials had been kept out of consideration<lb/> while granting bail inasmuch as the factum that the FIR had been<lb/> lodged by one of the co-accused to divert attention from the fake<lb/> encounter by the appellant accused, a senior police officer and other<lb/> police officer for entering into a criminal conspiracy and causing a<lb/> fake encounter of a hardened criminal and destroying the evidence<lb/> relating to the death of his wife, it was held that these material factors<lb/> had been kept out of consideration while granting bail and that even<lb/> though the re-appreciation of the evidence as done by the Court<lb/> granting bail is to be avoided, the Court dealing with an application<lb/> for cancellation of bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure, 1973 can consider whether relevant materials were taken<lb/> into consideration inasmuch as it was not known as to what extent the<lb/> irrelevant materials weighed with the Court for accepting the prayer<lb/> for bail.<lb/></p>

			<p>117. The verdict in State v. Anil Sharma (1997) 7 SCC 187 relied<lb/> upon by the State held that the apprehension of the CBI that the<lb/> respondent in that case who was the member of the legislative<lb/> assembly of the State of HP and was also a minister of HP State<lb/> Government for three years and a son of a former Union Minister for<lb/> Telecommunication and the CBI was conducting an investigation of a<lb/> case against him for an offence punishable under Section 13 (2) of the<lb/> Prevention of Corruption relating to acquiring wealth, power in excess<lb/> of his known sources of income and where according to CBI there<lb/> was clear cut evidence pointing to transfer of assets to the respondent<lb/> by his father, the contention of the CBI that the respondent&quot;s was a<lb/> clear case of corruption in high places and considering the responsible<lb/> and high offices which the respondent held and wide influence which<lb/> he could wield and the great handicap which the Investigating Officer<lb/> would be subject to while interrogating a person armed with an order<lb/> of anticipatory bail and the application having been dealt with by the<lb/> High Court as if it was considering the prayer for grant of regular bail<lb/> after the arrest, it was observed to the effect that the consideration<lb/> which should weigh with the Court while dealing with the request for<lb/> anticipatory bail need not be the same as an application to release on<lb/> bail after arrest and that the High Court ought not to have side stepped<lb/> the apprehension expressed by the CBI (that the respondent would<lb/> influence the witnesses) as one which can be made against all accused<lb/> persons in all cases and that the apprehension was quite reasonable<lb/> while considering the high position which the respondent held and the<lb/> nature of the accusation relating to the period during which he held<lb/> such office and it was observed also in the said case that in a case of<lb/> that kind effective interrogation of a suspected person was of<lb/> tremendous advantage in disinterring many useful informations and<lb/> also materials which would have been concealed and that often<lb/> interrogations in such a condition would reduce to a mere ritual if the<lb/> suspected person knew that he was well protected and insulated by a<lb/> pre-arrest bail order during the time he was interrogated. The verdict<lb/> of the High Court Madras in case titled as V.N.Sudhagaran v.<lb/> Enforcement Officer, Enforcement Directorate, Shastri Bhawan<lb/> Madras 1196 (2) MWM Cr 30 lays down that as a condition<lb/> precedent for an application under Section 438 of the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure, 1973, that there must be an existing reasonable<lb/> apprehension of arrest on an existing accusation of having already<lb/> committed a non-bailable offence prior to the point of time of filing<lb/> the application and in that case merely because another person has<lb/> been arrested, it was held that the applicant could not take it as a basis<lb/> to infer arrest and in the said case it was observed that there was no<lb/> accusation nor any reasonable apprehension of the applicant and<lb/> where in that case where only summons were issued by the<lb/> Enforcement Directorate to the applicant it was not proper for him to<lb/> presume that he was an accused and at that stage no anticipatory bail<lb/> could be granted by putting fetters and spokes in the wheels of<lb/> investigation to render nugatory and defeat the very purpose and<lb/> scope of FERA 1973, and that in that case there was no accusation or<lb/> reasonable apprehension of the applicant being arrested in the non-<lb/>bailable offence and the application was thus rejected. As already<lb/> observed herein above the factum that the petitioners seeks<lb/> cancellation of anticipatory bail of the applicant now itself is bound to<lb/> make the applicant apprehensive of arrest.<lb/></p>

			<p>118. As regards the reliance placed on behalf of the SIT on the<lb/> verdict of the High Court of Gujarat in case titled as State of Gujarat<lb/> Vs. Mayaben Surendrabhai Kodnani and Another 2010 Cri LJ<lb/> 1095, it is essential to observe that the FIRs in that case were<lb/> registered on the same day when the riots and lootings had not ceased<lb/> and it was observed by the Hon&quot;ble High Court of Gujarat in para 16<lb/> of the said judgment to the effect : -<lb/>&quot;16. It could also not be disputed that members of<lb/> the minority community were fleeing from the<lb/> scenes of the offences and taking shelter<lb/> elsewhere or in the relief camps set up for the riot<lb/> affected people. The statements or complaints<lb/> made by such victims of the riots in such<lb/> circumstances have to be read in the context of<lb/> the prevailing situation and the state of affairs in<lb/> which names of prominent persons like the<lb/> respondents were clearly alleged to have been<lb/> omitted from their statements by the investigating<lb/> officer and the complaints about such<lb/> investigation had led to filing of petitions before<lb/> the Supreme Court and ultimately the constitution<lb/> of SIT after six petitions before the Supreme Court<lb/> and ultimately the constitution of SIT after six<lb/> years. Therefore, absence of important details<lb/> about the offences or names of the respondents in<lb/> the earlier statements or complaints made before<lb/> the investigating agency or the lapse of time of six<lb/> years could not by itself make the subsequent<lb/> statements of the same witnesses contradictory or<lb/> unreliable. However, it is not that no witness has<lb/> ever implicated the respondents before the<lb/> investigation by SIT. No less than six witnesses<lb/> have mentioned the names of the respondents in<lb/> the year 2002 itself. Therefore, the argument that<lb/> the respondents are being implicated for the first<lb/> time by or through the SIT cannot be accepted at<lb/> this stage. In both the cases, there are statements<lb/> of witnesses indicating that a huge crowd armed<lb/> with weapons had gathered at the scene of the<lb/> offences when the respondents had reached and<lb/> they had incited and instigated the mob into<lb/> attacking the area populated by minority<lb/> community. The respondents were identified as<lb/> operating with the mob after coming to the spot by<lb/> particular vehicles and several victims had fallen<lb/> to the bullets of the police, while one of the<lb/> respondents was present. It is also alleged that the<lb/> respondents had offered weapon or cans of<lb/> inflammable liquid and subsequently intimidated<lb/> some of the witnesses for removal of the name of<lb/> one of the respondents presumably from the list of<lb/> persons being implicated during investigation by<lb/> the SIT. It has been clearly alleged that the names<lb/> of the respondents were not being recorded by the<lb/> investigating officer while earlier statements were<lb/> : recorded in the year 2002.&quot;<lb/> Thus it is indicated that in the said case relied upon on behalf of<lb/> the SIT that six witnesses had mentioned the name of the accused<lb/> persons at the time when the initial investigation was being conducted<lb/> and much before the SIT took over the investigation. Furthermore,<lb/> there are observations on para 7 of the said verdict that the presence of<lb/> the accused in that case was also brought forth through the records of<lb/> the mobile phone of the accused persons at the place and at the time of<lb/> the occurrence.<lb/></p>

			<p>119. Qua reliance placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict of the<lb/> Apex Court in the case titled as Pokar Ram Vs. State of Rajasthan<lb/> and Others (1985) 2 SCC 597, it is essential to observe that such<lb/> reliance was placed on behalf of the SIT on observation in para 11 of<lb/> the said verdict to the effect: -<lb/>&quot;11. The accusation against the respondent is<lb/> that he has committed an offence of murder<lb/> punishable-under Sec. 302 IPC. Surprisingly,<lb/> when anticipatory bail was granted on<lb/> September 30, 1983, there is not a whisper of it<lb/> in the order of the learned Sessions Judge,<lb/> Jodhpur. When a person is accused of a offence<lb/> of murder by the use of a fire arm, the Court has<lb/> to be careful and circumspect in entertaining an<lb/> application for anticipatory bail. Relevant<lb/> considerations are conspicuous by silence in the<lb/> order of the learned Sessions Judge. Could it be<lb/> said in this case that the accusation appears to<lb/> stem not from motives of furthering the ends of<lb/> justice but from some ulterior motive ? Could it<lb/> be said that the object being to injure and<lb/> humiliate the respondent by having him arrested<lb/> ? What prompted the learned Sessions Judge to<lb/> grant anticipatory bail left us guessing and we<lb/> arc none the wiser by the discussion in the order<lb/> of the learned Single Judge declining to<lb/> interfere&quot;<lb/> 120. It is essential however to advert to the facts of this case which<lb/> are reproduced in paras 8 &amp; 9 of the said verdict to the effect : -<lb/>&quot;8. The incident in which Bhanwaria was<lb/> injured with fire arm occurred on August 23,<lb/> 1983 in respect of which the first information<lb/> report was lodged on August 24, 1983, in which<lb/> it was in clear and unambiguous terms alleged<lb/> that the respondent was at the relevant time<lb/> armed with a gun and fired towards Bhanwaria<lb/> who suffered injuries by gun shot-The incident<lb/> occurred as stated earlier around 4.00 P. M. On<lb/> August 23, 1983 and this information is lodged<lb/> with the Police Station at a distance of 30 k.m.<lb/> from the scene of occurrence on August 24, 1983<lb/> at 11.30 a.m. Amongst others, the offence<lb/> registered was under Sec. 307 IPC i.e. attempt to<lb/> commit murder. The first information report<lb/> thus discloses use of fire arm with which the<lb/> respondent attempted to commit murder of<lb/> Bhanwaria. Surprisingly, the Investigating<lb/> Officer had not arrested him till September 29,<lb/> 1983 when he moved an application for<lb/> anticipatory bail under Sec.438 of the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure presumably after coming to<lb/> know that injured Bhanwaria has succumbed to<lb/> his injuries and the offence would one of<lb/> murder punishable under Sec. 302 IPC. This<lb/> conduct of the Investigating Officer left us<lb/> guessing. Some light is shed by some averments<lb/> from the affidavit filed in the High Court and<lb/> extracted by the learned Judge in his judgment.<lb/> It is stated that the respondent is the Sarpanch of<lb/> Vil. Danwara and is an influential person and<lb/> that his father Ranjit Singh is ex-M.L.A. and is<lb/> at present Pradhan of the Panchayat Samiti. Are<lb/> these relevant considerations for not cancelling<lb/> anticipatory bail when it appears to have been<lb/> granted by a clear misconception of the relevant<lb/> considerations governing of anticipatory bail ?<lb/> The answer is emphatically in the negative in<lb/> view of the extracted observations from the<lb/> decision of the Constitution Bench in Gurbaksh<lb/> Singh Sibbia&apos;s case.<lb/> 9. The accusation against the respondent is that<lb/> he has committed an offence of murder<lb/> punishable-under Sec. 302 IPC. Surprisingly,<lb/> when anticipatory bail was granted on<lb/> September 30, 1983, there is not a whisper of it<lb/> in the order of the learned Sessions Judge,<lb/> Jodhpur. When a person is accused of a offence<lb/> of murder by the use of a fire arm, the Court has<lb/> to be careful and circumspect in entertaining an<lb/> application for anticipatory bail. Relevant<lb/> considerations are conspicuous by silence in the<lb/> order of the learned Sessions Judge. Could it be<lb/> said in this case that the accusation appears to<lb/> stem not from motives of furthering the ends of<lb/> justice but from some ulterior motive ? Could it<lb/> be said that the object being to injure and<lb/> humiliate the respondent by having him arrested<lb/> ? What prompted the learned Sessions Judge to<lb/> grant anticipatory bail left us guessing and we<lb/> arc none the wiser by the discussion in the order<lb/> of the learned Single Judge declining to<lb/> interfere&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>121. Reliance placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict in the case<lb/> titled as Harbans Kaur And Another Vs. State of Haryana (2005) 9<lb/> SCC 195, it is essential to observe that the same is on the basis of the<lb/> evidence led and is not in facts pari materia to the instant case<lb/> inasmuchas in the instant case the investigation is still in progress.<lb/> 122. Reliance placed on behalf of the petitioner on the verdict of<lb/> Supreme Court in the case titled as Prakash Kadam and Others Vs.<lb/> Ramprasad Vishwanath Gupta and Another (2011) 6 SCC 189 is<lb/> also on facts not in pari materia to the facts in the instant case<lb/> inasmuchas in that case the appellants were policemen accused of<lb/> contract killing in Case No. 317 of 2010 then pending before the<lb/> Sessions Judge, Greater Bombay and had been charge sheeted for the<lb/> offences punishable under Section 302/34/120B, 364/34 of the Indian<lb/> Penal Code, 1860 and other minor offences and the prosecution case<lb/> was that the appellants were engaged as contract killers by a private<lb/> person to eliminate the accused. As observed vide para 20 of the said<lb/> verdict the version of the accused therein that the accused was shot<lb/> dead in a police encounter was found to be false during investigation<lb/> and it was observed vide para 25 of the said verdict that prima facie<lb/> some police officers and staff were engaged by some private persons<lb/> to kill their opponent and the police officers and the staff acted as<lb/> contact killers for them and it was observed further that if such police<lb/> officers and staff could be engaged as contract killers to finish some<lb/> person there may be very strong apprehension in the minds of the<lb/> witnesses about their own safety and if the police officers and staff<lb/> could kill a person at the behest of a third person, it cannot be ruled<lb/> out that they may kill the important witnesses or their relatives or give<lb/> threat to them at the time of trial of the case to save themselves and<lb/> that this aspect had been completely ignored by the Sessions Judge<lb/> while granting bail to the accused persons and thus it was held vide<lb/> para 26 that the High Court was perfectly justified in cancelling the<lb/> bail to the appellant accused who were police personnel and it was<lb/> their duty to uphold the law but far from performing their duty they<lb/> appeared to have operated as criminals and that the protectors had<lb/> become the predators.<lb/></p>

			<p>123. As regards the reliance placed on behalf of the SIT on the<lb/> verdict in Neeru Yadav v. State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Anr. (Supra), it<lb/> is essential to observe that the accused therein was a history-sheeter of<lb/> Police Station Kavi Nagar, District Ghaziabad with 15 cases<lb/> registered against him of which four inter alia were in relation to<lb/> offences punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860<lb/> and two cases were punishable under Sections 307 of the Indian Penal<lb/> Code, 1860 and three cases were in relation to Section 25 under the<lb/> Arms Act and it was observed by the Court that the number and<lb/> nature of crimes registered against the accused spoke voluminously<lb/> about his antecedents. Furthermore the allegations against the accused<lb/> in relation to whom the appellant therein sought cancellation of bail<lb/> were found to be not in parity to the facts against the co-accused who<lb/> was on bail and it was thus observed vide para 17 of the said verdict<lb/> to the effect:<lb/> &quot; Coming to the case at hand, it is found that<lb/> when a stand was taken that the second<lb/> respondent was a history-sheeter, it was<lb/> imperative on the part of the High Court to<lb/> scrutinize every aspect and not capriciously<lb/> record that the second respondent is entitled to<lb/> be admitted to bail on the ground of parity. It<lb/> can be stated with absolute certitude that it was<lb/> not a case of parity and, therefore, the impugned<lb/> order clearly exposes the non-application of<lb/> mind. That apart, as a matter of fact it has been<lb/> brought on record that the second respondent<lb/> has been charge-sheeted in respect of number of<lb/> other heinous offences. The High Court has<lb/> failed to take note of the same. Therefore, the<lb/> order has to pave the path of extinction, for its<lb/> approval by this Court would tantamount to<lb/> travesty of justice, and accordingly we set it<lb/> aside.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>124. It has thus to be re-emphasized as already observed herein<lb/> above that the verdicts relied upon on behalf of the petitioner herein<lb/> are in facts and circumstances of the said cases not in pari materia<lb/> with the facts and circumstances of the instant case and on the facts<lb/> sought to be put forth in the instant case as alleged are distinguishable<lb/> from those in the cases relied upon on behalf of the petitioner.<lb/></p>

			<p>125. Apart from the factum that the grounds for cancellation of bail,<lb/> i.e., an interference or attempt to interfere in the due course of<lb/> administration of justice, or attempt to evade the due course of justice<lb/> or abuse of the concession granted to the accused in any manner are<lb/> not made out against the respondent, in the facts and circumstances of<lb/> the instant case the contentions raised on behalf of the State through<lb/> the SIT, the petitioner, that the grant of anticipatory bail to the<lb/> applicant vide the impugned orders in FIR No.227/1992, under<lb/> Sections 147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436 of the Indian Penal<lb/> Code, 1860, Police Station Janakpuri and FIR No.264/1992, under<lb/> Sections 147/148/149/302/307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 Police<lb/> Station Vikaspuri was perverse by ignoring evidence on record or<lb/> taking into account irrelevant considerations cannot be accepted. This<lb/> is so inasmuch as the impugned orders dated 21.12.2016 take into<lb/> account the factum that the FIR as initially registered in both cases on<lb/> the basis of the affidavit of the complainant did not contain a whisper<lb/> of any allegation against the respondent regarding his participation in<lb/> the 1984 riots in the affidavit dated 8.9.1985 sworn before the Justice<lb/> Ranganath Mishra Commission.<lb/></p>

			<p>126. The impugned orders also take into account the factum that<lb/> neither the complainant nor any of the witnesses examined by the<lb/> Special Riot Cell had found any evidence to connect the applicant<lb/> with the offence in question in relation to incidents dated 1.11.1984<lb/> and 2.11.1984 and admittedly earlier investigations were closed as<lb/> untraced and the closure reports were accepted by the Courts of the<lb/> Metropolitan Magistrates. It was further more observed by the<lb/> impugned orders that admittedly from 1994 till examination of the<lb/> witnesses including the complainant in the year 2016 (an<lb/> reference to statements recorded under Section 161 of the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure, 1973) nothing incriminating had come against<lb/> the respondent herein and that the deposition made by the complainant<lb/> under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 had been<lb/> made for the first time after 32 years of the incident and some of the<lb/> witnesses who were examined in 2016 had also been examined in the<lb/> year 1992 and at that time had not named the respondent to be the<lb/> person who had incited the mob to burn down the properties of the<lb/> Sikhs or to murder them.<lb/> 127. Undoubtedly a submission has been made on behalf of the State<lb/> that some of the witnesses examined under Section 161 of the Code of<lb/> Criminal Procedure, 1973, where statements were recorded after re-<lb/>investigation by the SIT had been never ever been examined earlier. It<lb/> was also observed vide the impugned orders that though an<lb/> explanation had been given in the statement under Section 164 of the<lb/> Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 as to why he had not named the<lb/> respondent earlier, that as to whether such an explanation would be<lb/> believed or not after 32 years was a matter of trial. It was also<lb/> observed vide the impugned orders that some of the witnesses who<lb/> had been examined in the year 1992 had not deposed anything against<lb/> the respondent herein and that the delay of around 24 years from the<lb/> registration of the FIR did not make out a case of a custodial<lb/> interrogation of the respondent herein when admittedly at the time of<lb/> first interrogation nothing incriminating had come against the<lb/> respondent. It was also observed vide the impugned orders that there<lb/> was nothing on record to show that the respondent herein during this<lb/> course of 24 years had threatened or influenced any of the witnesses<lb/> to refrain any of them making any statement against him and that<lb/> further more the respondent had deep roots in society and had thrice<lb/> been a Member of the Parliament and chances of him fleeing from<lb/> justice were also quite remote and that there were no allegations<lb/> against the respondent that anything used in the commission of the<lb/> offence was to be recovered at the instance of the respondent.<lb/></p>

			<p>128. As observed in Sajjan Kumar v. State 43 1991 DLT 88 by this<lb/> Court the basic rule is &quot;bail not jail&quot; except where there are<lb/> circumstances suggestive of an accused fleeing from justice or<lb/> throttling the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape<lb/> of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like.<lb/></p>

			<p>129. The verdict of this Court in Sajjan Kumar V. State (Through<lb/> CBI) in Bail application No.306/2016 dated 26.10.2010 in which the<lb/> aspect of re-registration of FIR 250/1984, 347/1991, 307/.94 PS<lb/> Sultanpuri and FIR 416/84 PS Delhi Cantt. was ordered on<lb/> 24.10.2005, in which the charge sheets were submitted after the case<lb/> having been submitted untraced, in which the CBI therein had<lb/> contended that new witnesses had come forward witnessing the<lb/> incidents of arson and killing after the closure report had been filed<lb/> and duly accepted by the Metropolitan Magistrate and wherein the<lb/> accused had even been acquitted for want of evidence, it was<lb/> contended on behalf of the accused that the fresh prosecution on the<lb/> same facts having been launched and where the name of the accused<lb/> had for the first time surfaced before the Jain Banerjee Committee<lb/> which recommended registration of the case, and that some of the<lb/> witnesses who had earlier not named the accused which showed that<lb/> they had improved their version and that the witnesses had surfaced<lb/> after a lapse of 25 years, it was observed by this Court that the delay<lb/> in making the statements was required to be explained during trial and<lb/> veracity of these witnesses had to be tested when they appear in the<lb/> witness-box and it was held that in that case there was a delay of 25<lb/> years from the date of incident when the prayer of the respondent<lb/> herein seeking anticipatory bail was opposed and it was observed that<lb/> it would not be justifiable to detain the appellant in custody after a<lb/> lapse of 25 years of taking incident.<lb/></p>

			<p>130. The contention of the CBI in that case relied upon on behalf of<lb/> the respondent herein was that the accused were involved in serious<lb/> offences of arson, killing and rioting and the specific contentions<lb/> raised on behalf of the CBI were to the effect:<lb/> &quot;26…………….………….. Petitioner Sajjan<lb/> Kumar (i.e. the very same respondent herein) had<lb/> organized a mob and targeted the persons of<lb/> Sikh community; instigated the said mob to kill<lb/> and burn the houses of members of Sikh<lb/> community. The incident of arson, looting,<lb/> killing of male members of Sikh community was<lb/> perpetrated in a barbaric, inhuman and cold<lb/> blooded manner, as a consequence whereof<lb/> victims were isolated, felt insecure, threatened<lb/> and at that time had no courage to go before the<lb/> investigating agency or the court to make a<lb/> statement against the culprits. Some of the close<lb/> relatives of the deceased persons had migrated to<lb/> Punjab. They had no courage to return to Delhi,<lb/> so as to make a statement before the court or the<lb/> investigating agency. With the passage of time<lb/> they mustered up the courage and approached<lb/> the Commission and filed their affidavits. All<lb/> these years the truth was not allowed to come to<lb/> surface which shows the pervading influence<lb/> which the local administration had over the<lb/> whole matter, as petitioner Sajjan Kumar was<lb/> holding high political position. Accordingly,<lb/> delay of 25 years in this case will be of no<lb/> consequence.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>131. Undoubtedly, in the case relied upon on behalf of the<lb/> respondent, the respondent had already been acquitted in the said case<lb/> and witnesses had also been examined during trial but on re-<lb/>registration of the case during investigation some of the witnesses<lb/> who were common in the earlier FIR again made statements<lb/> implicating the respondent accused, i.e., respondent herein and it was<lb/> observed by this Court that the new witnesses would have to explain<lb/> as to why they did not come forward earlier during the trial and<lb/> though their statements could not be brushed aside as they had to<lb/> explain during trial as to why they did not depose against the accused<lb/> on earlier several occasions and that 25 years had gone by and this<lb/> delay undoubtedly tilted the balance in favour of the accused at least<lb/> for the purpose of grant of bail to them. This Court also did not<lb/> accept the contentions of the CBI in that case that the release of the<lb/> accused therein, i.e. the very same respondent to the present petition,<lb/> being enlarged on bail would hamper the fair trial and that witnesses<lb/> may not depose against the petitioner due to fear and threat was not<lb/> accepted by this Court, it having been observed vide para 30 thereof<lb/> to the effect:<lb/> &quot;30. I do not find much force in the contentions<lb/> of learned senior counsel that in case petitioners<lb/> are enlarged on bail it will hamper fair trial and<lb/> witnesses may not depose against the petitioners<lb/> due to the fear and threat. Admittedly all along<lb/> for the last 25 years petitioners have remained at<lb/> large as they were not in custody.<lb/> CBI<lb/> conducted investigation almost for about five<lb/> years. During this period, CBI did not deem it fit<lb/> to arrest any of the petitioners. In spite of<lb/> petitioners bearing at large, witnesses came<lb/> forward and made statements before the CBI.<lb/> There is no specific allegation against the<lb/> petitioners of having threatened or influenced<lb/> any of the witnesses, so as to refrain any of them<lb/> from making statement against them. Besides<lb/> this, it is evident from the facts narrated herein<lb/> above that after the unfortunate and appalling<lb/> incident that relatives of the family members of<lb/> the victims were not left alone to fend for<lb/> themselves<lb/> as<lb/> members<lb/> of<lb/> various<lb/> Commission/Committees including eminent<lb/> jurists had been visiting the affected areas and<lb/> even met the families of the victims residing in<lb/> camps and interacted, counselled, encouraged,<lb/> offered support to them right from the<lb/> beginning.<lb/></p>

			<p>31. Indeed, it is true, that offence with which<lb/> petitioners have been charged by the CBI is of<lb/> grave nature and ordinarily in such cases courts<lb/> would be slow in admitting the accused on<lb/> anticipatory bail, in the face of statements of eye<lb/> witnesses. However, in the peculiar facts and<lb/> circumstances of this case and for the reasons as<lb/> mentioned in the preceding paras hereinabove, I<lb/> am of the view that it would not be justifiable to<lb/> detain the petitioners in custody, after lapse of 25<lb/> years of incident.<lb/> 32. Accordingly, it is ordered that in the event of<lb/> their arrest, petitioners shall be released on bail,<lb/> subject to furnishing personal bond in the Sum<lb/> of Rs.50,000/-each with one surety in the like<lb/> amount to the satisfaction of Investigating<lb/> Officer/Arresting Officer/SHO.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>132. The appeal against this order to the Supreme Court of India was<lb/> declined in Crl.M.P. No.(S). 6021/2010 observing to the effect:<lb/> &quot;Heard Mr.Anil B. Divan and Mr.Ravi Shankar<lb/> Parsad, Senior Advocates appearing for the<lb/> petitioner.<lb/> Permission to file SLPs is granted.<lb/> In view of the reasons stated in the impugned<lb/> order, we are not inclined to interfere with the<lb/> same. We make it clear that the observation and<lb/> conclusion arrived by the High Court are<lb/> confined only for the disposal of the anticipatory<lb/> bail. At the time of the trial the court concerned<lb/> is free to decide the issue on the basis of the<lb/> materials placed and uninfluenced by any of the<lb/> observation made in the impugned order.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>133. The verdict of the Hon&quot;ble Supreme Court in Badresh Bipinbhai<lb/> Seth V. State of Gujarat and Anr.; (Cr.Appeal No.1134-1135/2015)<lb/> reiterates the factors and parameters delineated by the Supreme Court<lb/> in Siddharam Salingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra: (2011) 1<lb/> SCC 694 which need to be taken into consideration while dealing with<lb/> the aspect of grant or rejection of anticipatory bail as under :-<lb/>(a) The nature and gravity of the accusation and<lb/> the exact role of the accused must be properly<lb/> comprehended before arrest is made;<lb/> (b) The antecedents of the applicant including the<lb/> fact as to whether the accused has previously<lb/> undergone imprisonment on conviction by a court<lb/> in respect of any cognizable offence.<lb/> (c) The possibility of the applicant to flee from<lb/> justice;<lb/> (d) The possibility of the accused&apos;s likelihood to<lb/> repeat similar or other offences;<lb/> (e) Where the accusations have been made only<lb/> with the object of injuring or humiliating the<lb/> applicant by arresting him or her;<lb/> (f) Impact of grant of anticipatory bail<lb/> particularly in cases of large magnitude affecting<lb/> a very large number of people;<lb/> (g) The courts must evaluate the entire available<lb/> material against the accused very carefully. The<lb/> court must also clearly comprehend the exact role<lb/> of the accused in the case. The cases in which the<lb/> accused is implicated with the help of Sections 34<lb/> and 149 of the Penal Code, 1860 the court should<lb/> consider with even greater care and caution,<lb/> because over implication in the cases is a matter<lb/> of common knowledge and concern;<lb/> (h) While considering the prayer for grant of<lb/> anticipatory bail, a balance has to be struck<lb/> between two factors, namely, no prejudice should<lb/> be caused to free, fair and full investigation, and<lb/> there should be prevention of harassment,<lb/> humiliation and unjustified detention of the<lb/> accused;<lb/> (i) The court should consider reasonable<lb/> apprehension of tapering of the witness or<lb/> apprehension of threat to the complainant;<lb/> (j) Frivolity in prosecution should always be<lb/> considered and it is only the element of<lb/> genuineness that shall have to be considered in<lb/> the matter of grant of bail and in the event of<lb/> there being some doubt as to the genuineness of<lb/> the prosecution, in the normal course of events,<lb/> the accused is entitled to an order of bail.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>134. The following observations of the Apex Court in Badresh<lb/> Bipinbhai Sheth (Supra) are germane and relevant to the instant<lb/> case:<lb/> &quot;25.3 It is imperative for the courts to carefully<lb/> and with meticulous precision evaluate the facts<lb/> of the case. The discretion to grant bail must be<lb/> exercised on the basis of the available material<lb/> and the facts of the particular case. In cases<lb/> where the court is of the considered view that the<lb/> accused has joined the investigation and he is<lb/> fully cooperating with the investigating agency<lb/> and is not likely to abscond, in that event,<lb/> custodial interrogation should be avoided. A great<lb/> ignominy, humiliation and disgrace is attached to<lb/> arrest. Arrest leads to many serious consequences<lb/> not only for the accused but for the entire family<lb/> and at times for the entire community. Most<lb/> people do not make any distinction between arrest<lb/> at a pre-conviction stage or post-conviction stage.<lb/> 25.4 There is no justification for reading<lb/> into Section 438 CrPC the limitations mentioned<lb/> in Section 437 CrPC. The plentitude of Section<lb/> 438 must be given its full play. There is no<lb/> requirement that the accused must make out a<lb/> &quot;special case&quot; for the exercise of the power to<lb/> grant anticipatory bail. This virtually, reduces the<lb/> salutary power conferred by Section 438 CrPC to<lb/> a dead letter. A person seeking anticipatory bail is<lb/> still a free man entitled to the presumption of<lb/> innocence. He is willing to submit to restraints<lb/> and conditions on his freedom, by the acceptance<lb/> of conditions which the court may deem fit to<lb/> impose, in consideration of the assurance that if<lb/> arrested, he shall be enlarged on bail.<lb/> 25.5<lb/> The proper course of action on an<lb/> application for anticipatory bail ought to be that<lb/> after evaluating the averments and accusations<lb/> available on the record if the court is inclined to<lb/> grant anticipatory bail then an interim bail be<lb/> granted and notice be issued to the Public<lb/> Prosecutor. After hearing the Public Prosecutor<lb/> the court may either reject the anticipatory bail<lb/> application or confirm the initial order of<lb/> granting bail. The court would certainly be<lb/> entitled to impose conditions for the grant of<lb/> anticipatory bail. The Public Prosecutor or the<lb/> complainant would be at liberty to move the same<lb/> court for cancellation or modifying the conditions<lb/> of anticipatory bail at any time if liberty granted<lb/> by the court is misused. The anticipatory bail<lb/> granted by the court should ordinarily be<lb/> continued till the trial of the case.<lb/> 25.6<lb/> It is a settled legal position that the court<lb/> which grants the bail also has the power to cancel<lb/> it. The discretion of grant or cancellation of bail<lb/> can be exercised either at the instance of the<lb/> accused, the Public Prosecutor or the<lb/> complainant, on finding new material or<lb/> circumstances at any point of time.<lb/> 25.7……………………………………………………<lb/> …………………………………………………………<lb/> ………………………………………………………….<lb/> 25.8 Discretion vested in the court in all matters<lb/> should be exercised with care and circumspection<lb/> depending upon the facts and circumstances<lb/> justifying its exercise. Similarly, the discretion<lb/> vested with the court under Section 438 CrPC<lb/> should also be exercised with caution and<lb/> prudence. It is unnecessary to travel beyond it and<lb/> subject the wide power and discretion conferred<lb/> by the legislature to a rigorous code of self-<lb/>imposed limitations.&quot;<lb/> CONCLUSION<lb/> 135. The available records indicate that pursuant to the impugned<lb/> orders the respondent has made himself available for investigation and<lb/> it has been submitted on his behalf that he shall continue to do so.<lb/></p>

			<p>136. On a consideration of the totality of the circumstances put forth<lb/> it is held that presently, there are no grounds made out by the<lb/> petitioner for cancellation of anticipatory bail granted vide orders<lb/> dated 21.12.2016 in Bail Appln. 14072/2016 in relation to FIR 227/92<lb/> Police Station Janakpuri and Bail Appln. 14073/2016 in relation to<lb/> FIR No.262/92 Police Station Vikaspuri granted by the ASJ-01,<lb/> Dwarka Courts, New Delhi. The prayer made by the petitioner to that<lb/> extent is disallowed.<lb/></p>

			<p>137. However, the respondent shall not ask for a questionnaire from<lb/> the SIT to answer to its queries during investigation, subject to<lb/> protections enshrined under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India.<lb/> Furthermore, the respondent shall comply with all conditions imposed<lb/> on him vide the impugned orders dated 21.12.2016 at the time of the<lb/> grant of the anticipatory bail in FIR No.227/1992 Police Station<lb/> Janakpuri and FIR No.264/1992 Police Station Vikaspuri.<lb/></p>

			<p>138. A prayer is made by the petitioner seeking expunction of<lb/> observations made in para 24 and 26 of the impugned orders dated<lb/> 21.12.2016 which paragraphs are identical in both the impugned<lb/> which paragraphs 24 and 26 read to the effect:<lb/> &quot;24.<lb/> The submission of the ld.Counsel for<lb/> the applicant that the case has been re-opened<lb/> for political consideration just to falsely<lb/> implicate the applicant also cannot be ignored<lb/> and makes out a ground for anticipatory bail to<lb/> the applicant.<lb/></p>

			<p>25.<lb/> ……….<lb/></p>

			<p>26.<lb/> There can be no dispute with regard to ratio laid<lb/> down by the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court of India in the matter<lb/> of Jai Prakash Singh&apos;s case (Supra) regarding the<lb/> principles for grant of anticipatory bail relied upon by the<lb/> ld.cousnel for SIT. In the present case also, exceptional<lb/> circumstances have been made out for grant of<lb/> anticipatory bail as there is prima facie material to show<lb/> that the applicant has been falsely enroped in the crime in<lb/> question after 32 years of the incident and his chance of<lb/> mis-using the liberty is also non-existent,<lb/></p>

			<p>139. That the High Court can in the exercise of its inherent<lb/> jurisdiction may expunge remarks made by it or by the Court over<lb/> which it exercises supervisory, appellate and revisional jurisdiction, if<lb/> it be necessary to do so to prevent abuse of the process of the Court or<lb/> otherwise to secure the ends of justice is laid down by the Hon&quot;ble<lb/> Supreme Court in its verdict dated 15.3.1963 in the The State of Uttar<lb/> Pradesh v. Mohammad Naim;, AIR 1964 SC 703 which also lays<lb/> down that this jurisdiction is of an exceptional nature and has to be<lb/> exercised in exceptional cases only. It has also been observed by the<lb/> Apex Court in its verdict that :<lb/> &quot;if there is one principle of cardinal importance in the<lb/> administration of justice, it is this: the proper freedom and<lb/> independence of judges and Magistrates must be maintained and<lb/> they must be allowed to perform their functions freely and fearlessly<lb/> and without undue interference by anybody, even by this court. At<lb/> the same time it is equally necessary that in expressing their<lb/> opinions judges and Magistrates must be guided by considerations<lb/> of justice, fair play and restraint. It is not infrequent that sweeping<lb/> generalizations defeat the very purpose for which they are made.<lb/> It has been judicially recognized that in the matter of making<lb/> disparaging remarks against persons or authorities whose conduct<lb/> comes into consideration before courts of law in cases to be decided<lb/> by them, it is relevant to consider<lb/> (a) whether the party whose conduct is in question is before the<lb/> court or has an opportunity of explaining or defending himself; (b)<lb/> whether there is evidence on record bearing on that conduct<lb/> justifying the remarks; and (c) whether it is necessary for the<lb/> decision of the case, as an integral part thereof, to animadvert on<lb/> that conduct. It has also been recognised that judicial<lb/> pronouncements must be judicial in nature, and should not<lb/> normally depart from sobriety, moderation and reserve.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>140. The ratio of these observations were referred to in<lb/> R.K.Laxmanan v. A.K. Srinivasan and Anr.; [1976] 1 S.C.R. 204 and<lb/> in the verdict of Apex Court in Niranjan Patnaik v. Shashibhusan<lb/> Kar and Anr.; AIR 1986 SC 819, wherein it was observed vide<lb/> paragraph 24 to the effect:<lb/> &quot;It is, therefore, settled law that harsh or<lb/> disparaging remarks are not to be made against<lb/> persons and authorities whose conduct comes<lb/> into consideration before courts of law unless it<lb/> is really necessary for the decision of the case, as<lb/> an integral part thereof to animadvert on that<lb/> conduct. We hold that the adverse remarks made<lb/> against the appellant were neither justified nor<lb/> called for.&quot;,<lb/> whilst also adverting to the observations in Panchanan Banerji v.<lb/> Upendra Nath Bhattacharji, A.I.R. 1927 Allahabad 193 Sulaiman, J.<lb/> held as follows :<lb/> &quot;The High Court, as the supreme court of<lb/> revision, must be deemed to have power to see<lb/> that Courts below do not unjustly and without<lb/> any lawful excuse take away the character of a<lb/> party or of a witness or of a counsel before it.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>141. The verdict of the Supreme Court in Abani Kami Ray v. State<lb/> of Orissa and Ors.; 1995(6) SCALE 41 also observes to the effect:<lb/> &quot;What we have said above is nothing new and is<lb/> only a reiteration of the established norms of<lb/> judicial propriety and restraint expected from<lb/> everyone discharging judicial functions. Use of<lb/> intemperate language or making disparaging<lb/> remarks against any one unless that be the<lb/> requirement for deciding the case, is inconsistent<lb/> with judicial behaviours. Written words in<lb/> judicial orders for permanent record which<lb/> make it even more necessary to practice self-<lb/>restraint in exercise of judicial power while<lb/> making written orders. It is helpful to recall this<lb/> facet to remind ourselves and avoid pitfalls<lb/> arising even from provocation.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>142. As regards the observations in para 26 of the impugned orders,<lb/> it is essential to observe that the observations to the effect:<lb/> &quot;In the present case also, exceptional<lb/> circumstances have been made out for grant of<lb/> anticipatory bail as there is prima facie material<lb/> to show that the applicant has been falsely<lb/> enroped in the crime in question after 32 years<lb/> of the incident and his chance of mis-using the<lb/> liberty is also non-existent.&quot;<lb/> have essentially to be expunged as without completion of<lb/> investigation, it could not have been concluded by the learned ASJ-01,<lb/> Dwarka Courts that there was prima facie material to show that the<lb/> applicant, i.e., the respondent to the present petitioner, has been<lb/> falsely enroped in the crime in question after 32 years of the incident<lb/> and his chance of misusing the liberty was also non-existent. This is<lb/> so inasmuch as the recommendations for the re-investigation in the<lb/> instant cases was on the basis of the recommendations of the Justice<lb/> G.P.Mathur Committee report whereafter vide order dated 12.2.2015<lb/> the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs had constituted a<lb/> Special Investigation for investigating/re-investigating the cases of the<lb/> 1984 riots and to take all such measures under the Law for a thorough<lb/> investigation of the criminal cases and to file the charge sheet against<lb/> the accused in the proper Court where after investigation sufficient<lb/> evidence was found available. The SIT was constituted by the<lb/> Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India vide No. 13018/13/-<lb/>Delhi-I (NC) dated 12.02.2015 for re-investigation of the communal<lb/> cases which were filed in the NCT of Delhi in connection with the<lb/> 1984 riots and investigation in these cases was taken up thereafter by<lb/> the SIT (1984 riots) a notified police station having jurisdiction over<lb/> the whole of the NCT of Delhi by the Lt. Governor of Delhi vide<lb/> GNCT Delhi Notification -Notification No. 6/13/2015-2129 to 2131<lb/> dated 09.07.2015. In these circumstances, the observations in para 26<lb/> of the impugned orders to the effect:<lb/> &quot;In the present case also, exceptional<lb/> circumstances have been made out for grant of<lb/> anticipatory bail as there is prima facie material<lb/> to show that the applicant has been falsely<lb/> enroped in the crime in question after 32 years<lb/> of the incident and his chance of mis-using the<lb/> liberty is also non-existent.&quot;<lb/> are expunged.<lb/></p>

			<p>143. In para 24 of the impugned orders also, which states to the<lb/> effect i.e. the submission of the ld. Counsel for the applicant that the<lb/> case has been re-opened for political consideration just to falsely<lb/> implicate the applicant also cannot be ignored and makes out a ground<lb/> for anticipatory bail to the applicant, which accepts the contention of<lb/> the respondent herein that the cases have been re-opened for political<lb/> consideration just to falsely implicate him and that this fact cannot be<lb/> ignored and makes out a case of grant of bail, have essentially to be<lb/> expunged, and are accordingly expunged as the learned Trial Court<lb/> could not have pre-judged the issues involved.<lb/></p>

			<p>144. The petitions CRL.M.C. 338/2017 and CRL.M.C. 339/2017 are<lb/> disposed of accordingly. The copies of the statements under Section<lb/> 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 filed by the State during<lb/> the course of submissions made are directed to be placed in a sealed<lb/> cover as the State has requested for withholding the identities of the<lb/> witnesses examined other than the complainant. The Case Diary<lb/> submitted by the SIT on 12.12.2017 is hereby directed to be returned<lb/> to the Investigating Agency, the SIT.<lb/></p>
