passed by the Commissioner, Employees" Compensation whereby 

compensation of Rs.10,69,008/-along with interest @ 12% per annum 

has been awarded to respondent no.1.

working as labourers on the construction site, along with 12-13 other 

labourers. According to respondent no.1, the contractor Gulab Singh 

(respondent no.2) instructed respondent no.1 to climb the wall of the 

third floor and club the grease of the lift with a cord from the bamboo 

whereupon respondent no.1 and another labourer told the contractor 

that the wall was weak and wet and would fall down. On the 

insistence of the contractor Gulab Singh, respondent no.1 climbed the 

wall whereupon wall broke and respondent no.1 fell down and 

suffered grievous injuries namely compression fracture of L1 

vertebrae and olecranon fracture of the left elbow along with tendon 

deformity in both lower legs. Respondent no.1 was admitted to Hindu 

Rao Hospital. The injuries suffered by respondent no.1 resulted in

age of 21 years, wages of Rs.10,500/-per month @ Rs.350/-per day 

and 100% permanent disability.

FAO 345/2016 

Page 3 of 72 

stilt parking and a four storey building to respondent No.2 vide 

agreement for construction dated 10 th August, 2011 and, therefore, the

the parties which was dismissed by the Commissioner vide order dated 

2 nd May, 2013.

however, admitted having taken respondent no.1 to the hospital where 

he spent Rs.85,000/-on the treatment of respondent no.1. Respondent

respondent no.2. The Commissioner took the upper-wage limit of 

Rs.8,000/-per month, respondent no.1"s age of 21 years at the time of 

the accident and the factor of 222.71. The permanent disability of 

respondent no.1 was assessed by the Medical Board as 80% relating to 

both limbs due to post-traumatic paraplegia. However, considering 

that respondent no.1 was unable to do any physical work, the 

Commissioner took the loss of earning capacity as 100%. The

was entitled to compensation of Rs.10,69,008/-along with interest @ 

12% per annum. The Commissioner held the appellant liable to pay 

compensation to respondent No.1. The Commissioner gave liberty to

10. Learned counsel for the appellant urged at the time of the 

hearing that respondent no.1 was employed by respondent no.2 who 

alone was liable to pay the compensation to the petitioner. Reference 

was made to the construction agreement dated 10 th August, 2011 

between appellant and respondent no.2 under which respondent no.2 

was responsible for the accident during construction. It was further 

submitted that respondent no.2 had appointed a sub-contractor, Rahil 

who in turn had employed respondent no.1. It was further submitted 

that the appellant cannot be held liable to pay the compensation under 

Section 12 of the Employees" Compensation Act because the 

construction of the residential house was not part of his trade or 

business. The appellant disputed the income of respondent no.1 taken 

by the Commissioner, Employees" Compensation. The appellant 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 7 of 72 

further disputed the permanent disability of 80% assessed by the 

Medical Board and the loss of earning capacity of 100% assessed by 

the Commissioner. Reliance was placed on Bharat Earth Movers Ltd. 

v. Bhagyamma, 1975 A.C.J. 113, Dr. B. Radhakrishna v. 

Gouramma, 2000 (85) FLR 388, Lakshminarayana Shetty v.

11. Learned counsel for respondent no.1 urged at the time of the 

hearing that respondent no.1 was an "employee" within the meaning of 

Section 2(1)(dd) of the Employees" Compensation Act. It was 

submitted that the definition of "workman‖ in Section 2(1) (n) of the 

Workmen"s Compensation Act was amended in the year 2000. It was 

submitted that Section 2(1) (n) of the Workmen"s Compensation Act, 

1923 was amended by Workmen"s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 

2000 with effect from 8 th December, 2000 whereby the words "other 

than a person whose employment is of a casual nature and who is 

employed otherwise than for the purposes of the employer's trade or 

business" in the definition of ‗workman' in Section 2(1) (n) were 

omitted. The effect of the omission of words "other than a person 

whose employment is of a casual nature and who is employed 

otherwise than for the purposes of the employer's trade or business" 

in the definition of workman in Section 2(1)(n) by the amendment in 

2000 is that a person whose employment is of a casual nature and is 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 8 of 72 

employed other than for the purposes of the employer"s trade or 

business, would be covered within the meaning of -employee‖ as 

defined in Section 2(1)(dd) of the Employees Compensation Act and 

entitled to compensation against the principal under section 12 of the 

Employees Compensation Act. Reliance was placed on Govind 

Goenka v. Dayawati, 2013 ACJ 1897 in which this Court held that 

after the amendment, the workman whose employment is of casual 

nature and who is employed otherwise than for the purpose of 

employer's trade or business, would also be covered within the 

definition of "workman‖. Reliance was also placed on Public Works 

Department v. Commissioner, Workmen Compensation, 1981 

Lab.I.C. 493 in which Division Bench of Jammu and Kashmir High 

Court held that the word "business" in Section 12 has to be given an 

extended meaning, so as to include even an activity which engages 

time, attention or labour as a principal serious concern or interest of an 

individual without an element of profit in it. The Response of 

respondent no.1 to the judgments relied upon by the appellant is as 

under:-

11.1. In Bharat Earth Movers Ltd. v. Bhagyamma (supra) relied 

upon by the appellant, the Karnataka High Court exonerated the 

principal holding that the construction of the building was not 

ordinarily a part of trade or business of the appellant who was engaged 

in the business of manufacture of earth moving machinery. This 

judgment does not help the appellant as it relates to an accident in 

1969 i.e. prior to the Workmen"s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 

2000. 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 9 of 72 

11.2. In Dr. B. Radhakrishna v. Gouramma (supra) relied upon by 

the appellant, the Karnataka High Court held that a person 

constructing a residential building cannot be held liable unless it is 

shown that he had given a contract and he was the principal employer. 

This judgment does not help the appellant as it relates to an accident in 

1990 i.e. prior to the Workmen"s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 

2000. 

11.3. Lakshminarayana Shetty v. Shantha (supra) also relates to 

case prior to Workmen"s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2000 by 

which the words "other than a person whose employment was of 

casual nature" were omitted. 

11.4. In Ajay Singh Lal v. Somwati (supra), the owner of a 

residential house was exonerated from the liability under Section 12 of 

the Act on the ground that the construction work was ordinarily not 

part of the ‗trade or business' of the owner. This judgement also 

relates to an accident prior to Workmen"s Compensation 

(Amendment) Act, 2000. 

11.5. All the aforesaid four judgments relied upon by the appellant 

relates to the accidents prior to the Workmen"s Compensation 

(Amendment) Act, 2000 whereas the present case relates to an 

accident after the 2000 amendment, which came into force on 8 th 

December, 2000. Workmen"s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2000 

deleted the words ‗trade or business' from the definition of the word 

‗workman'. In Govind Goenka v. Dayawati (supra), this court held 

that the effect of omission of -trade or business‖ from the definition 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 10 of 72 

of -workman‖ meant that the owner shall be liable even in respect of 

the work other than his trade or business. 

11.6. Bharat Earth Movers Ltd. v. Bhagyamma (supra), Dr. B. 

Radhakrishna v. Gouramma (supra), Ajay Singh Lal v. Somwati 

(supra) and Lakshminarayana Shetty v. Shantha (supra) did not 

consider the interpretation of the word -business‖ in Section 12. The 

word ‗business' in Section 12 has been interpreted in Payyannur 

Educational Society v. Narayani (supra), Public Works Department 

v. Commissioner, Workmen Compensation (supra), Bala Mallamma 

v. Registrar, Osmania University (supra), Govind Goenka v. 

Dayawati (supra), Raj Pal Saini v. Kamla (supra) to include an 

activity which engages time, attention and labour. 

11.7. In Om Parkash Batish v. Ranjit (supra), the Supreme Court 

dealt with the question as to whether a casual employee would be a 

-workman‖ within the meaning of Section 2(n) of the Workmen"s 

Compensation Act, 1923 in respect of an accident dated 30 th June, 

1996. The Supreme Court held that the person, whose employment 

was of casual nature, was specifically excluded in the definition of 

workman under Section 2(n) of the Workmen"s Compensation Act, 

1923. The Supreme Court further held that the words "other than a 

person whose employment was of casual nature‖ were omitted by an 

amendment in 2000 but the amendment would not apply to an 

accident occurred prior to the date on which amendment came into 

force. The Supreme Court clearly recorded in para 22 of the judgment 

that they were considering the statutory provision prior to the 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 11 of 72 

amendment of 2000 by which the words "other than a person whose 

employment was of casual nature" were omitted. 

11.8. In Management, Sirishad Construction (P) v. C.P. Ravinder 

(supra), the employee suffered hearing loss of 20% as per the medical 

certificate issued by a doctor. The Commissioner, Employees" 

Compensation held the loss of earning capacity to be 70%. The 

Andhra Pradesh High Court set aside the order and remanded back the 

matter to the Commissioner. This judgement does not help the 

appellant as the claimant in that case was not examined by the Medical 

Board of a Government Hospital whereas in the present case, the 

Commissioner, Employees" Compensation directed the Medical 

Superintendent of Aruna Asif Ali Hospital, Delhi on 21 st February, 

2013 to examine respondent No.1 and certify his disability in 

pursuance to which the Medical Board examined the injured-claimant 

and issued the disability certificate dated 12 th April, 2013. 

11.9. In Kolhan Samvedak Sangh v. State of Jharkhand (supra), this 

Court held the contractor liable to pay the cess and dismissed the writ 

petition of the contractor for seeking refund of 1% cess deducted by 

the Rural Works Department. This judgment is not relevant with 

respect to the liability of an owner of a residential house to pay the 

compensation under Section 12 in respect of the death/injury to the 

employee employed through the contractor. 

12. Vide order dated 9 th January, 2017, Mr. Sanjoy Ghose, learned 

Additional Standing Counsel for Govt. of NCT of Delhi was directed 

place on record the safety requirements for construction workers and 

the legal position with respect to the responsibilities for failure to 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 12 of 72 

comply with the legal norms and standards. Learned Additional 

Standing Counsel was also directed to give suggestions with respect to 

the responsibility of the owners of the building who carry out 

construction without any safety measures for building workers. 

13. Mr. Sanjoy Ghose submitted a note with respect to the various 

statutes applicable to the construction workers and suggestions for 

ensuring the safety of the construction workers. It was submitted that 

the definition of "workman‖ in Section 2 (1) (n) of the Workmen"s 

Compensation Act was amended in the year 2000 to include the 

workers whose appointment were of casual nature and who were 

employed otherwise for the purpose of employers -trade or business‖. 

It was submitted that the rules of purposive construction, liberal 

interpretation and cessante ratione legis, cessat et ipsa lex would 

apply to interpret the amendment of Section 2 (1) (n). Reliance was 

placed on Workmen of American Express v. Management of 

American Express, AIR 1986 SC 458, Union of India v. 

Prabhakaran Vijaya Kumar, (2008) 9 SCC 527, Kunal Singh v. 

Union of India, (2003) 4 SCC 524, B.D. Shetty v. CEAT Ltd., (2002) 

1 SCC 193, Transport Corporation of India v. ESI Corporation, 

(2000) 1 SCC 332, Regional P.F. Commissioner v. Hooghly Mills 

Co. Ltd., (2012) 1 SCR 363 and H.H. Shri Swamiji Shri Admar Mutt 

Etc. v. The Commissioner, Hindu Religious & Charitable 

Endowments Department, (1980) 1 SCR 368. Mr. Sanjoy Ghose also 

submitted a note on the meaning of -trade or business‖ in Section 12 

and the legal effect of the omission of words "trade or business‖ from 

the definition of "employee" in Section 2(1)(dd) of the Employees" 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 13 of 72 

Compensation Act on Section 12 of the Employees" Compensation 

Act. It was submitted that the word "business‖ in Section 12 has been 

interpreted by the Division Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court in 

Balla Mallamma v. Registrar, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 2001 

(2) T.A.C. 182 (AP) 11 and Govind Goenka v. Dayawati (supra), in 

which this Court held that the word -business‖ has to be given 

extended meaning to include an activity that engages time, attention or 

labour. 

14. During the course of the hearing dated 31 st July, 2017, this 

Court considered the applicability of Building and Other Construction 

Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 

1996 which applies to residential buildings in which more than 10 

workers are employed on any day during preceding 12 months and the 

total cost of the construction is more than Rs.10 lakh. The appellant 

admitted that he spent more than Rs.10 lakh in the construction of the 

building but disputed the applicability of the Act on the ground that 

the building workers employed by the contractor never exceeded 10. 

The relevant portion of the order dated 31 st July, 2017 is reproduced 

hereunder: 

-1. 
Arguments heard with respect to the applicability of 
Building and Other Construction Workers' (Regulation of 
Employment and Conditions of Service) Act,1996 to residential 
buildings in which more than 10 workers are employed on any 
day during 12 months and the cost of the building is more than 
Rs.10,00,000/-and scope of Section 45(2) which imposes the 
responsibility of payment of the compensation under the 
Employee's Compensation Act on the owner as defined in 
Section 2(i), if the contractor fails to make the payment of 
compensation in respect of the building workers. 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 14 of 72 

2. 
Mr. Harvinder Singh, leaned counsel for the appellant 
admits that the appellant spent more than Rs.10,00,000/-in 
construction of the building but the building workers employed 
by the contractor never exceeded 10. 
3. 
At this stage, this Court considered necessary to examine 
the appellant on oath. The appellant has been partly examined 
to ascertain the cost of construction and the number of workers 
employed in the construction of the building.‖ 
(Emphasis supplied) 
15. On 31 st July, 2017, this Court examined the appellant under 

Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act when the appellant deposed 

on oath that only 4-5 persons worked on the site during construction 

The statement of the appellant recorded by this Court on 31 st July, 

2017 is reproduced hereunder: 

-Statement of Brijesh Kumar Verma, S/o late Sh. Tirath Verma, 
R/o. BU-48, Pitampura, Delhi. 
On SA 
I awarded the contract for construction of 
residential house at property No.BU-48, 
Pitampura, New Delhi in September, 2011 to 
respondent No.2. The construction of the building 
was completed in January, 2013. I incurred cost of 
Rs.40,00,000/-
to 
Rs.45,00,000/-
in 
the 
construction of this building. I paid approximately 
Rs.5,50,000/-to the contractor Gulab Singh. I 
visited the property approximately about 25-30 
times during the course of the construction. 
Whenever I visited the property, only 4-5 persons 
(1-2 mistari and 2-3 workers) were doing the 
construction work.‖ 

16. Respondent no.1, in his cross-examination dated 10 th December, 

2014, had stated that more than 30 workers were working on the site 

and 12-13 labourers were present on the date of accident. Relevant 

portion of the cross-examination of respondent no.1 is reproduced 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 15 of 72 

hereunder: 

-It is correct that I was daily wage labourer. My father is 
also a daily wage labourer. It is correct that I was part of 
labours who were in supposed to put linter in BU-48, 
Pitam pura, delhi and I was called my Md. Rahil as well 
as Sh. Gulab Singh. 30 more workers were working with 
Mohd. Rahil…… 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
………On that day i.e. 06.03.2012, I was working on the 
3rd floor of the premises. It is incorrect that I was 
specifically called for putting up of linter in the said 
premises and I did not do any other work……12-13 other 
labourers were present on the date of accident‖ 

17. On 11 th August, 2017, this Court heard the arguments on the 

applicability of BOCW Act to the present case. It was submitted on 

behalf of the appellant that the appellant was the owner of the building 

but he was not an employer as defined in Section 2(1) (i) of BOCW 

Act. It was further submitted that respondent no.2 (contractor) was 

the employer for the purpose of Section 2(1) (i) of BOCW Act. It was 

further submitted that the owner of the building can be held liable only 

when the owner himself carries on the construction activity on his 

premises but when the construction is carried out through the 

contractor, the contractor will be deemed to be the owner. It was 

further submitted that the appellant was not liable to pay compensation 

under Section 45 of the BOCW Act. It was further submitted that the 

liability, if at all, will arise if the contractor fails to make the payment. 

18. The submissions of respondent no.1 with respect to the BOCW 

Act are that the Act applies to every establishment where 10 or more 

building workers were employed in the building or other construction 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 16 of 72 

work; -building or other construction work‖ has been defined in 

Section 2(1)(d) of the BOCW Act; the term "employer‖ has been 

defined in Section 2(1)(i) of the BOCW Act which defines employer 

to mean owner and includes the contractor in relation to an 

establishment; -establishment‖ has been defined in Section 2(1)(j) 

which only excludes the construction work of the residential house by 

the owner himself where the cost of construction is less than Rs.10 

lakh; and Section 45 imposes the liability of payment of compensation 

on the employer as defined in Section 2(1)(i) . It was submitted that 

the appellant was the employer and clearly liable to pay the 

compensation under Section 45 of the BOCW Act as the cost of 

construction was more than Rs.10 lakh and more than 10 employees 

were employed in the construction work. 

19. Mr. Sanjoy Ghose, learned Additional Standing Counsel for 

GNCTD urged at the time of the hearing that BOCW Act applies to 

private construction of residential building where the cost of such 

construction is more than Rs.10 lakh and more than 10 building 

workers had been employed on any day in the preceding 12 months. 

The -employer‖ defined in Section 2(1) (i) of BOCW Act specifically 

includes the owner. Section 58 of the BOCW Act clearly provides 

that the provisions of Employee"s Compensation Act shall apply to the 

building workers. Section 45 of the BOCW Act makes the contractor 

and employer liable to pay the compensation to the building worker. 

The appellant, being the owner of the building, is an -employer‖ 

within the meaning of Section 2(1) (i) and is liable to pay the 

compensation under Section 45 of the BOCW Act. 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 17 of 72 

20. Liability of the principal under Section 12 of the Employee's 
Compensation Act 

Section 12 of the Employee"s Compensation Act imposes the liability 

of payment of compensation on the principal with right to recover the 

same from the contractor in respect of work being carried out by the 

contractor. Section 12 of the Employee"s Compensation Act is 

reproduced hereunder: 

-Section 12 -Contracting -
(1) Where any person (hereinafter in this section referred to as the 
principal) in the course of or for the purposes of his trade or 
business contracts with any other person (hereinafter in this 
section referred to as the contractor) for the execution by or under 
the contractor of the whole or any part of any work which is 
ordinarily part of the trade or business of the principal, the 
principal shall be liable to pay to any employee employed in the 
execution of the work any compensation which he would have been 
liable to pay if that employee had been immediately employed by 
him; and where compensation is claimed from the principal, this 
Act shall apply as if references to the principal were substituted for 
references to the employer except that the amount of compensation 
shall be calculated with reference to the wages of the employee 
under the employer by whom he is immediately employed. 
(2) Where the principal is liable to pay compensation under this 
section, he shall be entitled to be indemnified by the contractor, or 
any other person from whom the employee could have recovered 
compensation and where a contractor who is himself a principal is 
liable to pay compensation or to indemnify a principal under this 
section he shall be entitled to be indemnified by any person 
standing to him in the relation of a contractor from whom 
the employee could have recovered compensation and all questions 
as to the right to and the amount of any such indemnity shall, in 
default of agreement, be settled by the Commissioner. 
(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing an 
employee from recovering compensation from the contractor 
instead of the principal.

(4) This section shall not apply in any case where the accident 
occurred elsewhere that on, in or about the premises on which the 
principal has undertaken or usually undertakes, as the case may 
be, to execute the work or which are otherwise under his control or 
management.‖

21. Object of Section 12 of the Employee's Compensation Act 
The object for enacting the Employees" Compensation Act even as 

early as 1923 was to ameliorate the hardship of economically poor 

employees who were exposed to risks in work, or occupational 

hazards by providing a cheaper and quicker machinery for 

compensating them with pecuniary benefits. Section 12 safeguards 

the right to compensation when the employer delegates the work to 

another person. Section 12 is intended to secure to an employee the 

right to claim compensation not only against his immediate employer 

who, in the Act, is referred to as a contractor, but also against the 

person who had employed such contractor to execute the work. The 

Act refers to him as the principal. The main object of enacting Section 

12 of the Act is to secure compensation to the employees who have 

been engaged by the principal employer through a contractor for the 

work which the principal employer is supposed to carry out. If a 

person substitutes another for himself to do his work, he ought not to 

escape the liability which would have been imposed upon him, if he 

had done it himself. The intention of the Legislature in enacting 

Section 12 provision appears to be that the injured employee or the 

dependent of a deceased employee who has been awarded 

compensation by the Commissioner, should not be put to any 

difficulty in realising such amount of compensation on account of any 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 19 of 72 

recalcitrance of the employer or on account of the vicissitudes of his 

(the employer"s) financial position. The Employees" Compensation 

Act, 1923 is a piece of social beneficial legislation and its provisions 

have to be interpreted in a manner so as not to deprive the employees 

of the benefit of the legislation. Reference be made to Bhutabhai 

Angadbhai v. Gujarat Electricity Board, 1987 (1) L.L.N. 156; M.R. 

Mishrikoti v. Muktumsab Hasansab Asoti, (1972) 2 Mys LJ 449;

Compensation, (supra); Koodalingam v. Superintending Engineer,

Urban Division, DHBVNL, Bhiwani v. Priyanka, 2017 (153) FLR 

302 in which the Courts have examined the scope of Section 12. 

22. Section 12 of the Act has, in effect, stretched the contours of the 

word "employer‖ wider as to include the person contracting with 

another person for carrying out the work of the former. In such cases, 

the provision enjoins that the principal shall stand substituted as the 

employer. This is achieved by the words "where compensation is 

claimed from the principal, this Act shall apply as if references to the 

principal were substituted for references to the employer". The 

principal may have a claim for indemnity from his contractor or 

delegatee but the victim or his dependents are not to be involved in 

such disputes. 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 20 of 72 

23. Section 12 will apply notwithstanding the agreement or contract 

entered into between the principal and contractor regarding their 

liability for payment of compensation under the Act. The agreement or 

contract between the principal and the contractor shall govern only 

their inter-se rights and liabilities, and cannot affect the right of the 

employee or the dependants of the employee, to get the compensation 

from the principal or from the contractor at their option. 

24. Section 12 secures compensation to the employee who cannot 

fight out his battle for compensation by a speedy process. A person 

who employs others to advance his own interest is expected to provide 

a surer basis for payment of the injured employee than the 

intermediary, who may often turn out to be a man of straw, from 

whom compensation may not be available. This is the purpose for 

which the claimant is given the option under section 12 (3) of the Act 

to claim the compensation either from the principal or from the 

contractor. 

25. The contractor may not be a man of means or he may be merely 

a man of straw or it may be that wittingly or unwittingly he may 

possibly be part of an arrangement conceived by the principal to avoid 

confrontation directly with the employee engaged in the execution of 

the work. In either case, the interests of the employee need to be 

protected and that is what this provision secures to the employee. The 

principal can seek indemnification from the contractor if he has been 

made answerable for the payment of compensation. The right of the 

principal to be indemnified has thus been incorporated under Section 

12 (2), who has entrusted the work to the contractor stipulating the 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 21 of 72 

right of indemnification under the Act. 

26. Section 12 of the Act gives protection to the employee in case 

of an accident and secures compensation from the persons who can 

pay, so that such employee will not be dependent upon a petty 

contractor(s) who may themselves not be able to pay compensation on 

account of their financial inability. 

27. Section 12 is an enabling provision for the benefit of the 

employee(s) and enacted with the clear objective that the employee(s) 

should not be hampered by technicalities or practical difficulties of 

deciphering the correct employers. A pragmatic method has thus been 

devised for fixing the liability of the principal employer and thereby 

affording speedy relief to the employee for payment of compensation 

on account of the accident, though the principal has been invested with 

the right of indemnifying himself from the contractor who may have 

employed the employee and may have been responsible for taking 

work from him. 

28. Interpretation of the words "trade or business‖ in Section 12 

The words -trade or business‖ used in Section 12 of the Act have to 

be understood in the context in which this Act was enacted. The Act 

was enacted to provide compensation to the employees suffering 

during the course of their employment. It was also the purpose of the 

Act that the employees should get speedy remedies and it appears that 

the intention of enacting Section 12 of the Act was only to ensure that 

compensation is paid by the principal expeditiously and if this purpose 

of the Act and the provision is kept in mind, then the words -trade‖ or 

-business‖ may not have the same meaning which they would have, 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 22 of 72 

for instance, when used in interpreting a taxing statute. The word 

"trade" connotes commercial activity whereas the word "business" is 

of much wider import and may be used in different contexts in 

different senses. Used in one context, it may imply a particular 

occupation or employment to earn livelihood or gain, whereas used in 

a different context it may mean an activity which engages time, 

attention, or labour as a principal serious concern or interest. Its 

connotation may thus vary with the varying contexts in which it is 

used. In taxing statutes for instance, the word "business" will always 

denote an activity carried out with the object of earning profit, though 

the same may not be true when used in relation to other activities. The 

meaning of these two crucial words in Section 12 has to be understood 

in the context of its object. The word "business" in the Section 12 need 

not be restricted to what is synonymous with -trade‖. The use of the 

conjunction ‗or' should be understood as disjunctive for covering 

totally different areas unconnected with -trade‖. The word "business" 

has different shades of meanings. Among them, the most suitable in 

the present context is the meaning task, duty, concern or undertaking 

to do a work. The word "business" in its wider connotation may have 

more extensive meaning than the word -trade‖ and it means 

"anything which occupies the time and attention and labour of a 

man for the purpose of profit". The word -business‖ used in Section 

12 of the Act has been intended to convey the meaning -the work or 

task undertaken by the person concerned‖ which is not restricted to 

trade or commercial work alone. Used in broader sense, a person 

building his residential house may well be said to do "business" in so 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 23 of 72 

far as the said activity engages his or its time, attention or labour as 

principal serious concern or interest. Used in broader sense, a person 

building his residential house, may well be said to do "business" in so 

far as the said activity engages his time, attention or labour as 

principal serious concern or interest. Reference be made to the 

following judgments in which the Courts interpreted the words -trade 

or business‖ in Section 12:-

28.1. In Payyannur Educational Society v. Narayani, (supra), two 

workmen engaged in land excavating operation were buried alive in a 

landslide whereupon claim for compensation was made against an 

educational society. The society contested the claim on the ground 

that the society sold the soil to the contractor, who had engaged the 

workman and was liable to pay the compensation. It was further 

pleaded that ordinary business of the society was to impart education 

and digging work was not part of its -trade‖ or -business‖. The 

Division Bench of Kerala High Court headed by K.T.Thomas, J. as he 

then was, held that the word -business‖ used in Section 12 of the Act 

has been intended to convey the meaning as the work or task 

undertaken by the person concerned which are not restricted to trade 

or commercial work alone. The relevant portion of the judgment is 

reproduced hereunder:-

-9. It is trite law that the safe guidance for interpreting any 
provision in a statute or for understanding the scope and 
meaning of a particular word in provision, is to ascertain the 
intention of the legislature. However wide in the abstract, 
general words and phrases are more or less elastic and admit of 
restriction or extension to suit the legislative intention. "The 
object of the legislation would afford answer to the problems 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 24 of 72 

arising from ambiguities which it contains", (vide Maxwell on 
the "Interpretation of Statutes" 12 th edition at page 86). 
10. 
We bear in mind that one of the objects for enacting the 
Act even as early as 1923 was to ameliorate the hardships of 
economically poor workmen who were exposed to risks in work, 
or occupational hazards by providing a cheaper and quicker 
machinery for compensating them with pecuniary benefits. With 
the progress of times the concept impelled the courts, by and 
large, to make stretched constructions without violating the 
fundamental principles in order to advance the above object. 
Looking at it from the above angle, the object of the legislature 
in providing Section 12 in the Act is to safeguard the right to 
compensation when the employer delegates the work to another 
person. 
11. We will now proceed to consider in what manner the 
words "business" and "ordinarily" in Section 12 of the Act 
should be understood. 
12. 
Section 3 of the Act imposes a liability on the employer 
to pay compensation in cases where personal injury is caused to 
a workman by accident arising out of and in the course of the 
employment. Section 12 of the Act has, in effect, stretched the 
contours of the word "employer" wider as to include the person 
contracting with another person for carrying out the work of the 
former. In such cases, the provision enjoins that the principal 
shall stand substituted as the employer. This is achieved by the 
words 'where compensation is claimed from the principal, this 
Act shall apply as if references to the principal were substituted 
for references to the employer". The principal may have any 
claim for contribution from his contractor or delegatee, but that 
can be dealt with as between them separately. The victim or his 
dependents are not to be involved in such disputes. This much 
can easily be discerned from the section. 
13. The meaning of the two crucial words in Section 12 has 
to be understood in the above context. We do not think that the 
word "business" in the section need be restricted to what is 
synonymous with trade. The use of the conjunction "or" should 
be understood as disjunctive for covering totally different areas 
unconnected with "trade'. A reference to the Dictionary would 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 25 of 72 

reveal that the word "business" has different shades of 
meanings. Among them the most suitable in the present context 
is that which "The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary of 
Current English" has given as its third meaning: "Task, duty, 
concern or undertaking to do a work". Some succinct 
illustrations have also been given in the said dictionary to drive 
the meaning home. They are: "It is a teacher's business to help 
his pupils; I still make it my business to see that money is paid 
promptly; that is no business of yours". In none of the 
illustrations the word "business" is used to denote anything 
connected with trade or commerce. We think that, the word 
business used in Section 12 of the Act has been intended to 
convey the meaning as the work or task undertaken by the 
person concerned which are not restricted to trade or 
commercial work alone. Hence the interpretation given to the 
words "trade or business" appearing in Article 19 of the 
Constitution, or in the Rent Control Law is not apposite in the 
context of Section 12 of the Act. We may observe with great 
respect that the Division Bench of this Court in Travancore 
Devaswom Board v. Prushothaman (1989 2 LLJ 114), has not 
adopted any principle in conflict with the above view. 
14. 
In Bata Shoe Company v. Union of India AIR 1954 
Bombay 129 Gajendragadhkar, J. (as he then was) observed 
that the word "business" in its wider connotation may have 
more extensive meaning than the word "trade". His Lordship 
then quoted Jessel M.R. in Smith v. Anaerson 1880 15 Ch D 247 
who stressed the meaning of business as "anything which 
occupies the time and attention and labour of a man for the 
purpose of profit". This wide meaning was followed in Public 
Works Dept. v. Commissioner 1981 Lab I.C. 498 by a Division 
Bench consisting of Dr. A.S. Anand, J. (as His Lordship then 
was) and I.K. Kotwal, J. in Workmen's Compensation cases. We 
are, therefore, emboldened by the above decisions in adopting 
the wide connotation for the word "business" in the present 
case. 
15. 
Our next endeavour is to ascertain what the legislature 
meant by the word "ordinarily" in Section 12 of the Act. The 
word "ordinarily" is an elastic term. It is seen used in different 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 26 of 72 

statutes. The word has different shades of meaning in different 
contexts (vide Kailash Chandra v. Union of India (1961-II-LLJ-
369) (SC). If it is used for referring to jurisdictional aspects it 
may mean "in large majority of cases but not invariably". When 
the word is used for referring to residential qualification it may 
sometimes include even temporary residence. But the word 
"ordinarily" is employed in Section 12 of the Act for a different 
connotation. That has to be understood in the background of the 
preceding portion in the section wherein execution of the work 
carried out through any other person contracted by the 
principal for this purpose is mentioned. What the principal 
would have done if he has not contracted with another person to 
carry out that work? He himself would have normally done that 
work or caused it to be done under his supervision. The word 
"Ordinarily" is used in Section 12 of the Act for projecting that 
idea. So the word "ordinarily" in Section 12 of the Act means 
"otherwise, normally". We cannot confer any other meaning to 
the term "ordinarily" as it appears in the section. We did not 
find anything contrary to the above legal position in the 
decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Vijayaraghavan 
v. Velu (1973 I LLJ 490). 
16. Learned counsel for the appellant lastly contended that as 
the soil was sold to the second respondent, appellant had lost 
any ownership thereof and hence he cannot be made liable. 
What was sold by the appellant was only the soil and not the 
land. As long as the soil was not separated and transported, it 
remained as part of the land. The work involved in transforming 
land into soil must necessarily have been done when the 
ownership and title of the land remained with the appellant. So 
the appellant cannot disclaim liability in that line either. 
17. When the legal position is understood thus, we are of the 
view that appellant is the employer vis-a-vis the victims, as 
per Section 12 of the Act. Appellant is therefore liable to pay the 
compensation due under the Act to the claimants. Accordingly, 
we dismiss the appeals.‖ 
(Emphasis supplied) 

28.2. In Public Works Department v. Commissioner, Workmen 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 27 of 72 

Compensation (supra), the Division Bench of Jammu and Kashmir 

High Court held that the word "business" occurring in Section 12 has 

to be given an extended meaning, so as to include even an activity 

which engages time, attention or labour as a principal serious concern 

or interest of the Government or an individual without an element of 

profit in it. The relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced 

hereunder: 

-4. Unlike the word "trade" which merely; connotes 
commercial activity, the word "business" is of much wider 
import and may be used in different contexts in different senses. 
Used in one context, it may imply a particular occupation or 
employment to earn livelihood or gain, whereas used in a 
different context it may mean an activity which engages time, 
attention, or labour as a principal serious concern or interest. 
Its connotation may thus vary with the varying contexts in which 
it is used. In taxing statutes for instance, the word "business" 
will always denote an activity carried out with the object of 
earning profit, though the same may not be true when used in 
relation to other activities. Used in broader sense, a person 
building his residential house or a Government constructing a 
road, may well be said to do business in so far as the said 
activity engages his or its time, attention or labour as principal 
serious concern or interest. In saying so, I derive support from 
the following observations made by their Lordships of the 
Supreme Court in M/s. Hindustan Steel Ltd. v. State of Orissa, 
AIR 1970 S C 253: 
"The expression "business" though extensively 
used is a word of indefinite import, in taxing 
statutes it is used in the sense of an occupation, or 
profession which occupies the time, attention and 
labour of a person, normally with the object of 
making profit. To regard an activity as business 
there must be a course of dealings, either actually 
continued or contemplated to be continued with a 
profit motive, and not for sport or pleasure." 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 28 of 72 

Its amplitude has been more exhaustively dealt with by 
Gajendragadkar J. in Bata Shoe Co. Ltd. v. Union of India, AIR 
1954 Bom 129 wherein it has been observed : 
"In its wider denotation, the word "business" 
may have a more extensive meaning than the word 
"trade". But in the context, we think it would be 
safe to adopt the definition of the word "business" 
laid down by Jessel M. R. in 'Smith v. Anderson', 
(1880) 15 Ch D 247 at p. 258 (B), where the 
learned Judge has observed that 'anything which 
occupies the time and attention and labour of a 
man, for the purpose of profit, is business". It is 
true that the word "business" in its most general 
and unrestricted sense may conceivably cover all 
human activities. It may even include the business 
of governing a country. But we are disposed to 
hold that the context in which the word has been 
used in S. 18 (b), Presidency Small Cause Courts 
Act, S. 20, Civil P. C. and CL 12 of the Letters 
Patent, requires that this word should not be 
construed in such a wide and unrestricted sense." 
5. The next question which then falls for determination is; what 
meaning should be assigned to the word "business" occurring in 
Section 12? 
6. It is well settled that where a word used in a statute is 
capable of two meanings, only that meaning should be assigned 
to it which carries out its object. This rule 'of interpretation of 
statutes has been often times affirmed by their Lordships of the 
Supreme Court. In M/s. New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commr. 
of Sales Tax, Bihar, AIR 1963 S C 1207 it was held: 
"....It is a recognised rule of interpretation of 
statutes that the expressions used therein should 
ordinarily be understood in a sense in which they 
best harmonise with the object of the statute, and 
which effectuate the object of the Legislature. If an 
expression is susceptible of a narrow or technical 
meaning, as well as a popular meaning the Court 
would be justified in assuming that the Legislature 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 29 of 72 

used the expression in the sense which would carry 
out its object and reject that which renders the 
exercise of its powers invalid." 
Again, in South Asia Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. S. Sarup Singh AIR 
1966 SC 346, it was observed: 
".... A court would be fully justified in holding 
that in such a case it was intended that an order 
for recovery of possession can be made against the 
assignee alone for that would enable the object of 
the statute which was to enable the landlord to 
recover possession, to be achieved. An 
interpretation which defeats the objects of a statute 
is, therefore, of course, not permissible." 
7. The only object behind the provisions of Section appears to 
be to secure speedy payment of compensation resulting from 
injuries to a workman. The legislature intended to make doubly 
sure payment of such compensation to the workman, or to his 
dependants in the event of his death, as it could not exclude the 
possibility of the contractor being in some cases a man of straw, 
whose straitened circumstances might jeopardise the changes of 
recovery of such compensation. If, therefore, a restricted 
meaning is given to the word "business" so as to imply an 
activity with the object of earning profit only, the object behind 
Section 12 is likely to be defeated. Not only to speak of the 
Government performing its various functions of a welfare State, 
even many other persons may have to be kept out of the purview 
of Section 12 by assigning such a limited meaning to the word 
"business" occurring in it. Such an interpretation would absolve 
from liability to pay compensation even a person who would 
appoint a contractor for building his residential house, as 
building one's residential house cannot be said to have the 
object of earning profit or gain behind it. It cannot, as such, be 
said to partake of "business or trade" in commercial sense. 
Merely because the word "business" is clubbed with the word 
"trade" in Section 12, it should not be inferred that it has been 
used in simple commercial sense. Both these words have to be 
read disjunctively and rot conjunctively. Similarly, the doctrine 
of immunity attached to sovereign acts of State cannot be 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 30 of 72 

extended to acts like constructing roads or bridges, as such acts 
are not of such a nature as cannot be done by a private person. 
Viewed thus, the word "business" occurring in Section 12 has to 
be given an extended meaning, so as to include even an activity 
which engages time, attention, or labour as a principal serious 
concern or interest of the Government or an individual without 
an element of profit in it. It is one of the meanings given to the 
word "business" in dictionary. (See Webster's New International 
Dictionary, Vol. I, Ed. 1926). Construction of roads being one 
of the principal concerns of the Public Works Department of the 
Government inviting its serious attention, it is "business" within 
the meaning of Section 12 and the appellant was thus the 
principal employer vis-a-vis the deceased labourers.‖ 
(Emphasis supplied) 

28.3. In Bala Mallamma v. Registrar, Osmania University (supra), 

a claim for compensation was made for the death of a workman who 

fell down from a height of 40 feet while whitewashing the walls of 

Osmania University Science College. The claim was contested by the 

University on the ground that the University was constituted for 

imparting education and the whitewashing of the walls of the 

University was not a part of the -trade‖ or -business‖ of the 

University. The Division Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court, 

following Public Works Department v. Commissioner, Workmen 

Compensation (supra), held that whitewashing/colour washing was a 

regular feature of the activity of the University and it could be treated 

ordinarily as part of the -business‖ of the University because the 

words 'trade' or 'business', as used in the Act, have to be understood in 

the context in which the Act was enacted, failing which the very 

raison d'être of Section 12 of the Act would be defeated. The relevant 

portion of the judgment is reproduced hereunder: 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 31 of 72 

-14. The learned Counsel for the applicant has drawn our 
attention to the judgment of the Supreme Court reported in 
Mohan Lal v. R. Kondaiah, . Para No.3 of the said judgment is 
important for the purpose of the present case, which is 
reproduced below: 
"The expression business has not been defined 
in the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and 
Eviction) Control Act, 1960. It is a common 
expression which is sometimes used by itself and 
sometimes in a collection of words as in "business, 
trade or profession". It is a word of large and wide 
import, capable of a variety of meanings. It is 
needless to refer to the meanings given to that term 
in the various Dictionaries except to say that every 
one of them notices a large number of meanings of 
the word. In a broad sense it is taken to mean 
'everything that occupies the time, attention and 
labour of men for the purpose of livelihood or 
profit'. In a narrow sense it is confined to 
commercial activity. It is obvious that the meaning 
of the word must be gleaned from the context in 
which it is used. Reference to the provisions of the 
Constitution or other statutes where the expression 
is used cannot be of any assistance in determining 
its meaning in Section 10(3) (a) (iii) of the Andhra 
Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) 
Control Act, 1960. It is not a sound principle of 
construction to interpret expressions used in one 
Act with reference to their use in another Act; 
more so if the two Acts in which the same word is 
used are not cognate Acts. Neither the meaning, 
nor the definition of the term in one statute affords 
a guide to the construction of the same term in 
another statute and the sense in which the term has 
been understood in the several statutes does not 
necessarily throw any light on the manner in which 
the term should be understood generally. On the 
other hand, it is a sound, and, indeed, a well-


FAO 345/2016 

Page 32 of 72 

known principle of construction that meaning of 
words and expressions used in an Act must take 
their colour from the context in which they 
appear". 
15. This judgment reiterates a principle of interpretation and 
the principle is that the meaning of the word must be gleaned 
from the context in which it is used. Meaning assigned to a word 
in a particular Act may mean one thing and the meaning of the 
same term may give a different meaning when used in a 
different Act. Therefore, the word 'trade' or 'business' as used in 
this Act have to be understood in the context in which this Act 
has been enacted. Basically the Act has been enacted to provide 
compensation to the workers suffering during the course of 
employment. It is also the purpose of the Act that they should 
get speedy remedies and it appears that the intention of enacting 
the Section 12 of the Act was only to ensure that compensation 
is paid by the principal expeditiously and if this purpose of the 
Act and the provision are kept in mind, then the word 'trade' or 
'business' may not have the same meaning which it would have, 
for instance, when used in interpreting a taxing statute. If the 
plea of the University is accepted that they are engaged in 
imparting education, conducting examinations and conferring 
degrees only and cannot be termed to be doing any business or 
trade and hence they are not liable to pay compensation, then 
any person engaged for similar activity by any Government 
Department, any University, any hospital, if faced with an 
accident, would not be able to get compensation in terms 
of Section 12 of the Act although such a person would be a 
workman under the Act. Similarly if an individual who wants to 
construct a residential house of his own engages a person for 
construction of the house and if such a person faces an accident 
during the course of the building of the house, he would be 
remediless under the Act. Even otherwise the normal activity of 
the University is imparting education, conducting of 
examinations and conferring degrees, this they cannot do 
without having proper buildings.‖

28.4. In Govind Goenka v. Dayawati (supra), the appellant engaged 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 33 of 72 

a contractor for repairs and alterations in his shop. A portion of the 

wall fell on a labourer who suffered fatal injuries whereupon a claim 

for compensation was made against the owner who contested it on the 

ground that the deceased labourer was employed by the contractor. 

This Court, following the judgement of Division Bench of Andhra 

Pradesh High Court in Balla Mallamma v. Registrar, Osmania 

University (supra), held that the word -business‖ in Section 12 has to 

be given an extended meaning. The relevant portion of the judgment is 

reproduced hereunder: 

-6. As would be seen from the definition of "employer" 
envisaged under Section 2(e) of the Act, the same is of wide 
amplitude and would certainly encompass the present 
appellant who at the relevant time had employed the services 
of the contractor to carry out the job of repairs and alterations 
in his shop. The contractor who had taken the services of the 
deceased workman as a labourer no doubt will also be 
covered within the definition of employer but qua the appellant 
he would remain his agent and the appellant would be the 
principal employer. There is thus no difficulty to arrive at a 
conclusion that the appellant for all intents and purposes was 
the principal employer who had engaged the services of an 
Agent contractor to carry out the said job of the repair work.

9. So far as the interpretation of section 12 of the Act is 
concerned, again reference has been made to the principal 
making a contract for the purposes of trade or business, the 
judgment of the Division Bench of Andhra Pradesh High 
Court in the case of Balla Mallamma v. Registrar, Osmania 
University, Hyderabad and Anr, 2001(2)T.A.C.182(AP) is a 
complete answer……… 
10. As would be seen from the above judgment of the Hon'ble 
Division Bench where the Osmania University, Hyderabad 
had engaged services of a contractor for white washing and 
painting the walls of the University and a worker employed by 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 34 of 72 

the contractor while white washing the walls had fallen and 
died and the objection raised was that whitewashing the walls 
of the University would not be an activity which could be 
construed as an activity for the purposes of trade and business 
of the University. Giving an extended meaning to the word 
"business" employed in the said section 12, the Hon'ble 
Division Bench took a view that the restricted meaning given 
to the said expression would defeat the very raison d'être 
of section 12 of the Act. 
12. The said interpretation given by the Division Bench also 
finds support from the amendment brought by the Parliament 
in the definition of Section 2(1)(n) of the Act omitting the 
words "Casual workman" and a workman who is employed 
other than for the purposes of employer's trade or business. 
Reverting back to the facts of the present case, here also the 
deceased workman was employed by the contractor and 
although for carrying out repair job it might not be the 
principal activity of the appellant but yet the appellant cannot 
escape its liability keeping in view the object of the said 
beneficial piece of legislation. 
13. For the expeditious grant of compensation in the event of 
such accidents taking place in favour of the victim's dependent 
members, this act was enacted and a hyper technical 
interpretation of the statute would not only defeat the purpose 
of the said Act but would be adding insult to injury………‖

28.5. In Raj Pal Saini v. Kamla, (2016) 151 FLR 302, a mistry 

suffered an electric shock during the construction of second floor of a 

building. The owner of the building contested the claim on the ground 

that he had engaged the contractor who in turn had engaged the 

employee. Following Govind Goenka v. Dayawati (supra), this Court 

held the owner liable to pay compensation under Section 12 of the 

Act. The relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced hereunder: 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 35 of 72 

-6. On careful consideration of the rival contentions of the 
parties, this Court is of the view that the appellant, being the 
principal employer, is liable to pay the compensation to the 
respondent who was admittedly engaged in the construction 
work at the petitioner's house and was electrocuted on 16 th 
December, 2009. This case squarely covered by Govind 
Goenka v. Dayawati (supra) in which this Court held that the 
principal employer cannot escape its liability on the ground 
that the deceased employee was employed by the 
contractor.‖ 
(Emphasis supplied) 

28.6. Applying the rules of liberal and purposive interpretation, 

superior purpose and felt necessity, the word "business" occurring in 

Section 12 is given an extended meaning, so as to include even an 

activity which engages time, attention, or labour. Hence, construction 

of a residential house would be covered in Section 12. If the person 

who employs contractor is allowed to evade his liability by raising the 

defence that only the contractor or the intermediary should pay the 

compensation, then Section 12 will become redundant. This Court 

agrees with the view taken by the different High Courts in the 

judgments discussed herein above. 

29. Section 12 would apply notwithstanding the agreement or 
contract entered into between the principal and contractor regarding 
their liability for payment of compensation under the Act 

In Koodalingam v. Superintending Engineer, Project Circle, Public 

Works Department, Kozhikode (supra), the Division Bench of Kerala 

High Court held that Section 12 would apply notwithstanding the 

agreement or contract entered into between the principal and 

contractor regarding their liability for payment of compensation under 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 36 of 72 

the Act. The agreement of contract between the principal and the 

contractor governs only their inter-se rights and liabilities, and cannot 

affect the right of the workmen or their dependants to get the 

compensation form the principal or from the contractor at their option. 

Relevant portion of the judgment is as under: 

-11..........The avowed object with which Section 12 was 
enacted as part of the Act as seen from the Report of the Select 
Committee is to enable the workmen or the dependents of the 
workmen to proceed against the contractor or against the 
principal or both and to make the contractor liable to 
indemnify the principal in all cases in the absence of any 
agreement to the contrary. The Report of the Select Committee 
would also show that while finalising the provision the 
Committee has eliminated the provision which in the Bill as 
introduced exempted the Government and local authorities 
from liability imposed by this clause. The Committee has 
observed that these authorities are liable just in the same 
manner as private individuals. If these were the avowed 
objects with which Section 12 of the Act was incorporated in 
an enactment which itself is a beneficial legislation intended to 
confer benefits on the workmen, we are of the view that the 
provisions in Section 12(1) would apply notwithstanding the 
agreement or contract entered into between the principal and 
contractor regarding their liability for payment of 
compensation under the Act. So long as the Section has not 
been made specifically subject to any contract to the contrary, 
the Section would have application in all cases where the 
conditions specified in the Section are satisfied. The fact that 
no non obstante provision is used in the Section may not be a 
sufficient reason to exclude the application of the Section to 
cases where the conditions are satisfied. At best, agreements 
or contracts entered into between the principal and contractor 
can govern only their inter se rights and liabilities and cannot 
affect the right of the workmen or their dependents to get 
compensation either from the principal or from the contractor 
at their option. Right to get indemnified from the contractor 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 37 of 72 

specifically conferred on the principal under Section 12(2) of 
the Act sufficiently safeguards the interest of the principal who 
has entrusted the work to the contractor stipulating the 
liability under the Act.‖ 
(Emphasis supplied) 

30. Section 12 imposes the liability on the principal where several 
tiers of contractors or petty contractors are employed 

In Sardar Sewa Singh v. Hindustan Lever Ltd. (supra), the Allahabad 

High Court held Section 12 of the Workmen"s Compensation Act to 

be an enabling provision for the benefit of the workmen enacted with a 

clear objective that the workmen should not be hampered by 

technicalities or practical difficulties of deciphering the correct 

employers. A pragmatic method has been advised for fixing the 

liability on the principal employer for affording speedy relief to the 

workmen for payment of compensation on account of the accident. 

Section 12 imposes the liability on the principal where several tiers of 

contractors or petty contractors are employed. The relevant discussion 

of Section 12 is as under: 

-3………Chapter II of the Act captioned -workmen's 
compensation‖ deals with the question of compensation 
claimed by a workman. Ordinarily such claims are disposed of 
under the provisions of Ss. 3 to 5. The scheme of the Act is that 
the -employer‖ as defined in S. 2(c) should be liable in the 
manner mentioned in S. 3. In view, however, of the vastly 
increasing ramifications of industrial establishments and the 
multiplicity of immediate and indirect or remote employers 
which such process inevitably involves the Legislature has 
inserted a provision in the Act which may relieve a workman of 
the difficulty of ascertaining with precision as to who should 
be deemed to be the actual employer liable for compensation 
under the Act. Section 12, therefore, provides for a case where 
we have several tiers of employers or petty employers. It is a 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 38 of 72 

matter of common knowledge that in big industrial 
establishments important branches of undertakings are 
entrusted to contractors, who may in their turn have to employ 
other petty contractor working under their direction and a 
workman may be actually employed by one of these aforesaid 
persons and in such an elaborate hereby there may be no 
direct privity of contract between the principal and the 
workman in the last analysis. The workman has for all 
practical purposes to deal with an immediate employer but 
when it comes to lodging a legal claim for compensation on 
account of an accident he is concerned with the principal 
employer and not the immediate employer qua the workman. 
This is an enabling provision for the benefit of the workman 
and enacted with the clear objective that the workman should 
not be hampered by technicalities or practical difficulties of 
deciphering the correct employers. A pragmatic method has 
thus been devised for fixing the liability of the principal 
employer and thereby affording speedy relief to the workman 
for payment of compensation on account of the accident, 
though the principal has been invested with the right of 
indemnifying himself from the contractor who may have 
employed the workman and may have been responsible for 
immediately taking work from him.‖

31. Effect of amendment of Workmen's Compensation Act by 
Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2000 

31.1. Definition of -Workman/Employee‖ -The definition of 

‗workman', as it originally existed in the Workmen"s Compensation 

Act, 1923, excluded the workmen whose employment was of a casual 

nature and who were employed otherwise than for the purpose of 

employer"s -trade‖ or -business‖. Section 2(1) (n) of the Workmen"s 

Compensation Act, 1923 was amended by Workmen"s Compensation 

(Amendment) Act, 2000 with effect from 8 th December, 2000 whereby 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 39 of 72 

the words "other than a person whose employment is of a casual 

nature and who is employed otherwise than for the purposes of the 

employer's trade or business" in the definition of ‗workman' in 

Section 2(1) (n) were omitted. 

31.2. Section 2(1) (n) of the Workmen"s Compensation Act, prior to 

the Workmen"s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2000 read as under: 

-Section 2(1) (n) -

-workman‖ means any person (other than a person 
whose employment is of a casual nature and who is employed 
otherwise than for the purposes of the employer's trade or 
business) who is -
(i) ......... 
(ii) employed ****] 2 in any such capacity as is 
specified in Schedule II, whether the contract of 
employment was made before or after the passing 
of this Act and whether such contract is 
expressed or implied, oral or in writing; but does 
not include any person working in the capacity of 
a member of the Armed Forces of the Union; and 
any reference to a workman who has been 
injured shall, where the workman is dead, 
include a reference to his dependants or any of 
them.‖ 
(Emphasis supplied) 

31.3. Section 2(1)(n) of the Workmen"s Compensation Act, after the 

Workmen"s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2000 reads as under: 

-Section 2(1) (n) -
-workman‖ means any person who is -
(i) ......... 
(ia)......... 
(ii) employed in any such capacity as is specified 
in Schedule II, whether the contract of 
employment was made before or after the passing 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 40 of 72 

of this Act and whether such contract is 
expressed or implied, oral or in writing; but does 
not include any person working in the capacity of 
a member of the Armed Forces of the Union; 
and any reference to a workman who has been 
injured shall, where the workman is dead, 
include a reference to his dependants or any of 
them.‖ 
(Emphasis supplied) 

31.4. Workmen" Compensation Act was again amended in 2009 by 

Workmen"s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2009 with effect from 

18 th January, 2010 whereby the words -workman‖ and -workmen‖, 

were substituted with the words -employee‖ and -employees‖. The 

Workmen"s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2009 omitted Section 

2(1)(n) that defined -workman‖ and replaced it by Section 2(1)(dd) 

which defined -employee‖, though the substance of the definition 

remained the same. The aforesaid amendment also changed the name 

of the Workmen"s Compensation Act to Employee"s Compensation 

Act. Section 2(1)(dd) of the Employee"s Compensation Act reads as 

under: 

-Section 2(1) (dd) -
-employee‖ means a person, who is -
(i) 
......... 
(ii) ......... 
(iii) employed in any such capacity as is 
specified in Schedule II, whether the contract of 
employment was made before or after the passing 
of this Act and whether such contract is expressed 
or implied, oral or in writing; but does not include 
any person working in the capacity of a member of 
the Armed Forces of the Union; and any reference 
to any employee who has been injured shall, where 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 41 of 72 

the employee is dead, include a reference to his 
dependants or any of them;‖ 

31.5. The definition of -employee‖ in Section 2(1)(dd) of the 

Employee"s Compensation Act has to be read with Schedule II and the 

relevant Entry No.(viii) of Schedule II reads as under: 

-SCHEDULE II 
[Section 2(1) (dd)] 
LIST OF PERSONS WHO SUBJECT TO THE 
PROVISIONS OF SECTION 2(1) (dd), ARE INCLUDED 
IN THE DEFINITION OF EMPLOYEES 
The following persons are employees within the 
meaning of Section 2(1) (dd) and subject to the 
provisions of that section that is to say any person 
who is -
-(viii) employed in the construction, maintenance, 
repair or demolition of -
(a) any building which is designed to be or is or 
has been more than one storey in height above the 
ground or twelve feet or more from the ground 
level to the apex of the roof; or......‖ 
(Emphasis supplied) 

31.6. In Govind Goenka v. Dayawati (supra), this Court examined 

the effect of Workmen"s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2000 and 

held that, after the amendment, the workman whose employment is of 

casual nature and who is employed otherwise than for the purpose of 

employer's trade or business, would also be covered within the 

definition of "workman‖. Relevant portion of the said judgment is 

reproduced hereunder: 

-8. So far as the definition of workman envisaged in Section 
2(n) of the said Act is concerned, there has been a drastic 
change in the definition of the "workman" as it stood prior to 
the amendment and after the amendment. Prior to the 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 42 of 72 

amendment, certainly the workman whose employment was 
of a casual nature and who was employed otherwise than for 
the purpose of trade or business of the employer would not 
fall in the said definition. However, after the amendment of 
the said definition through the Amending Act 46 of 2000, the 
Parliament had removed the said mischief which was then 
prevailing and coming in the way of such casual workmen 
who met with an accident during the course of the 
employment unconnected with the employer's trade or 
business. With the amendment of the said definition, now 
certainly the workman whose employment is of casual nature 
and who is employed otherwise than for the purpose of 
employer's trade or business would also be covered within 
the definition of workman.‖ 
(Emphasis supplied) 

32. Rules of Interpretation of Social welfare legislations 

32.1. The principles of statutory construction are well settled that 

the words occurring in statutes of liberal import such as social welfare 

legislation and 'Human Rights' legislation are not to be put in 

procrustean beds or shrunk to Lilliputian dimensions. In construing 

these legislations, the imposture of literal construction must be 

avoided and the prodigality of its misapplication must be recognized 

and reduced. Where legislation is designed to give relief against 

certain kinds of mischief, the Court is not to make inroads by making 

etymological excursions but to advance the intent. 

32.2. It is a recognized rule of interpretation of statutes that the 

expressions used therein should ordinarily be understood in a sense in 

which they best harmonize with the object of the statute, and which 

effectuate the object of the Legislature. If an expression is susceptible 

of a narrow or technical meaning as well as a popular meaning, the 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 43 of 72 

Court would be justified in assuming that the Legislature used the 

expression in the sense which would carry out its object and reject that 

which renders the exercise of its powers invalid. 

32.3. It is trite law that the safe guidance for interpreting any 

provision in a statute or for understanding the scope and meaning of a 

particular word in provision, is to ascertain the intention of the 

legislature. However wide in the abstract, general words and phrases 

are more or less elastic and admit of restriction or extension to suit the 

legislative intention. The object of the legislation would afford answer 

to the problems arising from ambiguities which it contains. 

32.4. Purpose of Employee's Compensation Act, 1923 

In N.P. Lalan v. V.A. John, (1972) II LLJ 273 Ker, V.R. Krishna Iyer, 

J. as he then was, explained the purpose of Employee's Compensation 

Act in the following words:-

-4.The Act with which I am concerned relates to workers, and 
the entire purpose of the statute is to see that the weaker section 
of the community, namely, the working class, is not caught in 
the meshes of litigation which involves a protracted course of 
appeal. That is why the statute creates a special Tribunal and 
provides only for a restricted appeal ……… 
xxx

Part IV of the Indian Constitution serves as a perspective while 
construing the Workmen's Compensation Act. May be that pre-
Constitution statutes were interpreted in a particular way by 
Courts on certain assumptions of the State's functions at that 
time. Today it is absolutely plain that the Directive Principles of 
State Policy, though not enforceable by a Court, are 
nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country, and 
must inform the judicial mind when interpreting statutes 
calculated to promote the welfare of the working class. In fact, 
Article 42 enjoins upon the State to make provision for securing 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 44 of 72 

just and humane conditions of work and Article 43 compels the 
State to endeavour to secure, by suitable legislation, to all 
workers conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life. 
Indeed, the spirit of Part IV of the Constitution must colour the 
semantic exercises of the judiciary when applying the provisions 
of the Workmen's Compensation Act. If that be the approach to 
be made, I am clear in my mind that the argument that the 
proviso to Section 30 has been interpreted liberally in the pre-
Constitution days is of no significance. The same words, with 
socio-economic developments in society, acquire a new 
emphasis in tune with the changed conditions. It is clear 
therefore, that the dynamics of legal interpretation based on 
social changes which have taken place in the nation's life and 
goals demand ………‖

32.5. Rules of -Purposive Interpretation‖, -Superior Purpose‖ 
and -Felt Necessity‖ 

In Lanco Anpara Power Ltd v. State Of Uttar Pradesh, (2016) 10 

SCC 329, the appellants challenged the applicability of Building and 

Other Construction Workers' (Regulation of Employment and 

Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as "the 

BOCW Act") and the Buildings and Other Construction Workers' 

Welfare Cess Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as "the Welfare Cess 

Act") on the ground that they were registered under the Factories Act, 

1948 and therefore, they were not covered by the definition of 

-building or other construction work‖ as contained in Section 2(1)(d) 

of the BOCW Act and, therefore, the said Act was not applicable to 

them by virtue of Section 1(4) of BOCW Act. The Supreme Court 

held that the "superior purpose" of BOCW Act and the Welfare Cess 

Act has to be kept in mind as both these enactments namely BOCW 

Act and Welfare Cess Act are social welfare legislations. It was 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 45 of 72 

further observed that the concept of "felt necessity" and "purposive 

interpretation" would apply since the purpose of BOCW Act is to take 

care of a particular necessity i.e. welfare of unorganized labour class 

involved in construction activity as stated in the Statement of Objects 

and Reasons of the BOCW Act. The relevant portion of this 

judgement is reproduced herein under:-

-25. We have bestowed our due and serious consideration to 
the submissions made of both sides, which these submissions 
deserve. The central issue is the meaning that is to be assigned 
to the language of Section 2(1)(d) of the Act, particularly that 
part which is exclusionary in nature i.e. which excludes such 
building and construction work to which the provisions of the 
Factories Act apply. Before coming to the grip of this central 
issue, we deem it appropriate to refer to the objectives with 
which the Factories Act and the BOCW Act were enacted, as 
that would be the guiding path to answer the core issue 
delineated above. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
39. ……… As pointed out above, if the construction of this 
provision as suggested by the appellants is accepted, the 
construction workers who are engaged in the construction of 
buildings/projects will neither get the benefit of the Factories 
Act nor of the BOCW Act/Welfare Cess Act. That could not have 
been the intention of the legislature. The BOCW Act and the 
Welfare Cess Act are pieces of social security legislation to 
provide for certain benefits to the construction workers. 
40. Purposive interpretation in a social amelioration legislation 
is an imperative, irrespective of anything else. This is so 
eloquently brought out in the following passage in Atma Ram 
Mittal v. Ishwar Singh Punia [Atma Ram Mittal v. Ishwar Singh 
Punia, (1988) 4 SCC 284] : (SCC p. 289, para 9) 
-9. Judicial time and energy is more often 
than not consumed in finding what is the intention 
of Parliament or in other words, the will of the 
people. Blackstone tells us that the fairest and 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 46 of 72 

most rational method to interpret the will of the 
legislator is by exploring his intentions at the time 
when the law was made, by signs most natural and 
probable. And these signs are either the words, the 
context, the subject-matter, the effects and 
consequence, or the spirit and reason of the law. 
See Commentaries 
on 
the 
Laws 
of 
England (facsimile of 1 st Edn. Of 1765, University 
of Chicago Press, 1979, Vol. 1, p. 59). Mukherjea, 
J. as the learned Chief Justice then was, 
in Poppatlal Shah v. State of Madras[Poppatlal 
Shah v. State of Madras, AIR 1953 SC 274 : 1953 
Cri LJ 1105 : 1953 SCR 677 : (1953) 4 STC 188] 
said that each word, phrase or sentence was to be 
construed in the light of purpose of the Act itself. 
But words must be construed with imagination of 
purpose behind them said Judge Learned Hand, a 
long time ago. It appears, therefore, that though 
we are concerned with seeking of intention, we are 
rather looking to the meaning of the words that the 
legislature has used and the true meaning of what 
words [Ed.: Lord Reid in the afore cited case had 
observed: (AC p. 613: All ER p. 814) -We often 
say that we are looking for the intention of 
Parliament, but this is not quite accurate. We are 
seeking the meaning of the words which 
Parliament used. We are seeking not what 
Parliament meant but the true meaning of what 
they said.‖] as was said by Lord Reid in Black-
Clawson 
International 
Ltd. v. Papierwerke 
Waldhof-Aschaffenburg

Waldhof-
Aschaffenburg A.G., 1975 AC 591 : (1975) 2 WLR 
513 : (1975) 1 All ER 810 (HL)] We are clearly of 
the opinion that having regard to the language we 
must find the reason and the spirit of the law.‖

41. How labour legislations are to be interpreted has been 
stated and restated by this Court time and again. In M.P. 
Mineral Industry Assn. v. Regl. Labour Commr. (Central) [M.P. 
Mineral Industry Assn. v. Regl. Labour Commr. (Central), AIR 
1960 SC 1068] , this Court while dealing with the provisions of 
the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, observed that this Act is 
intended to achieve the object of doing social justice to 
workmen employed in the scheduled employments by 
prescribing minimum rates of wages for them, and so in 
construing the said provisions the court should adopt what is 
sometimes described as a beneficent rule of construction. 
In Surendra Kumar Verma v. Central Govt. Industrial Tribunal-
cum-Labour Court [Surendra Kumar Verma v. Central Govt. 
Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court, (1980) 4 SCC 443 : 
1981 SCC (L&S) 16] , this Court reminded that semantic 
luxuries are misplaced in the interpretation of -bread and 
butter‖ statutes. Welfare statutes must, of necessity, receive a 
broad interpretation. Where legislation is designed to give relief 
against certain kinds of mischief, the Court is not to make 
inroads by making etymological excursions. 
42. We would also like to reproduce a passage 
from Workmen v. American Express International Banking 
Corpn. [Workmen v. American Express International Banking 
Corpn, (1985) 4 SCC 71: 1985 SCC (L&S) 940], which 
provides complete answer to the argument of the appellants 
based on literal construction: (SCC p. 76, para 4) 
"4. The principles of statutory construction 
are well settled. Words occurring in statutes of 
liberal import such as social welfare legislation 
and human rights' legislation are not to be put in 
Procrustean beds or shrunk to Lilliputian 
dimensions. In construing these legislations the 
imposture of literal construction must be avoided 
and the prodigality of its misapplication must be 
recognised and reduced. Judges ought to be more 
concerned with the -colour‖, the -content‖ and 
the -context‖ of such statutes (we have borrowed 
the words from Lord Wilberforce's opinion 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 48 of 72 

in Prenn v. Simmonds [Prenn v. Simmonds, (1971) 
3 All ER 237: (1971) 1 WLR 1381 (HL)]). In the 
same opinion Lord Wilberforce pointed out that 
law is not to be left behind in some island of literal 
interpretation but is to enquire beyond the 
language, unisolated from the matrix of facts in 
which they are set; the law is not to be interpreted 
purely on internal linguistic considerations.‖ 
43. In equal measure is the message contained Carew and 
Co. Ltd. v. Union of India [Carew and Co. Ltd. v. Union of 
India, (1975) 2 SCC 791]: (SCC p. 802, para 21) 
-21. The law is not -a brooding 
omnipotence in the sky‖ but a pragmatic 
instrument of social order. It is an operational art 
controlling economic life, and interpretative effort 
must be imbued with the statutory purpose. No 
doubt, grammar is a good guide to meaning but a 
bad master to dictate.‖ 
44. The sentiments were echoed in Bombay Anand Bhavan 
Restaurant v. ESI 
Corpn. [Bombay 
Anand 
Bhavan 
Restaurant v. ESI Corpn., (2009) 9 SCC 61: (2009) 2 SCC 
(L&S) 573] in the following words: (SCC p. 66, para 20) 
-20. The Employees' State Insurance Act is 
a beneficial legislation. The main purpose of the 
enactment as the Preamble suggests, is to provide 
for certain benefits to employees of a factory in 
case of sickness, maternity and employment injury 
and to make provision for certain other matters in 
relation thereto. The Employees' State Insurance 
Act is a social security legislation and the canons 
of interpreting a social legislation are different 
from the canons of interpretation of taxation law. 
The courts must not countenance any subterfuge 
which would defeat the provisions of social 
legislation and the courts must even, if necessary, 
strain the language of the Act in order to achieve 
the purpose which the legislature had in placing 
this legislation on the statute book. The Act, 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 49 of 72 

therefore, must receive a liberal construction so as 
to promote its objects.‖ 
45. In taking the aforesaid view, we also agree with the learned 
counsel for the respondents that -superior purpose‖ contained 
in the BOCW Act and the Welfare Cess Act has to be kept in 
mind when two enactments -the Factories Act on the one hand 
and the BOCW Act/Welfare Cess Act on the other hand, are 
involved, both of which are welfare legislations. [See Allahabad 
Bank v. Canara Bank[Allahabad Bank v. Canara Bank, (2000) 
4 SCC 406] , which has been followed in Pegasus Assets 
Reconstruction (P) Ltd. v. Haryana Concast Ltd. [Pegasus 
Assets Reconstruction (P) Ltd. v. Haryana Concast Ltd., (2016) 
4 SCC 47 : (2016) 2 SCC (Civ) 524 : (2016) 1 Scale 1] in the 
context of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial 
Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 and the 
Companies Act, 1956.] Here the concept of -felt necessity‖ 
would get triggered and as per the Statement of Objects and 
Reasons contained in the BOCW Act, since the purpose of this 
Act is to take care of a particular necessity i.e. welfare of 
unorganised labour class involved in construction activity, that 
needs to be achieved and not to be discarded. Here the doctrine 
of purposive interpretation also gets attracted which is 
explained in recent judgments of this Court in Richa 
Mishra v. State of Chhattisgarh [Richa Mishra v. State of 
Chhattisgarh, (2016) 4 SCC 179. 
(Emphasis supplied) 

32.6. Rule of liberal interpretation of social welfare legislations 

In Prakash Cotton Mills (P) Ltd. v. State of Bombay, (1957) 2 LLJ 

490, Chagla J. unerringly observed that no labour legislation, no 

social legislation, no economic legislation, can be considered by a 

Court without applying the principles of social justice in interpreting 

the provisions of these laws. Social justice is an objective which is 

embodied and enshrined in our Constitution. It would indeed be 

startling for anyone to suggest that the Court should shut its eyes to 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 50 of 72 

social justice and consider and interpret a law as if our Country had 

not pledged itself to bringing about social justice. 

32.7. The rule of interpretation is that welfare, social and beneficial 

statutes are not to be construed strictly. In Regional P.F. 

Commissioner v. Hooghly Mills Co. Ltd., [2012] 1 SCR 363, the 

Supreme Court observed that a liberal rule of interpretation should be 

applied to social welfare legislations. The Court observed as follows: 

-23. If we look at the modern legislative trend we will 
discern that there is a large volume of legislation enacted with 
the purpose of introducing social reform by improving the 
conditions of certain class of persons who might not have been 
fairly treated in the past. These statutes are normally called 
remedial statutes or social welfare legislation, whereas penal 
statutes are sometime enacted providing for penalties for 
disobedience of laws making those who disobey, liable to 
imprisonment, fine, forfeiture or other penalty. 
24. The normal canon of interpretation is that a remedial 
statute receives liberal construction whereas a penal statute 
calls for strict construction. In the cases of remedial statutes, if 
there is any doubt, the same is resolved in favour of the class of 
persons for whose benefit the statute is enacted, but in cases of 
penal statutes if there is any doubt the same is normally 
resolved in favour of the alleged offender.‖

32.8. Cessante ratione legis, cessat et ipsa lex 

One of the most ancient maxims known to our law and constantly 

followed by our Courts is cessante ratione legis, cessat et ipsa lex i.e. 

when the reason for a law ceases, the law itself ceases. This principle 

of law can be applied to the present proposition. A restrictive 

interpretation to the words -trade or business‖ would disallow large 

claims of employees who otherwise would be covered by the Statute 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 51 of 72 

and the purpose behind the enactment would be lost. This principle of 

law has been applied in H.H. Shri Swamiji Shri Admar Mutt Etc, v. 

The Commissioner, Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments 

Department and Ors., [1980] 1 SCR 368 as well as the Foreign 

Courts. In Fox v Snow, 6 N.J. 12 (1950), the Supreme Court of New 

Jersey observed: 

-Cessante ratione legis, cessat et ipsa lex (the reason for 
a law ceasing, the law itself ceases) is one of the most ancient 
maxims known to our law and it is constantly followed by our 
courts. Of this maxim it was said in Beardsley v. City of 
Hartford, 50 Conn. 529, 47 Am. Rep. 677, 682 (1883), "This 
means that no law can survive the reason on which it is 
founded. It needs no statute to change it; it abrogates itself." 
The same thought was enunciated by Lord Coke in Milborn's 
Case, 7 Coke 7a (K.B. 1609): "Ratio legis est anima legis, et 
mutata legis ratione, mutatur ex lex" (the reason for a law is the 
soul of the law, and if the reason for a law has changed, the law 
is changed). "It is revolting," says Mr. Justice Holmes, "to have 
no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down 
in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds 
upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the 
rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past," and "To 
rest upon a formula is a slumber that, prolonged, means death.‖

33. Interplay of Section 12 and Section 2(1) (dd) of the Employees 
Compensation Act. (Earlier Section 2(1)(n) of Workmen's 
Compensation Act) 

The effect of the omission of words "other than a person whose 

employment is of a casual nature and who is employed otherwise than 

for the purposes of the employer's trade or business" in the definition 

of workman in Section 2(1)(n) by the amendment in 2000 is that a 

person whose employment is of a casual nature and is employed other 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 52 of 72 

than for the purposes of the employer"s trade or business comes within 

the meaning of -employee‖ as defined in Section 2(1)(dd) of the 

Employees Compensation Act. Although the words ‗trade' or 

‗business' remain in Section 12 of the Employees Compensation Act, 

applying the rules of ‗purposive interpretation', ‗superior purpose', 

and ‗felt necessity' this Court is of the view that the words ‗trade' or 

‗business' in the definition of -employee‖ in Section 2(1) (dd) were 

omitted to grant all the benefits of the Act to casual employees and 

employees employed other than for the purposes of employer's trade 

or business as held in Govind Goenka (supra). 

34. Judicial precedents must be applied with reference to the facts 
of the case 

34.1. The judgments relied upon by the appellant, namely, Bharat 

Earth Movers Ltd. v. Bhagyamma (supra), Dr. B. Radhakrishna v. 

Gouramma (supra), Lakshminarayana Shetty v. Shantha (supra), 

Ajay Singh Lal v. Somwati (supra), Om Parkash Batish v. Ranjit 

(supra), Management, Sirishad Construction (P) v. C.P. Ravinder 

(supra) and Kolhan Samvedak Sangh v. State of Jharkhand (supra), 

do not help the appellant for the reasons given by the respondent no.1 

in para 12 which are hereby accepted and are not being repeated 

herein for the sake of brevity. The other judgments cited by the 

appellant do not support the appellant. 

34.2. It is well settled that judicial precedent cannot be followed as a 

statute and has to be applied with reference to the facts of the case 

involved in it. The ratio of any decision has to be understood in the 

background of the facts of that case. What is of the essence in a 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 53 of 72 

decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein nor what 

logically follows from the various observations made in it. It has to be 

remembered that a decision is only an authority for what it actually 

decides. It is well settled that a little difference in facts or additional 

facts may make a lot of difference in the precedential value of a 

decision. The ratio of one case cannot be mechanically applied to 

another case without regard to the factual situation and circumstances 

of the two cases. 

34.3. In Padma Sundara Rao v. State of Tamil Nadu (2002) 3 SCC 

533 the Supreme Court held that the ratio of a judgment has to be read 

in the context of the facts of the case and even a single fact can make a 

difference. In para 9 of the said judgment, the Supreme Court held as 

under: 

-9. Courts should not place reliance on decisions without 
discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact 
situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. There is 
always peril in treating the words of a speech or judgment as 
though they are words in a legislative enactment, and it is to be 
remembered that judicial utterances are made in the setting of 
the facts of a particular case, said Lord Morris in British 
Railways Board v. Herrington. Circumstantial flexibility, one 
additional or different fact may make a world of difference 
between conclusions in two cases.‖ 

34.4. In Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd v. N.R. Vairamani, 

(2004) 8 SCC 579, the Supreme Court held that a decision cannot be 

relied on without considering the factual situation. The Supreme Court 

observed as under:-

-9. Courts should not place reliance on decisions without 
discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 54 of 72 

situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. 
Observations of courts are neither to be read as Euclid's 
theorems nor as provisions of a statute and that too taken out of 
their context. These observations must be read in the context in 
which they appear to have been stated. Judgments of courts are 
not to be construed as statutes. To interpret words, phrases and 
provisions of a statute, it may become necessary for judges to 
embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to 
explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not 
interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their 
words are not to be interpreted as statutes. In London Graving 
Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton [1951 AC 737: (1951) 2 All ER 1 
(HL)] (AC at p. 761) Lord Mac Dermott observed: (All ER p. 14 
C-D) 
-The matter cannot, of course, be settled merely by 
treating the ipsissima verba of Willes, J., as though 
they were part of an Act of Parliament and 
applying the rules of interpretation appropriate 
thereto. This is not to detract from the great weight 
to be given to the language actually used by that 
most distinguished judge…‖ 
10. In Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co. [(1970) 2 All ER 294: 
1970 AC 1004: (1970) 2 WLR 1140 (HL)] (All ER p. 297g-h) 
Lord Reid said, 
-Lord Atkin's speech … is not to be treated as if it 
were a statutory definition. It will require 
qualification in new circumstances‖. 
Megarry, J. in Shepherd Homes Ltd. v. Sandham (No. 
2) [(1971) 1 WLR 1062: (1971) 2 All ER 1267] observed: 
-One must not, of course, construe even a 
reserved judgment of Russell, L.J. as if it were an 
Act of Parliament.‖ 
And, in Herrington v.British Railways Board [(1972) 2 WLR 
537: (1972) 1 All ER 749 (HL)] Lord Morris said: (All ER p. 
761c) 
-There is always peril in treating the words of a 
speech or a judgment as though they were words in 
a legislative enactment, and it is to be remembered 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 55 of 72 

that judicial utterances made in the setting of the 
facts of a particular case.‖ 
11. Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different fact 
may make a world of difference between conclusions in two 
cases. Disposal of cases by blindly placing reliance on a 
decision is not proper. 
12. The following words of Lord Denning in the matter of 
applying precedents have become locus classicus: 
-Each case depends on its own facts and a close 
similarity between one case and another is not 
enough because even a single significant detail 
may alter the entire aspect, in deciding such cases, 
one should avoid the temptation to decide cases 
(as said by Cardozo) by matching the colour of one 
case against the colour of another. To decide 
therefore, on which side of the line a case falls, the 
broad resemblance to another case is not at all 
decisive. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
Precedent should be followed only so far as it 
marks the path of justice, but you must cut the dead 
wood and trim off the side branches else you will 
find yourself lost in thickets and branches. My plea 
is to keep the path to justice clear of obstructions 
which could impede it.‖‖

Factories Act, 1948 (63 of 1948), or the Mines Act, 1952 
(35 of 1952), apply;‖ 

38. Section 2(1) (j) of the BOCW Act defines -establishment‖. It 

is a wide definition which includes the establishment of an individual 

who employs building workers as well as establishment belonging to a 

contractor. However, an individual who employs workers in any 

building or construction work in relation to his own residence, where 

the cost of construction is less than Rs.10 lakh, is not included.

or implied, in connection with any building or other 
construction work but does not include any such 
person-
(i) who is employed mainly in a managerial or 
administrative capacity; or 
(ii) who, being employed in a supervisory 
capacity, draws wages exceeding one thousand 
six hundred rupees per mensem or exercises, 
either by the nature of the duties attached to the 
office or by reason of the powers vested in him, 
functions mainly of a managerial nature;‖ 

42. Section 45 of the BOCW Act imposes the liability of payment 

of compensation on the employer in the event of the failure of the 

contractor to make the payment of compensation to the building 

worker pay compensation in accordance with the provision of the 

Employee"s Compensation Act. Section 45 of the BOCW Act is 

reproduced hereunder: 

-Section 45 -Responsibility for payment of wages and 
compensation

employer shall be liable to make payment of that 
compensation in full or the unpaid balance due in 
accordance with the provisions of the Workmen's 
Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923), and recover the 
amount so paid from the contractor either by deduction 
from any amount payable to the contractor under any 
contract or as a debt payable by the contractor.‖ 


FAO 345/2016

43. Section 58 of the BOCW Act extends the provisions of the 

Employee"s Compensation Act to the building workers. Section 58 of 

the BOCW Act is reproduced hereunder: 

-Section 58 -Application of Act 8 of 1923 to building 
workers 
The provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 
1923, shall so far as may be, apply to building workers 
as if the employment to which this Act applies had been 
included in the Second Schedule to that Act‖ 

44. This Court is of the view that the BOCW Act applies to the 

construction of a residential building in which more than 10 building 

workers have been employed in the preceding 12 months and the cost 

of such construction is more than Rs.10 lakh. The owner of the 

aforesaid residential building would be an employer within the 

meaning of Section 2 (1) (i) and Section 45 of BOCW Act makes him 

liable to pay the compensation under the Employee"s Compensation 

Act. 

Findings 

45. The appellant is the owner of property bearing No. BU-48, 

Pitam Pura, Delhi on which he raised a four storeyed building through 

the contractor (respondent no.2). On 06 th March, 2012, respondent 

No.1 was working as a labourer on the construction site of the 

aforesaid building when he fell down and suffered grievous injuries. 

The aforesaid accident arose out of and during the course of the 

employment of respondent No.1 with respondent No.2. Respondent 

no.1 is held to be an employee as defined in Section 2 (1) (dd) of the 

Employee"s Compensation Act read with Clause (viii) (a) of Schedule 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 61 of 72 

II of the Employee"s Compensation Act. 

46. The definition of ‗workman', as it originally existed in the 

Workmen"s Compensation Act, 1923, excluded the workmen whose 

employment was of a casual nature and who were employed otherwise 

than for the purpose of employers -trade or business‖. Section 2 (1) 

(n) of the Workmen"s Compensation Act, 1923 was amended by 

Workmen"s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2000 with effect from 

8 th December, 2000 whereby the words "other than a person whose 

employment is of a casual nature and who is employed otherwise than 

for the purposes of the employer's trade or business" in the definition 

of ‗workman' in Section 2(1) (n) were omitted. The effect of the 

omission of words "other than a person whose employment is of a 

casual nature and who is employed otherwise than for the purposes of 

the employer's trade or business" in the definition of workman in 

Section 2(1)(n) by the amendment in 2000 is that a person whose 

employment is of a casual nature and who is employed other than for 

the purposes of the employer"s trade or business is covered within the 

meaning of -employee‖ as defined in Section 2 (1) (dd) of the 

Employees Compensation Act. Applying the rules of ‗purposive 

interpretation', ‗superior purpose', and ‗felt necessity', this Court is of 

the view that the words ‗trade or business' in the definition of 

-employee‖ in Section 2 (1) (dd) were omitted to grant all the benefits 

of the Act to casual employees and employees employed other than 

for the purposes of employer's trade or business. In Govind Goenka v. 

Dayawati (supra), this Court examined the effect of Workmen"s 

Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2000 and held that, after the 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 62 of 72 

amendment, the workman whose employment is of casual nature and 

who is employed otherwise than for the purpose of employer's trade or 

business, would also be covered within the definition of "workman‖. 

This Court agrees with the above interpretation. 

47. In Payyannur Educational Society v. Narayani (supra), Public 

Works Department v. Commissioner, Workmen Compensation 

(supra), Bala Mallamma v. Registrar, Osmania University (supra), 

Govind Goenka v. Dayawati (supra), the Courts have interpreted the 

word "business' in Section 12 of the Employee"s Compensation Act to 

include an activity which engages time, attention and labour. This 

Court agrees with the interpretation of the word ‗business' in the 

aforesaid judgments. Applying the principles laid down in the 

aforesaid judgments, construction of a residential house by the 

appellant through the contractor (respondent no.2) would fall within 

the meaning of ‗business' and, therefore, the appellant is liable to pay 

the compensation to respondent no.1 under Section 12 of the 

Employee"s Compensation Act. 

48. All the ingredients of Section 12 are satisfied in the present case 

and the appellant, being the principal, is liable to pay the 

compensation to respondent no.1 with right to recover the same from 

the contractor (respondent no.2). This case is squarely covered by the 

principles laid down in the judgments discussed above. 

49. There is no merit in the appellant"s contention that the appellant 

cannot be held liable in view of written agreement with the contractor 

under which the contractor is liable. As held in Koodalingam v. 

Superintending Engineer, Project Circle, Public Works Department, 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 63 of 72 

Kozhikode (supra), Section 12 would apply notwithstanding the 

agreement or contract entered into between the principal and 

contractor regarding their liability for payment of compensation under 

the Act. The agreement or contract between the principal and the 

contractor shall govern only their inter-se rights and liabilities, and 

cannot affect the right of the employee or the dependants of the 

employee, to get the compensation from the principal or from the 

contractor at their option. The appellant"s contention is, therefore, 

rejected. 

50. There is no merit in the defense of respondent no.2 that he had 

appointed Mohd. Rahil as sub-contractor who in turn had employed 

respondent no.1. Respondent no.2 filed an application under Order 1 

Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure for impleading Mohd. Rahil as 

a respondent which was rejected by the Commissioner vide order 

dated 02 nd May, 2013. On the appreciation of evidence before the 

Commissioner, this Court holds respondent no.1 to be the employee of 

respondent no.2 and the defence of respondent no.2 before the 

Commissioner for shifting the liability to Mohd. Rahil is rejected. So 

far as the appellant is concerned, Section 12 imposes the liability on 

the principal where several tiers of contractors or petty contractors are 

employed as held in Sardar Sewa Singh v. Hindustan Lever Ltd. 

(supra). 

51. Notwithstanding clear liability of the appellant to pay the 

compensation to respondents No.1 under Section 12 of the 

Employee"s Compensation Act, the appellant is also liable to pay the 

compensation under Section 45 read with Section 1(4), Section 2(1) 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 64 of 72 

(d), (e), (g), (i), (j) and 58 of the BOCW Act. BOCW Act applies to 

construction of a residential buildings in which more than 10 workers 

had been employed and cost of the residential building was more than 

Rs.10,00,000/-. Section 45 of BOC Act makes the employer liable to 

pay the compensation and the term ‗employer' in Section 2(1) (i) of 

the BOCW Act includes the owner. In the present case, BOCW Act is 

applicable as the cost of the appellant"s building was more than 

Rs.10,00,000/-and more than 10 building workers were employed 

during the construction work. The appellant"s building falls within the 

definition of ‗building and other construction work' as defined in 

Section 2(1)(d); respondent no.1 is a ‗building worker' within the 

meaning of Section 2(1)(e) of the BOCW Act; the appellant"s building 

is an ‗establishment' within the meaning of Section 2(1)(j) of the 

BOCW Act as the cost of the construction was more than Rs.10 lakhs; 

Respondent no.2 is a ‗contractor' within the definition of Section 

2(1)(g) of the BOCW Act and the appellant, being the owner, is an 

‗employer' within the definition of Section 2(1) (i) of the BOCW Act 

which includes the owner. The appellant is liable to pay the 

compensation to respondent no.1 under Section 45 of the Employee"s 

Compensation Act as the contractor has failed to make the payment of 

the compensation when it fell due. The objection of the appellant that 

the appellant is not the employer and he is not liable to pay the 

compensation under Section 45 is rejected. 

52. Respondent no.1 suffered post-traumatic paraplegia which 

resulted in 80% permanent disability relating to both lower limbs as 

per the disability certificate dated 12 th April, 2013. 
The

Commissioner, Employees" Compensation has taken the loss of 

earning capacity as 100%. Respondent no.1 appeared before this 

Court on 9 th March, 2017 and this Court is satisfied that the 

Commissioner, Employees" Compensation has rightly taken the loss 

of earning capacity as 100% as respondent no.1 is unable to do any 

work. Computation of compensation of Rs.10,69,008/-by the 

Commissioner is upheld. 

Conduct of the appellant 

53. During the course of hearing dated 31 st July, 2017, the appellant 

raised a false claim before this Court that less than 10 workers were 

employed during the construction whereupon this Court examined the 

appellant under Section 165 of Indian Evidence Act when the 

appellant made a false statement on oath with respect to the number of 

the workers. It is matter of record that more than 30 workers were 

employed on the site as stated by respondent No.1 during his cross-

examination on 10 th December, 2014. Even the appellant, in his 

written submissions filed before the Commissioner, Employees" 

Compensation on 27 th January, 2016, admitted that respondent no.1 

and 10-15 labourers were working on the site on the date of the 

accident. The relevant portion of the written submissions of the 

appellant, duly signed by the appellant and respondent no.2 as well as 

their counsel are reproduced herein below:-

-3. ………………The above said applicant was brought to 
the site of work by Mr. Mohd. Rahil alongwith 10-15 
labourers on daily wages, who used to lay linter work in 
the building on the day of incident i.e. 6.3.2012…………

54. Raising a false claim before the Court is an offence under 

Section 209 of Indian Penal Code which is reproduced here under:-

-Section 209 -Dishonestly making false claim in Court 
-Whoever fraudulently or dishonestly, or with intent 
to injure or annoy any person, makes in a Court of 
Justice any claim which he knows to be false, shall be 
punished with imprisonment of either description for a 
term which may extend to two years, and shall also be 
liable to fine.‖ 

55. In H.S. Bedi v. National Highway Authority of India, 2016 

(155) DRJ 259, this Court examined the scope of Section 209 of the 

Indian Penal Code and held as under: 

-15.1 Section 209 of the Indian Penal Code makes 
dishonestly making a false claim in a Court as an offence 
punishable with imprisonment upto two years and fine. 
15.2 The essential ingredients of an offence under 
Section 209 are: (i) The accused made a claim; (ii) The 
claim was made in a Court of Justice; (iii) The claim was 
false, either wholly or in part; (iv) That the accused knew 
that the claim was false; and (v) The claim was made 
fraudulently, dishonestly, or with intent to injure or to 
annoy any person. 
15.3 A litigant makes a ‗claim' before a Court of Justice 
for the purpose of Section 209 when he seeks certain relief 
or remedies from the Court and a ‗claim' for relief 
necessarily impasses the ground for obtaining that relief. 
The offence is complete the moment a false claim is filed 
in Court. 
15.4 The word -claim‖ in Section 209 of the IPC cannot 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 67 of 72 

be read as being confined to the prayer clause. It means 
the -claim‖ to the existence or non-existence of a fact or 
a set of facts on which a party to a case seeks an outcome 
from the Court based on the substantive law and its 
application to facts as established. To clarify, the word 
-claim‖ would mean both not only a claim in the 
affirmative to the existence of fact(s) as, to illustrate, may 
be made in a plaint, writ petition, or an application; but 
equally also by denying an averred fact while responding 
(to the plaint/petition, etc.) in a written statement, counter 
affidavit, a reply, etc. 
Doing so is making a -claim‖ to 
the non-existence of the averred fact. A false -denial‖, 
except when the person responding is not aware, would 
constitute making a -claim‖ in Court under Section 209 
IPC. 
15.5 The word ‗claim' for the purposes of Section 209 of 
the Penal Code would also include the defence adopted by 
a defendant in the suit. The reason for criminalising false 
claims and defences is that the plaintiff as well as the 
defendant can abuse the process of law by deliberate 
falsehoods, thereby perverting the course of justice and 
undermining the authority of the law. 
15.6 Whether the litigant's ‗claim' is false, is not 
considered merely from whatever he pleads (or omits to 
plead): that would be to elevate form over substance. To 
make out the offence, the Court does not merely 
inspect how a litigant's pleadings have been drafted or 
the case has been presented. The real issue to be 
considered is whether, all said and done, the litigant's 
action has a proper foundation which entitles him to seek 
judicial relief. 
15.7 Section 209 was enacted to preserve the sanctity of 
the Court of Justice and to safeguard the due 
administration of law by deterring the deliberate 
making of false claims. Section 209 was intended to 
deter the abuse of Court process by all litigants who 
make false claims fraudulently, dishonestly, or with 
intent to injure or annoy. 


FAO 345/2016 

Page 68 of 72 

15.8 False claims delay justice and compromise the 
sanctity of a Court of justice as an incorruptible 
administrator of truth and a bastion of rectitude. 
15.9 Filing of false claims in Courts aims at striking a 
blow at the rule of law and no Court can ignore such 
conduct which has the tendency to shake public 
confidence in the judicial institutions because the very 
structure of an ordered life is put at stake. It would be a 
great public disaster if the fountain of justice is allowed to 
be poisoned by anyone resorting to filing of false claims. 
15.10 The Courts of law are meant for imparting justice 
between the parties. One who comes to the Court, must 
come with clean hands. More often than not, process of 
the Court is being abused. Property-grabbers, tax-
evaders, bank-loan-dodgers and other unscrupulous 
persons from all walks of life find the Court-process a 
convenient lever to retain the illegal gains indefinitely. A 
person, who's case is based on falsehood, has no right to 
approach the Court. He can be summarily thrown out at 
any stage of the litigation. 
15.11 The disastrous result of leniency or indulgence in 
invoking Section 209 is that it sends out wrong signals. It 
creates almost a licence for litigants and their lawyers to 
indulge in such serious malpractices because of the 
confidence that no action will result. 
15.12 Unless lawlessness which is all pervasive in the 
society is not put an end with an iron hand, the very 
existence of a civilized society is at peril if the people of 
this nature are not shown their place. Further if the 
litigants making false claims are allowed to go scot free, 
every law breaker would violate the law with immunity. 
Hence, deterrent action is required to uphold the majesty 
of law. The Court would be failing in its duties, if false 
claims are not dealt with in a manner proper and effective 
for maintenance of majesty of Courts as otherwise the 
Courts would lose its efficacy to the litigant public.‖

Compensation is directed to initiate the penalty proceedings under 

Section 4A (3) of the Employees" Compensation Act in accordance 

with law. 

58. This Court is of the prima facie view that the appellant has 

raised a false claim before this Court and therefore, a show cause 

notice is hereby issued to the appellant to show cause as to why a 

complaint be not made against him under Section 340 Cr.P.C. for 

raising a false claim under Section 209 IPC. Reply to the show cause 

notice be filed by the appellant within four weeks.
