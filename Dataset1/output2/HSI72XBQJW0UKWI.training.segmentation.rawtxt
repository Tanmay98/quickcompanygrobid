1. This batch of writ petitions challenge the vires of the second 

explanation to Section 2(m) of the Delhi Entertainment and Betting 

Tax Act ("DEBT Act" or "the Act"), introduced with retrospective 

effect from 01.04.1998 by amendment (Notification No. F.14(9)/LA-

2012 /CONS 2 LAWW/148 hereafter "impugned notification" or 

"impugned amendment") dated 01.10.2012. Section 2(m) defines 

"payment for admission" and through the impugned provision 

payments made in lieu of advertisements commensurate to (i) 

sponsorship (ii) value of goods supplied and (iii) value of services 

rendered were included. All the petitioners seek directions that the 

exaction of these amounts as tax is unenforceable and in some cases, 

seek refund of amounts paid under protest. They also impeach the 

retrospective operation of the amendment, through the impugned 

notification. 

Brief Facts 

2. 
The petitioner in WP 2563/2013, Fashion Design Council of 

India (hereafter "FDCI") is a registered society created for the purpose 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 5 of 143 

of promoting and developing the Indian fashion industry especially in 

the areas of manufacturing, design, marketing and distribution. For 

these underlying purposes, FDCI, a non-profit organization, also 

receives support through grants from the Union Ministry of Textiles as 

well as other government bodies. Such grants inter alia are used to 

fund travel and accommodation related expenses of foreign buyers and 

is also utilized towards FDCI"s Market Access Initiative. Besides this, 

it organizes several events (such as seminars, workshops, marketing 

events, setting up academic scholarships, liaison with other 

international fashion councils and government bodies, forecasting and 

development of new trends and setting industry standards and norms). 

By providing a platform to up and coming fashion designers, FDCI 

assists the promotion of Indian fashion worldwide and promotes 

fashion trade in the domestic and international markets. 

3. 
Further to its objectives, FDCI, as a trade promotion council 

organises fashion weeks or fashion shows. These fashion shows are 

styled as market business promotion events and are the India Fashion 

Week (organised bi-annually), India Men"s Week and Couture Week. 

None of these events are ticketed and entry is strictly by invitation; in 

other words the only invitees are potential domestic and international 

buyers and the media who are given invitations solely for promoting 

and marketing Indian fashion who do not buy tickets for admission. 

However, as organizing such events require funds, the petitioner 

enters into sponsorship/ partnership agreements with various parties. 

The amounts received are then disbursed for organizing the events and 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 6 of 143 

in return the sponsor/ partner gets certain rights. These rights could 

encompass any or all of the following: 

1. Right to associate their name as title sponsor, or presenting 
partner etc.; 
2. Right to get their logo inserted in composite event logo (CEL), 
in official communications and promotion etc.; 
3. Right to get such designation, logo, marks in advertising and 
promotions etc.; 
4. Right to hold official party or get the party named on joint 
names; 
5. Right to manage, name VIP lounge with joint names; 
6. Right to name the main show area; 
7. Right to name a pavilion on agreed title; 
8. Right to get display area at the event; 
9. Right to get the opening or closing events with their names; 
10. Right to chair press conferences with CEL at conference 
backdrops; Logo placement in all invites, accreditation passes, 
official brochure, official website or, other media coverage etc.; 
11. Right to use pictures of designers; 
12. Right for television interviews etc. 

All such rights are towards organizing the event and do not guarantee 

the sponsor/ partner any assured invites to the event in exchange for 

their contribution to the event. In other words, the sponsor may or may 

not be given an invite to view the event and their role may be limited 

to advertising their products/ services. 

4. 
FDCI"s events styled as fashion shows, were sought to be 

classified as entertainment events by the respondents to attract tax 

liability under the Delhi Entertainment and Betting Tax Act ("the 

Act").The Act came into force on 01.04.1998 brought to tax, payments 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 7 of 143 

made for admission to a place of entertainment. Believing that its 

fashion shows were entertainment events, FDCI had applied for 

exemption under the provisions of Section 14 of the Act; the then Joint 

Secretary (Finance) acting at the behest of the Government of National 

Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) granted 100% entertainment tax 

exemption for events held from 2002-04 and 50% exemption for 

events held from 2008-09.Later, no tax exemptions were given and 

FDCI was asked to deposit the requisite entertainment tax in respect of 

payments received from sponsors. Aggrieved, FDCI approached this 

Court through several writ petitions which challenged the order dated 

10.09.2009 of the GNCTD granting only 50% tax exemption in 

respect of events conducted between 18.03.2009-23.03.2009 and 

15.10.2008-19.10.2008 and further challenged the assessment order 

dated 11.06.2009 passed by the AETO in respect of the latter two 

events. FDCI inter alia also contended that tax was not payable on 

sponsorship amounts and that the order passed by the AETO had 

ignored the fact that sponsorship amounts were beyond the purview of 

the Act and also that the relationship between a sponsor and organizer 

was governed by sponsorship agreements. This Court by its order 

dated 30.04.2012 was of the opinion that the true nature of 

sponsorship agreements would have to be discerned to ascertain the 

nature of payments for the purpose of deciding if entertainment tax 

was payable. The court observed that: 

"16. We are of the view that unless the terms and conditions of 
the sponsorship agreement are examined it may not be possible 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 8 of 143 

to ascertain the true nature of the payment and decide about the 
applicability of the relevant provisions of the Act. The AETO, as 
noted above, has not carried out this exercise and has rested his 
conclusion merely on the statutory provisions without 
ascertaining the basic facts or examining the terms and 
conditions of the sponsorship agreement. The entire exercise 
seems to us to be meaningless, if the factual background and the 
agreement between the parties have not been examined. The 
provisions of the Act have to be applied only to the facts 
gathered and governing the case and not in vacuo. We are 
therefore of the opinion that the impugned orders passed by the 
AETO have to be quashed. We accordingly issue a writ of 
certiorari quashing them. It is open to the AETO to examine the 
relevant facts including the terms and conditions of the 
sponsorship agreements and thereafter consider the 
applicability of the provisions of the Act and decide whether the 
petitioner is liable to pay entertainment tax or not, by passing 
fresh orders of assessment after hearing the petitioner." 

The GNCT of Delhi, in the meanwhile, amended Section 2 (m) of the 

Entertainment Tax Act by adding two explanations and took the 

position that these provisions were clarificatory; the amendments were 

inserted on 1 October 2012 but brought into force with effect from 01 

April 1998. These amendments are the subject matter of challenge in 

the present writ proceedings. 

Petitioners" arguments 

5. 
FDCI argues that the sponsorship amounts received by it are for 

the purpose of organizing its events and in no manner can they be 

classified as "payment for admission". It is urged that the impugned 

explanation is contrary to the Constitution of India as well as ultra 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 9 of 143 

vires the Act. It is argued that the impugned explanation, through a 

deeming fiction seeks to include sponsorship amounts paid for 

organizing an event into the same bracket as payment for admission. 

According to FDCI, the power of a State legislature under Entry 62 of 

List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution is to levy taxes on 

"luxuries including entertainment….". This does not extend to 

amounts paid for sponsorship, which by its nature is towards 

organizing the event. FDCI argues that the taxing incidence under the 

Entertainment Tax Act in the present case is "payment for admission 

to a place of entertainment" and for being entertained. When a 

sponsor, through an agreement, funds the petitioner"s event it is only 

for the purpose of organizing the event; it cannot be that the sponsor 

is being entertained. In any event, the amount funded-through 

sponsorship is not certainly for admission to entertainment. It is 

argued that sponsorship is of different types-while on the one hand it 

may relate to sponsoring an event where the trade of the sponsor is 

completely different from the event-like a corporate house sponsoring 

a music festival, it is the second kind which the petitioner is concerned 

with i.e. the one where the sponsor funds an event which is integral to 

its trade/ business. FDCI argues that in fashion events, brand owners 

sponsor the show and do so purely for the purpose of furthering their 

business interests and are not in it for amusement. Furthermore, but 

for such sponsorship, talented designers and those in the fashion 

industry, would be unable to show case them. The sponsorship enables 

the event, by providing patronage, which in turn, results in exposure of 

designers" capabilities. No single individual or fashion house has the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 10 of 143 

ability, in the country to organize an event, to showcase budding 

designers, whose offerings can be known to the public. The sponsors, 

by enabling the event, provide a platform for the future growth of such 

designs and products of designers and eventual growth of the industry. 

By participating in the events in the way they are, sponsors advertise/ 

promote their brands not only by showcasing it to the audience 

spectating the event at the venue but also to the public at large because 

of coverage by both the print as well digital media. FDCI cites the 

instance of the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week wherein Wills 

Lifestyle, the brand name of ITC"s apparel division, is the title sponsor 

of the event of the petitioner i.e. the India Fashion Week 

6. 
Mr. Arshad Hidayatullah, Senior Advocate for FDCI, argues 

that by organizing the events in question, FDCI provides a platform 

for various owners by paying it necessary amounts with a view to 

promote their brands/ products and ultimately fall under the class of 

organizers. Payment is received from such concerns not only as 

sponsors but also as event organizer/ proprietor, who are covered 

under Section 2(o) of the Entertainment Tax Act. The Counsel submits 

that though the products promoted fall under the class of luxury goods 

and these brands may relate to different products, yet they may all be 

co-advertised and promoted in the same event. In such situations, 

promoters are not "entertainers" but build their brands and create 

awareness of their designs in the country. By introducing a tax liability 

on sponsorship what the legislature is taxing advertisement, which is 

beyond the legislative ambit of the state legislature under Entry 62, 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 11 of 143 

List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The learned 

counsel refers to Entry 92 of List I to seventh schedule ("92. Taxes on 

the sale or purchase of newspapers and on advertisements published 

therein"). It is submitted that advertisement of the kind visualized in 

the events, would be also within the Union List, because of Entry 97 

of List I to the Seventh Schedule. What cannot be directly cannot be 

done indirectly, i.e. taxation on advertisement by a state. It is 

submitted that since the sponsorship is by way of advertisement, that 

cannot be taxed, its inclusion through the amendment, which is 

impugned in the present proceedings, is beyond legislative 

competence. The pith and substance of the impugned provisions, says 

FDCI, is advertisement and not entry to an entertainment event. 

7. 
Mr. Hidayatullah argues that there is an intelligible differentia 

between sponsors on the one hand who by contributing funds assist in 

the organizing of the event and the audience or the beneficiaries of 

entertainment on the other hand. It is argued that the impugned 

explanation seeks to equally place two classes and proceeds to tax 

them in the same manner ignoring that organizers who fund events 

cannot be taxed for payments made to access a place of entertainment. 

It is argued that fashion shows are not entertainment as the event 

participants are not entertainers, in any sense of the term, nor are the 

organizers or event facilitators creating an event for which there is 

"admission to entertainment". The core feature -that of receiving 

entertainment or being entertained is absent in these cases. Unlike 

typical entertainment events, meant to gratify, amuse or entertain 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 12 of 143 

viewers or participants, fashion shows, which are the subject matter of 

these cases, are "closed door" events the access to which is granted to 

only the organizers" invitees. The purpose of the event is not to 

entertain, but to sponsorship payments are not towards obtaining 

admission to a place of entertainment but are made by way of 

contracts which stipulate reciprocal rights from the primary organizer 

for purposes of advertising, organising conferences, parties, setting up 

stalls, banners etc. These do not constitute access to the event, nor can 

be equated with the price or consideration paid for "admission to 

entertainment event" which is the only incident of taxation under the 

Entertainment Tax Act. It is thus submitted that by equating the two, 

i.e. the organizers and those who are invited, for the purpose of 

imposing the tax burden, the legislature has violated Article 14 of the 

Constitution. 

8. 
Learned senior counsel argued that an event of this size and 

scale is a composite package with several different types of 

contributors; what is common to all the contributors is that none of 

them are pay to be "entertained". Urging that sponsors are a different 

class of people-akin to organizers and distinct from the people being 

entertained, the petitioner relies upon the decision of the Supreme 

Court in State of Karnataka Vs. Drive-in Enterprises (2001) 4 SCC 

60, where it was held that incidence of tax is on entertainment and 

consequently on the person availing such entertainment. In the 

absence of a rational nexus between the payment made for admission 

by a recipient of the entertainment vis-à-vis a sponsor"s contribution 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 13 of 143 

and also by treating similarly two distinct classes of persons i.e. 

sponsors organizing an event and persons availing the entertainment, 

the petitioner argues that the impugned amendment falls a foul Article 

14 of the Constitution. Sponsorship agreements are a separate class of 

payments entered into between private parties for organizing an event. 

By applying Section 6 to such payments by virtue of the impugned 

explanation, the Entertainment Tax Act clearly violates Article 14 of 

the Constitution. To this extent, the petitioner relies on the decision of 

the apex court in Kunnathat Thatunni Mupil Nair v State of Kerala 

AIR 1961 SC 552 wherein two propositions were laid down in respect 

of taxing statutes: firstly that the legislature must be competent to levy 

the tax and authorise its collection and secondly it should fulfill the 

obligations spelt out in Article 13 and 14 of the Constitution which 

guarantee equal protection of law. The petitioner argues that by 

combining together all classes of payments into a large and composite 

unit without any rational classification the legislature is in 

contravention of the guarantees spelt out under Articles 13 and 14 of 

the Constitution. Relying on Federation of Hotel and Restaurants Vs. 

Union of India and Ors AIR 1990 SC 1637, the petitioner argues that 

the impugned amendment must fulfill the test of Article 14 in the 

sense that the differentia must have a rational nexus with the object of 

the Act. 

9. 
FDCI challenges the impugned amendment to the Explanation 

on the ground that the power of a state is to impose taxes under Entry 

62 of list II on "luxuries including entertainment" and consequently 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 14 of 143 

the impugned explanation is ultra vires the Constitution and is beyond 

the scope of Entertainment Tax Act. The petitioners argue that 

entertainment is an activity by which one person provides 

entertainment to another; organizers such as the petitioner, through 

sponsorship funding organize or create events. Whether an event is an 

entertainment or not would depend on the facts and as such 

entertainment could not be defined in a straitjacket formula. The 

petitioner argues that Entry 62 permits the imposition of tax only in 

cases where entertainment is provided and not merely for an event. As 

a corollary, what Entry 62 allows for the state is to legislate in respect 

of taxes which would be payable for a person to have access to a place 

of entertainment and to be the beneficiary of an entertainment event. 

Further, the Act does not contemplate a situation where the organizer 

or creator of the event needs to pay tax for access to the place of 

entertainment. The petitioner argues that the impugned provision is 

vires the Act as well as the Rules and being a taxing statute has to be 

construed strictly keeping in mind its object and purpose as also 

keeping in mind the proposition laid down by the Supreme Court in 

Drive-in Enterprises (supra). 

10. FDCI submits that under the Constitution, the GNCTD does not 

have the authority to impose tax the way it seeks to, through the 

impugned amendment, under the Entertainment Tax Act. Analysing 

Section 6 (which is the charging section), in the backdrop of the 

decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Aluminium Co. Vs State of 

Kerala & Ors, AIR 1996 SC 1431, it is argued, that the legislature is 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 15 of 143 

incompetent to add the impugned Explanation and increase the scope 

of tax. Reliance has also been placed on Sri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. 

Vs. Broach Borough Municipality &Ors, AIR 1970 SC 192. It urges 

that for there to be a taxing incidence there needs to be an identifiable 

payment, which secures the right to admission into a place of 

entertainment. It is further argued on this ground that both the 

charging section as well as the pre-amendment Section 2(m) taxes any 

payment by a potential recipient of the entertainment for securing 

admission to an entertainment. For any event, which can be classified 

as entertainment under Section 2(i) the recipient forms a separate class 

of people in comparison to the organizers; sponsors are nothing but 

"proprietors" covered under Section 2(o)(i) of the Entertainment Tax 

Act. FDCI argues that by inserting the second Explanation to Section 

2(m), the state, seeks to change the object of the Act by enlarging the 

scope of the charging section by including even sponsors who are but 

organizers. Relying on the scheme of the Act with respect to Section 

6(1), it is argued that no tax can be levied when there is no payment 

for admission into a place of entertainment. 

11. It is argued, by learned senior counsel, that without amending 

the charging section, (i.e. Section 6), the legislature could not have 

sought to impose a tax burden merely by adding an explanation. In 

this regard, learned senior counsel for the petitioners, Mr. 

Hidayatullah relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court reported as 

M/s Tata Sky Ltd v State of Madhya Pradesh 2013 (4) SCC 656. 

Counsel also relied on Section 7, which was amended in 2010, to say 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 16 of 143 

that when the normal or traditional forms of entertainment were not 

covered by the provisions, not only did the legislature amend the 

definition in Section 2 (ha) and the definition of "admission to 

entertainment" by providing separately for clause (vi), to Section 2 

(m), but created a separate charge. Relying on Union of India v M/s 

Martin Lottery Agencies Ltd2009 (12) SCC 209, learned senior 

counsel urged that levy through explanation, in a retrospective 

manner, falls foul of the Constitution of India. 

12. Reliance upon the 1997 Rules (especially Rule 11, Form 6) is 

placed to reinforce this argument. They deal with the form, and 

manner in which information is to be given to the Commissioner 

before an event can be held. The petitioner submits that Form 6, which 

is to be submitted in compliance to Rule 11 in case of non-ticketed 

events (and which recognizes both sponsorship and advertisement 

amounts), nowhere discloses the tax component associated with the 

latter amounts and consequently it is a logical conclusion that when 

there is no payment for admission there is no taxing incidence. It was 

submitted that in the absence of a clear and cogent mechanism for tax 

collection, the levy, if it is assumed to exist, has to fail. Learned senior 

counsel relied on the judgment in Moopil Nair (supra) for that 

purpose. He also relied on Rai Ramkrishna & Others Vs. State of 

Bihar AIR 1963 SC 1667, where it was held that where "it appears 

that the taxing statute is plainly discriminatory, or provides no 

procedural machinery for assessment and levy of tax, or that it is 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 17 of 143 

confiscatory the Courts would be justified in striking down the 

impugned statute as unconstitutional". 

13. To further explain the differences in the nature of payments 

FDCI argues that representatives from the sponsor"s organization are 

issued with identity cards to enable their entry into the premises to 

conduct and manage the event. As identity cards ("ID Cards") allow 

their holders to enter the premises and are neither tickets nor entry to 

the entertainment event, the criteria prescribed under Sections 9 and 

10 would be fulfilled. Sections 9 and 10 mandate that no person can 

enter the premise where the entertainment event is to be conducted 

without a valid entry ticket with duly paid tax on it whereas persons 

entrusted with ID cards to the event are cleared for access to the 

premise at any time and are charged with specific duties in connection 

with the event including overseeing the organizing of the event. Since 

sponsors have specific duties like manning stalls and displaying goods 

it cannot be said that they are receiving entertainment; they are only 

giving effect to the sponsorship agreement. In terms of Sections 9 and 

10 of the Entertainment Tax Act, sponsors are neither spectators nor 

audience. 

14. It is also argued by the learned senior counsel that the impugned 

amendment seeks to enlarge the taxing incidence has legislated 

beyond its competence. While admittedly legislative entries under 

Schedule VII to the Constitution are to be given wide interpretation, 

the subject matter of the concerned legislation should fall within the 

scope of the relevant entry. The petitioner argues that Entry 62, the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 18 of 143 

scheme of the Entertainment Tax Act as well as various Supreme 

Court judgments make it abundantly clear that the legislature was not 

competent to introduce the impugned explanation. Furthermore, by 

giving retrospective effect to the amendment and by retrospectively 

enlarging the tax liability, the state has contravened established legal 

principles of giving taxing statutes retrospective effect only in 

exceptional and rare cases. The device used by introducing, an 

explanation cannot widen the scope of the original provision and 

certainly not in a way that interferes, or conflict with the main 

provisions of the Act. In this regard, learned senior counsel relied on 

the judgment reported as Sundaram Pillai Vs Pattabiraman (1985) 1 

SCC 591 which through a detailed analysis of case law relating to 

statutory interpretation and the scope of an explanation had enunciated 

that such a device has limitations and cannot widen the scope of 

something which was never intended to be covered. In other words, 

said counsel, the explanation, which are impugned in these batches of 

cases, are not clarificatory, notwithstanding the state"s interpretation to 

the contrary, but seek to expropriate the petitioners through an illegal 

levy, in a retrospective manner. The petitioner argues that 

retrospective effect should be given only for clarificatory purposes or 

to remove technical defects or in cases of economic importance-an 

instance being the protection of a tax base from unscrupulous schemes 

created with the motive of avoiding tax liability. Now by seeking tax 

from the petitioner, what the revenue is actually intending is charging 

a direct tax whereas the Entertainment Tax Act imposes indirect taxes. 

Reliance is placed on Rai Ramkrishna (supra) and R.C. Tobacco Pvt. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 19 of 143 

Ltd. and Anr Vs Union of India & Anr AIR 2005 SC 4203. The 

petitioner finally argues that there is an impossibility of performance 

because it seeks to unjustly recover tax from the proprietor who under 

the intended scheme of the Act only collects tax from the persons 

being entertained. It was emphasized that entertainment tax, under the 

provision is only for admission to entertainment, not a tax on 

entertainer, or on the proprietor or event creator/organizers. By 

seeking to re-write the entire levy through amendment of the 

definition clause, without any corresponding levy, and furthermore, in 

the absence of a coherent machinery for assessment, collection and 

recovery, the legislature has acted contrary to Article 265 and Article 

14 of the Constitution of India. 

Contentions of BCCI 

15. In WP(C) of 10729/ 2016, the petitioner, Board of Control for 

Cricket in India (BCCI) created the Indian Premiere League 

tournament (IPL), a cricket tournament played yearly in the "T-20" 

format since 2007. IPL matches in the tournament take place in 

different locales in stadiums across the country during the season. 

BCCI grants franchisee rights to various entities to form their teams 

and compete against other teams. The franchisees also negotiate with 

the owner of the stadiums for the purpose of securing their home 

stadium. Once permission to use a stadium as home stadium is 

granted, the franchisee inter alia is entitled to host its team"s home 

matches and retain proceeds from sale of tickets for those matches. 

BCCI entered into franchisee agreements with GMR Sports, which 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 20 of 143 

owns the "Delhi Daredevils" team and is proprietor of the matches 

conducted in Delhi. GMR enters into the necessary agreements 

including with the Delhi District Cricket Association for the purpose 

of using the Ferozeshah Kotla Stadium; the franchisee organizes the 

IPL matches in Delhi. GMR is the proprietor under Section 2(o) of the 

Entertainment Tax Act, which collects proceeds from tickets as well 

as sponsorships and deposits the requisite entertainment tax with the 

respondents. BCCI urges that it is merely the overall administrator of 

the IPL (the tournament as a whole), the responsibility of organizing 

each match is on the franchise that is playing at their home stadium. 

BCCI refers to its Franchise Agreement with GMR Sports Private 

Limited, whose team (Delhi Daredevils) has played most of its home 

matches (except those played in South Africa in 2009 and some 

matches played at Raipur) at the Ferozshah Kotla Ground in Delhi. 

Accordingly, while the DDCA may have provided certain assistance 

to the Franchisee in organizing the said matches at the Ferozshah 

Kotla (by virtue of being the owner of the Stadium), the responsibility 

of organizing the IPL T20 matches played at the 

Stadium is solely on the Franchisee (GMR). 

16. It is argued by Mr. Kamal Sawhney for BCCI that all the tickets 

for PL T20 matches played at the said Stadium are printed by GMR 

and the proceeds from the sale of the said tickets are also retained 

solely by the Franchisee. In fact GMR is treated by GNCTD as the 

proprietor for all matches held in Delhi in the past. Furthermore, GMR 

has in the past, filed entertainment tax returns and paid them. It is 

urged that the agreement between GMR and DDCA clearly shows that 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 21 of 143 

it is the Franchisee who is fully and solely responsible for organizing 

(in its capacity as sole proprietor) the matches of Delhi. Even the tax 

due on sponsorship amounts in respect of matches held at Delhi has 

been regularly deposited by GMR with the Respondents. The 

impugned notice to BCCI is without jurisdiction as the Petitioner is 

not the proprietor of the matches held at Delhi curing the Indian 

Premier 'League (IPL). It is urged that BCCI is merely the overall 

administrator of the IPL (the tournament as a whole), and the 

responsibility of organizing each match is on the respective franchises. 

It is highlighted that in fact the Franchisee (GMR) prints all the tickets 

for IPL T20 matches played at the Stadium and the proceeds from the 

sale of those tickets are also retained solely by GMR. The Franchisee 

has been treated as the proprietor for all matches held in Delhi. It is 

the Franchisee/GMR who has been filing the entertainment tax 

returns. 

17. It is argued by Mr. Sawhney that GNCT of Delhi has 

throughout treated only the Franchisee as the proprietor of the sporting 

event. It is submitted that the nature of the entertainment in question 

i.e. cricket matches held, at Delhi has not changed. It is argued that 

someone else cannot become the proprietor merely because an 

additional head in the form of sponsorship is sought to be taxed. The 

proprietor always was and remains the franchisee i.e. GMR. It is urged 

that the notices by the GNCTD proceed on the erroneous basis that the 

BCCI is "deemed to, be proprietor' in terms of the Act merely because 

the BCCI is connected with the organization of the IPL T20 matches 

held at the Stadium since 2008. It is submitted in this context that 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 22 of 143 

various provisions of the Act apply when there is access to those 

wishing to be entertained, for an event, that may be called 

"entertainment". Whereas access to those seeking entertainment is 

granted through tickets, for which the event proprietor is GMR (whose 

collections are subject to entertainment tax), the BCCI has no role, but 

as regulator of the sport in India and facilitator of matches, through its 

affiliating association, the Delhi District Cricket Association (DDCA). 

That BCCI receives advertising revenues of a share thereof, from the 

sponsors of the event, would not in any way render it liable for 

payment. It is stated that BCCI cannot be said to have provided access 

to entertainment, i.e., the cricket match or matches concerned, by 

allowing advertisements in the stadium of the sponsors, merely 

because some access to sponsors" representatives is provided for the 

event. 

18. It is submitted that what the Act empowers the respondents to 

do is to collect tax on the occurrence of the specified event, i.e. 

admission to entertainment. In the present case, the admission to the 

entertainment is through sale of tickets; the tax on that incident is 

collected by GMR and paid to the respondents. Such being the case, 

the impugned notification and amendment, to the extent it purports to 

create a species of "entry" for the entertainment by deeming 

sponsorships as also another form, is beyond the mandate permitted to 

the legislature. In saying so, counsel urges that the taxing event or 

incident, i.e. is one whole, and gets completed, with the physical 

access and entry to the spectator; by seeking to add another layer by 

an artificial fiction of a deemed "entry" through sponsorship, the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 23 of 143 

legislature is seeking to conjure an event that does not occur; 

moreover it is layering up one transaction with several artificial ones, 

merely to collect tax from transactions that fall outside the pale of the 

Act. 

19. In the case of BCCI/ GMR the events are cricket matches, 

which qualify as entertainment events. These are ticketed and open to 

the general public unlike events in the case of FDCI, (which are by 

special invite only and for a reserved audience who are members of 

the same industry). In case of IPL, the sponsors" advertisements, logos 

etc. are visible to not just the audience present at the venue but have a 

pan-India presence due to the broadcasting of the match. The 

petitioner"s grievance is that, under protest, it had to deposit ` 

1,07,97,000 towards entertainment tax on sponsorship, in order to 

obtain no objection certificate (NOC) from the GNCTD to organize 

two play-off matches titled the VIVO IPL 2016 play-off Matches at 

the Ferozshah Kotla Stadium on 25.05.2016 and 27.05.2016. It states 

that it had to deposit the entire entertainment tax payable on the sale of 

36,008 seat tickets as well as on the sponsorship amounts despite the 

Entertainment Tax Act under Sections 8 and 13 requiring only a 

security deposit to be made for the purpose of receiving an NOC. 

BCCI has sought directions for quashing of the impugned amendment 

and consequently refund of the tax paid under protest by it on the 

sponsorship amounts. 

20. In another Writ Petition -4966/ 2013, BCCI has challenged the 

notice dated 14.01.2013 issued by the respondent which seeks to tax 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 24 of 143 

BCCI for sponsorship amounts received by it. That notice was in 

relation to IPL matches held in 2012 at Ferozeshah Kotla stadium. The 

notice observed that certain sponsors including DLF, City Bank, Hero, 

Vodafone, Volkswagen and Karbonn had entered into sponsorship 

agreements with BCCI and not GMR and therefore required BCCI to 

pay the entertainment tax due. This notice was challenged before this 

Court and consequently stay was granted in respect of the demand on 

05.08.2013. 

21. It is urged by Mr. Sawhney, for BCCI, that on site 

advertisements through hoardings, do not constitute "entry" the 

entertainment event. He submitted that what is meant by entry for 

admission is entry to those who are to be entertained, i.e. human 

beings. Inanimate objects like hoardings and other publicity materials 

do not get entertained. Furthermore, it was argued, the sponsorship 

amounts are not given to the sporting event organizer (or the 

proprietor) with the object of gaining a seat; the purpose of such 

sponsorship is to give visibility to the donor/sponsor"s products or 

services. They cannot constitute "entertainment". 

22. DEN Soccer (P) Ltd, (hereafter "DEN", the petitioner in WP 

7495/2014) is, like BCCI, aggrieved by the respondent"s position that 

entertainment tax is payable for sponsorship amounts received by it. 

DEN was granted franchise rights by Football Sports Development 

Private Limited for forming a football team to represent Delhi in a 

football tournament called "Indian Super League" (ISL) organized by 

Football Sports Development Private Limited. The team formed by 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 25 of 143 

DEN is called "De Dynamos Football Club". As franchisee of the 

tournament, DEN is obligated to organize certain matches in Delhi 

and print, sell and distribute tickets for the matches to be held at Delhi. 

It is alleged that DEN approached various organizations and 

companies for providing sponsorships for sponsoring the event. 

Ordinarily the benefits provided to the sponsors for the consideration 

paid for the sponsorship relates to displaying the sponsors company 

logo or trading name, giving the sponsor exclusive or priority booking 

rights, sponsoring prizes or trophies for competition as well as other 

benefits associated with sponsorship. Pertinently DEN mentions that 

the sponsorship is not dependent on the matches or the venue where 

the matches are played but is to apply through the term of the 

agreement/ arrangement irrespective of where the matches are played 

whether in Delhi or any other place. As required by the provisions of 

the Act, DEN, by its letter dated 29.09.2014 applied to the respondent 

tax authority seeking approval for holding 3 matches to be held in 

Delhi on 14-25 and 29 th October, 2014 as part of the ISL tournament 

involving its team Delhi Dynamos. On 01.10.2014, by a letter, the 

respondents issued a "No Prohibitory Order" to DEN to organize the 

three matches at Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi on the 

relevant dates, on ticketed basis. The per rate ticket including the 

number of tickets was specified in the said order. That order was 

subject to certain terms and conditions and one of the conditions was 

that DEN had to submit the details of new sponsors added along with 

Entertainment Tax payable on sponsorship amounts. DEN had by 

letters dated 27.08.2014 and 4.09.2014 applied for exemption under 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 26 of 143 

Section 14, from application of the Entertainment Tax Act; however 

the respondents did not reply. DEN, in these circumstances, challenges 

the notification and the amendments on the same grounds urged by 

BCCI. 

Respondent"s Arguments 

23. The respondent states and its senior counsel, Mr. Parag Tripathi, 

firstly urges that all the events organized by FDCI are in the nature of 

entertainment events and payments received by them, including 

sponsorships, for such entertainment have always been taxable under 

the Act. The fact that FDCI accepted its liability to pay entertainment 

tax for payments received for earlier shows is further strengthened by 

the conduct of the petitioner, which had previously sought exemption 

from payment of entertainment tax under Section 14 of the 

Entertainment Tax Act. FDCI had previously claimed that its events 

were not ticketed events where entry was strictly by invite for select 

class of people. On the basis of this representation, the petitioner was 

granted 100% exemption from its liability to pay entertainment tax in 

respect of events conducted between the years 2002-07; this 

exemption was reduced to 50% for the year 2008-09 and thereafter, 

the government of NCT of Delhi refused to grant any further 

exemption. The revenue argues that dispute with respect to 

entertainment tax on sponsorship arose for the first time only in 2008 

when the government refused to grant exemption in respect of events 

to be conducted in that year and required the petitioner to deposit the 

entire taxable amount with respect to sponsorship payments. Against 

this, the petitioner approached this Court for issue of NOC. Since the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 27 of 143 

petitioner did not protest nor did it raise any objection with respect to 

the previous years, where exemption was sought and granted, the 

petitioner is estopped by conduct from raising the issue now at this 

belated stage and after having claimed and received several 

exemptions. 

24. Mr. Tripathi contends that the amendment is well within the 

defined limits of Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the 

Constitution. He contends that the second Explanation cannot be ultra 

vires the Constitution or the Entertainment Tax Act because it does 

not extend or enlarge the scope of the taxing incidence and has been 

added only for clarificatory purposes. Learned senior counsel relies on 

the phraseology in Section 2(m)(i) and 2(m)(iv) and explains that the 

term "person" includes any person including a company or body of 

individuals or an association. When section 2(m) is read with Section 

6(6), it covers a broad class of payments made in relation to payment. 

Since Section 6(6) already includes payment for admission to an 

entertainment and includes a lump sum paid in the form of a 

subscription, contribution, and donation or otherwise, such lump sum 

then becomes chargeable to tax. Contributions made such as in the 

case of the petitioner are squarely covered under Section 6(6) and 

therefore when this provision is read with Section 2(m), which defines 

payment for admission, it clear as crystal that the impugned 

amendment only seeks to clarify a taxing feature which is already in 

the statute. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 28 of 143 

25. Learned counsel relies upon State of West Bengal Vs. Purvi 

Communications (2005) 3 SCC 711 to contend that the legislature can 

choose the person it seeks to collect the tax levied on entertainment. 

Even in the current case, counsel highlights that the tax is on the 

entertainment and is well within the ambit of Entry 62 of list II. It is 

urged that sponsorship amounts have always been taxable under the 

Entertainment Tax Act as well as the Rules; Rule 11 at Serial no. 10 

requires an organizer of the event to give the names of all the sponsors 

along with the amount sponsored. This declaration too, according to 

senior counsel, suggests that sponsorship amounts were always subject 

to entertainment tax. In essence, it is argued that any person, for any 

payment whatsoever made in connection with an entertainment place 

shall be deemed to make a payment for admission and accordingly the 

provisions of the DEBT Act would apply. 

26. The revenue urges that the petitioner is mistaken in bracketing 

advertisement and sponsorship together and that such grouping flies in 

the face of logic. Counsel urges that while sponsorship and 

advertisement both may give the end result of brand publicity, unlike 

advertisement, in case of sponsorship certain rights get vested in the 

sponsoring party in lieu of the payment. For this reason, FDCI is the 

only proprietor in connection to the event, which collects the funds 

and is covered under Section 2(o) whereas sponsors are a different 

class who make the payment for admission into the place of 

entertainment. The revenue argues that these sponsors get their clients/ 

potential buyers as well as employees to the place of entertainment; 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 29 of 143 

such entry though by invite is possible only because of the 

contributions made by the sponsors. The sponsors may not directly 

watch the program but in an indirect way get their clients to watch the 

shows being hosted by the petitioner. The revenue contends that the 

scheme of the DEBT Act does not make distinctions between direct 

and indirect beneficiaries of an entertainment. Similarly nowhere is 

the definition of "payment for admission" restricted to merely 

payment through ticket. As long as a contribution has been made for 

the admission to an entertainment place the same would be liable to 

tax irrespective of who watches the show. The revenue urges that no 

distinction exists between a person who buys a ticket and a sponsor 

because either way both ultimately fund/ finance the producer/ 

proprietor of the event; while in the latter case the contributor is an 

indirect beneficiary the former is a case of direct beneficiary. If the 

logic of the petitioner had to be followed, that no tax liability accrues 

on a sponsor"s contribution because it is used for the purpose of 

funding an event, then for the same reason no entertainment tax should 

be charged from a ticket holder too. 

27. The revenue argues that the petitioner"s reliance on Form 6, 

specifically the lack of any taxing component, is misplaced. This is 

because Form 6 makes separate provisions for amounts received in 

lieu of advertisement and amounts received as sponsorship. This 

reasserts the revenue"s position that what a sponsor indeed does is 

funds the event in order to guarantee seats/ accommodation for its 

clients/ potential buyers and employees and is indirectly making 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 30 of 143 

payment for admission, chargeable to tax. The revenue also urges that 

the fashion shows organized by the petitioner are entertainment shows, 

unlike seminars and conferences and so any payment made for 

admission will be liable to tax. The respondent argues that when a 

proprietor/ producer organizes an event, the costs are borne by it. This 

is then made up for in generally the following ways: (i) Income from 

sale of tickets (ii) Amount received from sponsors/ advertisers. (iii) 

Amount received from sale of tickets as well as sponsors (iv) income 

from own sources. The revenue urges that in the first three categories 

any payments made are taxable whereas only in the fourth kind i.e. 

where the proprietor funds the event out of his/ her own sources would 

it be beyond the scope of taxability. It is urged that the proprietor 

collects payments from other sources including the persons attending 

the event, sponsors/ advertisers etc. all of whom, in lieu of the 

payment are given the permission to either watch the event or place 

banners/ logos or in certain cases (like sponsors) given the permission 

to bring their clients/ employees to enjoy the entertainment event. In 

respect to such payments if the petitioner"s contention is accepted then 

it would create ample opportunity for organizers like the petitioner to 

evade tax. Similarly in case of IPL and the T-20 matches, which are 

mega events in terms of both outreach and costs, the mainstay of the 

organizer"s fund is from sponsors/ advertisements. In such cases also, 

entertainment tax accrues on both the sponsors" payments as well as 

the tickets. 

28. It is also argued that no new provisions have been added as the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 31 of 143 

impugned Explanation only clarifies an already existing taxing 

provision and as such giving it retrospective effect would not in any 

way hamper or cause hardship to the person being subjected to such 

tax. It relies upon CIT Vs. Gold Coin Health Food Private Ltd (2008) 

9 SCC 622 and ETO Vs. Ambae Picture Palace (1994) 1 SCC 209 and 

contends that the amendment is only clarificatory and in the 

circumstances there is no bar to giving it retrospective effect. Mr. 

Tripathi relies on Raman Lal Bhai Lal Patel v State of Gujarat 

reported as (2008) 5 SCC 449 which held that where the definition is 

an inclusive definition, the use of the word 'includes' indicates an 

intention to enlarge the meaning of the word used in the statute. 

Counsel also relied on ND.P. Namboodripad v. Union of India (2007) 

4 SCC 502, where the Supreme Court observed that: 

" .......... The word "includes" has different meanings in different 
contexts. Standard dictionaries assign more than one meaning 
to the word "include". Webster's Dictionary defines the word 
"include" as synonymous with "comprise" or "contain". 
Illustrated Oxford Dictionary defines the word "include" as: (i) 
comprise or reckon in as a part of a whole; (ii) treat or regard 
as so included. Collins Dictionary of English Language defines 
the word "includes" as: (i) to have as contents or part of the 
contents; be made up of or contain; (ii) to add as part of 
something else; put in as part of a set, group or a category; (iii) 
to contain as a secondary or minor ingredient or element. It is 
no doubt true that generally when the word "include" is used in 
a definition clause, it is used as a word of enlargement, that is 
to make the definition extensive and not restrictive ........" 

To a similar effect, the decision in Hamdard (Wakf) Laboratories v. 

Dy. Labour Commissioner reported as (2007) 5 SCC 281 was cited. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 32 of 143 

29. It is submitted that as a consequence, the term must be 

construed as comprehending not only such things, which they signify 

according to their natural import, but also those things, which the 

interpretation clause declares that they shall include. It is therefore, 

argued that inclusion of sponsorship as a mode facilitating entry to an 

entertainment event is within the legislature"s powers. It is submitted 

that the expression 'admission to entertainment' is not confined to right 

to seats only but also includes other accommodation at an 

entertainment event. Because of the inclusive nature of the definition 

in the Act, the term 'admission to entertainment" is wide enough to 

cover participation in the event of the type done by the sponsors, 

associate partners etc. Learned senior counsel submitted that there is 

nothing abhorrent or inherently repugnant in the idea of expanding the 

natural meaning of the word for taxation purposes and courts, in 

several decisions, have accepted the introduction of such legislative 

devices. 

30. The revenue argues that it has been collecting entertainment tax 

from sponsors right from the inception of the Entertainment Tax Act 

including the One Day Cricket matches organized by Delhi District 

Cricket Association (DDCA), T-20 IPL Match organized by M/s. 

GMR Ltd. and various other live concerts being conducted in the city. 

Furthermore, the revenue contends that no new tax has been 

demanded and the petitioner has only been asked to deposit security 

amount equivalent to 100% tax at the time of applying for NOC which 

subsequently got rejected. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 33 of 143 

31. By way of persuasive legislative practice and precedents, 

amendments made to the entertainment tax enactments of 

Maharashtra, Goa, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have been relied 

upon. It is stressed that in these enactments too, sponsorships and 

lump sum amounts received by proprietors are treated as taxing 

incidents in relation to the entertainment concerned. Learned senior 

counsel submitted that as a result, the amendments made to the 

Entertainment Tax Act cannot be termed as ultra vires or in any 

manner unenforceable. 

Analysis and Conclusions 

32. The vires of the impugned amendment to Section 2(m) which, by 

the Second Explanation brings to tax sponsorship amounts paid, in 

lieu of advertisements by deeming it to be payment for admission is 

premised upon the deemed fiction and inclusive definition. It is 

contended that sponsorship amounts received by proprietors for the 

purpose of organizing and putting together an event do not fall within 

the purview of the Entertainment Tax Act. Through a deeming fiction, 

sponsorship amounts, value of the goods supplied or services rendered 

in lieu of advertisement/promotion are now bracketed as payment for 

admission to an entertainment; the petitioners argue that the legislature 

has gone beyond its competence and instead of levying tax on 

payment for admission to an entertainment, is now levying taxes on 

advertisements and is going beyond the pale of Entry 62 of List II of 

the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution which is nothing but 

colourable exercise of power. The Petitioners argue that by virtue of 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 34 of 143 

Entry 31 and Entry 92 of List I taxes on advertisements are covered 

therein and consequently the State legislatures are barred from 

legislating on those subjects. They also argue that the impugned 

amendment vitiates their fundamental right to equality before law, 

guaranteed under Articles 13 and 14 as the impugned amendment 

seeks to treat two distinct and unequal classes similarly by bracketing 

sponsors and persons paying for entertainment together. There is an 

intelligible differentia between the two classes and in the absence of 

any rational nexus of treating the two classes alike, the impugned 

amendment violates the Constitution as well as the Entertainment Tax 

Act. 

33. The Entertainment Tax Act was enacted with the purpose of 

subjecting to tax any entertainment organized or provided for in the 

National Capital Territory of Delhi. An entertainment is any 

performance or show, which gives pleasure, or a show, organized for 

the purpose of providing enjoyment to some or to a group of people. 

The scheme of the Act defines "entertainment" in the widest manner. 

It is not restricted to merely cinema shows, dramatic or musical 

performances or other conventional forms of entertainment. While no 

standard definition exists to describe the constituent elements of 

entertainment, some Acts which are pari materia, such as the Uttar 

Pradesh Entertainments and Betting Tax Act define entertainment 

under Section 2(g) to include any "exhibition, performance, 

amusement, game, sport or race (including horse race) to which 

persons are admitted for payment and in the case of cinematograph 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 35 of 143 

exhibitions, includes exhibition of news-reels, documentaries, 

advertisement shorts or slides, whether before or during the exhibition 

of a feature films or separately;". The Bombay enactment is phrased 

similarly. The Entertainment Tax Act defines entertainment under 

Section 2(i) as: 

"entertainment" means any exhibition, performance, amusement, 
game, sport or race (including horse race) or in the case of 
cinematograph exhibitions, cover exhibitions of news reels, 
documentaries, cartoons, advertisement shorts or slides, whether 
before or during the exhibition of a feature film or separately, and 
also includes entertainment through cable service and direct-to-
home (DTH) service." 

34. As can be seen from the definition, the state legislature sought 

to give widest power for taxing on entertainment. In the case of the 

petitioner FDCI, the first issue, which needs to be addressed, is 

whether as a fashion development and promotion society, which 

conducts fashion shows provides entertainment by hosting such 

shows. In Geeta Enterprise Vs State of U.P. & Ors, (1983) 4 SCC 202, 

a three Judge bench of the Supreme Court in the context of the U.P. 

Entertainment and Betting Tax Act, 1937, laid down certain tests to 

decipher if a given event is an entertainment for the purpose of levying 

tax. These were: 

"(1)That the show, performance, game or sport, etc. must 
contain a public colour in that the show should be open to 
public in a hall, theatre or any other place where members of 
the public are invited or attend the show; 

(2) That the show may provide any kind of amusement whether 
sport, game or even a performance which requires some 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 36 of 143 

amount of skill; in some of the cases, it has been held that even 
holding of a tambola in a club hall amounts to entertainment 
although the playing of tambola does, to some extent, involves a 
little skill; 

(3) That even if admission to the hall may be free but if the 
exhibitor derives some benefit in terms of money it would be 
deemed to be an entertainment; 

(4) That the duration of the show or the identity of the persons 
who operates the machine and derives pleasure or 
entertainment or that the operator who pays himself feels 
entertained is wholly irrelevant in judging the actual meaning 
of the word "entertainment" as used in Section 2(3) of the Act. 
SO also the fact that the income derived from the show is 
shared by one or more persons who run the show." 

35. Geeta Enterprise (supra), as is apparent, was rendered in the 

context of entry to a video parlour where the customer operated a 

video machine enabling viewership of movies, participating in video 

games, sports etc. While no admission fee to view the show was 

collected, however in order to operate the machine for 30 seconds, the 

user would have to insert a 50 paisa coin into the machine which was 

later collected from by the manufacturer of the machine and a certain 

portion of the collection went to the petitioner. The court held that the 

levy of entertainment tax applied in the facts of the case. The 

respondents have also relied on the decision of the Bombay High 

Court in The Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council Vs State 

of Maharashtra [2013] 59 VST 129 (Bom) which involved an event 

organized by a jewellery promoting company which scheduled annual 

exhibitions for promoting export and trade of jewellery and gems and 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 37 of 143 

prospective buyers allowed entry through invitations. The High Court 

refused to grant relief and deemed the exhibitions to be entertainment 

events within the ambit of Bombay Entertainment Duty Act on an 

application of the tests prescribed in Geeta Enterprise (supra). A 

significant feature -which persuaded the High Court in that instance, 

to hold that the event constituted "entertainment" was that 

considerable and substantial registration fees was collected from 

participants. 

36. This Court is unable to agree with the Bombay view. First, that 

was in the context of a different set of facts -here no entry fees are 

collected from any viewer or participant. Secondly, in Gems and 

Jewellery (supra) the Bombay High Court overlooked the distinction 

between a business promotion event and an entertainment event. Not 

all of the former, which involve elements of amusement or 

entertainment, are entertainment events. To elucidate, for instance, a 

private dinner for which entry is through invitation alone, involving 

private performance by some musicians, or playing of recorded music, 

is not "entry to entertainment" event, within the meaning of the Act. 

Likewise, free entry to a speech or performance, by a popular public 

figure, or motivational speaker, or a gratis performance by a popular 

entertainer which involves considerable expense, borne by a few 

sponsors (without which the event cannot take place) would not be an 

admission to an entertainment, unless those seeking the entertainment 

event are made to pay. Similarly, the judgment in Poorvi (supra) in 

the opinion of this court is of no assistance. That case did not concern 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 38 of 143 

entry to an entertainment event; it sought to tax a cable operator-much 

the same way the present Act does, through a separate definition as 

well as a charging mechanism. The relevant provisions of the state 

Act, in that case read as follows: 

"(4a) Where any owner, or any person for the time being in 
possession, of any electrical, electronic or mechanical device, is 
a cable operator and receives through such device the signal of 
any performance, film or any other programme telecast, and 
thereafter such owner or person, against payment received or 
receivable,-

(i) exhibits such performance, film or programme through cable 
television network directly to customers, or 

(ii) transmits such signal to a sub-cable operator, who in turn 
provides cable service for exhibition of such performance, film 
or programme to the customers, 

such owner or person shall be liable to pay tax from the month 
in which he exhibits such performance, film or programme or 
transmits such signal to a sub-cable operator on the basis of his 
monthly gross receipt at such rate, not exceeding twenty five per 
centum of the monthly gross receipt, as may be specified by the 
State Government by notification published in the Official 
Gazette." 

In Amit Kumar(supra) the Supreme Court upheld the view of the High 

Court that the show put up was a device and "subterfuge" with the 

intention of evading provisions of the Entertainment Tax Act in that 

state. The court upheld the finding that there was no evidence to show 

and therefore it was difficult to believe that the fashion show was held 

merely to attract students. An affirming judgment, the decision did not 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 39 of 143 

cite any authority. Nor did it advert to Geeta Enterprises (supra) and 

the various tests indicated by courts. 

37. At this stage, it would be essential to extract the relevant 

provisions of the Entertainment Tax Act applicable in this case. 

Section 2(i) defines the term "entertainment" it reads as follows:-

"(i) "entertainment" means any exhibition, performance, 
amusement, game, sport or race (including horse race) or in the 
case of cinematograph exhibitions, cover exhibition of news-
reels, documentaries, cartoons, advertisement shorts or slides, 
whether before or during the exhibition of a feature film or 
separately, and also includes entertainment through cable 
service;" 

Section 2(m) of the Act, after amendment with effect from 1st 

October, 2012 reads as under:-

(m) "payment for admission" includes-

(i) any payment made by a person for seats or other 
accommodation in any form in a place of entertainment; 

(ii) any payment for cable service; 

(iii) any payment made for the loan or use of any instrument or 
contrivance which enables a person to get a normal or better 
view or hearing or enjoyment of the entertainment, which 
without the aid of such instrument or contrivance such person 
would not get; 

(iv) any payment, by whatever name called for any purpose 
whatsoever, connected with an entertainment, which a person is 
required to make in any form as a condition of attending, or 
continuing to attend the entertainment, either in addition to the 
payment, if any, for admission to the entertainment or without 
any such payment for admission; 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 40 of 143 

(v) any payment made by a person who having been admitted to 
one part of a place of entertainment is subsequently admitted to 
another part thereof, for admission to which a payment 
involving tax or more tax is required; 

Explanation 1: Any subscription raised, contribution received 
or donation collected in connection with an entertainment, 
where admission is partly or entirely by tickets/ invitation 
specifying the amount of admission or reduced rate of ticket 
shall be deemed to be payment for admission; 

Explanation 2: Any sponsorship amount paid or value of goods 
supplied or services rendered or benefits provided to the 
organizer of an entertainment programme in lieu of 
advertisement of sponsor's produce/brand name or otherwise 
shall be deemed to be payment for admission." 

Explanations 1 and 2 were inserted on 1st October, 2012, with 

retrospective effect from 1st April, 1998."Proprietor" is defined by 

Section 2(o); it reads as under:-

"2(o) "proprietor" in relation to any entertainment includes any 
person-

(i) connected with the organisation of the entertainment, of 
(ii) charged with the work of admission to the entertainment, or 

(iii) responsible for, or for the time being in charge of, the 
management thereof;" 

38. Thus, the terms relevant for purposes of the enactment are 

entertainment, payment and "payment for admission"; equally 

"proprietor" too is relevant in relation to any entertainment for the 

purposes of the Act. Section 6 is the charging provision; it provides as 

follows:-


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 41 of 143 

"Section 6 -Tax on payment for admission to entertainment (1) 
Subject to the provisions of this Act, there shall be levied and 
paid on all payments for admission to any entertainment, other 
than an entertainment to which section 7 applies, an 
entertainment tax at such rate not exceeding one hundred per 
cent of each such payment as the government may from time to 
time notify in this behalf, and the tax shall be collected by 
proprietor from the person making the payment for admission 
and paid to the government in the manner prescribed. 

(2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall preclude the government 
from notifying different rates of entertainment tax for different 
classes of entertainment or for different payments for admission 
to entertainment 

(3) Where the payment for admission to an entertainment 
together with the tax is not a multiple of fifty paise, then 
notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) or sub-
section (2) or any notification issued thereunder, the tax shall 
be increased to such extend and be so computed that the 
aggregate of such payment for admission to entertainment and 
the tax is round off to the next higher multiple of fifty paise, and 
such increased tax shall also be collected by the proprietor and 
paid to the government in the manner prescribed. 

(4) If in any entertainment, referred to in sub-section (1), to 
which admission is generally on payment, any person is 
admitted free of charge or on a concessional rate, the same 
amount of tax shall be payable as if such person was admitted 
on full payment. 

(5) Where the admission to a place of entertainment is generally 
on payment, and if any entertainment is held in lieu of the 
regular entertainment programme without payment of 
admission or with payment of admission less than what would 
have been paid in the normal course, the proprietor shall be 
liable to pay tax which would have been payable in a normal 
course at full house capacity or the tax for the programme held 
in lieu of the regular entertainment programme whichever is 
higher. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 42 of 143 

(6) Where the payment for admission to an entertainment, 
referred to in sub-section (1), is made wholly or partly, the 
means of a lump sum paid as subscription, contribution, 
donation or otherwise, the tax shall be paid on the amount of 
such lump sum and of the amount of the payment for admission, 
if any, made otherwise 

(7) Where in a hotel or a restaurant, or a club, entertainment is 
provided by way of cabarets, floor shows, or entertainment is 
organised on special occasion along with any meal or 
refreshment with a view to attract customers, the same shall be 
taxed at a rate to be notified under sub-section (1)." 

Section 8 prescribes relates to information, which has to be provided 

by a person, who holds entertainment. The said section reads:-

"Section 8 -Information before holding entertainment 

1) No entertainment on which tax is leviable shall be held 
without prior information being given to the Commissioner in 
the manner prescribed. (2) No proprietor of a cable television 
network or video cinema shall provide entertainment unless he 
obtains permission from the Commissioner in the manner 
prescribed. 

(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any other 
law for the time being in force, the Commissioner, or any other 
officer authorised by the government in this behalf, may after 
giving reasonable opportunity of hearing to the proprietor, 
prohibit the holding of such entertainment and may also take all 
reasonable steps to ensure that order of prohibition is complied 
with, if he is satisfied that-

(a) the proprietor has given any false information which is 
likely to result in the evasion of tax; 
(b) the proprietor has failed to deposit the security due; 

(c) the proprietor has committed breach of any of the provisions 
of this Act or the rules made thereunder." 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 43 of 143 

39. Sub-section (1) to Section 8 of the Act stipulates that no 

entertainment on which tax is leviable shall be held without prior 

information to the Commissioner in the prescribed form. It mandates 

furnishing of prior information by a person who wants to hold 

"entertainment" on which tax is leviable. 

40. The exemption provision is in Section 14 of the Act, which 
reads:-

"Section 14 -Exemption (1) The government may, for 
promotion of arts, culture or sports, by general or special 
order, exempt any individual entertainment programme or class 
or entertainments from liability to pay tax under this Act. 

(2) The government may, by general or special order, exempt in 
public interest any class of audience or spectators from liability 
to pay tax under this Act, (3) Without prejudice to the generality 
of the provisions of sub-section (l) where the government is 
satisfied that any entertainment,-

(a) is wholly of an educational character; or 

(b) is provided partly for educational or partly for scientific 
purposes by a society not conducted or established for profit; or 

(c) is provided by a society not conducted for profit and 
established solely for the purpose of promoting public health or 
the interests of agriculture, or a manufacturing industry, and 
consists solely of an exhibition of articles which are of material 
interest in connection with questions relating to public health or 
agriculture or are the products of the industry for promoting the 
interest whereof the society exists, or the materials, machinery 
appliances or foodstuff used in the production of such products; 

it may, subject to such terms and conditions as it may deem fit 
to impose, grant exemption to such entertainment from payment 
of tax under this Act: PROVIDED that the government may 
cancel such exemption if it is satisfied that the exemption was 
obtained through fraud or misrepresentation, or that the 
proprietor of such entertainment has failed to comply with any 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 44 of 143 

of the terms or conditions imposed or directions issued in this 
behalf and thereafter the proprietor shall be liable to pay the 
tax which would have been payable had not the entertainment 
been so exempted. 

(4) Where the government is satisfied that the entertainment 
programme is not conducted for profit and the entire gross 
proceeds from payment for admission as defined in clause (1) of 
section 2 of an entertainment are to be devoted to philanthropic, 
religious or charitable purposes, without any deductions 
whatsoever on account of the expenses of the entertainment, it 
may, subject to the rules made under this Act, grant exemption 
to such entertainment from payment of tax under this Act on 
such terms and conditions as it may deem fit to impose. 

(5) Where any exemption from payment of tax is granted under 
sub-section (4), the proprietor of such entertainment shall 
furnish to the Commissioner such documents and records and in 
such in manner as may be prescribed. 

(6) If the proprietor of an entertainment exempted under sub-
section (4) fails to furnish the documents and records required 
under sub-section (5), or fails to comply with any conditions 
imposed or directions issued in this behalf, or if the government 
is not satisfied with the correctness of such documents or 
records, the government may cancel he exemption so granted 
and thereupon the proprietor shall be liable to pay the tax 
Which would have been payable had not the entertainment been 
so exempted. 

(7) The government may for reasons to be recorded in writing 
grant export facto exemption from payment of entertainment tax 
is respect of any programme." 

41. The above provision authorises the GNCTD to exempt certain 

classes of programmes from part or full payment of entertainment tax. 

The conditions inter alia, include those for submission of documents 

and records can be imposed. Rules 35 and 36 prescribe the procedure, 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 45 of 143 

which should be followed for availing exemption under Section 14 of 

the Act. Rules 35 and 36 are as under: 

"35. Exemption by Government under section 14(3) of the Act 
(1) An application for exemption under sub-section (3) of 
section 14 of the Act shall be presented to the Commissioner at 
least fifteen days before the proposed date of entertainment 
stating the full description and nature of entertainment and any 
other details which may be required by the Commissioner with 
necessary proof as also the particular clause of sub-section (3) 
of section 14 of the Act under which exemption is sought: 
PROVIDED that an application may be admitted after the 
expiry of the period thereof, if the applicant satisfies the 
Commissioner or any other office authorised by him that he had 
sufficient cause for not preferring the application within that 
period. (2) The Government may grant exemption on such terms 
and conditions as it may deem fit to impose in the particular 
case. 

(3) Where exemption is granted a certificate shall be issued to 
the applicant by the Commissioner or any other officer 
authorised by him and the same shall, on demand be produced 
before an inspecting officer. The proprietor shall comply with 
the condition stated in the certificate. 

(4) Where the Government is satisfied, it may grant the 
exemption after taking such security as it may consider 
necessary to secure payment of the tax due in case the 
exemption is cancelled under the proviso to sub-section (3) of 
section 14 of the Act. (5) The proprietor of the exempted 
entertainment shall submit to the Commissioner all tickets for 
admission for attestation in the manner required by the 
Commissioner before bringing them into use. He shall also 
prepare and submit to the Commissioner or any other officer 
authorised by him, within fifteen days from the date of 
entertainment a full and true account of the tickets issued at 
different rates and the gross amount collected from the sale 
thereof along with the counterfoils of used tickets and all the 
unused ticket books. He shall also furnish a full and true 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 46 of 143 

account of the expenditure incurred along with the vouchers, if 
so required by the Commissioner or any other office authorised 
by him, within fifteen days from the date of entertainment. 

36. Exemption by Government under section 14(4) of the Act. 

(1) The application for exemption under sub-section (4) of 
section 14 of the Act shall be presented to the Commissioner, at 
least, fifteen days before the date of the entertainment stating 
clearly the full description, the nature of entertainment and the 
purposes of entertainment with necessary proof: PROVIDED 
that the application may be admitted after the expiry of the 
period thereof, if the applicant satisfies the Commissioner or 
any other office authorised by him that he had sufficient cause 
for not preferring it within that period. (2) The application for 
exemption shall be made in the manner required by the 
Commissioner. (3) Where the Government is satisfied it may 
grant the exemption after taking such security as it may 
consider necessary to secure payment of the due tax in case the 
exemption is cancelled under sub-section (6) of section 14 of the 
Act. (4) Where exemption is granted a certificate shall be issued 
to the applicant by the Commissioner or the officer authorised 
by him and the same shall, on demand, be produced before an 
inspection officer. (5) The proprietor of the exempted 
entertainment shall submit to the Commissioner all tickets for 
admission for attestation in the manner required by the 
Commissioner before bringing them into use. He shall also 
prepare and submit to the Commissioner within fifteen days 
from he date of entertainment full and true account of the ticket 
issued at different rates and the gross amounts collected from 
the sale thereof along with the counterfoils of used tickets and 
all the unused ticket books. He shall also furnish a full and true 
account of the expenditure incurred along with the vouchers, if 
so required by the Commissioner, within fifteen days from the 
date of the entertainment. (6) The proof of utilisation of the 
entire gross proceeds for philanthropic, religious or charitable 
purposes shall be furnished by the proprietor of the 
entertainment within thirty days from the date of entertainment 
in such manner as may be required by the Commissioner: 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 47 of 143 

PROVIDED that if the proprietor satisfies the Commissioner 
that he had sufficient reasons for not submitting the proof of 
utilisation within the period prescribed, the Commissioner may 
extend the period of time to extent as he may deem fit." 

42. In the case of FDCI, the events are non-ticketed events where 

entry is by special invite of the organizers and are handed out to those 

who might have potential interest in the products being showcased at 

the shows. These shows do not have a public colour in the sense that 

these events are for a select audience. There is no provision for the 

public to buy tickets to watch the show. In fact, no tickets are sold 

publicly. FDCI as well as its various organizing partners, who have 

business interest in these shows, to further their business select the 

audience for the shows. At fashion shows the nature of the goods 

showcased are generally luxury goods or brands and these shows are 

generally styled glamorously with after parties, special appearances by 

models etc. FDCI"s position is that the shows are not held entertaining 

or providing amusement but for the purpose of furthering business; the 

dominant purpose here is promoting business; if incidentally the 

audience is entertained it would not imply that the primary purpose for 

organizing the event is entertainment. These events are held for a fixed 

audience picked by the organizers themselves; the "public" element is 

absent in the case of FDCI. It is true that the events in question 

showcase luxury goods in luxury locations like five star hotels and 

convention centres. However, by that reason alone the events cannot 

be labeled as entertainment shows. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 48 of 143 

43. The Govt. of NCT of Delhi relied on Amit Kumar v State of 

Uttar Pradesh (2008) 1 SCC 528, where the Supreme Court held that 

the fashion show in question which was organized for promoting an 

arts and culture college was actually an entertainment program. The 

Court expressed skepticism about the event being organized for the 

purpose of educating prospective students interested in joining the 

arts, fashion designing and modeling institute as the show was being 

promoted with the object of inviting people to watch glamour and 

modeling and to the see the world of exotic fashion in Gorakhpur. The 

issue at hand is different-FDCI sends out the invites to potential 

buyers and does not advertise its invite. Unlike in the case of Amit 

Kumar (supra) wherein a competitive pageant was held to decide Mr. 

and Mrs. Gorakhpur, FDCI"s events are organized by a group of 

industry experts with the aim of furthering their business. FDCI"s 

events are business and trade promotion events, entry to which cannot 

be categorized as entry to entertainment for the simple reason that 

those attending the shows are not deriving any pleasure or amusement. 

They are witnessing the show simply to further their business 

interests. If FDCI"s events were to be classified as entertainment 

shows, the reasons for classification would have to then be applied to 

various trade shows like the automobile exhibitions or defence shows 

where products are showcased at high end venues to a niche clientele 

for the prospect of furthering the respective industries. When 

prospective buyers from the industry attend these events, for free 

based on a special invite, it would be fallacious to assume that they are 

being entertained. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 49 of 143 

Whether payment for admission includes sponsorship 

44. FDCI, to organize its events requires funding. These funds are 

given by sponsors through agreements, which in lieu of sponsorship 

give certain rights to the sponsors with respect to the events. The 

amendment of 01.10.2012, which introduced the second Explanation, 

through deeming fiction seeks to tax sponsorship amounts as payment 

for admission under Section 2(m). The petitioners contend that 

payment for admission to a seat or other accommodation is limited to 

those cases, where people pay for the purpose of securing a seat or any 

other accommodation for the purpose of being entertained. On the 

other hand it is contended by the revenue that "seats or other 

accommodation" appearing in Section 2(m)(i) means accommodation 

in any form in the widest sense and will not attract the principle of 

ejusdem generis to mean "accommodation for those persons who are 

being entertained". The revenue relies upon Union of India v Alok 

Kumar (2010) 5 SCC 349 to contend that in this case there are not 

several different expressions representative of one genus. 

45. In the present case, "accommodation" necessarily means all 

kinds of accommodation. Once any payment for admission to 

entertainment is made, Section 6, the charging provision that subjects 

to tax all such payments is attracted. Section 6(6) taxes any payment 

for admission to entertainment under Section 6(1) made by way of 

subscription, contribution and donation or otherwise. The revenue 

contends that the phrase "or otherwise" in Section 6(6) is to be 

construed widely to include sponsorship amounts. It relies on the 

decision of the Supreme Court in Lila Vati Bai v State of Bombay AIR 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 50 of 143 

1957 SC 521 where it was held that when the legislature uses the term 

"otherwise" in a statute it does so to cover all possible cases occurring 

due to any reason. On the other hand the petitioners argue that Section 

6(6) is towards any payment made in lieu of being entertained and 

sponsorship amounts are outside the purview of the section. The 

petitioner argues that sponsors are not the ones being entertained and 

are actually part of the organizers and fit within the definition of 

proprietor under Section 2(o). 

46. Section 2(m) which defines "payment for admission" includes-

"(i) any payment made by a person for seats or other 
accommodation in any form in a place of entertainment; 

………. 

Explanation 1: Any subscription raised, contribution received or 
donation collected in connection with an entertainment, where 
admission is partly or entirely by tickets/ invitation specifying the 
amount of admission or reduced rate of ticket shall be deemed to 
be payment for admission; 

Explanation 2: Any sponsorship amount paid or value of goods 
supplied or services rendered or benefits provided to the organizer 
of an entertainment programme in lieu of advertisement of 
sponsor"s product/ brand name or otherwise shall be deemed to be 
payment for admission;" 

47. The explanation to Section 2(m) was added on 21.09.2012 and 

given retrospective effect from 01.04.1998. Prior to the amendment a 

single explanation to Section 2(m) covered "Any subscription raised, 

contribution received, or donation collected in connection with an 

entertainment, where admission is partly or entirely by tickets/ 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 51 of 143 

invitation specifying the amount of admission or reduced rate of ticket 

shall be deemed to be payment for admission;". 

48. A plain reading of the provisions would show that the new 

amendment seeks to tax sponsorship amounts. To test the vires of the 

amendment it is important to ascertain the nature of sponsorship. 

Sponsorship is typically given by an entity in return for a reciprocal 

business gain. The Merriman-Webster dictionary as defines the term 

"sponsor" as follows: 

"a person or an organization that pays for or plans and 
carries out a project or activity; especially: one that pays 
the cost of a radio or television program usually in return 
for advertising time during its course.." 

[https://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary/sponsor (accessed on 

14 August, 2017 at 15:32 hours]. The Concise Oxford English 

dictionary [10 th Ed] defines "sponsor" as a person or organisation that 

pays for or contributes to the costs of a sporting or artistic event or a 

radio or television programme in return for advertising. Thus, 

sponsors are those individuals or concerns who provide monetary 

contribution and in return for some rights or privileges, which may 

include advertisement rights. Through the Second Explanation, read 

with Section 6, the legislature includes sponsorship into the taxing 

ambit. 

49. Two questions arise in the circumstance -firstly can the 

legislature increase the scope of taxability by inserting an Explanation 

and secondly is such inclusion of sponsorship amounts within the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 52 of 143 

scope and object of the Entertainment Tax Act read as a whole. An 

Explanation is added to clear any ambiguities that may arise while 

interpreting or applying a provision of the statute; it is not meant to 

enlarge the scope of the original provision. It only explains what has 

already been given and cannot through the process of explaining or 

clarifying seek to add that which is not there in the original provision. 

When there is some challenge to the scope of the explanation, it is 

useful to discern any ambiguity by testing its true effect in the context 

of the whole Act. In this context the decision of the Supreme Court in 

Sundaram Pillai Vs Pattabiraman (1985) 1 SCC 591 where a detailed 

analysis of statutory interpretation and the scope of "explanation" was 

done is of relevance. The Court held that: 

"53. Thus, from a conspectus of the authorities referred to above, it 
is manifest that the object of an explanation to a statutory 
provision is-

(a) To explain the meaning and intendment of the Act itself, 
(b) Where there is any obscurity or vagueness in the main 
enactment, to clarify the same so as to make it consistent with 
the dominant object which it seems to subserve, 
(c) To provide an additional support to the dominant object of the 
Act in order to make it meaningful and purposeful, 
(d) An Explanation cannot in any way interfere with or change the 
enactment or any part thereof but where some gap is left which 
is relevant for the purpose of the Explanation, in order to 
supress the mischief and advance the object of the Act it can 
help or assist the Court in interpreting the true purport and 
intendment of the enactment, and 
(e) It cannot, however, take away a statutory right with which any 
person under a statute has been clothed or set at naught the 
working of an Act by becoming an hindrance in the 
interpretation of the same."

50. An explanation, therefore, cannot widen the scope of the 

original provision and definitely not as a tactic, which would be at 

conflict or odds with the main enactment or the existing provision. It 

may be used to advance the scope of the Act or to suppress a mischief. 

In this background, it is necessary to put to test the scope of the 

Explanation in the context of the object and effect of the 

Entertainment Tax Act. The Entertainment Tax Act was enacted to tax 

any payment for entertainment and specifically for admission in a 

place of entertainment. It was enacted by the legislature in pursuance 

to Entry 62, List II of the Seventh schedule. Entry 62 is: 

"62. Taxes on luxuries, including taxes on entertainments, 
amusements, betting and gambling." 

The scope of this entry is to subject to tax any person spending on 

luxuries, entertainments and amusements as well as the subject of 

entertainment. Thus, this entry allows a State to legislate on luxuries 

and pursuant to which the Entertainment Tax Act was enacted. The 

Entertainment Tax Act seeks to tax any payment for admission to a 

place of entertainment. The question is whether sponsorship is 

payment to admission. To determine this, the pith and substance of the 

Act will have to be examined. In E.V. Chinnaiah Vs State of Andhra 

Pradesh &Ors(2005) 1 SCC 394, a five judge bench of the Supreme 

Court held that while the power to legislate is derived from Article 

245, the areas of legislation are demarcated by the three lists under 

Schedule VII. It was held that: 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 54 of 143 

"32. One of the proven methods of examining the legislative 
competence of an enactment is by the application of doctrine of 
pith and substance. This doctrine is applied when the legislative 
competence of a Legislature with regard to a particular 
enactment is challenged with reference to the Entries in various 
lists and if there is a challenge to the legislative competence the 
courts will try to ascertain the pith and substance of such 
enactment in question is genuinely referable to the field of 
legislation allotted to the State under the constitutional 
scheme." 

51. One time -honoured principle applied to determine legislative 

competence is that a Court must not take a doctrinaire or pedantic 

approach but should weigh the question in a liberal manner. Though 

the entries in the Seventh Schedule only outline the fields of 

legislation, yet, when legislative competence with respect to an Act is 

challenged, its legitimacy has to be traced keeping in mind the scope 

as well as object and reasons of the Act with reference to the Entries in 

either List II or List III of the Seventh Schedule. The pith and 

substance of the Act will have to be discerned in light of its objects, 

scope and effect and the entire Act including its Rules would have to 

be studied as a whole. If it can be proved that the impugned legislation 

is one, which is beyond the field of legislation allotted to the State, 

then the Court is well within its power to strike down such enactment 

as ultra vires the Constitution on the ground of legislative 

incompetence. 

52. Taxing statutes are distinct. While testing for legislative 

competence as noticed under Article 248(2) as well as in Hoechst 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 55 of 143 

Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs State of Bihar (1983) 4 SCC 45, to determine 

whether the imposition of a certain tax is within legislative 

competence the nature of the tax will have to be determined through 

the charging section; what a legislature intends to tax is to be seen 

from the charging section of the Act. The question here is, whether in 

imposing entertainment tax on sponsors who make contributions in 

lieu of advertisements, the state legislature is incidentally acting 

beyond its field of legislation. 

53. Section 6(1) which is the charging section in the Act subjects to 

levy all payments for admission to any entertainment while Section 

6(6) directs that where payment for admission has been made by way 

of subscription, contribution, donation or otherwise, tax shall be paid 

on all such payments. For ease of reference Section 6 has been 

reproduced below: 

"6. Tax on payment for admission to entertainment 
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, there shall be levied and 
paid on all payments for admission to any entertainment, 
other than an entertainment to which Section 7 applies, an 
entertainment tax at such rate not exceeding one hundred 
per cent of each such payment as the Government may from 
time to time notify in this behalf, and the tax shall be 
collected by the proprietor from the person making the 
payment for admission and paid to the Government in the 
manner prescribed. 
…………………………. 
…………………………. 
(6) Where the payment for admission to an entertainment, 
referred to in sub-section (1), is made wholly or partly, by 
means of a lump sum paid as subscription, contribution, 
donation or otherwise, the tax shall be paid on the amount of 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 56 of 143 

such lump sum and on the amount of payment for admission, 
if any, made otherwise." 

A proprietor in the context of Section 6 and for the purpose of the 

issue at hand is defined under Section 2(o) as: 

"(o) "Proprietor" in relation to any entertainment includes any 
person-

(i) Connected with the organization of the entertainment" 

54. In this backdrop what is to be determined is whether 

sponsorship amounts fall within the classification under Section 6(6). 

The substance of levy under the Act is payment for admission in any 

form to a place of entertainment. The taxing incidence therefore, is 

payment for admission to entertainment, not the entertainment event 

itself. When juxtaposed with the scheme of the Act, which is to tax 

payment made for admission to entertainment, the question, which 

presents itself, is whether sponsorship amounts, made through 

agreements, for business purposes are payments for admission to a 

place of entertainment. Payment for admission to a place of 

entertainment, in common parlance, would mean payment for the 

purpose of entry to enjoy or derive amusement from the entertainment 

event. What sponsors do is diametrically opposite to what is 

contemplated under the Act. A sponsor is a secondary organizer of the 

event. While the primary or the chief organizer might be a person who 

organizes the event in the physical sense, by arranging equipment, 

entering into performance agreements, coordinating between various 

stakeholders of an event etc., a sponsor is the one who provides 

monetary support to the primary organizer. This monetary support is 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 57 of 143 

conditional; certain rights through agreements flow from the primary 

organizer to the sponsor. Through this agreement the sponsor is 

allowed access to the place of entertainment but not in the sense 

contemplated by the Act. The sponsor accesses the place of 

entertainment for setting up its advertisements, banners logos etc. all 

of which are part of organizing the event. When a sponsor is allowed 

to set up a stall for the purpose of selling its products, the sponsor has 

in effect bought space to sell its products and further its business. A 

sponsor does not make the payments for gratification or for deriving 

pleasure from the events; these are business transactions to be 

understood in the commercial sense. Thus, the sponsor is not one 

getting entertained. The Entertainment Tax Act, under Section 6(6) 

taxes any payment made through subscription, contribution donation 

or otherwise. The common denominator in all such payments is that 

these classes of payments are made for securing seats or any other 

accommodation in return for entertainment and not for furthering 

businesses or for advertising. 

55. There is authority-the petitioners had relied on some judgments 

in this regard-for the proposition that mere definitional change of a 

term, in a taxing enactment, without change or amendment of the 

charging provision, does not result in a valid levy. Thus, in M/s Tata 

Sky Ltd (supra), the Supreme Court held it to be so, in the following 

terms: 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 58 of 143 

"36. On behalf of the State the imposition of levy on DTH was 
sought to be justified on the basis of sub-clause(4) of clause (d) 
of section 2 which reads as under: 

"(iv) any payment made by a person by way of contribution or 
subscription or installation and connection charges or any 
other charges, by whatever name called, for providing access to 
any entertainment, whether for a specified period or on a 
continuous basis;" 

37. In our view, the submission is untenable for more reasons 
than one. First, section 2 (d) (iv)is only the measure of tax and 
it does not create the charge which is created by section 3. The 
question of going to the measure of the tax would arise only if it 
is found that the charge of tax is attracted. Under section 3 read 
with section 2 (d) and section 2 (a) , the charge or levy of tax is 
attracted only if an entertainment takes place in a specified 
place or locations and persons are admitted to the place on 
payment of a charge to the proprietor providing the 
entertainment. In the present case, as DTH operation is not a 
place-related entertainment, it is not covered by the charging 
section 3 read with section 2 (a) and 2 (b) of the 1936 Act. 
Consequently, the question of going to section 2 (d) (iv) does 
not arise. Moreover, even if section 2 (d) (iv) is to be read as 
an extension of section 3 and, thus, as a part of the charge, it 
does not make any difference at all because section 2 (d) 
(iv) refers to "entertainment" which takes us back to section 2 
(b) and finally to section 2 (a). 

38. We have held that DTH is not covered by the provisions of 
section 3 read with section 2 (a) 2 (b) and 2 (d) of the 1936 
Act. The issue gets further settled on reference being made to 
the mechanism of collection of the charge as provided under 
section 4 of the 1936 Act. Section 4 (1) mandates that no person 
shall be admitted to any entertainment other than entertainment 
by V.C.R. except with a ticket stamped with an impressed, 
embossed, engraved or adhesive stamp issued by the State 
Government of nominal value equal to the duty payable under 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 59 of 143 

Section 3; sub-section (2) of Section 4 provides for different 
modes specified thereunder for payment of the amount of duty 
due on the entertainment. Neither the provision of Section 4 
(1) nor any of the modes provided under Section 4 (2) can be 
made applicable for collection of duty on DTH operation. 
Further, it is noted above that Section 8 provides rule making 
powers. In exercise of the powers under that provision the 
Madhya Pradesh Entertainment Duty and Advertisement Tax 
Rules 1942 were framed. A perusal of the Rules makes it 
absolutely clear that the collection mechanism under the 1936 
Act is based on revenue stamps stuck to the tickets issued by the 
proprietor for entry to the specified place where entertainment 
is held. 

39. The machinery for collection of duty provided under the 
1936 Act has no application to DTH. It is well settled that if the 
collection machinery provided under the Act is such that it 
cannot be applied to an event, it follows that the event is beyond 
the charge created by the taxing statute. See: Commissioner of 
Income Tax v B.C. Srinivasa Setty, (1981) 2 SCC 460, 
Commissioner of Income Tax Ernakulam, Kerala v Official 
Liquidator, Palai Central Bank Ltd.(1985) 1 SCC 45 (pages 50-
51) PNB Finance Ltd v Commissioner of Income Tax (2008) 13 
SCC 94 (paragraphs 21 and 24 pages 100 to 101). 

40. In light of the discussions made above, we are clearly of the 
view that the 1936 Act cannot be extended to cover DTH 
operations being carried out by the appellants. 

56. In M/s Martin Lottery Agency Ltd, likewise, insertion of an 

explanation was held to be insufficient to constitute levy (in that case, 

of service tax, through amendment to the Finance Act of 1994). The 

Supreme Court held that: 

"The explanation, in our opinion, cannot be said to be a 
simple clarification as it introduces a new concept stating 
that organizing of the lottery is a form of entertainment. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 60 of 143 

Introduction of such new concept itself would have a 
constitutional implication. In the year 2003, while 
amending the provisions of 1994 Act, the Constitution 
was also amended and Article 268A and Entry 92C in 
List I were inserted. The courts are in future required to 
determine whether a service tax within the meaning of 
Entry 92C would cover sale of lottery or it would come 
within the purview of residuary entry containing Entry 97 
List I. If it is held to be a taxing provision within the 
purview of Entry 97, the same will have a bearing on the 
States. The Explanation so read appears to be a charging 
provision. It states about taxing need. It can be termed to 
be asui generis tax. If it is a different kind of tax, the same 
may be held to be running contrary to the ordinary 
concept of service tax. It may, thus, be held to be a 
standalone clause. A constitutional question may have to 
be raised and answered as to whether the taxing power 
can be segregated. If by reason of the said explanation, 
the taxing net has been widened, it cannot be held to be 
retrospective in operation." 

57. This court"s reasoning is bolstered, to a considerable extent, 

because in the past, whenever the legislature wished to expand the 

levy of tax, not only did it amend the definition clause, but also 

amended the charging provision, as in the case of DTH service and 

video service. This is apparent from the amendment to the 

Entertainment Tax Act, carried out with effect from 1 February, 2010, 

which introduced the following amendments, not only to the 

definition, but to the charging provisions as well as the machinery 

under the rules. The relevant parts of the enactment and the rules are 

reproduced below:

shall mutatis mutandis apply." 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 65 of 143 

58. It is evident, from the above provisions that Section 7 is a 

separate charging section. It clearly stipulates that entertainment tax is 

to be levied on all payments for admission to entertainment, inter alia, 

through a cable television network or DTH service. Now, if the 

respondent/NCT"s arguments were to be accepted, there was no 

necessity of amending the charging provision, of the very same 

enactment, when according to that logic, the object of bringing to tax 

other diverse elements would have been achieved by merely amending 

the definition. However, the amendments of 2010, which not only 

amended the definition, but also the charging provision, and provided 

a separate regime for the collection mechanism, contradict the 

revenue"s position that it is inessential to amend the charging 

provision and that amendment to the definition would be sufficient in 

this case. 

59. Tata Sky (supra) and M/s Martin Lottery (supra) are also 

authorities for the proposition that without a charging provision or a 

viable machinery for collection of the tax, the levy fails. This was first 

explained in B.C. Srinivasa Setty (supra) where the Supreme Court 

held as follows: 

"A transaction to which those provisions cannot be 
applied must be regarded as never intended by s. 45 to be 
the subject of the charge. This inference flows from the 
general arrangement of the provisions in the Income Tax 
Act, where under each head of income the charging 
provision is accompanied by a set of provisions for 
computing the income subject to that charge. The 
character of the computation provisions in each case 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 66 of 143 

bears a relationship to the nature of the charge. Thus the 
charging section and the computation provisions together 
constitute an integrated code. When there is a case to 
which the computation provisions cannot apply at all, it 
is evident that such a case was not intended to fall within 
the charging section. Otherwise one would be driven to 
conclude that while a certain income seems to fall within 
the charging section there is no scheme of computation 
for quantifying it. The legislative pattern discernible in 
the Act is against such a conclusion. It must be borne in 
mind that the legislative intent is presumed to run 
uniformly through the entire conspectus of provisions 
pertaining to each head of income. No doubt there is a 
qualitative difference between the charging provision and 
a computation provision. And ordinarily the operation of 
the charging provision cannot be affected by the 
construction of a particular computation provision. But 
the question here is whether it is possible to apply the 
computation provision at all if a certain interpretation is 
pressed on the charging provision. That pertains to the 
fundamental integrality of the statutory scheme provided 
for each head." 

60. In Virtual Soft Systems v Commissioner of Income Tax, 2007 

(289) 83the Supreme Court again reiterated the principle by saying 

that "the charge and its computation were two parts of an integral 

whole and concluded therefore, that if the computation could not be 

done, the charge was not intended to apply." A similar view was 

expressed in Commissioner of Income Tax v D.P. Sandhu Bros [2005] 

273 ITR 1 (SC) where describing the judgment in Srinivasa Setty it 

was held that "all transactions encompassed by Section 45 must fall 

within the computation provisions of Section 48. If the computation as 

provided under Section 48 could not be applied to a particular 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 67 of 143 

transaction, it must be regarded as "never intended by Section 45 to 

be the subject of the charge". 

61. Govind Saran Ganga Saran vs. Commissioner of Sales Tax and 

Ors1985 (Supp) SCC 205 held that: 

"6. The components which enter into the concept of a tax are 
well known. The first is the character of the imposition known 
by its nature which prescribes the taxable event attracting the 
levy, the second is a clear indication of the person on whom the 
levy is imposed and who is obliged to pay the tax, the third is 
the rate at which the tax is imposed, and the fourth is the 
measure or value to which the rate will be applied for 
computing the tax liability. If these components are not clearly 
and definitely ascertainable it is difficult to say that the levy 
exists in point of law. Any uncertainty or vagueness in the 
legislative scheme defining any of those components of the levy 
will be fatal to its validity." 

In view of the above position, this court would have to also consider 

whether the mechanism and collection provisions exist in respect of 

the Entertainment Tax Act levy, to make it effective. In view of the 

clear pronouncements of the courts, without a mechanism or collection 

provisions, the levy would fail. For this purpose, in Rule 11 of the 

Rules, Form 5 and 6 have been prescribed. The said Rule reads as 

under:-

"11. Form and manner of information before holding an 
entertainment 

A person or society desirous of holding an entertainment shall 
submit to the Commissioner an application in Form "5" where 
it is a ticketed programme and in Form "6" where the admission 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 68 of 143 

to the entertainment is exclusively by invitation, at least seven 
clear days before the date of such entertainment: 

PROVIDED that, the Commissioner may accept the application 
at a shorter period if he is satisfied that there were cogent 
grounds or difficulties for not submitting the application earlier 
and there is sufficient time for depositing the security, getting 
the tickets attested, obtaining Form "7" register and for 
completing other necessary formalities before starting the show. 
" 

62. A reading of the above Rule clarifies that in cases of ticketed 

programmes/events, information in Form 5 has to be submitted and in 

cases of non-ticketed programmes/events, information in application 

Form 6 has to be submitted. The said information has to be provided at 

least seven clear days before the date of such event i.e. holidays have 

to be excluded. The Commissioner, however, has the option to 

entertain the said applications at a shorter time period, provided the 

applicant makes an application in Form 7 giving cogent grounds or 

difficulties for not submitting the application earlier. A plain reading 

of Form 5 indicates that an applicant has to give details of place or 

places where shows are proposed to be held, specify the number of 

shows including special shows, if any, to be held on a daily basis, etc. 

In Form 6 an applicant has to provide details of place or places where 

shows are proposed to be held, details of expenses, sources for 

meeting the expenses, name of sponsors (Serial No. 10) and the 

amount sponsored by them, advertiser and the amount received from 

them. Details with regard to number of shows daily held, number of 

seats in each class, number of each kind of tickets, etc. too has to be 

furnished. Form 6 stipulates that an applicant should give details of the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 69 of 143 

amount of security deposit, if any, lying with the department if shows 

were previously held and amount of arrears of tax, if any, to be 

deposited in respect of shows previously held. 

63. The forms, after submission are to be processed and dealt with 

by the authorities under Section 13 of the Act read with Rules 30 and 

31. Section 13 reads as under:-

"Section 13 -Deposit and forfeiture of security (1) Every 
proprietor before holding an entertainment on which tax is 
leviable shall deposit such security and in such manner as may 
be prescribed. The Commissioner may deduct any arrears of tax 
from the security and may vary or forfeit the security in such 
manner as may be prescribed. 

(2) No order to forfeit the security shall be made under sub-
section (1) unless, after giving the proprietor reasonable 
opportunity of being heard, the Commissioner is satisfied for 
reasons to be recorded that the proprietor has evaded the tax or 
violated the provisions of this Act or rules made thereunder. 

(3) Any person aggrieved by an order forfeiting the security 
may, within thirty days from the date of service of such order 
prefer an appeal to the appellate authority in such manner as 
may be prescribed and the order of the appellate authority shall 
be final." 

64. Section 13 (1) specifies that every proprietor before holding an 

entertainment on which tax is leviable shall deposit security in such a 

manner as may be prescribed. The Commissioner can deduct arrears 

of tax from the security and may vary or forfeit the security in a 

manner as prescribed. Section 13 (2) postulates that no order of 

forfeiture of security under Section 13 (1) could be made before 

giving reasonable opportunity of hearing to the proprietor or applicant. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 70 of 143 

It stipulates that Commissioner can order forfeiture of security for 

reasons to be recorded upon satisfaction that the proprietor has evaded 

tax or violated the provisions of the Act or Rules made thereunder. An 

order under sub-section (1) and (2) is appealable within 30 days before 

the appellate authority in such a manner as may be prescribed and the 

order of the appellate authority shall be final. It is noticeable that sub-

section (2) is only applicable in cases of an order forfeiting the 

security and not to any other order. Rules 30 and 31 are also relevant 

and read:-

"30. Manner of depositing security The proprietor is required to 
deposit security under sub-section (1) of section 13 of the Act 
shall furnish a security in the form of bank draft or pay order or 
bank guarantee or a fixed deposit receipt, for such amount as 
may be specified by the Commissioner under rule 31. 

31. Amount of security [(1)] The amount of security shall be 
fixed by the Commissioner and shall not be more than the 
amount of the total tax chargeable for the full house capacity. 
In case of cinemas and other regular programmes of 
entertainment it shall before seven days as calculated with 
reference to the number of maximum shows to be held during 
seven days and shall not be less than fifty per cent of such 
amount: 

PROVIDED that in case of a cinema which has not defaulted in 
the deposit of tax during the preceding three years, the 
Commissioner may on application in this behalf, reduce the 
minimum amount of security as he may deem fit. He may, 
however, re-fix the amount of security as prescribed under this 
rule in case of any subsequent default in the deposit of tax: 

PROVIDED FURTHER that the amount of security may be 
fixed at an amount higher than the full house capacity, if the 
Commissioner deems it fit in the interest of revenue. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 71 of 143 

[(2) The amount of security for a direct-to-home (DTH) service 
shall be fixed by the Commissioner and shall not be more than 
the total tax chargeable for a period of three months.]" 

65. By Rule 31, the Commissioner is entitled to fix the amount of 

security, not exceeding the amount of the total tax chargeable for the 

full house capacity. The proprietor is required to deposit security in 

terms of Rule 30 (1) by way of bank draft or pay order or bank 

guarantee or a fixed deposit receipt, for such amount as may be 

specified by the Commissioner under Rule 31. The second proviso 

stipulates that the amount of security may be higher than the full house 

capacity, if the Commissioner deems it fit in the interest of revenue. 

66. The revenue had sought to urge that the columns, in Form 6, 

especially Sl. No. 10 indicates the machinery provision for collection 

in this case. This court is unable to concur. Just a reference to the 

expression "sponsor" would not, per se, render a sponsor into a 

proprietor, nor even an entertainment event, for which admission is 

free, into a taxing event. Section 6 (6), which is relied here, as the 

backup provision under the Act, is of no avail, because that provides 

for the eventuality of admissions being "made wholly or partly, by 

means of a lump sum paid as subscription, contribution, donation or 

otherwise, the tax shall be paid on the amount of such lump sum and 

on the amount of payment for admission, if any, made otherwise." The 

object of the event, is not to facilitate admissions to it, wholly or 

partly. The object rather is to ensure that the designers get a platform, 

to showcase their talents. The admission is not to all; nor available 

upon payment; it is by invitation. The sponsor may or may not secure 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 72 of 143 

any admission rights; if it does, it is wholly irrelevant. Even if it does 

and is allotted space for a kiosk or other desk, that is not per se an 

admission to an entertainment event. The entry given through passes, 

etc to sponsors is purely incidental. 

67. There are various forms of sponsorship of different kinds of 

events. For instance, a movie or a show may be put together purely 

through sponsorship funding. In such an event sponsorship is an 

alternative to raising finances or other forms of funding, where the 

organizer borrows moneys. The arrangement with the sponsor may 

only be to exhibit the product or a brand logo periodically, or for a 

certain time duration. Now, if admission to such event is through 

tickets, the price of the ticket would determine the entry; it is that 

"admission" and the cost of the ticket, which is taken into 

consideration for levy of entertainment tax. Any other interpretation 

would result in extremely distorted consequences, because a priced 

entry event, carrying fixed rates (or slabs, as in movie halls) can result 

in multiple taxation incidences, if the state were to be believed. One 

such instance, to illustrate, is the cinematographic production 

"Zindagi na milegi dobara" which received sponsorship funding from 

companies, where a soft drink beverage was featured -in the 

production, -ref https://www.slideshare.net/amyberi/case-study-on-

360-degree-marketing-zindagi-na-milegi-dobara). 
Likewise, 
in 

Yaadein, apparently the producers received substantial amounts from a 

mouth-freshener producing company. The sponsor"s objective in these 

cases is typically to secure visibility for their products/services. The 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 73 of 143 

end production may or may not be priced. If it is, the cost of the ticket 

for admission purposes, only, is the taxing incident. Any other 

interpretation would inject an uncontrolled element of subjectivity to 

the incidence of taxation, which is confined to entry to an admission 

event and nothing else. 

68. Exhibitions, fashion shows, cultural festivals are generally 

conducted as a marketing exercise to further business of the concerned 

industry. For instance, in a college/cultural festival several private 

(and corporate) sponsors, in lieu of advertisement fund the festival. 

Such festivals are typically organized to facilitate interaction and 

dialogue between students from similar disciplines from different 

colleges. All such events are by invitation only where students do not 

purchase tickets and the presence of music or competitions or other 

kinds of events does not rob these festivals of its essential character of 

being a forum for student interaction. Even in the case of IPL matches, 

where the events are entertainment events and are ticketed, sponsors 

play a different role and do not share the same equation as the general 

public, which buys tickets to witness the matches for entertainment 

purposes. For instance, during the IPL tournament, when a sponsor 

such as Pepsi, as the official sponsor of IPL (for some of the seasons), 

makes sponsorship payments, it receives the rights to advertise-across 

platforms including television and radio throughout the country. 

69. In such cases, can sponsors be subjected to entertainment tax? 

Or in another case, when aero shows are held with various private 

companies showcasing their products to potential buyers, can the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 74 of 143 

sponsors of such events be subjected to entertainment tax? If the same 

show is ticketed and opened to the public who may have no interest in 

propagating the industry, then, in such cases an entertainment tax can 

be levied on the public buying such tickets. However, to tax sponsors, 

who pay to secure space for business purposes under the Act would be 

incongruous. Closer home and on a more relatable note, the Bar 

Council organizes non-ticketed events for its members where there is 

no entry fee and the events are sponsored. At such events, lawyers 

may perform shows like stand up comedies, mimicry etc. but that does 

not necessarily mean that these are entertainment events in the context 

of the Entertainment Tax Act or that the sponsors are making 

contributions towards securing seat/ accommodation in a place of 

entertainment. 

70. This court is fortified in its opinion that the levy in the present 

case, is premised on the event, i.e., admission to entertainment, which 

presupposes that the object of the entry should be for entertainment 

purposes only, in two remarkable precedents. In J. Lyons & Co. Ltd. 

v. Fox. 1919 (1) KB 11 music concerts were held during and after the 

service of tea and dinner. The diner was permitted to stay for one hour 

after the service of dinner had ceased. No charge was made in any 

form except for the meals which were served both at a fixed price and 

a-la-carte, and for which a bill was rendered to the customer before he 

left the restaurant. By a majority it was held that payments made by 

the customers to the restaurant were not payment for admission to 

entertainment within the meaning of section 1(1) of the Finance (New 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 75 of 143 

Duties) Act, 1916, and that the entertainment duty was therefore not 

chargeable in respect thereof. The majority of the Judges held that the 

payments made by the customers of the restaurants were not 

"payments for admission" to an entertainment within the meaning of 

the Act. Bailhache J. put the matter thus: 

"The question, therefore, which we have to determine is, what is 
the meaning of those words 'payment for admission' to an 
entertainment in that section. I ask myself whether any ordinary 
intelligent person who had taken tea or had dined at the 
Trocadero would, using ordinary language, say that he had 
paid for admission to the Trocadero. The answer to that 
question must be in the negative. In ordinary language when 
one has paid for a dinner in a restaurant, one does not say that 
one has paid for admission to the restaurant any more than, 
when one pays for a pair of boots bought in a shop, one would 
say one was paying for admission to the shop." 

71. In Calico Mills Ltd. vs. State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. AIR 

1961 MP 257 a nominal entry charge of ` 2 was levied in an 

establishment ("the Calico Dome") which sold cloth and other related 

merchandise. Fashion models gave special performances at certain 

times. The charge to the store was uniform. The court held that such 

charge was an entry charge to the establishment, to restrict access 

having regard to vagaries of certain customers, rather than an entry to 

an entertainment event: 

"The natural import of the term 'entertainment' is amusement 
and gratification or some sort. The term connotes something in 
the nature of an organised entertainment. This is evident from 
the fact that the Act was enacted to provide for the levy of a 
duty in respect of admission to theatres, cinemas and other 
places of public entertainment. Therefore an entertainment to 
come within the definition of Section 2 (b) and of the provisions 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 76 of 143 

of the Act must be some exhibition, performance, amusement, 
game or sport for the purpose of entertainment, that is, for 
affording some sort of amusement and gratification to those 
who see or hear it. 

In the present case, it is impossible to say on the agreed facts 
that there is any exhibition, performance, amusement, game or 
sport which is an integral component factor attracting the 
visitors to the Calico Dome. In the return, much emphasis was 
laid on the fact that during the evening hours there was "a 
special programme of fashion show by specially trained girls 
.....and for that show seating arrangement was also made inside 
the dome and a stage was also erected for the performance of 
the show". 

But learned Government Advocate did not urge before us that 
this showing off of the fabrics by the mannequins was-any 
performance, amusement, game or sport. He, however, argued 
that the Dome was a place of entertainment inasmuch as it was 
an exhibition. Learned Government Advocate did not go to the 
extent of saying that the mannequins themselves were an 
"exhibition". On the other hand, he contended that even without 
the mannequins the display of the Fabrics by the petitioners in 
the manner they did inside the Dome was in itself an exhibition 
and an entertainment within the meaning of Section 2 (b). 

We are unable to accept this argument, which seems to us to 
ignore certain basic facts and the primary object with which the 
petitioners put up the Dome for the display of their goods. No-
body can doubt that the object of the display of the fabrics 
manufactured by the petitioners inside the Calico Dome was to 
advertise them and to promote their sales. There was not 
anything in the nature of an organised entertainment in the 
display of the fabrics themselves. 

A person who visited the Dome went there as a prospective 
buyer and not as a spectator or as one of the audience to an 
entertainment. A display of the fabrics by mannequins wearing 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 77 of 143 

them was no doubt arranged during the evening hours. But that 
was not for the purpose of affording amusement Or gratification 
to the visitors but for enabling them to make a selection in the 
purchase of the goods they desired. It is common knowledge 
that the elegance and beauty of a wearing apparel can be best 
judged and appreciated when it is shown off by a person 
wearing it and not when it is folded and wrapped in packages. 

It is also well known that many drapers and milliners of repute 
and standing display their goods on dummy models. It seems to 
us that a place where fabrics are displayed and shown off by 
mannequins wearing them is no more a place of entertainment 
than a shop establishment where wearing apparels are 
displayed on dummy models. Nothing turns on the fact that the 
display by mannequins was on a stage or on the fact that there 
was a seating arrangement inside the Dome for having a good 
view of the display, or again on the fact that "many fashionable 
ladies and gentlemen of the town were attracted more towards 
the show than towards the purchase of cloth". Many of them 
might have gone to the place merely for the purpose of watching 
the display and seeing something which they had not seen 
before. But the fact that these people went out of curiosity and 
novelty did not make the exhibition of cloth or the display by 
mannequins inside the Dome an entertainment, which otherwise 
was not an entertainment. 

The word "exhibition" occurring in the definition of 
"entertainment" in Section 2 (b) must take its colour from the 
natural import of the term 'entertainment'. If certain goods are 
exposed to view for the purpose of sale, there is no doubt an 
exhibition of goods in the sense of "showing". But that is not 
any entertainment. The exhibition for sale of the fabrics 
themselves in elegant surroundings under a canopy put up. by 
the petitioners did not afford any gratification, diversion or 
amusement. 

It was no more than a display of cloth and apparels in a well-
decorated shop. The display by mannequins was simply a 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 78 of 143 

spectacle of living people instead of dummy models showing of 
the fabrics for impressing on the visitors the 'chic' of the 
material manufactured by the petitioner-Mills. To call such an 
exhibition "entertainment" is to give a very strained meaning to 
the word and to the language of the Act. If, as we think, there 
was no entertainment inside the Dome then it follows that any 
payment made by a visitor for admission to the Dome cannot be 
regarded as 'payment for admission' to entertainment 

In fact, it is clear from the admitted facts of the case that no 
charge was made for admission to the Calico Dome. It is not 
disputed that the petitioners were entitled to regulate the system 
of their trade and to restrict entry to the Dome. If, having 
regard to limited space inside the Dome, and apprehending a 
rush of visitors attracted by a feature, very common and old in 
the premier cities of the countries but a new one in Jabalpur, 
the petitioners thought it necessary to restrict entry to the Dome 
to bona fide purchasers and secured this by requiring the 
visitors in certain hours to obtain a token which could be 
exchanged for Rs. 2/-worth of Calico cloth, it cannot be said 
that the visitor paid Rs. 2/-for admission to the Dome. 

The position of such a visitor is no different from that of a 
person paying for cloth purchased in a shop. One does not 
speak of such a person as one paying for admission to the shop. 
It may be that some persons interested more in the feature of 
display of fabrics by mannequins than in the purchase of any 
cloth did not make any purchase and did not cash in the form of 
cloth the value of the token. Or. again it may be that those 
making purchases of high value were indifferent to the credit 
allowable to them on the strength of a token. 

But because of such vagaries of some visitors, one cannot run 
away from the facts and hold that the amount paid for the token 
was a payment for admission to an entertainment within the 
meaning of the Act. The token of Rs. 2/-obtained by a person 
visiting the Dome during evening hours was nothing more than 
a part advance payment towards the purchases that may be 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 79 of 143 

made. We do not entertain the slightest doubt that there was no 
entertainment within the provisions of the Act and the token 
obtained by a person visiting the Dome during certain hours 
was not a payment for admission to the Dome, much less a 
payment for admission to a place in which entertainment was 
held." 

72. For the above reasons, it is held that sponsorship amounts 

received by the petitioners became part of the admission to the 

entertainment events -not for FDCI; nor for the BCCI (which only 

provided on site advertising) or GMR (the sponsorship amounts 

received by it being for other rights of advertisement, exclusive of 

what was given by BCCI). In the case of BCCI and GMR, the 

arguments of the revenue, stand out in stark relief, because the 

entertainment event, i.e., cricket match, is controlled by one admission 

through tickets, which are paid for (and in respect of which tax is 

demanded and paid); yet the sponsorship amounts received for the 

same match can potentially be collected by the revenue, under the 

Entertainment Tax Act. This would result in multiple levies (three 

fold, to be exact) on one taxing event under one taxation statute-a 

fortiori an arbitrary result. 

73. The Court is also of the opinion that the reliance on Section 6 

(6), Rule 11 and Form 6 in the present case does not help the revenue. 

A juxtaposition of Section 6 (6) with Section 6 (7) underlines the 

importance of the place where entertainment is provided. Further, 

Section 6 is subject to other provisions of the Act. Importantly, the 

reference to events by invitation (under Form 6) is relatable only to the 

extent contemplated by Section 6 (6). The relevant part of Rule 11 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 80 of 143 

states that the proprietor has to file "Form "5" where it is a ticketed 

programme and in Form "6" where the admission to the entertainment 

is exclusively by invitation, at least seven clear days before the date of 

such entertainment." The import of these expressions is, and can only 

be to what is alluded to by Section 6 (6), i.e. "Where the payment for 

admission to an entertainment, referred to in sub-section (1), is made 

wholly or partly, by means of a lump sum paid as subscription, 

contribution, donation or otherwise.." This would cover cases, where 

the event viewers" entry is paid, to the proprietor, thorough some form 

of prior subscription, or contribution, or a lump sum paid in advance, 

by some or all parties, or even the booking of a show for viewing by 

invitees. In such cases, the event continues its essential character as an 

entertainment event, the admission for which is payable. The form of 

payment is the subject matter of Section 6 (6). In the case of 

sponsorships -of events like the ones conducted by FDCI, the event is 

sponsored or entirely funded by third parties; the event is per se not 

for amusement, but primarily for business promotion. Likewise, the 

sponsorship amounts paid in the other cases (BCCI, GMR, DEN) are 

not to enable entry of someone to be amused or entertained, but rather 

to enable visibility of the sponsor"s products or services. The placing 

of hoardings, or advertisements on site cannot be said to form "entry" 

to an entertainment event. For these reasons, it is held that the levy in 

this case also fails for absence of a defined and valid collection 

mechanism. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 81 of 143 

74. Now, to deal with the revenue"s argument that the amendments 

are merely clarificatory in nature. The revenue relied on Gold Coin 

Health Food Private Ltd (supra) and Ambae Picture Palace (supra) for 

this proposition and also urged that the expression "entertainment" 

was defined in an inclusive manner. So read, Section 6 (6) read with 

Form 6 had always created a levy and a mechanism. Therefore, the 

clarification being what it is, is a declaration of what existed (since 

inception of the enactment) and consequently, was retrospective. 

75. This court notices that in M/s Martin Lottery, a decision 

rendered after Gold Coin Health Food (P) Ltd (supra) in fact noticed 

this amendment. 

"the Court must be satisfied that the Parliament did not intend 
to introduce a substantive change in the law. As stated 
hereinbefore, for the aforementioned purpose, the expressions 
like `for the removal of doubts' are not conclusive. The said 
expressions appear to have been used under assumption that 
organizing games of chance would be rendition of service." 

The court also noticed and quoted the following passage from Virtual 

Soft Systems Ltd v Commissioner of Income Tax 2007 (9) SCC 665, 

and held as follows: 

"It may be noted that the amendment made to Section 271 by 
the Finance Act, 2002 only stated that the amended provision 
would come into force with effect from 1.4.2003. The statute 
nowhere stated that the said amendment was either clarificatory 
or declaratory. On the contrary, the statue stated that the said 
amendment would come into effect on 1.4.2003 and therefore, 
would apply to only to future periods and not to any period 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 82 of 143 

prior to 1.4.2003 or to any assessment year prior to assessment 
year 2004-2005. It is the well settled legal position that an 
amendment can be considered to be declaratory and 
clarificatory only if the statue itself expressly and unequivocally 
states that it is a declaratory and clarificatory provision. If 
there is no such clear statement in the statute itself, the 
amendment will not be considered to be merely declaratory or 
clarificatory. 

Even if the statute does contain a statement to the effect that the 
amendment is declaratory or clarificatory, that is not the end of 
the matter. The Court will not regard itself as being bound by 
the said statement made in the statute but will proceed to 
analyse the nature of the amendment and then conclude whether 
it is in reality a clarificatory or declaratory provision or 
whether it is an amendment which is intended to change the law 
and which applies to future periods." 

76. The revenue/respondents" arguments are untenable, in this 

court"s opinion. In the absence of the amendment, according to their 

plea, the impost based on sponsorship was still leviable, because the 

definition was inclusive. This argument is unsound. It is settled that 

there has to be clear authority of law for a valid levy, by reason of 

Article 265 of the Constitution and the subject of the levy should be 

precisely or definitely known. This much was said, in Indian Banks 

Association v Devkala Consultancy Services AIR 2004 SC 2615, when 

it was observed as follows: 

"In the event, the contention of the appellants is accepted, the 
same would give rise to incongruous results. Such an 
interpretation, as is well-known, must be avoided, if avoidable. 
Furthermore, a statutory impost must be definite. Having 
regard to Article 265 read with Article 366(28) of the 
Constitution of India nothing is realizable as a tax or by way of 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 83 of 143 

recovery of tax or any action akin thereto which is not permitted 
by law." 

77. The argument that sponsored events and sponsorship per se 

were covered by the un-amended Act, is therefore, insubstantial and 

rejected. The sequitur is that the amendment introduced a new 

element. By itself, in the absence of change to the enacting part 

creating a levy, (as discussed previously) the addition of the two 

impugned explanation, with retrospective effect cannot result in a 

valid impost; such impost cannot be retrospective in character. It is 

therefore held that the amendment is not clarificatory; it is also of no 

consequence given that there is no amendment to the charging section. 

Nor has a fresh charging provision been introduced introducing a fresh 

levy. In view of the opinion expressed as to the effect of the 

amendment, it is held that the retrospectivity assigned to it, is of no 

consequence. However, it is also held that as an amending enactment, 

which sought to introduce a new levy, which did not exist earlier, the 

impugned notification would be unreasonable because it would -were 

it indeed operative -impose onerous obligations upon transactions and 

those sought to be covered by it, for periods when it was not in force. 

Those ostensibly covered by it, would have to provision for demands 

which could not have been levied, because those obligations did not 

exist. 

78. Sections 9 and 10 of the Act require that for any person to enter 

a place of entertainment a valid ticket with a duly paid tax on it would 

have to be presented. The exception to this rule is carved out in respect 

of persons who have some specific duty to perform in connection with 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 84 of 143 

the entertainment. The Court has concluded that in the cases of FDCI, 

those entering the venue, upon invitation or those who enter, to make 

arrangements do not have to buy tickets. In the case of other ticketed 

events, such as cricketing or football fixtures, GMR and other 

organizers charge entertainment tax and collect it from those entering 

to view the event. Section 9 and 10 read as follows: 

"9. Restriction of admission 

Save as otherwise expressly provided by or under the Act, no 
person (other than a person who has some specific duty to 
perform in connection with the entertainment, or duty imposed 
upon him by law, or a person authorized by the Government in 
this behalf) shall be admitted to any entertainment except with a 
ticket in the prescribed form denoting that the proper tax 
payable under Section 6 has been paid." 

Section 10 reads out as: 

"10. Restriction on entry to entertainment 

No person (other than a person who has specific duty to 
perform in connection with the entertainment, or duty imposed 
upon him by law, or a person authorized by the Government in 
this behalf) shall enter or obtain admission to an entertainment 
without being in possession of a proper ticket as required under 
Section 9." 

Rule 11 requires organizers to submit applications in Form 5 for 

ticketed events and Form 6 in case of non-ticketed events. While Form 

5 under item 8 requires the organizer to disclose "charge for 

admission to various classes (excluding tax), entertainment tax and 

surcharge and total payable." Under head 10 and 11 of Form 6 the 

disclosure include "name of sponsors and the amount sponsored by 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 85 of 143 

them" and "name of advertiser and amount received from them" 

respectively. While submitting application under Form 6, it is not 

expected from an organizer to pay entertainment tax on sponsorship 

amounts, an aspect which is otherwise clearly spelt out in Form 5-i.e. 

entertainment tax paid proportionately on the ticket. 

79. The upshot of the above discussion is that in regard to 

concluded or past transactions, where the organiser or proprietor of the 

event had no opportunity to collect tax -either because the event was 

not ticketed (as admission was not paid for) or the entertainment event 

itself like in sports events, was based on tickets, on which 

entertainment tax was paid, the requirement of paying amounts, now, 

on the basis that the past event too is taxable, results in onerous 

consequences. Speaking about retrospective levies, the Supreme Court 

in D. Cavasji v State of Karnataka 1985 (1) SCR 825stated as follows: 

"It may be open to the Legislature to impose the levy at the 
higher rate with prospective operation but levy of taxation at 
higher rate which really amounts to imposition of tax 
with 
retrospective effect has to be justified on proper and cogent 
grounds." 

In a more recent decision, Commissioner of Income Tax v Vatika 

Industries 2015 (1) SCC 1 
the Supreme Court pointed out the 

rationale for a general rule of construction against retrospectivity of 

statutes, in the following manner: 

"The idea behind the rule is that a current law should govern 
current activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the events 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 86 of 143 

of the past. If we do something today, we do it keeping in view 
the law of today and in force and not tomorrow"s backward 
adjustment of it. Our belief in the nature of the law is founded 
on the bed rock that every human being is entitled to arrange 
his affairs by relying on the existing law and should not find 
that his plans have been retrospectively upset. This principle of 
law is known as lexprospicitnon respicit: law looks forward not 
backward. As was observed in Phillips vs. Eyre[3], a 
retrospective legislation is contrary to the general principle that 
legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated 
when introduced for the first time to deal with future acts ought 
not to change the character of past transactions carried on 
upon the faith of the then existing law." 

In its seminal decision, i.e. Rai Ramakrishna v State of Bihar 1964 (1) 

SCR 897 the Supreme Court held as follows: 

"Where the legislature can make a valid law, it may provide not 
only for the prospective operation of the material provisions of 
the said law, but it can also provide for the retrospective 
operation of the said provisions. Similarly, there is no doubt 
that the legislative power in question includes the subsidiary or 
the auxiliary power to validate laws which have been found to 
be invalid. If a law passed by a legislature is struck down by the 
Courts as being invalid for one infirmity or another, it would be 
competent to the appropriate legislature to cure the said 
infirmity and pass a validating law so as to make the provisions 
of the said earlier law effective from the date when it was 
passed. This position is treated as firmly established since the 
decision of the Federal Court in the case of The United 
Provinces V.Mst. Atiqa Begum (1). It is also true that though 
the Legislature can pass a law and make its provisions, 
retrospective, it would be relevant to consider the effect of the 
said retrospective operation of the law both in respect of the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 87 of 143 

legislative competence of the legislature and the reasonableness 
of the restrictions imposed by it. In other words, it may be open 
to a party affected by the provisions of the Act to contend that 
the retrospective operation of the Act so completely alters the 
character of the tax imposed by it as to take it outside the limits 
of the entry which gives the legislature competence to enact the 
law; or, it may be open to it to contend in the alternative that 
the, restrictions imposed by the Act are so unreasonable that 
they should be struck down on the ground that they contravene 
his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (f) & 
(g)." 

Yet later in Tata Motors v State of Bihar, 2004 (5) SCC 783the 

Supreme Court had to examine the validity of introduction of a 

provision with retrospective effect, that partially withdrew a benefit 

that had been enjoyed by assesseess. This is what the court stated: 

"It is no doubt true that the legislature has the powers to make 
laws retrospectively including tax laws. Levies can be imposed 
or withdrawn but if a particular levy is sought to be imposed 
only for a particular period and not prior or subsequently it is 
open to debate whether the statute passes the test of 
reasonableness at all. In the present case, the High Court 
sustained the enactment by adverting to Rai Ramkrishna's case 
when the benefit of the rule had been withdrawn for a specific 
period. The learned counsel for the State contended that the 
amendments had been made to overcome certain defects arising 
on account of the decision of the tribunal in regard to the 
modalities of working out the relief. But, the impugned 
amendment brought about by Section 26 is not for that 
purpose. Assuming that it was the legislative policy not to grant 
set off in respect of waste or scrap material generated, it 
becomes difficult to appreciate the stand of the State in the light 
of the fact that the original Rule continued to be in operation 
(with certain modifications) subsequent to 1.4.1988. The reason 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 88 of 143 

for withdrawal of the benefit retrospectively for a limited period 
is not forthcoming. It is no doubt true that the State has 
enormous powers in the matter of legislation and in enacting 
fiscal laws. Great leverage is allowed in the matter of taxation 
laws because several fiscal adjustments have to be made by the 
Government depending upon the needs of the Revenue and the 
economic circumstances prevailing in the State. Even so an 
action taken by the State cannot be so irrational and so 
arbitrary so as to introduce one set of rules for one period and 
another set of rules for another period by amending the laws in 
such a manner as to withdraw the benefit that had been given 
earlier resulting in higher burdens so far as the assessee is 
concerned without any reason. Retrospective withdrawal of the 
benefit of set-off only for a particular period should be justified 
on some tangible and rational ground, when challenged on the 
ground of unconstitutionality. Unfortunately, the State could not 
succeed in doing so. The view of the High Court that the 
impugned amendment of Rule 41-E was of clarificatory nature 
to remove the doubts in interpretation cannot be upheld. In fact, 
the High Court did not elaborate as to how the impugned 
legislation is merely clarificatory. In that view of the matter, 
although we recognise the fact that the State has enormous 
powers in the matter of legislation both prospectively and 
retrospectively and can evolve its own policy, we do not think 
that in the present cases any material has been placed before 
the Court as to why the amendments were confined only to a 
period of eight years and not either before or subsequently and, 
therefore, we are of the view that the impugned provision, 
namely, Section 26 deserves to be quashed by striking down the 
words "not being waste goods or scrap goods or by products" 
occurring in the said Section 26 of the Maharashtra Act IX of 
1989 and the authorities concerned shall rework assessments as 
if that law had not been passed and give appropriate benefits 
according to law to the parties concerned." 

80. This Court has concluded, earlier in the course of this judgment, 

that the amendment is not clarificatory; nor can it be said to introduce 

a valid levy, because of lack of any amendment to the charging 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 89 of 143 

provision; nor is there any valid mechanism to collect such levy. 

Therefore, the retrospectivity assigned to the amendment, is clearly 

arbitrary and unreasonable. It is so declared. 

81. One last aspect needs to be dealt with. The revenue had 

contended that since many petitioners had sought exemptions and in 

some cases, deposited amounts pursuant to demands, the present 

proceedings on their part are not maintainable. The invocation of the 

doctrine of estoppel or waiver, in the opinion of this court, under such 

circumstances is inapt. This is because, the Supreme Court has held, in 

a series of judgments, that there can be no waiver of fundamental or 

other statutory rights, nor can such procedural hurdles bar the inquiry 

into validity of statutes or rules. State of Punjab & Anr v Devans 

Modern Brewaries Ltd 2004 (11) SCC 26 articulated, through a 

Constitution Bench, this principle, as follows: 

"Even otherwise when the legislative competence of a State is 
in question, the same goes to the root of the jurisdiction. Once it 
is found that the State Legislature has exceeded its jurisdiction 
in imposing the impugned levy, the same being a fraud on the 
Constitution cannot be sustained on the procedural doctrine of 
estoppel or waiver." 

(Also ref Suraj Mall Mehto v AV Viswanath Sastri AIR 1954 SC 545; 

Bashesharnath v. I.T Commissioner AIR 1959 SC 149; and Olga 

Tellis v Bombay Municipal Corporation AIR 1986 SC 180). For these 

reasons, it is held that the plea that the petitions cannot be entertained, 

is insubstantial and therefore, rejected. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 90 of 143 

82. In view of the foregoing reasons, this court summarizes its 

findings and issues the following directions: 

(1) The impugned amendment does not result in a valid levy of 

entertainment tax; mere amendment to the definition of "payment for 

admission" under Section 2 (m) of the Act cannot, in the absence of an 

amendment to the charging section, or introduction of a new charging 

section, introduce a levy. Therefore, the demands made on the basis of 

the amendments are hereby declared as contrary to Articles 14 and 

265 of the Constitution of India. 

(2) The impugned levy, to the extent it does not introduce a 

separate machinery also fails and a direction to that effect is also 

issued; 

(3) Arguendo, the impugned amendment is to be valid, it is not 

clarificatory but in fact a new amendment. Therefore, granting 

retrospective effect to it, would impose onerous and harsh conditions, 

that could never have been provisioned for by the event proprietors. 

As a result, the retrospective effect given to the impugned amendment 

is void as violative of Articles 14 and 265 of the Constitution of India. 

(4) The petitioners cannot be said to have waived their right to 

challenge the levy or collection of amounts as duty in the 

circumstances of these cases; 

(5) The amounts collected by the respondents, from FDCI, BCCI, 

DEN and other petitioners are directed to be refunded to them, with 

interest @ 7 percent per annum from date of payment, within 8 weeks 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 91 of 143 

from today. In the case of GMR, the amounts collected towards 

sponsorship receipts (as opposed to ticket collections for which tax has 

been deposited in the normal course) shall be similarly refunded, with 

similar rate of interest within 8 weeks. 

83. All the writ petitions are allowed in terms of the above 

directions without any order as to costs.

Control of Cricket in India (BCCI), DEN Soccer Private Limited and 

Pro Sportify Private Limited, asking them to furnish the details of 

sponsorship amounts received, along with agreements and to deposit 

entertainment tax at the rate of 15% on total sponsorship amount, 

including other payments, received. In writ petition bearing W.P.(C) 

No.7465/2013 and W.P.(C) No.2586/2017, filed by GMR Sports 

Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as the GMR Sports), the 

petitioner has challenged the notices dated 09.02.2010, 13.05.2010, 

12.05.2011, 21.04.2011, 
15.04.2011, 31.03.2011, 22.03.2012, 

20.03.2012, 04.04.2012, 18.04.2012, 02.05.2012, 11.05.2012, 

14.03.2013, 12.04.2013 and 16.03.2017, whereby they were asked to 

pay entertainment tax on the sponsorship receipts for IPL seasons 

2010 to 2013 and also sought declaration that no entertainment tax is 

leviable on sponsorship receipt. All these writ petitions are grouped as 

Group 'B' cases. 

4. 
In all these writ petitions, the main challenge of the petitioners 

relates to levy of entertainment tax on sponsorship amount received by 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 93 of 143 

them for organizing the respective events. It is argued that sponsorship 

amount cannot be subjected to tax and by adding Explanation 2 to the 

definition of Section 2(m) of the Delhi Entertainment and Betting Tax 

Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"), levy on sponsorship 

amount is introduced for the first time and thus a new regime of 

entertainment tax has been introduced with retrospective effect. The 

sponsorship amount paid or value of goods supplied or services 

rendered or benefits provided to the organizers of an entertainment 

programme were never in the tax net and now by this deeming 

provision, these are considered deemed payment for the admission to 

an entertainment. This way the legislature has enlarged the scope of 

Section 2 (m) which cannot be done by adding an Explanation to the 

main provision, without amending the main provision. The petitioners 

have also sought the quashing of Explanation 2 of Section 2(m) of the 

Act. 

5. 
On the other hand, the main contention of respondents is that 

the definition of Section 2(m) of the Act is inclusive and wide enough 

to include all the payments made, may it be called by any name and 

made in any form for tickets or other accommodations in any form in 

a place of entertainment. It is argued that even before Explanation 2 

was added, sponsorship amount received by FDCI for holding fashion 

shows was subjected to entertainment tax and this Court in earlier writ 

petition being W.P.(C) No. 1145/2010 titled as Fashion Design 

Council of India vs. GNCT and Ors., has dealt with this issue and 

remanded the matter with the direction to examine the sponsorship 

documents and then to assess the tax and this way the Coordinate 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 94 of 143 

Bench of this Court had upheld the levy of tax on sponsorship amount 

received by FDCI for conducting the fashion show. Also, this Court in 

the said matter had upheld the refusal on the part of respondents to 

give 100% exemption to FDCI from entertainment tax and upheld the 

order of the respondents by which the exemption from entertainment 

tax on the sponsorship amounts was restricted to 50% of the total tax 

payable. 

6. 
It is further argued that the Hon'ble Supreme Court also in Amit 

Kumar vs. State of U.P. (2008) 1 SCC 528 has clearly held that 

fashion shows are entertainment and organizers have to pay 

entertainment tax on the sponsorship amounts received by them. It is 

thus apparent that the impugned amendment is only 

clarificatory/explanatory in nature and does not introduce any new 

levy. 

7. 
The detailed arguments of learned Senior Counsel of both the 

parties have already been recorded in detail by my learned brother in 

his order. It is futile to reproduce the same again; however, I have 

taken note of those detailed arguments. 

8. 
I have given thoughtful consideration to the contentions and 

arguments of learned Senior Counsel and have also examined the 

various provisions of the Act. I proceed to answer the issue posed in 

these petitions. 

9. 
Essentially, the issue is whether the sponsorship amount paid by 

sponsors to the organizers and in lieu of which sponsors and/or their 

authorized representatives gain entry in a place of entertainment on 

invitations or passes and/or are also permitted to display their 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 95 of 143 

products, logo or brand name, is payment for admission under Section 

2(m) of the Act or introduced for the first time by adding impugned 

Explanation 2 with retrospective effect. 

10. The principles of interpretation are well settled. The Hon'ble 

Supreme Court in Chief Justice of A.P. v. L.V.A. Dixitulu, (1979) 2 

SCC 34 has clearly held that a Statute has to be interpreted in terms of 

the intention of the Legislature for which the Act has been enacted, 

gathered from the language of the provision. It is the language used in 

the provision which should guide the Courts while interpreting the 

Statute. Even where two interpretations are possible, the Courts should 

adopt the interpretation which is in harmony with the other part of the 

Statute. The relevant paragraphs are reproduced as under: -

"66. The primary principle of interpretation is that a 
Constitutional or statutory provision should be 
construed "according to the intent of they that made 
it" (Coke). Normally, such intent is gathered from the 
language of the provision. If the language or the 
phraseology employed by the legislation is precise 
and plain and thus by itself proclaims the legislative 
intent in unequivocal terms, the same must be given 
effect to, regardless of the consequences that may 
follow. But if the words used in the provision are 
imprecise, protean or evocative or can reasonably 
bear meanings more than one, the Rule of strict 
grammatical construction ceases to be a sure guide to 
reach at the real legislative intent. In such a case, in 
order to ascertain the true meaning of the terms and 
phrases employed, it is legitimate for the Court to go 
beyond the and literal confines of the provision and to 
call in aid other well recognised rules of construction, 
such as its legislative/history, the basic scheme and 
framework of the statute as a whole, each portion 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 96 of 143 

throwing light on the rest, the purpose of the 
legislation, the object sought to be achieved, and the 
consequences that may flow from the adoption of one 
in preference to the other possible interpretation. 

67. Where two alternative constructions are possible, 
the court must choose the one which will be in accord 
with the other parts of the statute and ensure its 
smooth, harmonious working, and eschew the 
which leads to absurdity, confusion, or friction, 
contradiction and conflict between its various 
provisions, or undermines, or tends to defeat or 
destroy the basic scheme and purpose of the 
enactment......." 

(emphasis supplied) 

11. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in RBI v. Peerless General 

Finance & Investment Co. Ltd (1987) 1 SCC 424 has also held that 

one of the rules of interpretation is to interpret the same in consonance 

with the object for which it was enacted. The Court held that the 

interpretation should match the contextual. The relevant paragraph is 

reproduced as under:-

"33. Interpretation must depend on the text and the 
context. They are the bases of interpretation. One may 
well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives 
the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are 
important. That interpretation is best which makes the 
textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute 
is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. 
With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as 
a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, 
phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is 
looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the 
glasses of the statute-maker, provided by such context, 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 97 of 143 

its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words 
may take colour and appear different than when the 
statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the 
context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as 
a whole and discover what each section, each clause, 
each phrase and each word is meant and designed to 
say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part 
of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed 
in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that 
every word has a place and everything is in its 
place......" 

(emphasis supplied) 

12. In Doypack Systems (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (1988) 2 SCC 

299, the Apex Court has, while discussing the principles of 

interpretation of a Statute, held that the literal construction of the 

Statute should be given primacy, keeping in mind the intention of the 

Parliament for which the Statute has been enacted. The relevant 

paragraphs are reproduced as under:-

"58. The words in the statute must, prima facie, be 
given their ordinary meanings. Where the 
grammatical construction is clear and manifest and 
without doubt, that construction ought to prevail 
unless there are some strong and obvious reasons to 
the contrary. Nothing has been shown to warrant that 
literal construction should not be given effect to….. 

59. It has to be reiterated that the object of 
interpretation of a statute is to discover the intention 
of the Parliament as expressed in the Act. The 
dominant purpose in construing a statute is to 
ascertain the intention of the legislature as expressed 
in the statute, considering it as a whole and in its 
context. That intention, and therefore the meaning of 
the statute, is primarily to be sought in the words used 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 98 of 143 

in the statute itself, which must, if they are plain and 
unambiguous, be applied as they stand…." 

(emphasis supplied) 

13. The same principles were again reiterated by the Apex Court in 

Gurudevdatta VKSSS Maryadit v. State of Maharashtra (2001) 4 

SCC 534, wherein the Court has again held that the cardinal principle 

of interpretation is to give ordinary meaning to the words used by the 

Legislature and the words has to be understood in their natural, 

ordinary and popular sense and be construed according to their 

grammatical meaning. The relevant paragraph is reproduced as under:-

"26. 
Further we wish to clarify that it is a 
cardinal principle of interpretation of statute that the 
words of a statute must be understood in their natural, 
ordinary or popular sense and construed according to 
their grammatical meaning, unless such construction 
leads to some absurdity or unless there is something 
in the context or in the object of the statute to suggest 
to the contrary. The golden rule is that the words of a 
statute must prima facie be given their ordinary 
meaning. It is yet another rule of construction that 
when the words of the statute are clear, plain and 
unambiguous, then the courts are bound to give effect 
to that meaning, irrespective of the consequences. It is 
said that the words themselves best declare the 
intention of the law-giver. The courts have adhered to 
the principle that efforts should be made to give 
meaning to each and every word used by the 
legislature and it is not a sound principle of 
construction to brush aside words in a statute as 
being inapposite surpluses, if they can have a proper 
application in circumstances conceivable within the 
contemplation of the statute….." 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 99 of 143 

(emphasis supplied) 

14. In British Airways Plc. v. Union of India (2002) 2 SCC 95, the 

Court has put much emphasis on the theory of harmonious 

construction of a Statute. The Court has held as under:-

"8. While interpreting a statute the court should try to 
sustain its validity and give such meaning to the 
provisions which advance the object sought to be 
achieved by the enactment….. The well-known 
principle of harmonious construction is that effect 
shall be given to all the provisions and for that any 
provision of the statute should be construed with 
reference to the other provisions so as to make it 
workable. A particular provision cannot be picked up 
and interpreted to defeat another provision made in 
that behalf under the statute. It is the duty of the court 
to make such construction of a statute which shall 
suppress the mischief and advance the remedy. While 
interpreting a statute the courts are required to keep 
in mind the consequences which are likely to flow 
upon the intended interpretation." 

(emphasis supplied) 

15. From the settled principle of law, it is apparent that, while 

interpreting a particular provision of a Statute, the grammatical 

structure of the provisions of the Act has to be given primacy. A 

particular provision should not be interpreted in isolation, but in 

context to the object for which that particular Statute has been enacted 

and the interpretation should further the said object. Where the words 

used in a Statue are clear and unambiguous, the ordinary grammatical 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 100 of 143 

interpretation to those words should be given unless such an 

interpretation leads to absurdity. 

16. In order to determine the issue in hand which essentially relate 

to the interpretation of Section 2(m) of the Act and the added 

Explanation 2 to it, it is necessary to understand the scope and object 

of the whole Act. 

17. Section 9 and Section 10 of the Act puts total restrictions on the 

admission to a place of entertainment of any person unless such 

person is in possession of a valid ticket or he/she is a person exempted 

therein. Section 9 and Section 10 of the Act are reproduced as under 

for convenience:-

"9. Restriction of admission -

Save as otherwise expressly provided by or under this 
Act, no person (other than a person who has some 
specific duty to perform in connection with the 
entertainment, or duty imposed upon him by law, or a 
person authorized by the government in this behalf) 
shall be admitted to any entertainment except with a 
ticket in the prescribed form denoting that the proper 
tax payable under section 6 has been paid." 

"10. Restriction on entry to entertainment-

No person (other than a person who has some specific 
duty to perform in connection with the entertainment, 
or duty imposed upon him by law, or a person 
authorized by the government in this behalf) shall 
enter or obtain admission to an entertainment without 
being in possession of a proper ticket as required 
under section 9." 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 101 of 143 

18. The term "ticket" is defined under Section 2(u) of the Act. The 

provision is reproduced as under:-

""ticket" means a ticket or a complimentary pass for 
the purposes of securing admission to an 
entertainment in accordance with the provisions of 
this Act or the rules made thereunder and a 
"duplicate ticket", means a ticket or set of tickets used 
or intended to be used otherwise than in accordance 
with this Act or the rules made thereunder;" 

19. Section 6 of the Act, which is the charging Section, imposes tax 

on all "the payments for admission". It casts duty on the proprietor to 

collect the tax from the person seeking admission and deposit it. The 

tax is to be paid by person seeking admission and duty is on the 

proprietor of the entertainment event to collect and deposit it with the 

revenue. Even where admission is free or on concessional rates, the 

tax is to be levied on the full rate payable for entry where the entry is 

generally on payment. Even where lump sum payments are made by 

way of subscription, contribution, donation or otherwise and if such 

payments are for the admission to an entertainment, the tax is payable 

on it. Where in a hotel, club or restaurant entertainment is provided by 

way of cabarets, floor shows or when an entertainment is organized on 

special occasions and any free meal or refreshment is provided to the 

customers with a view to attract them, Section 6 of the Act imposes 

tax on such free meals and refreshments. 

20. Section 6 is reproduced as under in order to make it convenient 

to understand the provision:-

"6. Tax on payment for admission to entertainment-


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 102 of 143 

(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, there shall be 
levied and paid on all payments for admission to any 
entertainment, other than an entertainment to which 
section 7 applies, an entertainment tax at such rate 
not exceeding one hundred per cent of each such 
payment as the government may from time to time 
notify in this behalf, and the tax shall be collected by 
the proprietor from the person making the payment 
for admission and paid to the government in the 
manner prescribed. 

(2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall preclude the 
government from notifying different rates of 
entertainment tax for different classes of 
entertainment or for different payment for admission 
to entertainment. 

(3) Where the payment for admission to an 
entertainment together with the tax is not multiple of 
fifty paise, then notwithstanding anything contained in 
sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) or any notification 
issued thereunder, the tax shall be increased to such 
extent and be so computed that the aggregate of such 
payment for admission to entertainment and the tax is 
rounded off to the next higher multiple of fifty paise, 
and such increased tax shall also be collected by the 
proprietor and paid to the government in the manner 
prescribed. 

(4) If in any entertainment, referred to in sub-section 
(1), to which admission is generally on payment, any 
person is admitted free of charge or a concessional 
rate, the same amount of tax shall be payable as if 
such person was admitted on full payment. 

(5) Where the admission to a place of entertainment is 
generally on payment, and if any entertainment is held 
in lieu of the regular entertainment programme 
without payment of admission or with payment of 
admission less than what would have been paid in the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 103 of 143 

normal course, the proprietor shall be liable to pay 
tax which would have been payable in a normal 
course at full house capacity or the tax for the 
programme held in lieu of the regular entertainment 
programme whichever is higher. 

(6) Where the payment for admission to an 
entertainment, referred to in sub-section (1), is made 
wholly or partly, by means of a lump sum paid as 
subscription, contribution, donation or the 
tax shall be paid on the amount of such lump sum and 
on the amount of payment for admission, if any, made 
otherwise. 

(7) Where in a hotel or a restaurant, or a club, 
entertainment is provided by way of cabarets, floor 
shows, or entertainment is organized on special 
occasion along with any meal or refreshment with a 
view to attract customers, the same shall be taxed at a 
rate to be notified under sub-section (1)." 

21. The language of Section 6 unambiguously states that 

entertainment tax is to be paid on all 'payments for admission'. The 

term "payment for admission" is defined in Section 2(m) of the Act. 

Section 6 uses the expression "there shall be levied and paid on all 

"payments for admission to any entertainment", the entertainment tax. 

22. The expression 'payment for admission' is defined in Section 

2(m). Before the addition of Explanation 2, the impugned Notification, 

Section 2(m) read as under:-

"2 (m) "payment for admission" includes-

(i) any payment made by a person for seats or other 
accommodation in any form in a place of 
entertainment; 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 104 of 143 

(ii) any payment for cable service; 

(iii) any payment made for the loan or use of any 
instrument or contrivance which enables a person to 
get a normal or better view or hearing or enjoyment 
of the entertainment, which without the aid of such 
instrument or contrivance such person would not get; 

(iv) any payment, by whatever name called for any 
purpose whatsoever, connected with an entertainment, 
which a person is required to make in any form as a 
condition of attending, or continuing to attend the 
entertainment, either in addition to the payment, if 
any, for admission to the entertainment or without any 
such payment for admission; 

(v) any payment made by a person who having been 
admitted to one part of a place of entertainment is 
subsequently admitted to another part thereof, for 
admission to which a payment involving tax or more 
tax is required; 

(vi) 
any payment made by a person by way of 
contribution, subscription, installation or connection 
charges or any other charges collected in any manner 
whatsoever for entertainment through direct-to-home 
(DTH) broadcasting service for distribution of 
television signals and value added services with the 
aid of any type of addressable system, which connects 
a television set, computer system at a residential or 
non-residential place of subscriber"s premises, 
directly to the satellite or otherwise. 

Explanation: Any subscription raised, contribution 
received or donation collected in connection with an 
entertainment, where admission is partly or entirely 
by tickets/invitation specifying the amount of 
admission or reduced rate of ticket shall be deemed 
to be payment for admission." 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 105 of 143 

23. The definition starts with, using the expression "payment for 

admission includes". The use of word "includes" in the definition 

unambiguously demonstrates the intent of the Legislature. The 

conscious use of the word "includes" by the Legislature seems to have 

been done with the intent to give widest possible interpretation this 

provision. 

24. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in M/s Geeta Enterprises and Ors 

v. State of U.P & Ors, (1983) 4 SCC 202 discussed the meaning of 

expression "includes" whenever used by the Legislature and observed 

as under:-

"13. The Allahabad High Court in the case of Gopal 
Krishna Agarwal v. State of Uttar Pradesh, which was 
also a case under the Act, held that entertainment tax 
was leviable on video games. The High Court has 
very carefully analysed sub-section (3) of Section 2 of 
the Act and the import of the word 'entertainment' and 
observes as follows:-

"The context in which the word 'includes" has been 
used in the definition clauses of the Act does not 
indicate that the legislature intended to put a 
restriction or a limitation on words like 
'entertainment' or 'admission to an entertainment' 
or 'payment for admission'. With the advance of 
civilization and scientific developments new forms of 
entertainments have come into existence. The money 
charged for use of the video machine is an admission 
to entertainment and the payment made by the person 
who uses the machine is the payment for admission. In 
any case it is a payment for admission. In any case it 
is a payment connected with entertainment which a 
person is required to make as a condition of attending 
the entertainment." 
(emphasis supplied) 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 106 of 143 

25. The Court concluded in para 14 as under:-

"14. We find ourselves in entire agreement with the 
observations of the Court and fully approve of the 
ratio decidendi of this case. The Allahabad High 
Court has given almost the same reasons as given by 
us in the earlier part of the judgment." 

26. While upholding the findings of the Allahabad High Court in 

Gopal Krishna Agarwal (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court set aside 

the findings of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Harris Wilson v. 

State of Madhya Pradesh AIR 1982 MP 171 which had taken a 

contrary view. 

27. The Apex Court again had the occasion to interpret the word 

'include' in N.D.P. Namboodripad (Dead) by LRs vs. Union of India 

(UOI) and Ors. (2007) 4 SCC 502. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, while 

interpreting the meaning of the word 'include' had reiterated that it 

should be given the widest possible meaning. The Hon'ble Supreme 

Court stated in para 18 that, "...it is no doubt true that generally when 

the word 'include' is used in a definition clause, it is used as a word of 

enlargement, that is to make the definition extensive and not 

restrictive...." 

28. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in an earlier judgment P. 

Kasilingam and Ors. vs. P.S.G. College of Technology and Ors. AIR 

1995 SC 1395, while discussing the meaning of words 'means' and 

'includes' has held as under:-

"19....A particular expression is often defined by the 
Legislature by using the word 'means' or the word 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 107 of 143 

'includes'. Sometimes the words 'means and includes' are 
used. The use of the word 'means' indicates that 
"definition is a hard-and-fast definition, and no other 
meaning can be assigned to the expression that is put 
down in definition." (See: Gough v. Gough [(1891) 2 QB 
665:60 LJ QB 726]; Punjab Land Development and 
Reclamation Corpn. Ltd. v. Presiding Officer, Labour 
Court[(1990) 3 SCC 682, 717 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 71]). 
The word 'includes' when used, enlarges the meaning of 
the expression defined so as to comprehend not only such 
things as they signify according to their natural import 
but also those things which the clause declares that they 
shall include. The words 'means and includes', on the 
other hand, indicate "an exhaustive explanation of the 
meaning which, for the purposes of the Act, must 
invariably be attached to these words or expressions….." 

(emphasis supplied) 

29. Again, in Bharat Cooperative Bank (Mumbai) Ltd. vs. 

Cooperative Bank Employees Union (2007) 4 SCC 685, the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court, while defining the meaning of expression 'include' 

used by the Legislature has held in para 23:-

"23....On the other hand, when the word "includes" 
is used in the definition, the legislature does not 
intend to restrict the definition; makes the 
definition enumerative but not exhaustive. That is 
to say, the term defined will retain its ordinary 
meaning but its scope would be extended to bring 
within it matters, which in its ordinary meaning 
may or may not comprise...." 

(emphasis supplied) 

30. The same principle of interpretation of the word 'include' has 

been reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case Hamdard 

(Wakf) Laboratories vs. Deputy Labour Commissioner and Ors. AIR 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 108 of 143 

2008 SC 968 wherein the Apex Court has held that "When an 

interpretation clause uses the word "includes", it is prima facie 

extensive…". 

31. In Commercial Taxation Officer vs. Rajasthan Taxchem Ltd. 

(2007) 3 SCC 124, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has again put emphasis 

on the need to give wider interpretation to the word 'include. The 

Apex Court has held as under:-

"22...The word includes gives a wider meaning to the 
words or phrases in the Statute. The word includes is 
usually used in the interpretation clause in order to 
enlarge the meaning of the words in the statute. When the 
word include is used in the words or phrases, it must be 
construed as comprehending not only such things as they 
signify according to their nature and impact but also 
those things which the interpretation clause declares they 
shall include...." 

(emphasis supplied) 

32. Earlier also, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.K. Gupta and Anr. 

vs. K.P. Jain and Anr. (1979) 3 SCC 54, while discussing the 

meaning and import of word 'include' has clearly held in para 24 of its 

judgment that "....But where the definition is an inclusive definition, 

the word not only bears its ordinary, popular and natural sense 

whenever that would be applicable but it also bears its extended 

statutory meaning. At any rate, such expansive definition should be so 

construed as not cutting down the enacting provisions of an Act unless 

the phrase is absolutely clear in having opposite effect.." 

(emphasis supplied) 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 109 of 143 

33. It therefore is clear that the fundamental canon of statutory 

construction is that a literal interpretation is the first and foremost 

approach. If the words are plain and clear, the Courts must give effect 

to its ordinary meaning without adding or subtracting anything. It is 

the grammatical interpretation which is needed to be given to word 

used in a provision and the same should be in harmony and 

consonance with the Statute. 

34. In the Act, the Legislature has used the expression 'include' in 

Section 2(m) of the Act which defines the payment for admission and 

also in Section 2(aa) of the Act which defines admission to an 

entertainment. From the object of the Act and the language used by 

the Legislature in other provisions of the Act clearly shows that the 

Legislature has consciously used the word 'include' in Section 2(m) 

and Section 2(aa) of the Act. The use of the word 'include' in these two 

definitions, defining 'payment for admission' and 'admission to an 

entertainment' is inclusive in nature. The use of expression clearly 

shows the intention of the Legislature to give expanded and wide 

meaning to the definitions of 'payment for admission' and 'admission 

to an entertainment'. The object and purpose of passing this Act was to 

impose entertainment tax on the admissions to an entertainment. The 

use of the expression 'include' is intended to have been used in these 

two definitions with the object to expand the meaning of the 

definitions to include all the payments for admission and admissions 

to an entertainment with intent to curtail the non-payment of 

entertainment tax by camouflaging the payments or the admissions to 

an entertainment events. The expression "include" thus needs to be 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 110 of 143 

given widest connotation to fully justify the intention of Legislature 

which is to interpret the Act in such a manner which help in tackling 

the situation and efforts made to avoid taxes by adopting indigenous 

methods, by couching or disguising payments made to organizers. 

This view finds support from the findings of the Apex Court in British 

Airways Plc (supra), wherein the Hon'ble Court has clearly held that 

"it is the duty of the court to make such construction of a statute which 

shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy" and to keep in 

mind "the consequences which are likely to flow upon the intended 

interpretation". 

35. Section 2(m) (i) of the Act envisages that besides payment for 

seats, payments made for "other accommodation in any form in a 

place of entertainment" is also to be treated as payment for admission. 

The definition makes it clear that besides making payment for seats, if 

payment is made for other accommodations in any form in a place of 

entertainment, such payment is payment for admission. Such 

accommodation could be in the form of display of products or logo or 

brand names or permission to put up the advertisement in a place of 

entertainment, and then if any payment in lieu of such accommodation 

is made to the organizer, as per this definition, it is payment for 

admission to an entertainment. 

36. This payment could be payment in the form of sponsorship 

amount. If on account of payment of the sponsorship amount, the 

sponsors are accommodated to display their products or logo or brand 

name or put up their advertisements, then this sponsorship amount 

paid as per definition of Section 2(m)(i) of the Act is payment for 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 111 of 143 

admission. This is the only interpretation that can be given to this 

provision. 

37. Sub-clause (iv) of clause (m) of Section 2 of the Act includes 

within its ambit, any payment made by a person in any form, called by 

whatever name, may be made for any purpose, connected with the 

entertainment and if in lieu of that, a person is allowed to attend the 

entertainment or allowed to continue to attend it, then such payment 

by virtue of this provision, is payment for admission. The use of the 

words and expression "any payment, by whatever name called for 

any purpose whatsoever", if that purpose is "connected with 

entertainment" and which a person is required to make "in any form" 

as a "condition of attending", unambiguously depicts the intention of 

Legislature to give widest amplitude to this provision. To give narrow 

or restricted interpretation to the definition would certainly defeat the 

object of the provision and intent of the Legislature. 

38. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gurudevdatta VKSSS Maryadit 

(supra) has clearly held that "the words of a statute must be 

understood in their natural, ordinary or popular sense and construed 

according to their grammatical meaning...." . The well-settled 

principle is that the words have to be given its ordinary meaning, 

especially where the words are clear, plain and unambiguous. The 

words used are certainly the best source to know and understand the 

intention of the Legislature while framing the said law. 

39. Earlier, there was only one Explanation to Section 2(m) of the 

Act. By impugned amendment, Explanation 2 was added. The earlier 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 112 of 143 

Explanation is now termed as Explanation 1 and is reproduced as 

under:-

"Explanation 1: Any subscription raised, contribution 
received or donation collected in connection with an 
entertainment, where admission is partly or entirely by 
tickets/invitation specifying the amount of admission or 
reduced rate of ticket shall be deemed to be payment for 
admission." 

40. 
As per this Explanation, any subscription raised, contribution 

received or donation collected in connection with an entertainment, 

where admission is partly or entirely by tickets/invitation shall be 

deemed to be payment for admission. This Explanation clarifies to 

some extent the expression "any payment", "by whatever name called 

for" and "made for any purpose whatsoever" used in Section 2(m) of 

the Act, by stating that even where the payments received are termed 

as subscription, contribution or donation, it is payment for admission. 

This shows that even before the impugned amendment, Section 2(m) 

of the Act has postulated that payments by whatever name it may be 

called for, if it is made for entry to a place of entrainment, then such 

payments even if it is termed as subscription, donation or contribution 

shall be deemed payment for admission. The Legislature has used the 

expressions "payments for other accommodation in any form in a 

place of entertainment" in Section 2(m)(i) of the Act. Similarly, in 

Section 2(m)(iv) of the Act, the language used by the Legislature, is 

any payments made, any name given to such payment and given for 

any purpose which is connected with an entertainment which a person 

is required to make in any form as a condition of attending or 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 113 of 143 

continuing to attend the entertainment, then such payment made in any 

form is taxable. It could be in the form of providing certain free 

services or other benefits or any other freebees. Language of Section 

2(m) of the Act is wide enough to include the payment made in any 

form. The conscious use of such wide range language by the 

Legislature only indicates that it has been used with an object to 

circumvent the evasion of tax. 

41. The said intention can also be seen, in the language used while 

defining "Admission to an entertainment" in Section 2(aa) of the Act. 

In this definition, the Legislature has again used the expression 

includes. The expression 'admission to entertainment' includes 

"admission to any place in which entertainment is held". While 

defining the expression "Admission to an entertainment", the 

Legislature has not used the expression "Admission of a person to a 

place where entertainment is held" rather it has used the language 

"includes admission to any place where entertainment is held". 

Reading of this plain inclusive language suggests that admission to a 

place of entertainment could be of a person or by any other way like 

display of goods, brand names or logo or advertisement of one"s 

product etc. at a place where entertainment is being held. Wide 

amplitude of the provision cannot certainly be restricted. When both 

the definitions of admission to an entertainment and definition for 

payment for admission, is read together, it clearly shows that where 

payment is made for accommodation of the nature of advertisement or 

display of logo/brand name, it is admission to a place where the 

entertainment is held and, therefore, is any payment is made and that 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 114 of 143 

payment may have been given any name, the tax is leviable on such 

payment. The Act envisages tax on payments made in any manner, or 

by any name, if by making that payment, admission to a place of 

entertainment is sought, then tax is leviable on such payment. 

42. The impugned Notification is to be seen in this background for 

ascertaining if the Legislature vide impugned Explanation 2 has added 

new levies which were not envisaged in the main provision i.e. 

Section 2 (m) of the Act. The impugned notification reads as under:-

"Explanation 2: Any sponsorship amount paid or 
value of goods supplied or services rendered or 
benefits provided to the organizer of an entertainment 
programme in lieu of advertisement of sponsor"s 
product/brand name or otherwise shall be deemed to 
be payment for admission." 

43. This Explanation envisages that any sponsorship amount paid or 

value of goods supplied or services rendered or benefits provided to 

the organizer of an entertainment programme in lieu of advertisement 

of sponsor's product/brand name, etc. is deemed to be payment for 

admission. 

44. The purpose and object of an Explanation which is added to any 

Section is to clarify and explain the original provision. There is no 

dispute to the proposition of law that the Legislature cannot by way of 

explanation add any new levy, without amending the main provision. 

The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S. Sundaram Pillai and 

Ors. vs. V.R. Pattabiraman & Ors. (1985) 1 SCC 591 had the 

occasion to consider the scope of Explanation and the Hon"ble Court 

has held as under:-


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 115 of 143 

"53. Thus, from a conspectus of the authorities 
referred to above, it is manifest that the object of an 
Explanation to a statutory provision is-

(a) to explain the meaning and intendment of the Act 
itself, 

(b) where there is any obscurity or vagueness in the 
main enactment, to clarify the same so as to make it 
consistent with the dominant object which it seems to 
subserve. 

(c) to provide an additional support to the dominant 
object of the Act in order to make it meaningful and 
purposeful, 

(d) an Explanation cannot in any way interfere with 
or change the enactment or any part thereof but 
where some gap is left which is relevant for the 
purpose of the Explanation, in order to suppress the 
mischief and advance the object of the Act it can help 
or assist the Court in interpreting the true purport and 
intendment of the enactment, and 

(e) it cannot, however, take away a statutory right 
with which any person under a statute has been 
clothed or set at naught the working of an Act by 
becoming an hindrance in the interpretation of the 
same." 

The same principles were reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court in Dipak Chandra Ruhidas v. Chandan Kumar Sarkar (2003) 

7 SCC 66. 

45. This Court needs to judge the nature of impugned Explanation 

in the light of these principles which the Apex Court has formulated, 

in order to conclude whether the impugned Explanation is 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 116 of 143 

explanatory/clarificatory or it adds new levy, if it is latter, then it has 

to go. 

46. For this, we need to construe Section 2(m). As already 

discussed, Section 2(m)(i) of the Act states that when a payment is 

made for seats or other accommodations in any form in a place of 

entertainment then such payment for seats or other accommodation in 

any form is subjected to tax as the same is payment for admission. It 

is apparent that the language used by the Legislature in Section 2(aa) 

and Section 2(m) of the Act is of widest amplitude. Thus, it can be 

safely discern from it that the Legislature has always intended to 

include levy on the payments made for tickets or other 

accommodations of any nature in a place of entertainment when 

admission to a place where entertainment is being held, is sought. The 

conjoint reading of Sections 2(aa) and 2(m)(i) clarify the intention of 

the Legislature that it had intended to levy taxes on the payments 

made for other accommodations in a place of entertainment, in any 

form, which could be, as already discussed, by display of brand/logo 

or putting up of advertisement, considering it an admission to a place 

in which entertainment is being held. Similarly, any payment by 

whatever name it may be called for, which a person is required to 

make "in any form" as a condition precedent to attending or continue 

attending the entertainment then such payment made in any form, is 

also payment for admission under Section 2(m) of the Act. Such 

payments could be termed as sponsorship amount or be called by any 

other name and such payments can also be in the form of providing 

free meals, beverages, decoration of the venue or other services or 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 117 of 143 

other benefits to the organizers of the events. The provision wraps 

within it all these payments as it clearly states that payments in any 

form in lieu of which a person is allowed to attend or continue to 

attend the entertainment. It is crucial to note that the Legislature in 

Section 2(m) has used the expression "includes". It states "payment 

for admission" "includes" and, therefore, the definition of payment for 

admission is inclusive one and has to be given wider interpretation. 

47. The petitioners in these petitions have challenged the levy of tax 

on sponsorship amounts, alleging that tax on the sponsorship amount 

was not leviable as per Section 2(m) and it has sought to be brought 

within the purview of Section 2(m) of the Act by adding Explanation 2 

to it and in this way the new tax provision has been added without 

amending main Section. 

48. The undisputed facts are that the FDCI is a registered Society 

which was established solely for the purpose of promoting and 

fostering the growth of the Indian Fashion industry. The events so 

organized by FDCI are non-ticketed events, i.e., entry to the shows 

organized by it is exclusively by invitation, both for domestic and 

international buyers, associated professionals and media. It was 

granted 100% exemption from the liability to pay entertainment tax 

under the Act in respect of the events held by it for the period 2002-

2004. However, for the year 2008-2009, such exemption for holding 

such events was withdrawn and as a special case, considering the 

recession in the industry and export sectors and to project Delhi as a 

world class city, the liability of FDCI to pay the tax, was restricted to 

50% of the tax payable. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 118 of 143 

49. FDCI approached this Court in writ petitions bearing W.P.(C) 

No.1145/2010, W.P.(C) No.3199/2011, W.P.(C) No.3200/2011, 

W.P.(C)

W.P.(C) 

No.7505/2011, W.P.(C) No.7506/2011, W.P.(C) No.1169/2010 and 

W.P.(C) No.4728/2010 against the assessment orders and demand of 

50% of the entertainment tax and non-issuance of No Objection 

Certificate (NOC) on account of non-payment of entertainment tax. 

This Court directed the issuance of NOC subject to deposit of money. 

Before Additional Entertainment Tax Officer (AETO), FDCI raised 

two contentions. The first was that the Fashion shows were not 

"entertainment" under the Act and the second was, that the sponsorship 

amounts received by it were not "payment for admission to the 

entertainment" and, therefore, non-chargeable to entertainment tax. 

The AETO rejected both the contentions of FDCI. 

50. The contentions raised by FDCI before AETO is noted by 

Coordinate Bench of this Court in para 4 of its judgment dated 

30.04.2012, reads as under:-

"4. A perusal of the assessment orders shows that the 
principal contentions raised by the petitioners before 
the AETO were these. The first contention was that 
the Fashion show was not an "entertainment" under 
the Act. This contention was rejected by the AETO 
who held that it is an exhibition of designs and 
clothing and would also amount to a performance by 
the models on the ramp and thus the Fashion show 
amounts to an "entertainment". The other contention 
raised by the petitioner was that the sponsorship 
amount received in respect of the Wills Lifestyle India 
Fashion Week was not "payment for admission to the 
entertainment" and therefore not chargeable to 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 119 of 143 

entertainment tax. This contention was also rejected 
by the AETO, relying upon the inclusive definition of 
the term "payment for admission" in Section 2 (m) of 
the Act." 

(emphasis supplied) 

51. However, while challenging the assessment orders before this 

Court, the FDCI in the writ petitions confined its contentions only to 

two grounds. The contentions raised the FDCI before the Division 

Bench of this Court in these writ petitions was noted by Division 

Bench as under. In para 7, the first contention is noted as follows:-

"7. The first contention is based on the powers of 
delegation given under Section 4 of the Act to the 
government." 

52. It, therefore, is clear that FDCI in these earlier writ petitions did 

not challenge the findings of AETO that the fashion shows are 

entertainment events within the meaning of the Act. This Court has 

dealt with the second contention of the FDCI in para 15 of the said 

judgment dated 30.04.2012 and observed as under: 

"15. The second contention put forth before us is that 
the sponsorship amounts collected by the petitioner 
cannot be considered as "payment for admission" 
within the meaning of Section 2 (m) or Section 6 (6) of 
the Act. It is stated that sponsors make payment of the 
amounts to the petitioner for sponsoring the Fashion 
show and there is no stipulation that the amounts are 
received by the petitioner on condition that some 
persons will be allowed admission to the Fashion 
shows without any separate payment for the same. 
This contention was put forward before the AETO. 
But he has not chosen to examine the same on the 
basis of the facts, the agreements between the 
petitioner and the sponsors. He has examined the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 120 of 143 

question whether the Fashion shows are 
"entertainment" within the meaning of the Act, an 
aspect about which there is now no dispute. The 
AETO has referred to the question whether the 
sponsorship amount collected by the petitioner 
represented payment for admission to an 
entertainment in para 17 of his order dated 
11.06.2009, which is an assessment order for the 
period 15.10.2008 to 19.10.2009. He has merely 
referred to Section 2(m) of the Act, and particularly to 
clause (i) of the provision. He has noted that the 
definition of the expression "payment for admission" 
is an inclusive definition and, therefore, should be 
construed liberally. He has also referred to Section 
2(aa) of the Act which defines the term "admission to 
the entertainment". From this provision he has drawn 
the inference that even if the payment received by the 
petitioner is not in consideration of allotment of seats 
to the sponsor, it would still fall for being considered 
as payment for admission because of the inclusive 
definition which is wide enough to cover participation 
in any Fashion show. In support of his conclusion the 
AETO merely referred to Section 6(6) of the Act in 
paras 24 and 25 of the impugned order." 

53. The finding that fashion shows are entertainment has attained 

finality since matter though taken to the Hon'ble Supreme Court was 

withdrawn. Even otherwise in Amit Kumar (supra), the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court has clearly stated that fashion shows are subjected to 

entertainment tax even though the invite was only by invitation. The 

Court held that such acts are subterfuge to avoid tax. The Court has 

held as under:-

"19. We have carefully considered the submissions 
made on behalf of the respective parties and we are 
inclined to agree with Mr. Dviwedi that the fashion 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 121 of 143 

show was held with full knowledge that entertainment 
tax was payable in respect thereof and that though 
tickets may not have been issued in respect of the 
programme and only invitation cards had been issued, 
the same was merely a subterfuge for the purpose of 
evading and/or avoiding payment of entertainment 
tax. It is difficult to believe that the fashion show was 
held with the object of educating prospective students 
who would be interested in joining the Institute of Art, 
Fashion Designing and Modelling and was, therefore, 
exempt under Section 11(3) of the 1979 Act. As the 
advertisement referred to above indicates the object of 
the show was to invite people to come and watch the 
new world of glamour and modelling and to see the 
world of exotic fashion in Gorakhpur itself." 

(emphasis supplied) 

54. Even otherwise, the question whether an event of fashion shows 

is an entertainment within the meaning of Act or not, is a question of 

facts, to be determined by the concerned authorities in terms of 

settled principles of law as set out in various pronouncements, 

including M/s Geeta Enterprises and Ors. (supra), based on 

evidences and documents produced before it. 

55. In M/s Geeta Enterprises and Ors. (supra), the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court has interpreted the expression "entertainment" as used 

in Section 2 (3) of The Uttar Pradesh Entertainment and Betting Tax 

Act, 1937, which is akin to Section 2(i) of the Act which defines the 

word 'entertainment' and Section 3 of The Uttar Pradesh 

Entertainment and Betting Tax Act, 1937, is akin to Section 6 of the 

Act. In M/s Geeta Enterprises and Ors. (supra),the Apex Court has 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 122 of 143 

laid down the parameters to be considered while deciding whether an 

event is an entertainment or not. The Court has held as under:-

"12. Thus, on a consideration of the legal connotation 
of the word 'entertainment as defined in various 
books, and other circumstances of the case as also on 
a true interpretation of the word as defined in Section 
2 (3) of the Act, it follows that the show must pass the 
following tests to fall within the ambit of the aforesaid 
section: 

1. that the show, performance, game or sport, etc. 
must contain a public colour in that the show should 
be open to public in a hall, theatre or any other place 
where members of the public are invited or attend the 
show. 

2. that the show may provide any kind of amusement 
whether sport, game or even a performance which 
requires some amount of skill. 

In some of the cases, it has been held that even 
holding of a tombola in a club hall amounts to 
entertainment although the playing of tombola does, 
to some extent, involves a little skill. 

3. that even if admission to the hall may be free but if 
the exhibitor derives some benefit in terms of money it 
would be deemed to be an entertainment. 

4. that the duration of the show or the identity of the 
person who operates the machine and derives 
pleasure or entertainment or that the operator who 
pays himself, feels entertained is wholly irrelevant, in 
judging the actual meaning of the word 
'entertainment' as used in Section 2 (3) of the Act. So 
also the fact that the income derived from the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 123 of 143 

show is shared by one or more persons who run the 
show." 
(emphasis supplied) 

56. The Court has clearly held "that the operator who pays himself, 

feels entertained is wholly irrelevant, in judging the actual meaning of 

the word 'entertainment'. Hence, it is apparent that if a person pays for 

seats or other accommodation in any form in a place of entertainment, 

it is not essential that he should be entertained. 

57. In M/s Geeta Enterprises and Ors. (supra), the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court has categorically held that when a show is an 

entertainment than any payment made for admission to such 

entertainment in any form, is levy to tax. The Court further held that 

even where the entry to a show is free, if the exhibitor derives some 

benefits in terms of money, such shows shall be deemed to be an 

entertainment and that it is immaterial if the income is shared by more 

persons. 

58. The findings of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M/s Geeta 

Enterprises (supra) is in relation to the video shows, which though are 

entertainment, and where the admission was free but the payment was 

to be made for the use of game machine and the Court on these facts 

held that the money charged for the use of the video machine is 

payment for admission to an entertainment and so taxable. It is the use 

of video machines located in the place of entertainment and the 

payment made for the use of such video machines and the profits 

earned by the organizers, which weighed in the mind of the Court 

when the Court held that such payments are payment for admission to 

a place of entertainment. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 124 of 143 

59. Applying the same analogy where anyone uses a place of 

entertainment for display of its brand name/logo/products and pays 

for it in any form, either in cash terming it as sponsorship money or in 

kind, i.e., by giving some benefits in the form of freebees which could 

be free goods, free services or other benefits to the organizers and 

thereby causing profits to the organizers, then such benefits and 

sponsorship money and payments made is admission to a place of 

entertainment. It is apparent that in such scenario, the organizers are 

saving its expenditure on such services while organizing the events 

and thus earning profits. By virtue of definition of payment for 

admission in Section 2(m) of the Act, these certainly have to be 

considered as payments for admission in a place of entertainment. No 

one can be allowed to evade tax by camouflage. The definition of 

payment for admission in Section 2(m) of the Act is wide enough to 

include all payments by piercing the camouflage as also observed by 

the Apex Court in para 12 of M/s Geeta Enterprises (supra) where it 

has clearly held that even where the admission to an entertainment is 

free, "but if organizers derives some benefit in terms of money, it 

would be deemed to be an entertainment". 

60. This Court in earlier challenge by FDCI in its judgment dated 

30.04.2012 in para 16, has clearly held that "unless the terms and 

conditions of the sponsorship agreement are examined it may not be 

possible to ascertain the true nature of the payment and decide about 

the applicability of the relevant provisions of the Act..." 

This makes clear that this Court in its earlier judgment has 

clearly opined that whether a sponsorship amount paid amounts to 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 125 of 143 

payment for admission or not is a question of facts, to be ascertained 

from documents. In this context, this Court has further observed that 

"The provisions of the Act have to be applied only to the facts 

gathered and governing the case and not in vacuo." 

61. This Court has clearly held that true nature of the payment is 

essentially to be ascertained from the agreements and other documents 

for determining the issue whether payment made is payment for 

admission as defined in Section 2(m) of the Act. Nomenclature of the 

payment is immaterial. The Coordinate Bench of this Court in earlier 

judgment dated 30.04.2012 held that fashion shows are entertainment 

and it is the discretion of authorities to grant exemption or not and 

thereby upheld the charge of 50% tax of the tax payable by FDCI. The 

Court remanded the matter for ascertaining the payable tax and in this 

context, the Court has held as under:-

"20. Whether to grant exemption to the Fashion 
events from entertainment tax or not is a discretionary 
power granted to the Government of NCT of Delhi. 
However, the discretion is controlled by the criteria 
mentioned in the section. Even if the criteria stands 
satisfied, it is for the government to decide whether 
full exemption or part exemption is to be given to the 
petitioner from entertainment tax. The exemption, 
whether full or part, may also be granted subject to 
such terms and conditions as the government may 
deem fit to impose. It appears that essentially it is a 
matter which is within the domain of the executive and 
judicial review is limited to examining whether the 
relevant criteria have been kept in view and whether 
the decision making process has been just and fair. It 
is not for Court to examine the correctness of the 
decision of the executive. The Court can examine only 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 126 of 143 

the decision making process. On a perusal of the 
order passed by the Government of NCT of Delhi on 
10.09.2009 and on a fair reading thereof we find that 
the petitioner has been given a personal hearing to 
explain its petition for exemption from entertainment 
tax and thus the rules of natural justice have been 
adhered to, though Section 14 of the Act does not 
specifically refer to the grant of a personal hearing. 
Secondly, all the points raised by the petitioner in 
support of the claim for exemption have been duly 
noted in the impugned order and taken into 
consideration by the competent authority. After taking 
into account all the relevant criteria and the 
submissions made by the petitioner, the competent 
authority has taken a decision to grant exemption to 
the petitioner from payment of entertainment tax only 
to the extent of 50% of the tax amount as a special 
case. In coming to this decision it seems to us that 
there is no flaw, irregularity or irrationality in the 
decision of the competent authority justifying 
interference under Article 226 of the Constitution of 
India. The relevant part of the impugned order which 
has been extracted by us hereinabove bear out the 
reasons for not accepting the claim of the petitioner in 
full. The petitioner has been treated fairly and 
objectively and we, therefore, decline to interfere. 

23. In these writ petitions, interim directions were 
issued for deposit of tax as condition for issue of NOC 
for holding the events. The events were permitted to 
be held as the petitioners deposited the tax as directed 
by this Court. In the assessment orders to be passed 
under Section 15 of the Act, pursuant to the disposal 
of the writ petitions, the AETO may raise demands 
including interest, subject to appropriate/ suitable 
adjustments for tax already deposited, and subject to 
the petitioner being given reasonable opportunity of 
being heard." 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 127 of 143 

62. The said order was challenged by FDCI before the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court in SLP (C) No.23411/2012. The said SLP was 

withdrawn by the FDCI with permission to approach the appropriate 

forum if any adverse order is passed by the authority concerned in 

pursuance of the remand order. These findings of the Coordinate 

Bench of this Court that FDCI is liable to pay 50% of tax leviable, has 

attained finality. 

63. The argument that the sponsorship amount is beyond the scope 

of Section 2(m) and no tax can be levied on it under Section 6 is 

without any merit. The sponsorship amount was considered payment 

for admission by Hon'ble Supreme Court also in Amit Kumar (supra) 

also. The findings of the Apex Court in Amit Kumar (supra) and of 

the Coordinate Bench of this Court in writ petitions (supra) were 

given before the impugned Explanation was added to Section 2(m) of 

the Act. 

64. Sections 9 and 10 of the Act put total embargo on the admission 

of any person to any entertainment, except as provided in these 

provisions. If any person supplies goods or renders services or 

provides benefits to the organizers of an entertainment programme and 

in lieu of that he is allowed to put up his advertisements, to display his 

product/brand name, etc. thus allowed admission to a place where 

entertainment is held, in view of Section 2(aa) of the Act, it is 

admission to an entertainment. Naturally, he is permitted to do so by 

the organizers of those events only in lieu of the benefits he has 

provided to him. To put it otherwise, a person is when accommodated 

in the manner that he is permitted to display its product/brand name in 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 128 of 143 

an entertainment event in lieu of certain value of goods supplied by it 

or/and services rendered by it or/and the benefits provided to the 

organizers, then such value of goods supplied and services rendered or 

benefit provided amounts to payment for admission to such an 

entertainment and are leviable to tax. Such payments can be said to 

have been made in these forms, a situation envisaged in Section 2(m) 

(iv) which includes payments made "in any form". 

65. The language of charging Section 6(6) of the Act further 

clarifies the intent of Legislature that the Section 2(m) of the Act is 

required to be given the widest possible interpretation to avoid the 

theft of tax. It is the charging Section and levy entertainment tax on 

every payment for admission to any entertainment. For the sake of 

repetition, Section 6(6) of the Act is reproduced herein:-

"6. Tax on payment for admission to entertainment-

(1) to (5) XXX 
XXX 
XXX 

(6) Where the payment for admission to an 
entertainment, referred to in sub-section (1), is made 
wholly or partly, by means of a lump sum paid as 
subscription, contribution, donation or otherwise, the 
tax shall be paid on the amount of such lump sum and 
on the amount of payment for admission, if any, made 
otherwise. 

66. This clause levy tax on two types of payments. Firstly, on 

payments made in lump sum and secondly, on the amount of payments 

"made otherwise for admission". The expression "made otherwise" 

thus includes payments made in other forms for admission to a place 

of entertainment. Section 2(m) of the Act states that any payment 

made in any form is payment for admission. On superimposing the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 129 of 143 

charging Section 6(6) of the Act on Section 2(m) of the Act, it is clear 

that charge shall be levied on "payments made otherwise" and as 

discussed earlier it could be in the form of benefits, services etc. This 

shows that even before the impugned amendment was added to 

Section 2(m) of the Act, such services or benefits were subjected to 

entertainment tax. This goes to show that the Explanation has simply 

clarified the provisions of Section 2(m). It is clarificatory in nature and 

is intended to remove the loopholes of which the entertainment 

industry is amenable to take advantage in order to avoid the taxes. 

Vide this Explanation, the Legislature is certainly not introducing any 

new tax regime which is not covered under Section 2(m) of the Act. 

There is no doubt that the purpose and aim of an Explanation should 

be to advance the scope of the Act. If the Explanation is meant to 

suppress the mischief, adopted to subserve the main object of the 

Statute, the Explanation cannot be struck down. This Explanation 

provides an additional support to the dominant object of this Act and 

also furthers the meaning and object and intendment of the Act. It also 

removes the vagueness and clarifies the provisions of the Act to make 

it consistent with the object of the Act. 

67. The argument that the Legislature has travelled beyond its 

jurisdiction by adding new regime of tax without amending the 

provision thus has no merit. 

68. In the case of CIT vs. Gold Coin health Food Private Limited 

(2008) 9 SCC 622, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has clearly held that 

where a Statue is passed which is clarificatory and explanatory to a 

former Statute, the subsequent Statue relates back to the time when the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 130 of 143 

prior Act was passed. The relevant paragraphs are reproduced as 

under:-

"18. As noted by this Court in CIT v. Podar Cement 
(P) Ltd. [(1997) 5 SCC 482] the circumstances under 
which the amendment was brought in existence and 
the consequences of the amendment will have to be 
taken care of while deciding the issue as to whether 
the amendment was clarificatory or substantive in 
nature and, whether it will have retrospective effect or 
it was not so. 

19. In Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 11th 
Edn., 2008, Justice G.P. Singh has stated the position 
regarding retrospective operation of statutes as 
follows: 

"The presumption against retrospective 
operation is not applicable to declaratory 
statutes. As stated in Craies and approved 
by the Supreme Court: "For modern 
purposes a declaratory Act may be defined 
as an Act to remove doubts existing as to 
the common law, or the meaning or effect of 
any statute. Such Acts are usually held to be 
retrospective. The usual reason for passing 
a declaratory Act is to set aside what 
Parliament deems to have been a judicial 
error, whether in the statement of the 
common law or in the interpretation of 
statutes. Usually, if not invariably, such an 
Act contains a preamble, and also the word 
"declared" as well as the word "enacted"." 
But the use of the words "it is declared" is 
not conclusive that the Act is declaratory 
for these words may, at times, be used to 
introduce new rules of law and the Act in 
the latter case will only be amending the 
law and will not necessarily be 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 131 of 143 

retrospective. In determining, therefore, the 
nature of the Act, regard must be had to the 
substance rather than to the form. If a new 
Act is "to explain" an earlier Act, it would 
be without object unless construed 
retrospective. An explanatory Act is 
generally passed to supply an obvious 
omission or to clear up doubts as to the 
meaning of the previous Act. It is well 
settled that if a statute is curative or merely 
declaratory 
of 
the 
previous 
law 
retrospective operation is generally 
intended. The language "shall be deemed 
always to have meant" or "shall be deemed 
never to have included" is declaratory, and 
is in plain terms retrospective. In the 
absence of clear words indicating that the 
amending Act is declaratory, it would not be 
so construed when the amended provision 
was clear and unambiguous. An amending 
Act may be purely clarificatory to clear a 
meaning of a provision of the principal Act 
which was already implicit. A clarificatory 
amendment of this nature will have 
retrospective effect and, therefore, if the 
principal Act was existing law when the 
Constitution came into force, the amending 
Act also will be part of the existing law. 

20. In Zile Singh v. State of Haryana [(2004) 8 SCC 
1] sc held as under (SCC pp. 8-9, paras 13-15) 

"13. It is a cardinal principle of 
construction that every statute is prima 
facie prospective unless it is expressly or by 
necessary implication made to have a 
retrospective operation. But the rule in 
general is applicable where the object of the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 132 of 143 

statute is to affect vested rights or to impose 
new burdens or to impair existing 
obligations. Unless there are words in the 
statute sufficient to show the intention of the 
legislature to affect existing rights, it is 
deemed to be prospective only-"nova 
constitutio futuris formam imponere debet 
non praeteritis"-a new law ought to 
regulate what is to follow, not the past. 
(See Principles 
of 
Statutory 
Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, 9th 
Edn., 2004 at p. 438.) It is not necessary 
that an express provision be made to make a 
statute retrospective and the presumption 
against retrospectivity may be rebutted by 
necessary implication especially in a case 
where the new law is made to cure an 
acknowledged evil for the benefit of the 
community as a whole (ibid., p. 440). 

14. The presumption against retrospective 
operation is not applicable to declaratory 
statutes … In determining, therefore, the 
nature of the Act, regard must be had to the 
substance rather than to the form. If a new 
Act is "to explain" an earlier Act, it would 
be without object unless construed 
retrospectively. An explanatory Act is 
generally passed to supply an obvious 
omission or to clear up doubts as to the 
meaning of the previous Act. It is well 
settled that if a statute is curative or merely 
declaratory 
of 
the 
previous 
law 
retrospective operation is generally 
intended … An amending Act may be purely 
declaratory to clear a meaning of a 
provision of the principal Act which was 
already implicit. A clarificatory amendment 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 133 of 143 

of this nature will have retrospective effect 
(ibid., pp. 468-69). 

21. Above being the position, the inevitable 
conclusion is that Explanation 4 to Section 
271(1)(c) is clarificatory and not 
substantive. The view expressed to the 
contrary in Virtual case [(2007) 9 SCC 
665] is not correct." 

69. Also, in the case of ETO v. Ambae Picture Palace (1994) 1 

SCC 209, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has clearly held that when the 

Parliament or State Legislature has the competence to legislate, they 

can do so prospectively as well as retrospectively and the taxation 

laws are no exception to this power. The retrospective effect of 

Explanation 2 does not make it illegal for two reasons; firstly that the 

Legislature has in express terms made it operational with retrospective 

effect and secondly, the very nature of amendment is clarificatory and 

thus does not in any way affects the existing rights of the parties. 

70. Another argument of the petitioners is that no machinery and 

methodology is provided under the Act to calculate the tax on the 

payments as described in Explanation 2 of the Act. It is argued that the 

amendment is vague and unguided and there is no mechanism for 

determining the value of the goods supplied or services rendered or 

benefits provided. 

71. On the other hand, it is argued on behalf of the Revenue that 

Section 8 of the Act restricts holding of an entertainment without prior 

information to the Commissioner. Rule 11 of Delhi Entertainment and 

Betting Tax Rules, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as "the Rules") deals 

with the manner in which such information is to be furnished to the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 134 of 143 

Commissioner by a Society or a person. It requires that an organizer 

shall supply information in Form-5 in case of ticketed event and in 

Form-6 where the admission is exclusively by invitation. It is argued 

that Form-6 is comprehensive and requires an organizer to disclose 

besides name and nature of entertainment, the estimate of expenses, 

sources of meeting the expenses, name of sponsors and the 

sponsorship amount and name of advertiser and the amount received 

from them and to disclose also the number of seats in each class, 

manner and criteria of distribution of invitation cards and levy can be 

easily laid on the basis of this information. It is further argued that 

Government had issued notification under Section 6 of the Act 

wherein it has fixed the entertainment tax at the rate of 15%. As per 

Rule 25 of the Rules, the tax is to be paid by proprietor on the basis of 

returns of payment for admission to the entertainment furnished in 

terms of Section 11 (b) of the Act and thus the organizer is required to 

pay tax on the basis of return furnished by him. It is argued that 

Section 15 of the Act requires that on the basis of information 

furnished by an organization in Form 6, the assessment is to be done 

and under certain circumstances reasonable opportunity to the 

proprietor is mandated before passing of the assessment order. The 

aggrieved person also is provided a right to appeal to the 

Commissioner against such order. The Act has also made the 

provision of Appellate Authority whose jurisdiction can be invoked 

against order of Commissioner. The Act thus provides sufficient 

mechanism and it cannot be said that there is no machinery provided 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 135 of 143 

for charging tax on payments, as envisaged in Explanation, received 

for admission to an entertainment. 

72. I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments of 

learned Senior Counsel of the parties. Their arguments in detail on this 

point are recorded by my learned brother in his order and therefore not 

repeated again. 

73. Section 6 is the charging Section. Sub-section (1) of Section 6 

of the Act makes it mandatory to levy entertainment tax on "all 

payments for admission to any entertainment". The language used is 

"there shall be levied". On imposing the definition of "payment for 

admission" in Section 2(m) of the Act, it is evident that all payments 

made in any form or be termed by any name either for seats or other 

accommodation in any form in a place of entertainment, the charge 

shall be levied on such payments which may be in terms of money or 

which could be in terms of benefits/services etc. as already discussed 

and it is the duty of organizer to collect and deposit it. 

74. Section 8 of the Act prohibits the holding of any event except 

with the prior information to the Commissioner in the prescribed 

manner. Rule 11 of the Rules provides the manner in which such 

information is to be furnished. The same is reproduced as under:-

"11. Form and manner of information before 
holding an entertainment 

A person or society desirous of holding an 
entertainment shall submit to the Commissioner an 
application in Form "5" where it is a ticketed 
programme and in Form "6" where the admission to 
the entertainment is exclusively by invitation, at least 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 136 of 143 

seven clear days before the date of such 
entertainment: 

PROVIDED that, the Commissioner may accept the 
application at a shorter period if he is satisfied that 
there were cogent grounds or difficulties for not 
submitting the application earlier and there is 
sufficient time for depositing the security, getting the 
tickets attested, obtaining Form "7" register and for 
completing other necessary formalities before starting 
the show." 

75. The information is required to be furnished in term of Rule 11 

of the Rules in Form-5 for ticketed events and Form-6 for 

entertainments which are exclusively by invitation. Form 6 is 

reproduced as under:-

"FORM 6 
(Prescribed under rule 11) 
INFORMATION BEFORE HOLDING AN ENTERTAINMENT 
WHERE ADMISSION TO THE ENTERTAINMENT IS EXCLUSIVELY 
BY INVITATION 
To 
The Commissioner 
………………..

required under rule 11 of the Rules made under the said Act:-

1.

2. 
Nature of entertainment 

3. 
Name of permanent as well as local address of the proprietor 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters

4. 
Name and permanent as well as local address of the person who 
will be responsible for management and for conducting day-to-day

23. Additional information, if any, required by the Commissioner 

Date……. 

Signature……….." 

76. The said Rule thus also distinguishes in the events which are 

ticketed and those which are non-ticketed, i.e., where the admission is 

by invitation. Here, it is important to note that pursuant to Sections 8 

and 9, there is absolute restriction to entry to a place of entertainment 

(excluding those exempted under Sections 8 and 9) otherwise than on 

a ticket, and ticket also includes complimentary passes [Section 2 (u)]. 

From the language of Form 6, it is clear that the organizer is required 

to disclose the expenditure incurred and the sources of such expenses. 

While disclosing such expenses and its sources, the organizer has to 

disclose of the contracts he has entered into with various entities or 

persons whom he had allowed admission to a place of entertainment 

either for seats or/and by accommodating them to the extent of 

allowing them to display their logo, brand name or put up their 

advertisements. Where the agreement is to provide free services, free 

beverages, food etc. and in lieu of such accommodation, the organizer 

accommodated them to the extent that they were permitted to display 

their brand name, logo or advertise their product in a place of 

entertainment, that being payment for admission to a place of 

entertainment is taxable. These are the expenses which the organizer 

has saved and thus earned profit. Form 6 requires an organizer to 

disclose its expenses and sources to meet such expenses and where 

certain expenses are met by others by providing services, goods and 

other benefits the organizer while filling Form 6 needs to disclose it. 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 139 of 143 

77. Section 6(6) of the Act envisages where payment is made in 

lump sum such as in the form of subscription, contribution, donation 

or "otherwise" then tax is leviable on this lump sum amount paid 

towards subscription, contribution and donation. This provision also 

levies tax on "payments for admission made otherwise". On conjoint 

reading of Section 2(m) of the Act and this provision, it is clear that 

any payment made otherwise in any other form, which form could be 

by providing services, giving certain benefits or by supply of certain 

goods, or lump sum amount termed as sponsorship, the tax is to be 

levied on such benefits which saves the expenditure of the organizer 

which he would have otherwise incurred for organizing the event. It 

certainly cannot be said that there is no charging provision under the 

Act. 

78. Section 6(7) of the Act further clarifies the intention of 

Legislature to include in tax net the free refreshment and meals 

provided in an entertainment event. No doubt, this provision is 

restricted to hotel etc. but when the Act provides levy on such items in 

clear terms, it cannot be said that the Act provides no method of 

calculating taxes on such services, goods or benefits or freebees. 

79. It is also clear that Form 6, which is meant for non-ticketed 

events like the one held by FDCI, the organizer of an event is required 

to furnish wide arena of information like estimate of expenses with 

details, sources for meeting the expenses, name of sponsors and the 

amount sponsored by them, name of advertisers and the amount 

received from them, number of seats in each class, last serial number 

of each kind of ticket for each class and for each show issued at last 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 140 of 143 

place, the manner and criteria of distribution of invitation cards, 

outlets of distribution of invitation cards if distribution is on first come 

first serve basis and any other additional information, if any, required 

by the Commissioner. The list is exhaustive, wherein the organizer of 

an event can very clearly disclose sponsorship amounts received by 

him. He can also disclose the value of goods, which are not difficult to 

be valued. Also, it is noteworthy that even before the impugned 

Explanation 2, the Form 6 required the organizer of a non-ticketed 

event to disclose as per serial No.10 and 11 of Form 6, the name of 

sponsors and advertiser and the amount received from them. This 

further shows that impugned amendment does not levy new taxes. 

80. As regards the value of benefits or services he has received 

from persons whom he has allowed admission, is concerned, he knows 

the expenditure he had to incur if those services or benefits are not 

provided to him and he had to incur those expenses on his own. These 

facts are within his knowledge, being organizer or manager of the 

entertainment event. Form 6 contains columns which require an 

organizer of the event to estimate the expenses and disclose its source. 

It therefore cannot be said that the Act has no charging Section or the 

Act does not provide the manner in which the information is needed to 

be conveyed to authorities. 

81. The organizers of the sponsored entertainment event cannot be 

allowed to escape their liability to pay taxes simply because instead of 

receiving money in cash, they are receiving it in form of services, 

benefits and/or goods. The argument that machinery provided under 

the Act for calculation of tax is not equipped to do so in these cases 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 141 of 143 

has no merit. To hold it otherwise would encourage the organizers to 

adopt dubious means and methods to avoid payment of taxes. 

82. GMR Sports, DEN Soccer Private Limited, Pro Sportify Private 

Limited and BCCI conduct ticketed entertainment events and are 

required to furnish the requisite information in Form 5. As per Serial 

10, 11 and 12 of the said Form, they are required to disclose the 

number of seats in each class, starting serial number of each kind of 

tickets, for each class for each show, total number of each kind of 

tickets printed for each class for each show. 

83. In such events also if the organizer in lieu of sponsorship or 

certain benefits allowed admission which it cannot do except by issue 

of ticket (Sections 9&10) and ticket also includes passes [Section 2(u)] 

then even if the entry is free or on concessional rate, by virtue of 

Section 6(4), the tax is payable on full amount. Since no person can be 

allowed entry to an entertainment, except on a ticket to such person 

(due to prohibition of Sections 9 and 10 of the Act) and if anyone in 

lieu of benefits/services or other benefits and sponsorship amounts, 

allowed to put up its advertisement and thus allowed admission to a 

place of entertainment, the tax has to be levied on such benefits, 

services or sponsorship amount because by virtue of Section 6(4) of 

the Act, even if the admission is free of charge or on concessional rate. 

Where the admission is generally on payment, the tax has to be paid as 

if the entry was on payment of full charge. It therefore cannot be said 

that the Act does not provide sufficient machinery for levying tax. 

84. Harmonious and effective interpretation is needed to be given to 

the provisions of a Statute, keeping in mind its prime object and the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 142 of 143 

purpose. The Act prohibits the entry to any place of entertainment 

except as provided in Sections 9 and 10 of the Act and Section 2(m) of 

the Act defines payment for admission which definition is inclusive. 

The object and purpose of the Legislature for making the definition of 

Section 2(m) of the Act so broad and inclusive is to defeat indigenous 

methods adopted to avoid tax. The Hon'ble Supreme Court had also 

acknowledged this attitude of organizers that in order to avoid taxes, 

they tactfully invent new methods. In Amit Kumar (supra) case, the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court has come heavily on FDCI and while rejecting 

their contentions that entry by invitation cards was not "payment for 

admission", the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that though tickets 

may not have been issued in respect of the programme and only 

invitation cards had been issued, the same was merely a subterfuge 

for the purpose of evading and/or avoiding payment of 

entertainment tax. 

85. I thus conclude that sponsorship amounts are payments for entry 

to a place of entertainment if it fulfills other requirements of Section 

2(m) of the Act. Similarly, putting up advertisements, display of 

product/brand name etc. in place of entertainment is admission to an 

entertainment in terms of Section 2(aa) of the Act. The impugned 

amendment, whereby Explanation 2 is added retrospectively, is 

explanatory and clarifactory in nature and does not add any new 

regime of taxation and the Act has sufficient machinery to levy taxes. 

86. In Group "A" writ petitions, the petitioners have failed to point 

out any defects in the assessment orders levying taxes on the 


W.P.(C)2563/2013 and connected matters 

Page 143 of 143 

sponsorship amounts received by FDCI. The petitions thus fail and 

dismissed. 

87. In Group "B" cases, the petitioners have challenged various 

letters requiring them to furnish details of sponsorship amounts 

received by them and were also directed to submit the agreements. 

This demand is also in consonance of directions issued by this Court 

in its earlier decision in Fashion Design Council of India (supra), 

whereby this Court had directed the authorities to examine contracts 

before reaching to the conclusion that the sponsorship amount is 

payment for admission in place of entertainment. Sections 15 and 15A 

of the Act also empowers the assessing officer to issue summons to 

any person and examine him under oath and ask him or anyone to 

produce documents. In Group "B" cases since the authorities have 

exercised their powers while issuing the impugned notices, no ground 

for interference exist. Also, the direction to deposit 15% tax is in terms 

of Section 6 of the Act. The writ petitions in Group "B" are also 

dismissed. No order as to costs.
