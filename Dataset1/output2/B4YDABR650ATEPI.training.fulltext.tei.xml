			REKHA PALLI, J
			<lb />

				JUDGMENT
				<lb />
			</head>
			<p>
				1. This batch of four petitions under Section 482 of the Code of
				<lb />
				Criminal Procedure, 1973 has been filed by two senior officers of the
				<lb />
				Indian Railways. Crl.M.C. No.3137/2017 and Crl.M.C.
				<lb />
				No.3141/2017 assail identical but separate sanction orders dated
				<lb />
				14.03.2017 passed by the Minister of Railways, granting approval for
				<lb />
				the petitioners&apos; prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act,
				<lb />
				1988 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;PC Act&quot;) as also the consequential
				<lb />
				order dated 01.07.2017 passed by the learned Trial Court taking
				<lb />
				cognizance against them. Crl.M.C. No.5094/2017 and Crl.M.C.
				<lb />
				No.5095/2017 impugn the order dated 08.05.2017, whereby the
				<lb />
				learned Trial Court has rejected the petitioners&apos; application seeking a
				<lb />
				direction to the Sanctioning Authority to refer the matter regarding
				<lb />
				grant of sanction for their prosecution to the Department of Personnel
				<lb />
				and Training, Government of India (hereinafter referred to as
				<lb />
				&quot;DoPT&quot;) for a final decision, in compliance of the DoPT&apos;s OMs
				<lb />
				dated 15/17.10.1986, 06.11.2006 and 20.12.2006. For the sake of
				<lb />
				convenience, only the facts of Crl.M.C. No.3137/2017 are being
				<lb />
				referred to hereinbelow.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				2. The petitioner who is a senior government official working with
				<lb />
				the Indian Railways, was holding the post of Chief Commercial
				<lb />
				Manager (Catering), Northern Railways (hereinafter referred to as
				<lb />
				&quot;CCM (Catering)&quot;) w.e.f. 25/26.05.2014 against Leave Vacancy.
				<lb />
				Based on a joint surprise check conducted on 22.08.2014 by the
				<lb />
				Central Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter referred to as &quot;CBI&quot;) in
				<lb />
				Rajdhani and Shatabdi Trains, a FIR bearing no. RC-DAI-2015-A-
				<lb />
				0032 was registered u/s 120B r/w section 420 of the IPC and section
				<lb />
				13(2) r/w section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act against the petitioners and
				<lb />
				various other private caterers. Immediately after the registration of
				<lb />
				the FIR on 14.10.2015, the petitioners were suspended from service
				<lb />
				w.e.f. 16.10.2015.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				3.
				<lb />
				As per the allegations in the FIR, various licensee caterers
				<lb />
				appointed by the Indian Railways had been violating the mandatory
				<lb />
				terms and conditions of the license agreement executed between
				<lb />
				them and the Indian Railways for the supply of meals and Packaged
				<lb />
				Drinking Water (hereinafter referred to as &quot;PDW&quot;) to passengers. It
				<lb />
				is alleged that instead of providing Rail Neer, the own brand of the
				<lb />
				Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (hereinafter
				<lb />
				referred to as &quot;IRCTC&quot;), the licensee caterers were supplying other
				<lb />
				brands of PDW to the passengers, thereby causing huge losses to the
				<lb />
				Indian Railways and corresponding gains to themselves. The specific
				<lb />
				role attributed to the petitioners is that, despite being aware of the
				<lb />
				default on the part of the licensee caterers, they did not take punitive
				<lb />
				action against them and, on the other hand, continued to release
				<lb />
				payments to them even though they had breached the terms of the
				<lb />
				license agreement.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				4. After completing its investigation, the CBI, on 16.12.2015, filed
				<lb />
				a charge-sheet against the petitioners before the learned Trial Court
				<lb />
				and simultaneously sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways seeking
				<lb />
				sanction for their prosecution. Later on, upon a specific request, a
				<lb />
				copy of the charge-sheet was also forwarded by the CBI to the
				<lb />
				Ministry of Railways vide its letter dated 07/08.01.2016.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				5. It is the common ground of the parties that no formal complaint
				<lb />
				of any wrongful losses was ever lodged by the Ministry of Railways.
				<lb />
				In fact, even after receiving the CBI&apos;s report and a copy of the
				<lb />
				charge-sheet, the Review Committee of the Ministry of Railways
				<lb />
				decided not to continue with the further suspension of the petitioners
				<lb />
				and on 08.10.2016, specifically observed that the matter had been
				<lb />
				referred to the Central Vigilance Commission (hereinafter referred to
				<lb />
				as &quot;CVC&quot;) for its advice, with the recommendation that the case was
				<lb />
				not fit for prosecution in any court of law or even for Regular
				<lb />
				Departmental Action (hereinafter referred to as &quot;RDA&quot;). The
				<lb />
				aforesaid reference was noted to have been made with the specific
				<lb />
				approval of the Railway Board.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				6. Based upon the reference made to it, the CVC, on 02.05.2016,
				<lb />
				gave its opinion stating that no case was made out for grant of
				<lb />
				sanction for prosecution of the petitioners. The CVC specifically
				<lb />
				observed that it was in agreement with the Railway Board that the
				<lb />
				petitioners&apos; cases were not even fit for RDA. In response to the
				<lb />
				CVC&apos;s opinion dated 02.05.2016, the CBI sent a letter dated
				<lb />
				16.06.2016 to the Railway Board requesting for the reasons why it
				<lb />
				had opined against grant of sanction.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				7. It is the case of the Ministry of Railways that on 18.10.2016, the
				<lb />
				matter alongwith the decision of the CVC advising non-grant of
				<lb />
				sanction, was put up before the Sanctioning Authority, i.e., the
				<lb />
				Minister of Railways, who in turn not only asked for the CBI&apos;s
				<lb />
				written opinion but also requested that the CVC once again offer its
				<lb />
				opinion before a final view is taken in the matter. At the request of
				<lb />
				the Sanctioning Authority, on 02.11.2016, the CVC once again
				<lb />
				reinforced its earlier advice by stating that it had already tendered its
				<lb />
				written advice on 02.05.2016, which was self-explanatory.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				8. At this stage it may be noted that the Railway Board, after
				<lb />
				receiving the CVC&apos;s reply dated 02.11.2016, once again wrote to the
				<lb />
				CBI on 13.12.2016, setting out the details as to why in its opinion as
				<lb />
				concurred by the CVC, the petitioners&apos; cases did not qualify for grant
				<lb />
				of sanction for prosecution. In its letter dated 13.12.2016, the
				<lb />
				Railway Board brought out various important factors, including the
				<lb />
				fact that the Indian Railways had not suffered any loss on account of
				<lb />
				the licensee caterers supplying PDW of brands other than Rail Neer
				<lb />
				and even otherwise, IRCTC had been able to sell its own brand of
				<lb />
				PDW, i.e, Rail Neer fully, if not to the licensees of Rajdhani and
				<lb />
				Shatabdi, but to those of the other mandatory trains/stations, as it was
				<lb />
				very much short in its capacity to produce and supply Rail Neer vis-
				<lb />
				a-vis its total demand of PDW. The said letter also pointed out that
				<lb />
				there was no question of any unlawful gain to the licensees, who
				<lb />
				have in fact been suffering losses irrespective of the brand of PDW
				<lb />
				they supply, since they were being paid only a fixed amount of Rs.15
				<lb />
				per bottle, whereas the cost of a bottle of Rail Neer and other brands
				<lb />
				of PDW is at least Rs.18.08/-and Rs.14.49/-respectively, excluding
				<lb />
				the cost of transportation. Therefore, the licensees had at best cut
				<lb />
				their losses when supplying other brands of PDW instead of Rail
				<lb />
				Neer. It was also pointed out that at such a senior level as CCM
				<lb />
				(Catering), the petitioners were responsible for the overall
				<lb />
				supervision of catering provisions in hundreds of trains and stations
				<lb />
				in the zonal railway and in that process, were assisted by a number of
				<lb />
				officers and staff members. In fact, keeping in view the issues
				<lb />
				flagged by the CBI, Shri Sandeep Silas, the petitioner in Crl.M.C.
				<lb />
				No.3137/2017 had himself made a suggestion that Rail Neer be
				<lb />
				directly supplied to the licensees of premium trains and payments be
				<lb />
				released to them by the Ministry of Railways directly.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				9. It appears that the CBI gave a point-wise reply to the issues
				<lb />
				brought forth by the Railway Board in its letter dated 13.12.2016 and
				<lb />
				once again reiterated that a prima facie case of abuse of office was
				<lb />
				made out against the petitioners and, therefore, sought sanction for
				<lb />
				their prosecution. In the meanwhile, keeping in view the fact that in
				<lb />
				the absence of any sanction order, no further action could be taken
				<lb />
				against the petitioners on the basis of the charge-sheet filed by the
				<lb />
				CBI, the learned Trial Court upon being informed that
				<lb />
				correspondence between the CBI and the competent authority was
				<lb />
				still ongoing, vide its letter dated 06.01.2017 granted one month&apos;s
				<lb />
				time to the Railway Board to take a decision on the question of
				<lb />
				sanction. Since no decision was taken within the time so granted,
				<lb />
				another reminder to the same effect was directed to be issued by the
				<lb />
				learned Trial Court vide its order dated 08.02.2017.
				<lb />
				10. Pursuant to the reminders issued by the learned Trial Court, the
				<lb />
				Sanctioning Authority, vide its impugned order dated 14.03.2017,
				<lb />
				granted sanction for the prosecution of the petitioners in the
				<lb />
				following terms :-

					under section 120-B r/w section 420 IPC and under section
					<lb />
					13(2) r/w 13 (i)(d) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and
					<lb />
					substantive offences thereof on the basis of allegations and
					<lb />
					materials emerging there from. The brief details of the case
					<lb />
					are as under:-
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(iii) CBI, ACB, New Delhi has registered a regular case no.
					<lb />
					RC-DA-1-2015-A-0032 under section 120-B r/w section 420
					<lb />
					IPC and under section 13(2) r/w 13(i)(d) of Prevention of

					Corruption Act, 1988 on 14.10.2015 against S/Shri
					<lb />
					M.S.Chalia, the then CCM/Catering/NR and Sandeep Silas,
					<lb />
					the then CCM/Catering/ NR and other private persons and
					<lb />
					others companies on the basis of a complaint arising out of
					<lb />
					preliminary inquiry in PE35A/2014-DLI conducted by Shri
					<lb />
					Raman Kumar Shukla, Inspector CBl, ACB, Delhi regarding
					<lb />
					alleged violation of terms and conditions of contract
					<lb />
					agreement executed between Railway and the licensee
					<lb />
					caterers namely (i) M/s R.K.Associates, New Delhi (ii) M/s
					<lb />
					Satyam Caterer Pvt. Ltd, New Delhi (iii) M/s Doon Caterers,
					<lb />
					New Delhi, (iv) M/s Ambuj Hotel and Real Estates, New
					<lb />
					Delhi, (v) M/s P.K.Associates Pvt. Ltd., (vi) M/s Sunshine Pvt.
					<lb />
					Ltd. (vii) M/s Brandavan Food Product, New Delhi &amp; (viii)
					<lb />
					M/s Food World for supply of Meals and Rail Neer, Packaged
					<lb />
					Drinking Water (PDW) in Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains
					<lb />
					during the year 2013-14.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(iv) Whereas, it is alleged that as per para 1.3.4 of the
					<lb />
					agreements executed between the Railways and the licensees
					<lb />
					and which were signed by the said Shri M.S.Chalia, it was
					<lb />
					mandatory for the licensee to sell/distribute or serve Rail Neer
					<lb />
					(PDW) to passengers on board in such quantities and at
					<lb />
					rates as may be prescribed by the Railways on the Premium
					<lb />
					Trains from time to time. In case of non
					<lb />
					availability/inadequate supply of Rail Neer by the
					<lb />
					Railways/IRCTC, the licensees shall be permitted to sell
					<lb />
					packaged drinking water of brands approved by Railway, for
					<lb />
					which prior approval of the Railway in writing was to be
					<lb />
					taken by the licensees
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					2.AND WHEREAS, it is alleged that the licensees
					<lb />
					continued to supply other cheap brand of packaged drinking
					<lb />
					water without taking written approval from the competent
					<lb />
					authority (as mandated under the contract condition) i.e.
					<lb />
					Chief Commercial Manager/Catering. Shri M.S.Chalia and
					<lb />
					Shri Sandeep Silas who were working as Chief Commercial
					<lb />
					Manager (Catering) were in the knowledge of this violation of
					<lb />
					contract conditions but did not take any appropriate action to
					<lb />
					penalize the licensees. This inaction has resulted in undue
					<lb />
					gains to the licensees and caused financial loss to the
					<lb />
					IRCTC/Indian Railways.
					<lb />
				</item>

				<item>
					3.AND WHEREAS, the President, being the authority
					<lb />
					competent to remove the said Shri M.S.Chalia and Shri
					<lb />
					Sandeep Silas from service, after examining the statements of
					<lb />
					witnesses and documents related to the case with regard to
					<lb />
					the above allegations observed that conduct of the officers
					<lb />
					prima facie appear to be malafide and thus being satisfied
					<lb />
					that a prima facie case is made out against Shri M.S.Chalia
					<lb />
					and Shri Sandeep Silas for according sanction for prosecution
					<lb />
					of Shri M.S.Chalia and Shri Sandeep Silas for offences
					<lb />
					punishable under section 120-B r/w section 420 IPC and
					<lb />
					under section 13(2) r/w 13(i) (d) of Prevention of Corruption
					<lb />
					Act, 1988 and as such offences in respect of acts aforesaid
					<lb />
					and for taking cognizance of the such offences by a court of
					<lb />
					competent jurisdiction.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					4.NOW THEREFORE, the President hereby accord
					<lb />
					sanction under section 19 of Prevention of Corruption Act,
					<lb />
					1988 for the prosecution of the said Shri M.S.Chalia and Shri
					<lb />
					Sandeep Silas for the offences and any other offences in
					<lb />
					respect of the aforesaid acts and for taking cognizance of the
					<lb />
					said offences by a court of competent jurisdiction.‖
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				11. Immediately upon learning about the grant of sanction, the
				<lb />
				petitioners made a representation dated 23.03.2017 to the Cabinet
				<lb />
				Secretary, Government of India with a request to order the CBI not to
				<lb />
				proceed with the filing of the sanction order before the learned Trial
				<lb />
				Court, until the matter was duly examined by the DoPT as per the
				<lb />
				procedure prescribed in its office memorandums (OMs). The
				<lb />
				petitioners also moved an application before the learned Trial Court
	
				<lb />
				on 31.03.2017, contending that the sanction order dated 14.03.2017
				<lb />
				had been granted without complying with the DoPT&apos;s OM dated
				<lb />
				05.02.2016, which was stated to categorically mandate a reference to
				<lb />
				the DoPT in all cases where there is a disagreement between the
				<lb />
				Sanctioning Authority and CVC.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				12. It also transpires that the CVC, upon being informed that the
				<lb />
				Sanctioning Authority had proceeded to grant sanction for the
				<lb />
				petitioners&apos; prosecution despite its advice to the contrary, sent a letter
				<lb />
				dated 20.04.2017 to the Railway Board seeking a clarification as to
				<lb />
				whether the procedure prescribed in the DoPT&apos;s OMs dated
				<lb />
				15/17.10.1986, 06.11.2006 and 20.12.2006 had been followed before
				<lb />
				issuing the impugned sanction order. Armed with a copy of the
				<lb />
				aforesaid letter dated 20.04.2017, the petitioners moved another
				<lb />
				application on 01.05.2017 before the learned Trial Court seeking a
				<lb />
				direction to the Sanctioning Authority to comply with the OMs
				<lb />
				dated 15/17.10.1986, 06.11.2006 and 20.12.2006, and refer the
				<lb />
				matter regarding the petitioners&apos; prosecution to the DoPT for a final
				<lb />
				decision.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				13. The petitioners&apos; applications dated 31.03.2017 and 01.05.2017
				<lb />
				were rejected by a common order dated 08.05.2017, which has been
				<lb />
				challenged in Crl.M.C. No.5095/2017 and Crl.M.C. No.5094/2017.
				<lb />
				Thereafter, the learned Trial Court passed the order dated 01.07.2017
				<lb />
				taking cognizance against the petitioners on the basis of the charge-
				<lb />
				sheet filed by the CBI and the sanction order issued by the
				<lb />
				Sanctioning Authority, which has also been impugned before this
				<lb />
				Court by way of Crl.M.C. No.3137/2017 and Crl.M.C.
				<lb />
		
				No.3141/2017.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				14. Before referring to the submissions made by the learned counsel
				<lb />
				for the parties, it may also be appropriate to note that during the
				<lb />
				pendency of the present writ petitions, the petitioners had preferred
				<lb />
				applications before the Sanctioning Authority seeking review of the
				<lb />
				decision to grant sanction for their prosecution. The matter was
				<lb />
				thereafter referred to the DoPT, which is stated to have now informed
				<lb />
				the Sanctioning Authority that in the present case, there was no
				<lb />
				requirement for the matter to be referred to it. It has also come on
				<lb />
				record that vide its decision dated 20.12.2018, the Sanctioning
				<lb />
				Authority has rejected the petitioners&apos; aforesaid applications seeking
				<lb />
				review of the impugned sanction order, by placing reliance on the
				<lb />
				decision in State of Himachal Pradesh v. Nishant Sareen [2010 14
				<lb />
				SCC 527], wherein the Supreme Court has held that a competent
				<lb />
				authority under Section 19(1) of the PC Act can review its decision
				<lb />
				to grant or refrain from granting sanction only when fresh material is
				<lb />
				placed before it and a change of opinion on the basis of the same
				<lb />
				material is impermissible.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				15. At the outset, Mr. Arvind Nigam, learned Senior Counsel for
				<lb />
				Shri Sandeep Silas submits that the impugned sanction order having
				<lb />
				been issued in contravention of the CVC&quot;s repeated and binding
				<lb />
				advice to not grant sanction for the petitioners&quot; prosecution, is void
				<lb />
				ab initio. In support of his contention that the CVC&quot;s advice was
				<lb />
				binding on the Sanctioning Authority, he places reliance on the
				<lb />
				decisions of the Supreme Court in Vineet Narain v. Union of India
				<lb />
				[(1998) 1 SCC 226] and Alok Kumar Verma v. Union of India and
				<lb />
				Anr. [2019 SCC OnLine SC 23] and contends that the CVC is a
				<lb />
				statutory body which has been specifically constituted to check
				<lb />
				corruption in public offices. For this purpose, under Sections 8(1)(a),
				<lb />
				(b), (f) and (h) of the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003
				<lb />
				(hereinafter referred to as the &quot;CVC Act&quot;) and Section 4 of the Delhi
				<lb />
				Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (hereinafter referred to as
				<lb />
				&quot;DSPE Act&quot;), the CVC has been vested with wide powers of
				<lb />
				superintendence inter alia over the CBI and the vigilance
				<lb />
				administration of various ministries of the Central Government.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				16. By drawing my attention to the decision of the Supreme Court
				<lb />
				in State of Bihar &amp; Anr. v. JAC Saldhana and Ors. [(1980) 1 SCC
				<lb />
				550], Mr. Nigam contends that the CVC&quot;s aforesaid powers of
				<lb />
				&quot;superintendence&quot; are of wide amplitude and ensconce the power to
				<lb />
				exercise effective control over the actions, performance and
				<lb />
				discharge of duties by the Sanctioning Authority. He submits that the
				<lb />
				only limitation on the said power of the CVC is laid down in the
				<lb />
				provisos to Sections 8(1)(b) and 8(1)(h) of the CVC Act itself,
				<lb />
				neither of which prohibit the CVC from issuing directions to the
				<lb />
				competent authority under Section 19(1) of the PC Act to grant or
				<lb />
				refrain from granting sanction for the prosecution of public officers.
				<lb />
				Thus, Mr. Nigam&quot;s submission is that given the pivotal role played
				<lb />
				by a statutory body like the CVC in ensuring transparency and good
				<lb />
				governance in the Indian democracy, its recommendations cannot
				<lb />
				merely be treated as advisory, but constitute a binding mandate on
				<lb />
				the Sanctioning Authority. In fact, if the CVC&quot;s repeated advice is
				<lb />
				permitted to be ignored, it will frustrate the very object of the
				<lb />
				creation of the CVC and the enactment of the CVC Act, resulting in
				<lb />
				the frivolous prosecution of public servants for bona fide decisions
				<lb />
				taken by them while discharging their official duties.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				17. In support of his contention that the advice of the CVC was
				<lb />
				binding on the CBI, Mr.Nigam also relies on the DoPT&apos;s OMs dated
				<lb />
				15/17.10.1986, 06.11.2006 and 20.12.2006 and submits that the
				<lb />
				concerned ministry is required to issue sanction orders for
				<lb />
				prosecution only in accordance with the advice of the CVC. He
				<lb />
				submits that the aforesaid OMs also clarify that if the concerned
				<lb />
				ministry/department proposes not to accept the binding advice of the
				<lb />
				CVC, the case has to be referred to the DoPT for a final decision. He
				<lb />
				states that in the present case, the CVC not only initially advised
				<lb />
				against grant of sanction, but even after reconsideration had
				<lb />
				reiterated its earlier advice that no case was made out either for grant
				<lb />
				of sanction or for RDA against the petitioners. In these
				<lb />
				circumstances, there was absolutely no reason for the Sanctioning
				<lb />
				Authority to accord sanction for the petitioners&apos; prosecution, and that
				<lb />
				too without referring the matter to the DoPT in terms of its OMs
				<lb />
				dated 15/17.10.1986, 06.11.2006 and 20.12.2006. He, thus, contends
				<lb />
				that the sanction order having been passed without following the
				<lb />
				procedure prescribed in the DoPT&apos;s OMs, it is illegal and liable to be
				<lb />
				quashed.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				18. Mr.Nigam further submits that the sanction order shows
				<lb />
				complete non-application of mind inasmuch as it is a cryptic order
				<lb />
				which does not even reflect as to whether the Sanctioning Authority
				<lb />
				was aware of the CVC&apos;s repeated advice as also the recommendation
				<lb />
				of the Railway Board, both of which had clearly opined that there
				<lb />
				was no case made out for grant of sanction in respect of the
				<lb />
				petitioners. He submits that if the Sanctioning Authority had been
				<lb />
				made aware of the CVC&apos;s advice, there was no reason as to why it
				<lb />
				would have straightaway granted sanction without even referring the
				<lb />
				matter to the DoPT. In support of his aforesaid contention, Mr.Nigam
				<lb />
				also relies on the opinion dated 02.07.2018 of the Chairman, Railway
				<lb />
				Board wherein it was categorically observed that crucial materials,
				<lb />
				namely the OM dated 06.11.2006 and other relevant materials, were
				<lb />
				not brought to the notice of the Sanctioning Authority and there was
				<lb />
				procedural deviation while passing the impugned sanction order, on
				<lb />
				account of which the Chairman had recommended that the
				<lb />
				permission of the Court be sought for withdrawing the sanction so
				<lb />
				granted. He further submits that despite the specific recommendation
				<lb />
				of the Chairman, Railway Board to withdraw the sanction so granted,
				<lb />
				the Sanctioning Authority has rejected the petitioners&apos; application
				<lb />
				seeking recall of sanction only on the premise that any
				<lb />
				reconsideration of the said order at this stage would be contrary to
				<lb />
				the decision of the Supreme Court in Nishant Sareen (supra),
				<lb />
				without appreciating the fact all the relevant documents had not been
				<lb />
				placed before the Sanctioning Authority.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				19. Lastly, Mr.Nigam submits that the present case is a classic
				<lb />
				example of situations where honest officers are being compelled to
				<lb />
				face criminal prosecution even though there is not even an iota of
				<lb />
				doubt that there is absolutely no criminality involved in the alleged
				<lb />
				action of the petitioners and the same could at best be treated as non-
				<lb />
				compliance of some of the terms and conditions of the license
				<lb />
				agreement by the licensees, which admittedly had not resulted in any
				<lb />
				kind of loss to the railways or any kind of gain to the petitioners. He
				<lb />
				submits that even though there was no loss of any kind to Indian
				<lb />
				Railways or any gain to the petitioners, the CBI has, without any
				<lb />
				basis, presumed that there has been loss to the Railways on the
				<lb />
				premise that the cost of the PDW actually supplied has to be treated
				<lb />
				as nil, merely because it was not Rail Neer. He, thus, contends that
				<lb />
				the wholly unwarranted prosecution of the petitioners on the basis of
				<lb />
				untenable presumptions by the CBI has resulted in a complete failure
				<lb />
				of justice and, therefore, submits that this Court ought to exercise its
				<lb />
				inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC to quash the
				<lb />
				sanction order and the other consequential orders.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				20. Mr.Vikas Pahwa, learned Senior Counsel for Shri M.S. Chalia
				<lb />
				while reiterating the submissions made by Mr.Nigam, submits that
				<lb />
				the impugned sanction order completely ignores the advice not only
				<lb />
				of the CVC but also of the Railway Board, which clearly states that
				<lb />
				no case was made out for grant of sanction for the prosecution of the
				<lb />
				petitioners. He submits that while the sanction order does not show
				<lb />
				any application of mind, the advice of the CVC given on 02.05.2016
				<lb />
				leaves no manner of doubt that the CVC had perused not only the
				<lb />
				investigation report and comments of the CBI, but also those of the
				<lb />
				administrative department and had thereafter come to a considered
				<lb />
				conclusion that no case was made out for grant of sanction. He
				<lb />
				contends that even the Railway Board on 13.12.2016, after dealing
				<lb />
				with the allegations against the petitioners in detail, had given a
				<lb />
				comprehensive opinion recommending non-grant of sanction, which
				<lb />
				advice was reinforced by its Chairman on 02.07.2018, when he
				<lb />
				reiterated that the Ministry of Railway does not have a case to defend
				<lb />
				in the matter of sanction for prosecution and the sanction order
				<lb />
				should be withdrawn.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				21. The next submission of Mr.Pahwa is that the Sanctioning
				<lb />
				Authority, while according sanction, did not even examine whether
				<lb />
				the essential ingredients of the offences alleged against the
				<lb />
				petitioners were made out. He contends that there was no allegation
				<lb />
				regarding any illegal gratification, personal benefit, abuse of official
				<lb />
				position or any dishonest intention on the part of the petitioners,
				<lb />
				which is mandatory for prosecution under Section 13(1)(d) of the PC
				<lb />
				Act. He states that the Sanctioning Authority has also failed to
				<lb />
				appreciate that the criminal case against the petitioners had been
				<lb />
				registered not on the basis of any complaint but on the basis of
				<lb />
				source information after the CBI had conducted inspections in
				<lb />
				various trains.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				22. Mr. Pahwa further draws my attention to the annual report of
				<lb />
				the IRCTC as also the opinion dated 02.07.2018 of the Chairman,
				<lb />
				Railway Board in support of his contention that even as per the
				<lb />
				Indian Railways, there has neither been any wrongful loss to them
				<lb />
				nor any wrongful gain to anyone on account of the licensee caterers
				<lb />
				providing PDW of brands other than Rail Neer, as IRCTC has been
				<lb />
				able to satisfy only 25-30% of the total demand of PDW in trains and
				<lb />
				mandatory stations. He, thus, contends that in such circumstances the
				<lb />
				supply of PDW other than Rail Neer by the licensees could not be
				<lb />
				treated as such an act that warrants criminal action against the
				<lb />
				petitioners. He further submits that not only the Sanctioning
				<lb />
				Authority, but even the learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate
				<lb />
				that at best it was a case of non-compliance of the terms and
				<lb />
				conditions of the license by the caterers in question, who are alleged
				<lb />
				to have been supplying PDW other than Rail Neer without taking
				<lb />
				prior approval, for which penalties were levied against them during
				<lb />
				the period 2013-14. He, therefore, contends that even this
				<lb />
				presumption that the petitioners had not taken any action against the
				<lb />
				erring contractors is contrary to the record, which factor has been
				<lb />
				simply overlooked by the Sanctioning Authority as also by the
				<lb />
				learned Trial Court.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				23. On the other hand, Mr. Nikhil Goel, learned Special Public
				<lb />
				Prosecutor for the CBI while opposing the petitions, submits that the
				<lb />
				petitions themselves are not maintainable, as the legality of the
				<lb />
				impugned sanction order is essentially a matter of trial and cannot be
				<lb />
				decided by this Court in exercise of its inherent powers under Section
				<lb />
				482 of the CrPC at this stage. While relying on the decisions of the
				<lb />
				Supreme Court in Prakash Singh Badal v. State of Punjab [(2007) 1
				<lb />
				SCC 1] and Director, CBI v. Ashok Kumar Aswal [(2015) 16 SCC
				<lb />
				163], he states that the validity of a sanction order has to be tested on
				<lb />
				the touchstone of prejudice to the accused, which is essentially a
				<lb />
				question of fact that should be left to be determined in the course of
				<lb />
				trial. He submits that at this pre-mature stage, this Court only has the
				<lb />
				power to see whether the Sanctioning Authority was competent to
				<lb />
				pass the sanction order and if it had applied its mind to all the
				<lb />
				relevant material before passing the same. Therefore, barring the
				<lb />
				question of the competence of the Sanctioning Authority and whether
				<lb />
				it had applied its mind to all the relevant material while passing the
				<lb />
				sanction order, everything else is a matter of trial and cannot be
				<lb />
				probed into by this Court at this stage.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				24. Taking his aforesaid plea further, Mr. Goel submits that Section
				<lb />
				19 of the PC Act is a complete code in itself for the trial of public
				<lb />
				servants for offences alleged to have been committed under the said
				<lb />
				Act. While relying upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Vivek
				<lb />
				Batra v. Union of India [(2017) 1 SCC 69], he states that the only
				<lb />
				requirement under Section 19(1) of the PC Act, is a sanction order
				<lb />
				passed by a competent authority and any inter departmental disputes
				<lb />
				prior to the passing of the sanction order are of no consequence to the
				<lb />
				validity of the same. In the facts of the present case, the petitioners
				<lb />
				being in the employment of the Ministry of Railways, the sanction
				<lb />
				for their prosecution was duly issued by the Minister of Railways on
				<lb />
				behalf of the President of India, in terms of Section 19(1)(a) of the
				<lb />
				PC Act and, therefore, there was no irregularity whatsoever in the
				<lb />
				passing of the impugned sanction order. He contends that merely
				<lb />
				because the CVC was of a different opinion, it did not prevent the
				<lb />
				competent authority from passing an order granting sanction for
				<lb />
				prosecution, on the basis of its subjective satisfaction as to the
				<lb />
				necessity of passing such an order.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				25. Mr. Goel further places reliance on the decision of the Supreme
				<lb />
				Court in State of Maharashtra v. Mahesh G. Jain [(2013) 4 SCC
				<lb />
				81] to contend that, while examining whether the sanction order was
				<lb />
				passed after due application of mind, this Court cannot go into the
				<lb />
				adequacy of the material placed before the Sanctioning Authority, as
				<lb />
				it does not sit in appeal over the sanction order. On the other hand, in
				<lb />
				determining the aforesaid issue, this Court can only consider the
				<lb />
				limited question as to whether the requisite material was placed
				<lb />
				before the Sanctioning Authority, which includes materials in favour
				<lb />
				of the accused persons, i.e., the petitioners. He submits that when the
				<lb />
				sanction order itself clearly states that it was passed after considering
				<lb />
				all the relevant materials, there is no reason to doubt that the CVC&apos;s
				<lb />
				opinions dated 02.05.2016 and 02.11.2016 in favour of the
				<lb />
				petitioners, were placed before the Sanctioning Authority alongwith
				<lb />
				the CBI&apos;s detailed report dated 16.12.2015 and a copy of the charge-
				<lb />
				sheet.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				26. In support of his aforesaid contention that all the relevant
				<lb />
				materials were placed before the Sanctioning Authority, Mr. Goel
				<lb />
				also draws my attention to the reply filed by the Ministry of
				<lb />
				Railways, wherein it has been clearly stated that the sanction for the
				<lb />
				petitioners&apos; prosecution under the PC Act, was duly granted upon
				<lb />
				proper application of mind and after considering all the relevant
				<lb />
				materials on record. He further places reliance on the affidavit filed
				<lb />
				by the Ministry of Railways pursuant to the directions of this Court,
				<lb />
				categorically stating that the impugned sanction order could not be
				<lb />
				reviewed as no fresh facts were brought out so as to warrant a
				<lb />
				withdrawal of the sanction. Thus, Mr. Goel&apos;s contention is that there
				<lb />
				is absolutely no merit in the petitioners&apos; plea that the sanction order
				<lb />
				suffers from non-application of mind on account of the relevant
				<lb />
				documents not having been placed before the Sanctioning Authority.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				27. Without prejudice to his aforesaid contention that this Court
				<lb />
				cannot go into the merits of the sanction order at this stage of the
				<lb />
				proceedings, Mr. Goel submits that the material on record makes it
				<lb />
				evident that there is a prima facie case against the petitioners. He
				<lb />
				states that as per the terms of the license agreement between the
				<lb />
				licensee caterers and the Indian Railways, it was incumbent upon the
				<lb />
				former to supply Rail Neer to the passengers of Rajdhani and
				<lb />
				Shatabdi trains and they were allowed to supply other approved
				<lb />
				brands of PDW only in the event that Rail Neer was unavailable,
				<lb />
				after obtaining the approval of the CCM (Catering). However, when
				<lb />
				the CBI conducted its surprise check on 22.08.2014, various licensee
				<lb />
				caterers were found to be supplying other brands of PDW in
				<lb />
				Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains, despite the ample availability of Rail
				<lb />
				Neer, thereby causing huge losses to the India Railways. He further
				<lb />
				submits that the loss to the Indian Railways aside, the petitioners
				<lb />
				were charged with cheating and criminal misconduct for releasing
				<lb />
				payments to the defaulting licensee caterers, inspite of the Railway
				<lb />
				Board&apos;s specific instructions to take strict action against them and
				<lb />
				withhold payment. In fact, contrary to the instructions of the Railway
				<lb />
				Board, the petitioners did not take any action against the defaulting
				<lb />
				licensee caterers for breaching the terms of their license agreements,
				<lb />
				which shows the petitioners&apos; complicity in the caterers&apos; criminal
				<lb />
				conduct.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				28. On the merits of the impugned sanction order, Mr. Goel further
				<lb />
				draws my attention to the charge-sheet filed by the CBI and contends
				<lb />
				that in April 2013, a decision had been taken to initiate strict action
				<lb />
				against the defaulting licensee caterers. A draft letter to this effect
				<lb />
				was prepared and placed before Shri M.S. Chalia, who in turn
				<lb />
				removed the phrase &quot;punitive action will be taken against the
				<lb />
				defaulting licensees&quot; from the same, thereby clearly showing his
				<lb />
				mala fide intention. Furthermore, there was incriminating evidence of
				<lb />
				quid pro quo with respect to Shri M.S. Chalia, from whose residence
				<lb />
				a letter from one of the defaulting licensee caterers was recovered,
				<lb />
				which essentially offered jobs to 9 candidates from Shri M.S.
				<lb />
				Chalia&apos;s family owned trust. Thus, Mr. Goel&apos;s contention is that
				<lb />
				there was ample material on record warranting the issuance of a
				<lb />
				sanction order in respect of the petitioners.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				29. In response to the petitioners&apos; contention that in the light of the
				<lb />
				differences in the opinions of the Sanctioning Authority and CVC, it
				<lb />
				was incumbent upon the Sanctioning Authority to refer the matter to
				<lb />
				the DoPT for a final decision, Mr. Goel contends that OMs are issued
				<lb />
				to navigate the internal processes of the executive department and
				<lb />
				cannot be used to govern the exercise of power granted by a statute.
				<lb />
				Be that as it may, he states that the DoPT&apos;s OMs dated
				<lb />
				15/17.10.1986, 06.11.2006 and 20.12.2006 relied upon by the
				<lb />
				petitioners, do not mandate a reference to the DoPT in every case
				<lb />
				where there is a disagreement between the competent authority and
				<lb />
				the CVC with respect to the grant of sanction for prosecution. By
				<lb />
				drawing my attention to clause 2.2(iii) of the OM dated
				<lb />
				15/17.10.1986, Clause 2(iv) of the OM dated 06.11.2006 as also to
				<lb />
				the relevant paragraph in the OM dated 20.12.2006, he contends that
				<lb />
				a reference to the DoPT is only necessary in cases where the CVC
				<lb />
				has advised grant of sanction and the competent authority is of a
				<lb />
				different opinion. In converse situations like the present case where
				<lb />
				the CVC is of the opinion that no sanction ought to be granted and
				<lb />
				the competent authority is convinced of the necessity of passing a
				<lb />
				sanction order, a reference to the DoPT is not mandatory. Mr. Goel&apos;s
				<lb />
				contention, thus, is that the petitioners&apos; reliance on the DoPT&apos;s OMs
				<lb />
				dated 15/17.10.1986, 06.11.2006 and 20.12.2006 is wholly
				<lb />
				misconceived, as they neither govern the exercise of power under
				<lb />
				Section 19(1) of the PC Act, nor do they contemplate a reference to
				<lb />
				the DoPT in cases like the present where the competent authority
				<lb />
				wants to accord sanction for prosecution as against the CVC&apos;s advice
				<lb />
				for non-grant of sanction.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				30. Finally, Mr. Goel submits that the petitioner&apos;s reliance on
				<lb />
				Section 8 of the CVC Act is entirely misplaced, as it neither
				<lb />
				expressly nor impliedly controls the power of a competent authority
				<lb />
				to grant sanction under Section 19(1) of the PC Act. He further states
				<lb />
				that the Sanctioning Authority, which has an independent existence
				<lb />
				under Section 19 of the PC Act, is not subordinate to the CVC and,
				<lb />
				therefore, the CVC&apos;s opinion is at best advisory and cannot constitute
				<lb />
				a binding directive on the Sanctioning Authority. By placing reliance
				<lb />
				on the decision of the Supreme Court in Centre for PIL &amp; Anr. v.
				<lb />
				Union of India &amp; Anr. [(2011) 4 SCC 1], he contends that the sole
				<lb />
				purpose behind setting up the CVC was to improve the vigilance
				<lb />
				administration of the country and it does not in any way control the
				<lb />
				exercise of power of the competent authority under section 19(1) of
				<lb />
				the PC Act.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				31. Mr.V.S.R. Krishna, learned counsel for the Ministry of
				<lb />
				Railways briefly submits that the impugned sanction order was
				<lb />
				issued by the Sanctioning Authority only after considering the
				<lb />
				conflicting opinions of the CBI and the CVC. He states that it is
				<lb />
				precisely for this reason that the Sanctioning Authority was
				<lb />
				compelled to reject the petitioners&apos; application seeking review of the
				<lb />
				sanction order, as the petitioners had not been able to bring on record
				<lb />
				any fresh material so as to make out a case for recalling or reviewing
				<lb />
				the decision to grant sanction for their prosecution. He, therefore,
				<lb />
				contends that there is absolutely no merit in the petitioners&apos; plea that
				<lb />
				the impugned sanction order suffers from complete non-application
				<lb />
				of mind on account of the relevant materials not having been
				<lb />
				considered by the Sanctioning Authority.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				32. It may also be noted that although Mr. Ravinder Agarwal had
				<lb />
				entered appearance on behalf of the CVC/Respondent No. 4, neither
				<lb />
				any counter affidavit has been filed nor have any submissions been
				<lb />
				made on behalf of the said respondent.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				33. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and
				<lb />
				with their assistance perused the record. On the basis of the rival
				<lb />
				submissions of the learned counsel for the parties, I find that the
				<lb />
				preliminary issue which arises for my consideration is whether this
				<lb />
				Court can interfere with the decision of a competent authority to
				<lb />
				grant sanction under Section 19 of the PC Act for the prosecution of
				<lb />
				a public servant at this stage, when the trial is yet to commence. It is
				<lb />
				only if the answer to the aforesaid issue is in the affirmative that the
				<lb />
				second issue would arise as to whether the sanction order suffers
				<lb />
				from any infirmity so as to warrant interference by this Court.
				<lb />
				Another connected issue which has been raised is whether in terms of
				<lb />
				the DoPT&apos;s OMs dated 15/17.10.1986, 06.11.2006 and 20.12.2006, it
				<lb />
				was mandatory for the Sanctioning Authority to refer the matter to
				<lb />
				the DoPT, before passing the sanction order.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				34. Before dealing with the rival contentions of the parties, it may
				<lb />
				be useful to refer to Section 19 of the PC Act, which is reproduced
				<lb />
				hereinbelow for the sake of ready reference:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					-19. Previous sanction necessary for prosecution.-
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(1) No court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable
					<lb />
					under sections 7, 10, 11, 13 and 15 alleged to have been
					<lb />
					committed by a public servant, except with the previous
					<lb />
					sanction,-
					<lb />
					(a) in the case of a person who is employed in connection with
					<lb />
					the affairs of the Union and is not removable from his office
					<lb />
					save by or with the sanction of the Central Government, of that
					<lb />
					Government;
					<lb />
					(b) in the case of a person who is employed in connection with
					<lb />
					the affairs of a State and is not removable from his office save
					<lb />
					by or with the sanction of the State Government, of that
					<lb />
					Government;
					<lb />
					(c) in the case of any other person, of the authority competent
					<lb />
					to remove him from his office.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(2) Where for any reason whatsoever any doubt arises as to
					<lb />
					whether the previous sanction as required under sub-section
					<lb />
					(1) should be given by the Central Government or the State
					<lb />
					Government or any other authority, such sanction shall be
					<lb />
					given by that Government or authority which would have been
					<lb />
					competent to remove the public servant from his office at the
					<lb />
					time when the offence was alleged to have been committed.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of
					<lb />
					Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),-
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(a) no finding, sentence or order passed by a special Judge
					<lb />
					shall be reversed or altered by a court in appeal, confirmation
					<lb />
					or revision on the ground of the absence of, or any error,
					<lb />
					omission or irregularity in, the sanction required under sub-
					<lb />
					section (1), unless in the opinion of that court, a failure of
					<lb />
					justice has in fact been occasioned thereby;
					<lb />
					(b) no court shall stay the proceedings under this Act on the
					<lb />
					ground of any error, omission or irregularity in the sanction
					<lb />
					granted by the authority, unless it is satisfied that such error,
					<lb />
					omission or irregularity has resulted in a failure of justice;
					<lb />
					(c) no court shall stay the proceedings under this Act on any
					<lb />
					other ground and no court shall exercise the powers of revision
					<lb />
					in relation to any interlocutory order passed in any inquiry,
					<lb />
					trial, appeal or other proceedings.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(4) In determining under sub-section (3) whether the absence
					<lb />
					of, or any error, omission or irregularity in, such sanction has
					<lb />
					occasioned or resulted in a failure of justice the court shall
					<lb />
					have regard to the fact whether the objection could and should
					<lb />
					have been raised at any earlier stage in the proceedings.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					Explanation.-For the purposes of this section,-
					<lb />
					(a) error includes competency of the authority to grant
					<lb />
					sanction;
					<lb />
					(b) a sanction required for prosecution includes reference to
					<lb />

					<lb />
					or any requirement of a similar nature.‖
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				35. As regards the preliminary issue, a bare reading of Section
				<lb />
				19(1) shows that a valid sanction order is a sine qua non for the trial
				<lb />
				of a public servant under the provisions of the PC Act. It is well
				<lb />
				settled that the very purpose of the protection granted under Section
				<lb />
				19(1) is to prevent honest public officers from frivolous prosecution
				<lb />
				and, therefore, the issue regarding the validity of the sanction order
				<lb />
				must be resolved at the earliest so as to forward one of the foremost
				<lb />
				objectives of the PC Act. In fact, since the issue regarding the
				<lb />
				validity of the sanction order goes to the very root of the trial court&apos;s
				<lb />
				jurisdiction to take cognizance against a public officer, the aforesaid
				<lb />
				issue, if raised, can be decided at the pre-trial stage also. There is
				<lb />
				absolutely nothing in Section 19 of the PC Act to suggest that such
				<lb />
				an issue, if raised at a pre-trial stage, cannot be examined by this
				<lb />
				Court by exercising its inherent powers under Section 482 of the
				<lb />
				CrPC. On the other hand, a perusal of Section 19 shows in cases
				<lb />
				where the Court comes to a conclusion that there is a manifest failure
				<lb />
				of justice, it can examine the validity of the sanction order and if
				<lb />
				need be, interfere with the same. Reliance may be placed upon the
				<lb />
				decision in Nanjappa v. State of Karnataka [(2015) 14 SCC 186],
				<lb />
				wherein the Supreme Court while referring to its earlier decision in
				<lb />
				State of Karnataka v. C. Nagarajaswamy [(2005) 8 SCC 370], held
				<lb />
				as follows:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					-22. The legal position regarding the importance of sanction
					<lb />
					under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act is thus
					<lb />
					much too clear to admit equivocation. The statute forbids
					<lb />
					taking of cognizance by the court against a public servant
					<lb />
					except with the previous sanction of an authority competent to
					<lb />
					grant such sanction in terms of clauses (a), (b) and (c) to
					<lb />
					Section 19(1). The question regarding validity of such
					<lb />
					sanction can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. The
					<lb />
					competence of the court trying the accused so much depends
					<lb />
					upon the existence of a valid sanction. In case the sanction is
					<lb />
					found to be invalid the court can discharge the accused
					<lb />
					relegating the parties to a stage where the competent authority
					<lb />
					may grant a fresh sanction for the prosecution in accordance
					<lb />
					with law. If the trial court proceeds, despite the invalidity
					<lb />
					attached to the sanction order, the same shall be deemed to be
					<lb />
					non est in the eyes of law and shall not forbid a second trial for
					<lb />
					the same offences, upon grant of a valid sanction for such
					<lb />
					prosecution.‖

				36. Reference may also be made to the decision in Ashok Kumar
				<lb />
				Aggarwal v. CBI &amp; Ors. [(2016) SCC OnLine Del 214], wherein
				<lb />
				this Court while dealing with the issue of the validity of a sanction
				<lb />
				order at the stage, rejected the contention of the official
				<lb />
				respondents therein that the aforesaid issue can only be determined
				<lb />
				after evidence is adduced at trial. The relevant paragraphs 50, 52 and
				<lb />
				54 of the decision in Ashok Kumar Aggarwal (supra) read as under:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					-50. From a conspectus of the decisions of the Supreme Court
					<lb />
					as cited above the legal position that emerges is that the
					<lb />
					question of validity of a sanction must be decided as soon as it
					<lb />
					is raised and cannot be postponed to a later stage of trial, as an
					<lb />
					invalid sanction goes to the very root of the jurisdiction of the
					<lb />
					court that has taken cognizance. Considering that the
					<lb />
					cognizance taken by the Special Judge, CBI would be rendered
					<lb />
					non-est in light of section 19(1) of POCA, the dispute on
					<lb />
					validity must be adjudicated at the earliest...
					<lb />
					* * *
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					52. It is trite to state that a sanction is a precursory sacrosanct
					<lb />
					step to initiate criminal proceedings against public officer, and
					<lb />
					the lack of a valid sanction precludes the court from taking
					<lb />
					cognizance of the an offence under section 19(1) POCA.
					<lb />
					Section 19(1) POCA affords protection to those public
					<lb />
					servants, who could get trapped in vexatious proceedings while
					<lb />
					discharge of their official functions. If this protection is not
					<lb />
					afforded to a public servant then the cognizance taken under
					<lb />
					section 19(1) POCA also stands vitiated.
					<lb />
					* * *
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					54. In view of the above discussion…[t]he submission made on
					<lb />
					behalf of the official respondents to the effect that this Court
					<lb />
					ought not to determine disputed questions of fact is unfounded,
					<lb />
					baseless and contrary to the record and is, therefore,
					<lb />
					categorically negated and traversed.‖
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				37. Thus, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in
				<lb />
				Nanjappa (supra) as also of this Court in Ashok Kumar Aggarwal
				<lb />
				(supra), I find that there is absolutely no merit in the preliminary
				<lb />
				objection raised by the learned counsel for the CBI that the present
				<lb />
				petitions are not maintainable at this stage. This Court can decide the
				<lb />
				issue of the validity of a sanction order at any stage of the
				<lb />
				proceedings, including the pre-trial stage when cognizance has
				<lb />
				already been taken and the trial proceedings are yet to be conducted,
				<lb />
				as is the case in the present petitions. However, the only precursor to
				<lb />
				any interference by the Court should be the occurrence of a manifest
				<lb />
				failure of justice, in the absence of which such judicial intervention
				<lb />
				would be in the teeth of Section 19(1) of the PC Act. In determining
				<lb />
				whether there has been a failure of justice in the present case, even
				<lb />
				though I do not propose to examine the merits of the sanction order, I
				<lb />
				cannot lose sight of the fact that the Railway Board and CVC have
				<lb />
				concurrently opined that the petitioners&apos; cases are not even fit for
				<lb />
				RDA as also the fact that nothing has been pointed out on record to
				<lb />
				show any kind of loss to the Indian Railways. On the other hand, it is
				<lb />
				an admitted position that the entire stock of Rail Neer produced by
				<lb />
				IRCTC&apos;s Nangloi plant, was fully utilized as it was supplied not only
				<lb />
				in various trains but also to other mandatory stations. In these
				<lb />
				circumstances, if the petitioners are made to face trial under the PC
				<lb />
				Act, it will indeed lead to a failure of justice and the sanction order, if
				<lb />
				found to be defective on any count, will be liable to be set aside in
				<lb />
				terms of Section 19(3)(a) of the PC Act.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				38. Having answered the preliminary issue before this Court in the
				<lb />
				affirmative, I may now examine whether the petitioners have made
				<lb />
				out any ground for this Court to exercise its inherent powers and
				<lb />
				interfere with the order dated 14.03.2017 granting sanction for their
				<lb />
				prosecution. The learned counsel for the petitioners have raised two
				<lb />
				primary contentions to impugn the sanction order, the first being that
				<lb />
				it suffers from the vice of non-application of mind as it does not at all
				<lb />
				show that the Sanctioning Authority had considered the repeated
				<lb />
				advice given by the CVC as also the Railway Board to the effect that
				<lb />
				not even a case for RDA was made out against the petitioners. The
				<lb />
				second ground pressed by the learned counsel for the petitioners is
				<lb />
				that the sanction order having been passed without following the
				<lb />
				procedure prescribed in the DoPT&apos;s OMs dated 15/17.10.1986,
				<lb />
				06.11.2006 and 20.12.2006, it is void ab initio and consequently, the
				<lb />
				cognizance taken by the learned Trial Court against the petitioners is
				<lb />
				also without jurisdiction.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				39. As one of the main grounds on which the sanction order has
				<lb />
				been challenged is that it is contrary to the advice of the CVC, which
				<lb />
				as per the petitioners&apos; submissions was binding on the Sanctioning
				<lb />
				Authority, it would be appropriate to refer to the recent decision of
				<lb />
				the Supreme Court in Alok Kumar Verma (supra), wherein the
				<lb />
				history of the constitution of the CVC has been summarized:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					-18. The organization i.e. CBI has grown over the years in its
					<lb />
					role, power and importance and today has become the
					<lb />
					premier investigative and prosecution agency of the country.
					<lb />
					The high stature and the pre-eminent position that the
					<lb />
					institution has acquired is largely on account of a strong
					<lb />
					perception of the necessity of having such a premier agency.
					<lb />
					Such a perception finds reflection in the conscious attempts of
					<lb />
					the Government of the day to introduce reforms, from time to
					<lb />
					time, so as to enable the institution to reach greater heights in
					<lb />
					terms of integrity, independence and confidence. A close look
					<lb />
					at such attempts will now be in order.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					19. In Vineet Narain (supra) such developments have already
					<lb />
					been taken note of in detail. The recommendations of the
					<lb />
					Committee headed by Shri N.N. Vohra constituted by
					<lb />
					Government Order No. S/7937/SS(ISP)/93 dated 9 th July,
					<lb />
					1993 and those of the Independent Review Committee (IRC)
					<lb />
					constituted by Government Order No. 226/2/97-AVD-II dated
					<lb />
					8 th September, 1997 has had a major role to play in giving the
					<lb />
					CBI and the CVC their present shape and form and the pivotal
					<lb />
					role and position that these two bodies have come to occupy
					<lb />
					in the system of law enforcement in the country. Incidentally,
					<lb />
					the CVC had been in existence as an administrative body on
					<lb />
					being established by Resolution No. 24/7/64-AVD dated
					<lb />
					11 th February, 1964 issued by the Central Government until
					<lb />
					conferment of statutory status by the CVC Act, 2003 on the
					<lb />
					basis of recommendations of the IRC, summary of which with

					functioning of the CBI. While Government shall
					<lb />
					remain answerable for the CBI&apos;s functioning, to
					<lb />
					introduce visible objectivity in the mechanism to

					choice. The Committee shall draw up a panel of IPS
					<lb />
					officers on the basis of their seniority, integrity,

				</item>
				<item>
					7. The Director, CBI shall have a minimum tenure
					<lb />
					of two years, regardless of the date of his

					10. Selection/extension of tenure of officers up to
					<lb />
					the level of Joint Director (JD) shall be decided by
					<lb />
					a Board comprising the Central Vigilance
					<lb />
					Commissioner, Home Secretary and Secretary
					<lb />
					(Personnel) with the Director, CBI providing the
					<lb />
					necessary inputs. The extension of tenure or
					<lb />
					premature repatriation of officers up to the level of
					<lb />
					Joint Director shall be with final approval of this
					<lb />
					Board. Only cases pertaining to the appointment or

					decision.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					11. Proposals for improvement of infrastructure,

					methods of investigation, etc. should be decided
					<lb />
					urgently. In order to strengthen CBI&apos;s in-house
					<lb />
					expertise, professionals from the Revenue, Banking
					<lb />
					and Security sectors should be inducted into the
					<lb />
					CBI.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					12. The CBI Manual based on statutory provisions
					<lb />
					of the CrPC provides essential guidelines for the
					<lb />
					CBI&apos;s functioning. It is imperative that the CBI
					<lb />
					adheres scrupulously to the provisions in the
					<lb />
					Manual in relation to its investigative functions, like
					<lb />
					raids, seizure and arrests. Any deviation from the
					<lb />
					established procedure should be viewed seriously
					<lb />

					officials concerned.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					13. The Director, CBI shall be responsible for

				</item>
				<item>
					14. A document on CBI&apos;s functioning should be
					<lb />
					published within three months to provide the
					<lb />

					<lb />
					allowed where consultation is required with the
					<lb />
					Attorney General (AG) or any other law officer in
					<lb />
					the AG&apos;s office.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					16. The Director, CBI should conduct regular
					<lb />
					appraisal of personnel to prevent corruption and/or

					Establishment.-(1) The superintendence of the Delhi
					<lb />
					Special Police Establishment in so far as it relates to
					<lb />
					investigation of offences alleged to have been committed
					<lb />
					under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (49 of 1988),

					41. Thus, what emerges is that, in consonance with the directions of
					<lb />
					the Supreme Court in Vineet Narain (supra), the CVC Act was
					<lb />
					passed in 2003 to statutorily constitute the CVC as a special body
					<lb />
					with wide powers of surveillance to check corruption in public
					<lb />
					offices. Simultaneously, a corresponding amendment was also made
					<lb />
					in Section 4 of the DSPE Act, categorically vesting the powers of
					<lb />
					superintendence over the CBI in the CVC. It is, therefore, evident
					<lb />
					that the CVC has been specially constituted as an independent body
					<lb />
					to inquire or cause inquiries into offences allegedly committed under
					<lb />
					the PC Act by public officers. The provisions of Sections 8(1)(a), (b),
					<lb />
					(f) and (h) of the CVC Act and Section 4 of the DSPE Act, leave no
					<lb />
					manner of doubt that the CVC not only has the power of
					<lb />
					superintendence over the functioning of the CBI in so far as it relates
					<lb />
					to the investigation of offences alleged to have been committed under
					<lb />
					the PC Act, but also qua the vigilance administration of various
					<lb />
					ministries, corporations and local authorities controlled by the central
					<lb />
					government. There is absolutely no scope to interpret these
					<lb />
					provisions in such a narrow manner so as to exclude CVC&apos;s power of
					<lb />
					superintendence in cases like the present where senior public officers
					<lb />
					are sought to be tried for offences under the PC Act. As a
					<lb />
					consequence of the special status and pivotal role granted to it for
					<lb />
					checking corruption in public offices, the CVC&apos;s opinions have to be
					<lb />
					given due consideration and cannot merely be treated as inter-
					<lb />
					departmental consultations, as is sought to be contended by the
					<lb />
					learned counsel for the CBI.
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				42. In the light of my aforesaid conclusion, I may now examine the
				<lb />
				impugned sanction order. I find that the said order merely recites a
				<lb />
				gist of the allegations against the petitioners and read by itself, it
				<lb />
				does not disclose whether the Sanctioning Authority had considered
				<lb />
				the advice tendered by the CVC on two separate occasions to not
				<lb />
				grant sanction for prosecution, which advice was also concurred by
				<lb />
				the Railway Board vide its letter dated 13.12.2016. While it is true
				<lb />
				that a sanction order should not be read pedantically, it should, so as
				<lb />
				to inspire confidence, at least demonstrate that the Sanctioning
				<lb />
				Authority had applied its mind to all the relevant material. In the
				<lb />
				present case, keeping in view the fact that there is no reference at all
				<lb />
				to the opinion of the CVC in the impugned sanction order, the
				<lb />
				subsequent recommendation of the Chairman, Railway Board to
				<lb />
				recall the sanction order, assumes importance and I deem it
				<lb />
				appropriate to refer to the same in in extenso:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					-13. Summing up it may be stated that:-
					<lb />
					i.Railway Administration was of the view that there is no
					<lb />
					evidence of any criminality and no adequate grounds to
					<lb />
					prosecute the officers (S.No.12 -page 33 to 71)
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					ii.CVC agreed with Railway Administration that no case
					<lb />
					is made out to sanction prosecution of the officers and the
					<lb />
					cases against the officers is not fit even for regular
					<lb />
					departmental action (S No.12 -page 48).
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					iii.A Committee comprising of Member(Staff), Member
					<lb />
					(Traffic) and Member (Mechanical) met on 08.04.16 to review
					<lb />
					the suspension of Shri Sandeep Silas. Based on the findings
					<lb />
					of Railway Board Vigilance, the Committee unanimously
					<lb />
					opined that there is no case for further extension of
					<lb />
					suspension beyond 11.04.16 and this was approved by the
					<lb />
					then Hon&apos;ble MR (S.No.15).
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					iv. After receipt of CVC&apos;s advice that no case is made out
					<lb />
					to sanction prosecution, the competent authority sought for
					<lb />
					CBI written opinion on the advice tendered by CVC. The
					<lb />
					administration did not point out the Procedural deviation in
					<lb />
					such action of the sanctioning authority. On the other hand
					<lb />
					CBI requested for comments of Railway Administration and
					<lb />
					thereafter reiterated their findings.
					<lb />
					The sanctioning
					<lb />
					authority took his decision after this procedural deviation
					<lb />
					(Page 50 of S.No.12).
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					v. Sanctioning authority after consideration of the entire
					<lb />
					material place before it, entertains any doubt on any point the
					<lb />
					competent authority may specify the doubt with sufficient
					<lb />
					particulars and may request the authority who h as sought
					<lb />
					sanction to clear the doubt. But that would be only to clear
					<lb />
					the doubt in order that the authority may apply its mind
					<lb />
					proper, and not for the purpose of coming to a conclusion as
					<lb />
					to whether such a sanction is to be granted or not. In the
					<lb />
					instant case without specifying any particular fact or doubt
					<lb />
					for clarification, the opinion of CBI on the advice tendered
					<lb />
					by CVC sought and thereafter the competent authority
					<lb />
					decided on the issue.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					vi.The sanctioning authority was not in the knowledge
					<lb />
					of the fact that his disagreement with CVC had to be sent to
					<lb />
					DOP&amp;T for resolution and once DOP&amp;T gives its views, the
					<lb />
					Disciplinary Authority may have to take a considered final
					<lb />
					decision, keeping in view the advice given by DOP&amp;T.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					vii.CVC in its annual report has brought out that the
					<lb />
					Commission found that these were Acts of omission,
					<lb />
					procedural lapses and short-cuts, but the case did not exhibit
					<lb />
					any criminality on the part of CCMs and hence it did not
					<lb />
					advice sanction for prosecution. The Commission has
					<lb />
					observed that the instruction of the DOP&amp;T is that where
					<lb />
					there is a disagreement between CVC and the DA, the matter
					<lb />
					has to be referred to the DOP&amp;T for a final view. This is a
					<lb />
					case of deviation from the Commission&apos;s advice and of not
					<lb />
					following the laid down procedure of consultation with
					<lb />
					DoP&amp;T (S.No.19).
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					viii. The matter was not submitted to DOP&amp;T for resolution
					<lb />
					after the competent authority disagreed with the advice of
					<lb />
					CVC.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					ix. As per decision of Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in the case
					<lb />
					of PS Rajya Vs. State of Bihar (1196) 9 SCC 1; the Hon&apos;ble
					<lb />
					Apex Court observed that the standard of Proof required to
					<lb />
					establish the guilt in a criminal case is far higher than the
					<lb />
					standard of proof required in a departmental case. In the
					<lb />
					instant case as per the advice of CVC the case of both Shri
					<lb />
					MS Chalia and Shri Sandeep Silas are not even fit for
					<lb />
					Regular Departmental Action (S.No.12 -page 50).
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					x.DOP&amp;T vide OM dated 23.10.09 have stated that since
					<lb />
					sanction for prosecution by the competent authority is after
					<lb />
					satisfying itself regarding the misconduct of a person under
					<lb />
					PC Act, the natural conclusion would be that in case any
					<lb />
					prosecution is to be withdrawn in respect of such person the
					<lb />
					same competent authority may have to satisfy himself
					<lb />
					regarding the feasibility for withdrawing the prosecution
					<lb />
					against that person. The instructions also state that the
					<lb />
					matter was considered in consultation with the Ministry of
					<lb />
					Law and Justice, Department of Legal Affairs who have
					<lb />
					advised that the withdrawal of prosecution under Section
					<lb />
					321 of Cr.P.C. may be approved by such authority which has
					<lb />
					accorded the sanction for prosecution in respect of the
					<lb />
					person (S.No.17).
					<lb />
				</item>

				<item>
					13.Based on facts as brought out in preceding paras,
					<lb />
					Ministry of Railways do not have a case to defend in the
					<lb />
					matter of sanction for prosecution issued to the petitioners.
					<lb />
					Perhaps the same was not adequately considered at the time
					<lb />
					of processing the sanction. In this context the best course of
					<lb />
					action would be to seek permission of the Hon&apos;ble Court for
					<lb />
					withdrawing the sanction.&quot;
					<lb />
				</item>
			</list>
			<p>
				43. Even though, Mr. Goel has vehemently contended that the
				<lb />
				refusal of the Sanctioning Authority to review its decision makes it
				<lb />
				clear that all the relevant material had already been considered by it
				<lb />
				at the time of passing the sanction order, I am unable to accept the
				<lb />
				said contention. In the light of the specific observations of the
				<lb />
				Chairman, Railway Board extracted hereinabove, as also the fact that
				<lb />
				there is nothing in the impugned sanction order to demonstrate that
				<lb />
				the advice of the CVC was ever considered, I have no hesitation in
				<lb />
				coming to the conclusion that the sanction order does not show due
				<lb />
				application of mind. A subsequent bald averment on behalf of the
				<lb />
				Sanctioning Authority that all the material was duly considered by it
				<lb />
				while passing the sanction order, cannot compensate for the inherent
				<lb />
				shortcoming/defect in the said order. The sanction order by itself
				<lb />
				must make it evident that it was passed after considering all the
				<lb />
				relevant material. I am fortified in my aforesaid conclusion by the
				<lb />
				decision in CBI v. Ashok Kumar Aggarwal [(2014) 12 SCC 295],
				<lb />
				wherein the Supreme Court summarized the legal position regarding
				<lb />
				the essential features of a valid prosecution under the PC Act as
				<lb />
				follows:-
				<lb />
			</p>
			<list>
				<item>
					-16. In view of the above, the legal propositions can be
					<lb />
					summarised as under:
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					16.1. The prosecution must send the entire relevant record to
					<lb />
					the sanctioning authority including the FIR, disclosure
					<lb />
					statements, statements of witnesses, recovery memos, draft
					<lb />
					charge-sheet and all other relevant material. The record so
					<lb />
					sent should also contain the material/document, if any, which
					<lb />
					may tilt the balance in favour of the accused and on the basis
					<lb />
					of which, the competent authority may refuse sanction.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					16.2. The authority itself has to do complete and conscious
					<lb />
					scrutiny of the whole record so produced by the prosecution
					<lb />
					independently applying its mind and taking into consideration
					<lb />
					all the relevant facts before grant of sanction while
					<lb />
					discharging its duty to give or withhold the sanction.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					16.3. The power to grant sanction is to be exercised strictly
					<lb />
					keeping in mind the public interest and the protection
					<lb />
					available to the accused against whom the sanction is sought.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					16.4. The order of sanction should make it evident that the
					<lb />
					authority had been aware of all relevant facts/materials and
					<lb />
					had applied its mind to all the relevant material.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					16.5. In every individual case, the prosecution has to establish
					<lb />
					and satisfy the court by leading evidence that the entire
					<lb />
					relevant facts had been placed before the sanctioning
					<lb />
					authority and the authority had applied its mind on the same
					<lb />
					and that the sanction had been granted in accordance with
					<lb />
					law.‖
					<lb />
				</item>

				44. Now coming to the issue regarding the Sanctioning Authority&apos;s
				<lb />
				failure to comply with the DoPT&apos;s OMs dated 15/17.10.1986,
				<lb />
				06.11.2006 and 20.12.2006 and refer the matter to the DoPT for a
				<lb />
				final decision, in the wake of the divergence of opinions between the
				<lb />
				Sanctioning Authority and the CVC. While dealing with issue, it may
				<lb />
				be useful to refer to the relevant provisions of the DoPT&apos;s aforesaid
				<lb />
				OMs, which are extracted hereinbelow:-

				<item>
					-2.2 The following guidelines may be kept in view while
					<lb />
					dealing with cases of Sanction of prosecution.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(i) In cases in which the sanction for prosecution is required
					<lb />
					to be accorded in the same name of the President, the Central
					<lb />
					Vigilance Commission will advise the Ministry/ Department
					<lb />
					concerned and it would be for that Ministry/Department to
					<lb />
					consider the advice of the CVC and to take a decision as to
					<lb />
					whether or not the prosecution should be sanctioned;
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(ii) In cases in which an authority other than the President is
					<lb />
					competent to sanction prosecution, and that authority does not
					<lb />
					propose to accord such sanction, it is required to report the
					<lb />
					case to the Central Vigilance Commission and take further
					<lb />
					action after considering the Central Vigilance Commission&apos;s
					<lb />
					advice, vide para 2(vii)(b) of the Government Resolution by
					<lb />
					which the Central Vigilance Commission was set up and the
					<lb />
					Central Vigilance Commission&apos;s letter No.9/1/64-DP, dated
					<lb />
					13th April, 1984;
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(iii) In a case falling under (i) above, if the Central
					<lb />
					Vigilance Commission advises grant of sanction for
					<lb />
					prosecution but the Ministry/Department concerned
					<lb />
					proposes not to accept such advice, the case should be
					<lb />
					referred to this Department for a final decision;
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(iv) In a case falling under (ii) above, if the Central Bureau
					<lb />
					of Investigation has sought sanction for prosecution and the
					<lb />
					Central Vigilance Commission has recommended grant of
					<lb />
					sanction and yet, the competent authority proposes not to
					<lb />
					grant sanction, the case should be referred to this
					<lb />
					Department for a final decision;
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(v) Where two or more Government servants belonging to
					<lb />
					different Ministries/Departments, or under the control of
					<lb />
					different cadre controlling authorities are involved, the CBI
					<lb />
					will seek sanction from the respective Ministries/Departments,
					<lb />
					or the respective competent authorities in accordance with the
					<lb />
					procedure laid down in the case of one of the Govt. servants
					<lb />
					but sanction is refused in the case of other or others, the CBI
					<lb />
					will refer the case to this Department for Resolution of the
					<lb />
					conflict, if any, and for a final decision.‖

					OM dated 06.11.2006
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					-2. Delay in the disposal of sanction of prosecution cases is
					<lb />
					not in the interest of the Government. The Government is
					<lb />
					keen that innocent officers should not needlessly face
					<lb />
					harassment through prosecution while at the same time the
					<lb />
					really culpable and guilty officers should not escape
					<lb />
					prosecution on account of failure of the competent authority
					<lb />
					to appreciate properly the fact brought out in the CBI
					<lb />
					investigation reports. In order to ensure that cases for grant
					<lb />
					of sanction for prosecution are disposed of quickly, it has
					<lb />
					been decided that the following measures should be adopted
					<lb />
					with immediate effect:-
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(i) In cases investigated by the Central Bureau of
					<lb />
					Investigation against any public servant who is not removable
					<lb />
					from his office except with the sanction of the President, the
					<lb />
					CBI forwards its final report of investigation to the CVC and
					<lb />
					also simultaneously endorses a copy of the report to the
					<lb />
					administrative Ministry/Department concerned the competent
					<lb />
					authority shall within three weeks formulate its tentative view
					<lb />
					regarding the action to be taken and seek the advice of the
					<lb />
					CVC in the matter.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(ii) The CVC would tender its advice within ten days to the
					<lb />
					concerned administrative Ministry/Department, which shall
					<lb />
					finalize its view in the matter within a week and issue orders
					<lb />
					for sanction for prosecution accordingly.
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(iii) The concerned Ministry/Department shall refer the case
					<lb />
					to CVC for reconsideration only in exceptional cases when
					<lb />
					new facts come to light. The Committee of experts proposed to
					<lb />
					be set up by the CVC, with experts drawn from the civil
					<lb />
					services, public sector undertakings and banks shall examine
					<lb />
					the CBI&apos;s recommendation and the tentative view of the
					<lb />
					concerned Ministry/Department in greater detail and CVC
					<lb />
					would render appropriate advice to the competent authority
					<lb />
					based on the findings of the expert committee, within a
					<lb />
					fortnight;
					<lb />
				</item>
				<item>
					(iv) If the CVC on reconsideration advices for grant of
					<lb />
					sanction, the concerned Ministry/Department will issue the
					<lb />
					requisite orders immediately. However, if the concerned
					<lb />
					Ministry/Department proposes not to accept the reconsidered
					<lb />
					advice of he CVC, the case will be referred to the Department
					<lb />
					of Personnel and Training for a final decision, as per the
					<lb />
					DOP&amp;T O.M.No./134/2/85-AVD-I dated 17.10.1986.‖

					requisite orders immediate. However, if the concerned
					<lb />
					Ministry/Department proposes not to accept the reconsidered
					<lb />
					advice of the CVC, the case will be referred to the Department
					<lb />
					of Personnel &amp; Training for a final decision, as per the
					<lb />
					DOP&amp;T OM. No.134/2/85-AVD-I dated 17.10.1986. The
					<lb />
					Department of Personnel&amp; Training shall decide the case
					<lb />
					within three weeks and convey its decision to the concerned
					<lb />
					Ministry/Department.‖

				45. From a combined reading of the aforesaid OMs, the foremost
				<lb />
				thing which becomes evident is that the CVC has been assigned a
				<lb />
				very important role not only in the post-2003 OMs when it was
				<lb />
				already established as an independent statutory authority, but even in
				<lb />
				the pre-2003 OMs when the CVC Act had not even been passed.
				<lb />
				Paragraphs 2.2(i) to (iv) of the OM dated 15/17.10.1986 categorically
				<lb />
				stipulate that in case an executive department proposes to not accept
				<lb />
				the opinion of the CVC for grant of sanction, the matter must be
				<lb />
				referred to the DoPT for a final decision. The same position emerges
				<lb />
				from the OM dated 06.11.2006, wherein while laying down
				<lb />
				guidelines for checking the delay in granting sanction for
				<lb />
				prosecution, the DoPT had clearly mandated that in a case being
				<lb />
				investigated by the CBI against any public servant, the CBI must
				<lb />
				while forwarding the report to the administrative department of the
				<lb />
				concerned ministry, simultaneously forward a copy thereof to the
				<lb />
				CVC, which is then expected to give its advice within 10 days.
				<lb />
				Paragraphs 2.2(iii) and (iv) of this OM reiterate that in a case where
				<lb />
				the administrative department of the concerned ministry proposes to
				<lb />
				disregard the advice of the CVC for grant of sanction, a reference
				<lb />
				ought to be made to the DoPT for a final decision.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				46. Even though, the language used in the aforesaid OMs may at the
				<lb />
				first blush, appear to suggest that a reference to DoPT is only
				<lb />
				necessary when the CVC has advised in favour of grant of sanction
				<lb />
				and the department wishes to disregard the same and not grant
				<lb />
				sanction, a careful perusal of all the three OMs shows that the
				<lb />
				paramount intent of these OMs is to give primacy to the advice of the
				<lb />
				CVC when there is a divergence of opinion between the concerned
				<lb />
				sanctioning authority and the CVC. There is nothing in the OMs to
				<lb />
				suggest that the DoPT is not enjoined to take a final decision
				<lb />
				regarding grant of sanction for prosecution in converse situations like
				<lb />
				the present case where the CVC advises against grant of sanction and
				<lb />
				the concerned administrative department proposes otherwise. To hold
				<lb />
				anything to the contrary, as is sought to be contended by the learned
				<lb />
				counsel for the CBI, would lead to a situation where the advice of the
				<lb />
				CVC would be given primacy in one situation and cannot be
				<lb />
				overruled by the department without reference to the DoPT, while in
				<lb />
				another situation the said advice could be simply disregarded by the
				<lb />
				department on its own. Such an interpretation of the OMs would not
				<lb />
				only undermine the important role assigned to the CVC under the
				<lb />
				CVC Act and DSPE Act, but would also dilute the powers of
				<lb />
				superintendence over the CBI vested in the CVC by virtue of the said
				<lb />
				enactments and would, thus, virtually render the CVC&apos;s power of
				<lb />
				superintendence redundant in a case where the CVC specifically
				<lb />
				advises against grant of sanction.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				47. It must be borne in mind that the DoPT&apos;s OMs must be
				<lb />
				interpreted so as to forward the very purpose for which they were
				<lb />
				issued in the first place. Once it is evident that the OMs in question
				<lb />
				were specifically issued to provide for situations where there is a
				<lb />
				divergence of opinion between the CVC and the concerned
				<lb />
				sanctioning authority, and they aim at giving primacy to the opinion
				<lb />
				of the former in such circumstances, there is no reason to hold that a
				<lb />
				reference to the DoPT is not essential where the advice of the CVC
				<lb />
				for not granting sanction is not acceptable to the concerned authority.
				<lb />
				In my view, only if the OMs are understood and implemented in the
				<lb />
				aforesaid manner, can the very purpose for which they have been
				<lb />
				issued be fulfilled. Thus, keeping in view the apparent intent of the
				<lb />
				DoPT when issuing the aforesaid OMs, I have no hesitation in
				<lb />
				holding that matters regarding grant of sanction ought to be referred
				<lb />
				to the DoPT in every case where the CVC and the concerned
				<lb />
				sanctioning authority are of differing views, irrespective of the fact
				<lb />
				as to whether the CVC&apos;s advice is in favour of or against the grant of
				<lb />
				sanction.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				48. In the light of the admitted position that the Sanctioning
				<lb />
				Authority has issued the sanction order in total disregard of the
				<lb />
				CVC&apos;s advice without any reference to the DoPT, the said order,
				<lb />
				besides suffering from non-application of mind, is also contrary to
				<lb />
				the OMs dated 15/17.10.1986, 06.11.2006 and 20.12.2006 and, thus,
				<lb />
				cannot be sustained.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				49. For the aforementioned reasons, the sanction order dated
				<lb />
				14.03.2017 being wholly unsustainable is hereby quashed.
				<lb />
				Consequently, the order dated 08.05.2017 rejecting the petitioners&apos;
				<lb />
				application for referring the matter to the DoPT for a final decision as
				<lb />
				also the subsequent order dated 01.07.2017 passed by the learned
				<lb />
				Trial Court taking cognizance against the petitioners, are also set
				<lb />
				aside. The matter is remanded back to the Sanctioning Authority to
				<lb />
				reconsider the same after making an appropriate reference to the
				<lb />
				DoPT in accordance with the OMs dated 15/17.10.1986, 06.11.2006
				<lb />
				and 20.12.2006. It is made clear that this Court has not expressed any
				<lb />
				opinion on the merits of the pleas taken by the petitioners that there
				<lb />
				is no case warranted for taking any criminal action against them and
				<lb />
				it will be open for the competent authority to take a fresh decision in
				<lb />
				this regard in accordance with the observations made hereinabove.
				<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
				50. The writ petitions are allowed in the aforesaid terms with no
				<lb />
				order as to costs.
