1. 
These two writ petitions, though separately filed and separately 

argued by learned Senior Counsel Mr. Sunil Gupta, raise interconnected 

issues, and involve, essentially, interpretation and understanding of 

common judicial authorities and pronouncements. They are, therefore, 

being decided by this common judgment, though the judgments on these 

writ petitions were reserved on different dates. 

2. 
Before adverting either to the facts of these cases, or the nature of 

the controversy involved, it would be appropriate to reproduce, in 

extenso, the relevant statutory provisions, as contained in the Constitution 

of India, the Delhi School Education Act, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as 

"the DSE Act") and the Delhi School Education Rules, 1973 (hereinafter 

referred to as "the DSE Rules"). 

(i) 
Relevant provisions from the Constitution: 

Article 26 

"26. 
Freedom to manage religious affairs -
Subject to public order, morality and health, every 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 3 of 173 

religious denomination or any section thereof shall 
have the right 

(a) to establish and maintain institutions for 
religious and charitable purposes; 

(b) to manage its own affairs in matters of 
religion; 

(c) to own and acquire movable and 
immovable property; and 

(d) to administer such property in accordance 
with law." 

Article 30 

"30. 
Right of minorities to establish and 
administer educational institutions -

(1A) In making any law providing for the 
compulsory acquisition of any property of an 
educational 
institution 
established 
and 
administered by a minority, referred to in clause 
(1), the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by 
or determined under such law for the acquisition of 
such property is such as would not restrict or 
abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause. 

(2) The state shall not, in granting aid to 
educational institutions, discriminate against any 
educational institution on the ground that it is 
under the management of a minority, whether 
based on religion or language."

committee of such school to bring the same up to the 
level of those of the employees of the corresponding

3. 
Having provided, thereby, the statutory backdrop in which the 

controversies in these writ petitions arise for consideration, I proceed to 

deal with these two writ petitions, separately. 

WP (C) 4374/2018 -Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private 
Schools v. DoE 

4. 
The petitioner, in this writ petition, is a registered association of 

450 private unaided recognised schools in Delhi, and claims, in this writ 

petition, to espouse the cause of 325, of the said 450 schools. The 

challenge, in the writ petition, is essentially directed against an Order, 

dated 13 th April, 2018, issued by the Directorate of Education (hereinafter 

referred to as "the DoE"). The said Order selectively withdrew an earlier 

Order, dated 17 th October, 2017, also issued by the DoE. It is essential, 

therefore, to first paraphrase the latter Order, dated 17 th October, 2017, 

thus: 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 16 of 173 

Order No DE. 15 (318)/PSB/2016/19786, dated the 17 th October, 2017, 
issued by the DoE 

5. 
This Order was, avowedly, issued for the implementation of the 

recommendations of the 7 th Central Pay Commission (hereinafter referred 

to as "the 7 th CPC"), and was issued in exercise of the powers conferred 

by Section 17(3) and 24(3), read with Section 18(3), (4) and (5) of the 

DSE Act, read with Rule 50, 177 and 180 of the DSE Rules. Separate 

instructions were contained, in the said Order, for schools set up on land 

given by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), in which a clause, 

proscribing the schools from increasing their fees without the prior 

approval of the DDA (hereinafter referred to as "the land clause") was 

contained, vis-à-vis schools in which no such "land clause" applied, while 

issuing general instructions, otherwise, covering all schools, irrespective 

of the "land clause". Among the instructions which were generally 

contained, in the said Circular, as applicable to all schools, irrespective of 

the "land clause", were the following: 

(i) 
Fee hike was not mandatory for recognized unaided schools. 

Schools were required, first, to explore the possibility of utilizing 

existing reserves to meet shortfall in payment of salaries and 

allowances, as a consequence of the increase in the salaries of 

employees consequent on the 7 th CPC. They were not to consider 

increase in fee to be the only source of augmenting their revenue, 

and were required to "venture upon other permissible measures for 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 17 of 173 

increasing revenue receipts". 
The following steps were 

suggested/mandated: 

(a) Interest on deposits made as a condition precedent to 

recognition of schools and as pledged in favour of the 

Government should also be utilized for payment of arrears. 

(b) Part of the reserve fund which had not been utilized 

for years together could also be used to meet the shortfall 

before proposing a fee hike. 

(ii) Fees/funds were to be strictly utilized in accordance with 

Rules 176 and 177 of the DSE Rules. No amount whatsoever 

would be transferred from the school fund or the trust to any other 

institution. 

(iii) The tuition fee had to be "so determined as to cover the 

standard cost of establishment including provisions for D.A., 

bonus, etc., and all terminal benfits as also the expenditure of 

revenue nature concerning curricular activities". No fees, in excess 

of the amount so determined or determinable could be charged 

from the students/parents. 

(iv) Every recognized unaided school was required to maintain 

accounts on the principles applicable to non-business 

organization/not-for-profit organization as per Generally Accepted 

Accounting Principles (GAAP). The financial statements of such 

schools, consisting of their Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss Account 

and Receipts & Payment Account, would be prepared every year as 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 18 of 173 

per the proforma prescribed by the DoE vide order dated 16 th April, 

2016. 

(v) Every recognized unaided school was required to file a 

statement of fees, by the 31 st of March every year, under Section 

17(3) of the DSE Act, as per the proforma prescribed by the DoE. 

(vi) If, after exploring all possibilities, the Managing Committee 

of the school, nevertheless, felt it necessary to increase the tuition 

fee, it had to hold a meeting with a group of teachers and parents 

which would include at least one parent representative from each 

section of the school, and would present the detailed budget of the 

school, the financial statements of the previous year, the 

requirement of funds for the implementation of the 7 th CPC 

recommendations, the availability of cash/reserve fund/savings 

with the School Fund account, as well as present the proposal for 

fee hike, with justification and with all the documents mentioned in 

Annexure A to the Circular. Inputs would be solicited from the 

parents and teachers' representatives. The Managing Committee 

could take their suggestions into consideration, or record their 

dissent. The DoE's nominee would remain present in the meeting. 

The minutes and attendance sheet of this meeting, countersigned 

by the nominee of the DoE, including details of the parents invited 

for the meeting, along with photographs of the meeting, was 

required to be submitted by the School to the Deputy Director of 

Education (hereinafter referred to as "DDE") concerned. The 

circular, however, was cautious in clarifying that presentation of 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 19 of 173 

the proposal for increase in fee before the parents' representatives 

would not be liable to be construed as seeking the approval of the 

parents, in view of the judgment, dated 12 th August, 2011, of this 

Court in Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh v. G.N.C.T.D., ILR 2011 

Supp (4) Del 247 (hereinafter referred to as "Delhi Abhibhavak 

Mahasangh-II"). It was further clarified that, for the purpose of 

increase in tuition fee mid-session, the approval of the DoE was 

not required, in view of Section 17(3) of the DSE Act. 

6. 
Thereafter, under the head "Procedure for Increase in Tuition 

Fees", the Circular proceeded to ordain as under, in respect of schools 

running on private land, or on government land without the "land clause", 

and, separately, in respect of schools running on land obtained from the 

Government with the "land clause". 

7. 
In respect of the first category of schools, i.e. schools running on 

private land, or land leased from the Government without any "land 

clause", the Circular directed thus: 

(i) 
If, after complying with the general stipulations prescribed, 

in the Circular, in respect of all schools (i.e. the stipulations 

enumerated in paragraph 4 supra), the school still felt it necessary 

to hike the tuition fee, it was required to present its case, along with 

detailed financial statements, before the Managing Committee of 

the School, which would include nominees of the DoE. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 20 of 173 

(ii) Prior to hiking the tuition fee, the school would ensure 

compliance with Section 18(4) of the DSE Act as well as Rules 

172, 173, 174, 175, 176 and 177 of the DSE Rules, as also other 

relevant provisions of the DSE Act and DSE Rules, and the 

guidelines of the DoE, as issued from time to time and various 

judicial pronouncements, especially the ratio of the decision in 

Modern School v. U.O.I., (2004) 5 SCC 583 and Delhi 

Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra). 
A time-schedule, for 

circulating the agenda for the meeting, convening thereof and filing 

of the statement of revised tuition fee, in accordance with Section 

17(3) of the DSE Act, was also prescribed. 

(iii) The proposal, of the school, to increase the fee, would be 

evaluated by the Managing Committee, taking into consideration 

the 
availability 
of 
funds/reserves/cash 
in 
hand/bank 

balances/surplus. 

(iv) Where the DoE nominee disagreed with the proposal for 

increase, or agreed with the proposal to increase the fee but to a 

lesser extent, she/he would record her/his dissent note in writing, 

justifying the dissent. 

(v) A copy of the minutes of the meeting of the Managing 

Committee would, in all cases, be forwarded by the DoE's 

nominee to the DDE, for information and record. 

(vi) The Managing Committee would file the full statement of 

fee with the DDE, as required by Section 17(3) of the DSE Act, in 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 21 of 173 

the proforma prescribed by Order dated 3 rd July, 2017, issued by 

the DoE. The statement would be compulsorily analyzed by the 

DDE. 

(vii) The DDE would pass necessary orders with regard to 

refund/reduction of the fee, if any. 

(viii) The school would not increase any other head of fee, like the 

annual fee, development fee, or earmarked levies, for 

implementation of the recommendations of the 7 th CPC. 

8. 
In respect of the second category of schools, i.e. schools running 

on land allotted by the DDA/Government, with the "land clause" (to 

which the petitioners in this writ petition belong), the Circular directed as 

under: 

(i) 
In the first instance, the school had to try to pay the 

arrears/increased salary to their employees/teachers without 

increasing the fee, from their existing resources. 

(ii) Schools, in respect of which the fee hike proposal, for the 

year 2016-2017, were examined and rejected by the DoE due to 

availability of sufficient funds with the School Fund account, were 

prohibited from increasing the rates of tuition fee w.e.f. 1 st January, 

2016. They were, however, permitted an 'interim fee hike', to be 

collected w.e.f. 1 st April, 2017, in case of unavailability of 

funds/reserves from any other permissible source. The Circular 

went on to stipulate the maximum monthly increase of tuition fee 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 22 of 173 

permissible in such cases, for collection of arrears, with 7.5% being 

permitted for the period 1 st January to 31 st March, 2016, 7.5% for 

the period 1 st April to 30 th June, 2017, 15% for the period 1 st July to 

30 th November, 2017 and 15% (for payment of regular salary) for 

the period 1 st December, 2017 to 31 st March, 2018. This fee hike 

was to be treated as an interim measure, and was subject to scrutiny 

into the records of the schools if the need arose, to examine 

whether any necessity for increase of fee, having regard to the 

financial position of the schools, existed. 

(iii) While stating that the above 'interim fee hike' would 

substantially cover the increased liability on the schools, pursuant 

to the 7 th CPC recommendations, it was further provided that, in 

case any school needed further increase in fee, it could submit a 

detailed fee increase proposal in the online module of the DoE, 

which would be examined by the DoE by due process, and detailed 

order passed on the proposal. For this purpose, the Circular stated 

that the online module of the DoE would be re-opened from 1 st 

November to 30 th November, 2017. 

(iv) It was further stipulated that, for the purpose of increase in 

tuition fee as above, a meeting of the Managing Committee of the 

school would be convened. A strict time schedule, for circulation 

of agenda, convening of the meeting, submission of revised 

statement of fee under Section 17(3) of the DSE Act and for 

submitting online proposal to the DoE, in case of increase of fee, 

beyond 7.5%/15%, being felt necessary, was also prescribed. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 23 of 173 

(v) This 'interim fee hike', it was clarified, was being permitted 

only in order to avoid further delay in dispensation of benefits of 

the 7 th CPC to teachers and other employees of the schools, and to 

ensure that the burden of payment of arrears did not accumulate on 

parents. 

(vi) It was further provided that, if it was found on examination 

of the fee statement under Section 17(3) of the DSE Act, that 

increase of 7.5%/15% in the tuition fee was not needed by the 

school, or that the provisions of paragraph 1 of the Circular or of 

judicial pronouncements were not complied with, individual 

orders, directing refund of fee, would be issued. 

(vii) The schools were also advised not to plan fee hike under 

other heads of fee in the academic year 2017-2018, in view of the 

considerable fee burden on parents, because of the implementation 

of the 7 th CPC recommendations. 

9. 
Specific stipulations, regarding the manner in which the arrears of 

fee, for the period 1 st January, 2016 to 30 th November, 2017, were to be 

collected, were also contained in the Circular. These applied to all 

schools, irrespective of the nature of the land on which they were 

situated. 

Order No. DE. 15 (318)/PSB/2016/23840-23847, dated 13 th April, 2018,

10. This Circular, admittedly and as expressly stated therein, was 

issued "in view of the stand taken by the Department, under instructions", 

in this Court, on 2 nd February, 2018, in WP (C) 11265/2017 (Taru 

Chauhan v. G.N.C.T.D.). It withdrew the Circular, dated 17 th October, 

2017 supra, selectively in respect of private unaided schools running on 

land allotted by the DDA/governmental agencies with the "land clause". 

Other directions were, instead, issued, in substitution thereof, for 

compliance by such schools. The Circular merits reproduction, thus:

11. As a result, the petitioners in this writ petition, being private 

unaided schools built on land allotted by DDA/government agencies, the 

documents of allotment in respect whereof contained the "land clause", 

the Order dated 17 th October, 2017 supra, became inapplicable to them 

and, instead, the conditions engrafted in the Order dated 13 th April, 2018, 

applied. 

Pleadings in the Writ Petition 

12. The petitioner in this writ petition, in the circumstances seeks 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 26 of 173 

"(i) mandamus directing the DoE not to enforce the impugned 

Order dated 13 th April, 2018, against the 325 schools in question. 

(ii) mandamus declaring all acts, circulars, orders, 

correspondences, etc. of the respondents, having the effect of 

obstructing, delaying, disabling and/or preventing the private 

unaided schools from giving effect to the 7 th CPC immediately, as 

required by Section 10(1) of the DSE Act, to be illegal, without 

jurisdiction, arbitrary, unconstitutional and void. 

(iii) certiorari quashing the Order dated 13 th April, 2018, issued 

by the Respondent No. 1 whereby the guidelines dated 17 th 

October, 2017, are sought to be selectively withdrawn only qua 

some of the private unaided schools, as being absolutely illegal, 

arbitrary, discriminatory, without jurisdiction, unconstitutional, 

biased, malicious and malafide." 

13. These prayers are, essentially, predicated on the following 

facts/grounds: 

(i) 
The DSE Act and the DSE Rules recognized and conferred 

maximum autonomy on private unaided recognized schools to 

determine their own fee structure. Section 17(3) of the DSE Act 

conferred autonomy on every unaided recognized private school to 

fix and levy fees, without any prior or later sanction or approval 

from the DoE. This position was confirmed, as far back as on 30 th 

October, 1998, by this Court in Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh v. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 27 of 173 

U.O.I., AIR 1999 Del 124 (hereinafter referred to as "Delhi 

Abhibhavak Mahasangh-I"), authored by Y. K. Sabharwal, J. (as 

the Hon'ble Chief Justice then was), as well as by the 11-Judge 

Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in T. M. A. Pai 

Foundation v. State of Karnataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481. 

(ii) In Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra), this Court 

held that the autonomy of unaided private schools could be ensured 

by first giving the right to such schools to increase their fees, 

retaining the right to regulate the quantum of such fees, with the 

DoE, under Section 17(3) of the DSE Act. It was reiterated that 

unaided schools were not required to obtain any prior approval 

from the DoE before fixing the fee to be charged by them. 

(iii) In this respect, private unaided schools formed a separate 

class, as compared to aided or government schools, in respect of 

their right to establish and administer their institutions. Section 

17(3) only requires such schools to file, with the DoE, a full 

statement of fee to be levied by the school during an ensuing 

academic year. 

(iv) Section 10 of the DSE Act mandated that the scale of pay 

and allowances of employees of private unaided schools would not 

be less than those of corresponding employees in government 

schools. 

(v) Unaided schools were entirely self-sustained, and were 

dependent on their fees for their sustenance, as contradistinguished 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 28 of 173 

from aided schools, which drew sustenance from aid provided by 

the government. 

(vi) The Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2016 

[hereinafter referred to as "the CCS (Revised Pay) Rules"], notified 

consequent to the acceptance of the recommendations of the 7 th 

CPC, had been adopted, by the DoE, for application to teachers and 

staff of government and aided schools by Orders dated 19 th August, 

2016 and 14 th October, 2016. Such teachers and staff had also 

been paid arrears, w.e.f. 1 st January, 2016. 

(vii) In respect of private unaided recognized schools, the DoE 

first issued Circular, dated 6 th January, 2017, which reads thus: 

"GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI

Authority, therefore, the Manager/HoS of all Private

issued by the department.

(Emphasis supplied) 

(viii) This was closely followed by another Circular, dated 27 th 

March, 2017, which read as under: 

"GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI

PRIVATE SCHOOL BRANCH, OLD SECTT., 
DELHI-54 

No. DE-15/PSB/Misc/2016 
Dated: 27/3/17 

Circular 

In continuation of the circular vide 
DE.15/PSB/Misc./2016/29 dated 06.01.2017, vide 
which the Managers/HoS, of PRIVATE Unaided 
Recognised Schools were directed not to hold any 
meeting of Managing Committee regarding increase in 
fee for the session 2017-18 till a decision is conveyed 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 30 of 173 

regarding modalities of implementation of 7 th Pay 
Commission Recommendations in respect of its 
employees. 

Various requests for clarifications are being 
received in this regard, hence it is clarified that the 
circular dated 06.01.2017, applies only with respect to 
7 th Pay Commission benefits, detailed guidelines for 
which will be issued after decision of competent 
authority. In the meantime, managing committee may 
take decision in normal course, as per established 
procedure. However, no fee increase with respect to 
7 th Pay Commission may be implemented, as 
modalities are yet to be conveyed. 

It is clarified here that the schools running on 
the DDA/Government Land owing agencies with a 
condition of seeking prior sanction of Director 
(Education) for fee hike, will not increase any fee 
without prior sanction of the Director (Education). 

This issues with the prior approval of the 
competent authority. 

Yogesh Pratap 
Deputy Director of Education (PSB)" 

(ix) The petitioner, in the circumstances, moved this Court by 

way of WP (C) 2637/2017, contending that, owing to the issuance 

of the aforesaid Circular by the DoE, it was being prevented from 

implementing the recommendations of the 7 th CPC, in respect of 

teachers and employees in its member-institutions, as mandated by 

Section 7 of the DSE Act. It was also contended that the afore-

extracted Circular dated 17 th October, 2017 was contrary to Section 

17(3) of the DSE Act. By an interim order, dated 30 th March, 2017, 

a learned Single Judge of this Court opined that, prima facie, "the 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 31 of 173 

unfettered right of the private unaided schools to notify the fee 

structure after taking into account the major expenditure to be 

incurred in a year before commencement of the academic session 

cannot be abridged or whittled down only on the ground that a 

decision with regard to a major head of expenditure, namely, the 

increase in salary due to 7 th Pay Commission shall be worked out 

by the Directorate of Education in a few days after the 

commencement of the academic session." "Keeping in view the 

importance and relevance of 31 st March, 2017, in the context of 

Section 17(3) of the DSE Act and to balance the equities", this 

Court directed that "in the event the 7 th Pay Commission is directed 

to be implemented in private unaided schools by the respondent, … 

the petitioner-schools would have an option within 2 weeks from 

the date of implementation of the 7 th Pay Commission to intimate 

the revised fee schedule and the same shall be taken as having been 

filed on 30 th March, 2017." The said writ petition is still pending, 

as on date. 

(x) On 25 th August, 2017, the following Order was issued by the 

DoE:

Managing Committee (Through Manager), 
All Private Unaided Recognised Schools of Delhi." 

(xi) The above Order was followed by the Order dated 17 th 

October, 2017, which already stands distilled hereinabove. 

(xii) WP (C) 11265/2017 (Taru Chauhan v. G.N.C.T.D.) was 

filed, before this Court, challenging the aforementioned Order, 

dated 17 th October, 2017, to the extent that the said Circular 

allowed private unaided recognised schools to increase their fee, 

for implementing the 7 th CPC. When the matter was taken up for 

preliminary hearing, by this Court on 20 th December, 2017, a 

statement was made, on behalf of the DoE, on instructions, that, till 

the next date of hearing in the writ petition, i.e. 1 st February, 2018, 

the Circular, dated 17 th October, 2017 supra would be kept in 

abeyance. As a result, private unaided recognised schools were 

denied even the interim fee hike provided by the said Circular. 

(xiii) In view of the Order passed, by this Court, on 20 th 

December, 2017 supra, the DoE issued an Order, dated 2 nd 

January, 2018, directing all private unaided recognised schools not 

to collect increased fee, if any, from parents/guardians/students, on 

account of the implementation of the 7 th CPC, till further orders, to 

be passed by this Court in the aforementioned WP(C) 11265/2017. 

(xiv) On the next date of hearing before this Court in the 

aforementioned WP(C) 11265/2017, the DoE filed an affidavit. 

Nothing substantial turns on the said affidavit, inasmuch as, on 1 st 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 34 of 173 

February, 2018, a statement was made, by the learned Standing 

Counsel appearing for the DoE, before this Court, that the 

Notification dated 17 th October, 2017 was being withdrawn. In 

view thereof, the petitioner chose to withdraw WP(C) 11265/2017. 

It is necessary to reproduce the order passed by this Court, on the 

said date, though it is brief: 

"Mr. Ramesh Singh, learned Standing Counsel for the 
Government of NCT of Delhi, appearing on behalf of 
the Directorate of Education, states that the impugned 
Notification bearing No DE.15 (318)/PSB/2016/19786 
dated 17.10.2017 is being withdrawn. 

Mr Khagesh Jha, learned counsel appearing on 
behalf of the petitioner, seeks leave to withdraw the 
said petition in view of the statement made on behalf 
of the official respondent. 

The petitioner along with the pending 
applications is dismissed as be drawn and disposed of 
accordingly." 

(xv) Instead of withdrawing the Order, dated 17 th October, 2017, 

as undertaken before this Court, the DoE proceeded to issue the 

Order, dated 13 th April, 2018 supra, partially withdrawing the 

earlier Order, dated 17 th October, 2017, limited to cases of schools 

located on land that was given by the DDA/government authorities 

with the "land clause". 

(xvi) The withdrawal of the Order, dated 17 th October, 2017, was 

completely uninformed by any reason whatsoever. The avowed 

object of the said Order was to allow for an interim fee hike, so that 

delay, in grant of benefit, to the teachers and employees of private 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 35 of 173 

unaided recognised schools, situated on land to which the "land 

clause" applied, was not delayed. The said objective had not ceased 

to exist; consequently, the basis, for the selective withdrawal of the 

Order, dated 17 th October, 2017, was unknown. 

(xvii) The Order, dated 13 th April, 2018, merely withdrew the 

earlier Order, dated 17 th October, 2017, in respect of schools such 

as those run by the members of the petitioner-Association, without 

clarifying when the order would be reinforced or how, in the 

absence of the interim fee hike, such schools would bear the 

burden of the 7 th CPC. The situation was aggravated because of the 

Order, dated 25 th August, 2017 supra, which mandated immediate 

implementation of the 7 th CPC recommendations. Even while the 

said order continued to remain in force, the impugned Order, dated 

13 th April, 2018 withdrew the means, by which the Order dated 25 th 

August, 2017 could be implemented, in respect of a select category 

of schools. 

(xviii) Section 10 of the DSE Act equalised all schools, in the 

matter of pay and allowances to be granted to teachers and 

employees. As such, there could be no justification to withdraw, 

selectively, the Order dated 17 th October, 2017. 

(xix) The result of the selective withdrawal of the Order, dated 

17 th October, 2017, in the case of schools situated on land, to which 

the "land clause" applied, was that compliance with Section 10 of 

the DSE Act, by granting, to the teachers and employees of such 

schools, the benefits of enhanced pay scales and allowances as per 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 36 of 173 

the 7 th CPC, had been stalled. This had resulted in dissatisfaction 

and discontentment among the teachers and staff of such schools. 

(xx) There was no justifiable basis to differentiate staff of 

government and aided schools, vis-à-vis staff of private unaided 

recognised schools, the allotment letters in respect whereof 

contained the "land clause", in the matter of disbursement of the 

benefits flowing from the 7 th CPC recommendations. The 

employees and staff of government and aided schools were entitled 

to receive the benefits of the 7 th CPC vide Circulars/Orders dated 

19 th August, 2016 on 14 th October, 2016. However, owing to the 

issuance of the impugned Order dated 13 th April, 2018, the 

employees and teachers of unaided private schools, situated on 

land to which the "land clause" applied, were denied, indefinitely, 

the same benefits, which directly infracted Section 10 of the DSE 

Act. 

(xxi) The members of the petitioner-Association, who were 

managing schools located on land, to which the "land clause" 

applied, had also paid institutional rates of allotment for the said 

land, which could not be treated as concessional in any manner. 

They could not, therefore, be justifiably discriminated vis-à-vis 

schools located on land to which the "land clause" did not apply, 

by requiring them to obtain prior approval of the DoE before 

enhancing fees. 

Counter-affidavit by the GNCTD 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 37 of 173 

14. A counter-affidavit, to the writ petition, stands filed by the 

GNCTD, in which reliance, for the issuance of the impugned Order, dated 

13 th April, 2018, has been placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court 

in Modern School v. U.O.I., (2004) 5 SCC 583 and of this Court in 

Justice for All v. G.N.C.T.D., 2016 (227) DLT 354 (DB). It is contended 

that these judgments obligated the schools, situated on land to which the 

"land clause" applied, to seek prior approval of the DoE before increasing 

their fees. These decisions, it is further submitted, recognised the 

authority, of the DoE, to regulate the fees of such schools, in order to 

prevent commercialisation of education, under Rules 172, 173, 175 and 

177 of the DSE Rules. Such schools, therefore, it is contended, were in a 

different category, as compared to schools running on private land, to 

which no "land clause" applied. The only option available to the DoE, in 

the said circumstances, it is contended, was to carry out a comprehensive 

audit of the accounts of private unaided schools situated on land to which 

the "land clause" applied, which would be completed in a time bound 

frame. This being an extraordinary situation, created by the requirement 

of mid-session implementation of the recommendations of the 7 th CPC, 

extraordinary measures were required to be taken. The withdrawal of the 

Order, dated 17 th October, 2017, by the impugned Order dated 13 th April, 

2018, in respect of schools situated on land, to which the "land clause" 

applied, it is contended, was because allowing of such an across the board 

interim fee hike, without prior approval of the DoE, was contrary to the 

Modern School mandate. The counter-affidavit also sets out the proposed 

procedure, to be followed for auditing the accounts of the schools, for 

which two firms of chartered accountants, it is contended, already stand 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 38 of 173 

engaged. The exercise of auditing, it is further submitted, was already 

underway. 

Submissions at the Bar 

15. Arguments were advanced, on behalf of the petitioner, by Mr. 

Sunil Gupta, learned Senior Counsel, instructed by Mr. Kamal Gupta, 

learned Counsel, and, on behalf of the DoE, by Mr. Ramesh Singh, 

learned Standing Counsel instructed by Mr. Santosh Kumar Tripathi, 

learned ASC. 

16. Mr Sunil Gupta, learned Senior Counsel, advanced the following 

submissions: 

(i) 
Inasmuch as the necessity to enhance the fees of the 325 

schools, which were members of the petitioner-Association and 

were built on Government land subject to the "land clause", did not 

arise mid-session, prior approval of the DoE was not required to be 

taken, in view of Section 17(3) of the DSE Act, which only 

required the school to submit its statement of fee, to the DoE, 

before commencement of the academic session, for its scrutiny. 

The scheme of Section 17(3) did not contemplate "prior approval" 

of the fees fixed by every school, before the fixation was brought 

into operation or before the onset of the academic session. 

(ii) The DoE possessed, at all times, the regulatory power to 

receive complaints from parents, scrutinize the accounts of the 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 39 of 173 

schools and even direct refund, if it came to the conclusion that the 

fees charged by the school were excessive. 

(iii) The machinery provided under the DSE Act could not, 

however, be worked "in reverse gear", by requiring every school, 

to which the "land clause" applied, to be subjected to a mass 

parental audit, or to be required to seek prior approval before 

enhancing its fees for the oncoming academic session, which 

would necessarily work to its detriment. 

(iv) It had been held, by this Court in Delhi Abhibhavak 

Mahasangh-II (supra), that the Supreme Court had stated "in so 

many judgments" the legal principle of "autonomy to the schools 

to fix their fee on the one hand and conferring authority upon the 

DoE to regulate the quantum of fee with limited purpose to ensure 

that the schools are not indulging in profiteering." Section 17(3), 

it was therefore held, "strikes a balance between the rights of the 

schools on the one hand and duty cast upon the DoE on the other 

hand." Reliance was placed, for this purpose, on Paragraphs 61 to 

65 of Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra). 

(v) 
The "balance", to which the above words from the judgment 

in Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra) referred, could only 

be struck if, in view of the fundamental right of the schools to fix 

and increase their fee, they were permitted to do so without prior 

approval of the DoE, subject to filing a full statement of fees with 

the DoE in advance of the academic session, in terms of Section 

17(3) of the DSE Act, and were required to take prior approval 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 40 of 173 

only in the case of mid-session increase of fees. Thus, and thus 

alone, could Section 17(3) of the DSE Act survive Article 19(1)(g) 

of the Constitution of India. 

(vi) The "land clause" had, therefore, to be interpreted as 

requiring the school, which was subject thereto, to submit its 

statement of fees, in accordance with Section 17(3) of the DSE 

Act, before the commencement of the academic session, and, 

equivalently, requiring the DoE to complete the exercise of 

approval of the said statement of fees before the commencement of 

the academic session, so that school and students would benefit in 

equal measure. 

(vii) Operated otherwise, the "land clause" would infract Article 

19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India as well as Section 17(3) of the 

DSE Act. 

(viii) The retrospective enforcement of the requirement of 

enhancing the pay scales of teachers and other employees as per 

the recommendations of the 7 th CPC, coupled with the delay in 

granting 'approval' by the DoE, had resulted in a situation in which 

the school and students were burdened alike. The schools, which 

were dependent on the fees paid by the students for their 

sustenance, were forced to pay the increased wages out of their 

own pocket, and the parents/students were faced, at a later stage, 

with the burden of higher fees, owing to retrospective enhancement 

of the payments made to the teachers and other staff. Another 

incongruity that resulted was that, owing to the delay, the liability 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 41 of 173 

which ought to have fallen on one batch of students, which would 

pass out while the DoE was sitting, as it were, on the issue of 

whether to grant "approval" or not, would fall on the shoulders of 

another batch. 

(ix) In the circumstances, the Order dated 17 th October, 2017 

supra provided a belated relief, by allowing an interim increase in 

fees, by the schools, subject to imminent scrutiny of the accounts 

of the schools by the DoE. The impugned order dated 13 th April, 

2018, by withdrawing this relief, too, in the case of schools to 

which the "land clause" applied, had effectively handicapped the 

schools from conforming with Section 10 of the DSE Act, by 

extending, to their employees and teachers, the benefits of the 7 th 

CPC, as was being extended to staff of government schools. 

(x) A similar "interim fee hike", in the context of revision of pay 

scales consequent on the 6 th CPC, stood upheld by this Court in 

Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II. 

(xi) The "land clause" had no nexus with the object of issuing the 

Order dated 17 th October, 2017. In the implementation of the said 

Order, therefore, the DoE had acted illegally in discriminating 

between schools, on the basis of whether the "land clause" was 

applicable, or not. 

(xii) The impugned Order dated 13 th April, 2018, had been issued 

without the prior approval of the Hon'ble Lieutenant Governor, 

which had been accorded to the Order dated 17 th October, 2017, 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 42 of 173 

which stood partly withdrawn thereby. The impugned Order was 

also, therefore, jurisdictionally flawed. Reliance was also placed, 

for this submission, on the judgment of this Court in Action 

Committee for Unaided Recognized Private Schools v. 

Directorate of Education, 2016 SCC Online Del 672. 

(xiii) Exhaustive reference was made to the file notings, indicating 

the proposals and decisions taken at various stages, before the 

Orders dated 17 th October, 2017 and 13 th April, 2018, came to be 

issued. I do not deem it appropriate to burden this judgment, 

which is already over-prolix, with reference thereto. The law, in 

this regard, is well settled by a catena of authorities, including, 

inter alia, Bachittar Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1963 SC 1395 

and Puranjit Singh v. Union Territory of Chandigarh, 1994 Supp 

(3) SCC 471, which hold that noting on files do not create any 

rights, unless and until they are communicated to the person 

seeking to place reliance thereon. In any event, this Court is 

concerned, in this case, with the validity, or otherwise, of the 

impugned Order dated 13 th April, 2018, which has to be tested on 

the anvil of the law, and not on the basis of the opinions or views 

held by different officials, howsoever high, during the upward and 

downward journeys of the file. Mr. Sunil Gupta did, however, 

choose to point out, on the basis of the said file notings, that an 

exhaustive and painstaking exercise was undertaken, with 

application of mind at all levels, before the Order dated 17 th 

October, 2017, was issued, and that, therefore, the evisceration of 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 43 of 173 

the said order, even if only in part, by a single sweep of the pen, 

was completely unconscionable in law. 

17. Arguing per contra, Mr. Ramesh Singh, learned Standing Counsel 

representing the DoE, submitted thus: 

(i) 
Section 17 of the DSE Act had nothing, whatsoever, to do 

with the present controversy. In passing the impugned Order dated 

13 th April, 2018, the DoE was only acting in accordance with the 

directives contained in the concluding paragraphs of the judgment 

of the Supreme Court in Modern School (supra), which mandated 

the DoE to ensure enforcement of the "land clause". This directive 

was reiterated, by this Court, in Justice for All (supra). 

(ii) The requirement of obtaining prior approval before 

enhancing their fees was an independent liability, to which schools 

who had obtained land from the Government with the "land 

clause" appendage were independently subjected, and this liability 

was neither subject to, nor did it override, the responsibilities cast 

on schools by Section 17(3) of the DSE Act. 

(iii) The Circular, dated 17 th October, 2017, infracted this legal 

requirement, by allowing an across-the-board interim fee hike of 

7.5/15% without requirement of prior approval, thereof, from the 

DoE. This mistake was corrected by issuing the Circular dated 13 th 

April, 2018. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 44 of 173 

(iv) Reliance was also placed on the Order, dated 11 th May, 

2012, passed by a Division Bench of this Court, disposing of LPA 

286/2010 (Rukmani Devi Jaipuria Public School v. Dinesh 

Chand). 

(v) Schools had no enforceable legal right to the interim hike 

granted by the Order dated 17 th October, 2017. The DoE had, on 

the other hand, the power and authority to withdraw the said order. 

(vi) In view of the directions contained in paragraph 27 of the 

report in Modern School (supra), it was impermissible for the DoE 

to permit an interim fee hike without undertaking the exercise 

contemplated therein. 

(vii) The power of the Administrator, conferred by Section 3 of 

the DSE Act, would be exercised only "in accordance with the 

provisions of" the said Act "and the rules made thereunder". In 

view thereof, the act of the DoE, in granting interim increase of 

fee, without looking into the financials of the individual schools, 

being contrary to Section 17 of the DSE Act, had necessarily to be 

reversed. There is no estoppel against the law. If the law required 

prior approval, before allowing any fee hike, an interim fee hike, 

without such prior approval, subject to post-approval scrutiny, was 

impermissible. Reliance was also placed, for this purpose, on 

paragraphs 72 and 79 of the judgment of this Court in Delhi 

Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra). 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 45 of 173 

(viii) Section 18(5) of the DSE Act required the managing 

committee of every recognised private school to file, in the year, 

with the DoE, the prescribed duly audited financial and other dues, 

and required the Competent Authority in the DoE to audit the said 

response. To the same effect was Rule 180 of the DSE Rules. This 

exercise had necessarily to predate the grant of any fee hike to 

unaided private schools. 

(ix) Reliance was also placed on Section 24 of the DSE Act. The 

schools could not be seen to complain against the withdrawal, vide 

the impugned Order dated 13 th April, 2018, of the interim fee hike 

granted by the earlier Order dated 17 th October, 2017, as, having 

obtained land at concessional rates, they had also to suffer the 

consequences that went with it. 

(x) The contention that the impugned Order dated 13 th April, 

2018 was bad on account of it not having been approved by the 

Hon'ble Lieutenant Governor was also without merit, as the 

Hon'ble Lieutenant Governor had only approved the Order, dated 

25 th August, 2017 supra, and not the Order dated 17 th October, 

2017 supra. 

18. Mr. Kamal Gupta submitted, by way of rejoinder to the 

submissions of Mr. Ramesh Singh, thus: 

(i) 
The argument, of Mr. Ramesh Singh, that Section 17 of the 

DSE Act was irrelevant, in the context of the controversy in issue, 

was completely without merit. It was not possible, statutorily, to 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 46 of 173 

dissociate Section 10, of the DSE Act, from Section 17 thereof. 

Neither was it possible to wish away Section 17 of the DSE Act, 

and merely restrict one's consideration to the "land clause". 

(ii) The "land clause" could not be permitted to substitute the 

scheme statutorily contained in Section 17 of the DSE Act. The 

two were required to be harmonised. 

(iii) Insofar as the reliance on Section 3 of the DSE Act was 

concerned, the framers of the DSE Act never contemplated a 

problem, of the magnitude that has now risen, consequent to the 

decision to extend, to teachers and other employees of schools, the 

benefits of the 7 th CPC. 

(iv) The reliance, by the DoE, on the affidavit filed before this 

Court in Taru Chauhan (supra), was neither here nor there, as the 

said affidavit had never been accepted by this Court, nor had any 

orders been passed in terms thereof. The affidavit was self-serving 

and self-congratulatory in nature. 

(v) The petitioner was not pleading promissory estoppel. 

19. Mr Khagesh B. Jha, learned Counsel, who was permitted to 

intervene on behalf of some of the affected parents, placed reliance on 

paragraph 72 of the judgment in Modern School (supra) and paragraph 

11 of the judgment in U.O.I. v. Jain Sabha, (1997) 1 SCC 164. He 

sought to distinguish the decision in T. M. A. Pai (supra) on the ground 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 47 of 173 

that the said judgment did not deal with any petitioner who had obtained 

land, with the "land clause" thrown in. 

Analysis 

20. Inasmuch as the present dispute, and the resolution thereof, largely 

involves an understanding of the law laid down by various decisions of 

the Supreme Court and of this Court, it would be appropriate to browse 

through the said decisions, chronologically, before embarking on one's 

own analysis of the issue. 

21. Chronologically, the relevant decisions required to be appreciated 

would be the following, and in that order: 

(i) 
Jain Sabha (supra), 

(ii) Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-I (supra), 

(iii) T. M. A. Pai (supra), 

(iv) Islamic Academy of Education v. State of Karnataka, 

(2003) 6 SCC 697, 

(v) Modern School (supra), 

(vi) P. A. Inamdar v State of Maharashtra, (2005) 6 SCC 537, 

(vii) Cochin University of Science and Technology v. Thomas P. 

John, (2008) 8 SCC 82, 

(viii) Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra), 

(ix) Justice for All v. G.N.C.T.D., 2016 SCC Online Del 355 

(hereinafter referred to as "Justice For All-I") and 

(x) Justice for All v. G.N.C.T.D., 2016 SCC Online Del 4114 

(hereinafter referred to as "Justice For All-II"). 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 48 of 173 

Of these, the necessity of referring to the judgment in Delhi Abhibhavak 

Mahasangh-I (supra) stands obviated by the fact that Modern School 

(supra) was the judgment, of the Supreme Court, passed in the appeal 

filed thereagainst. Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-I (supra) has, thus, 

merged with Modern School (supra). 

Analysis of relevant judicial authorities 

U.O.I. v. Jain Sabha, (1997) 1 SCC 164 (decided, on 21 st November, 
1996, by a Bench of two Hon'ble Judges) 

22. The respondent Jain Sabha (hereinafter referred to as "the Sabha"), 

in this case, applied to the Land & Development Officer (L&DO), for 

allotment of a plot of land to run a school. A plot of land admeasuring 

1.363 acres was allotted @ Rs 5000/-per acre, but physical possession 

thereof could not be delivered to the Sabha on account of the existence, 

thereon, of certain immovable structures. The Sabha continued to press 

for allotment, whereupon, on 18 th July, 1990, a letter of allotment, for an 

alternate plot of land, admeasuring 2.15 acres, was issued in its favour. 

While doing so, however, consideration for the area of 0.787 acres, in 

excess of the area of 1.363 acres originally allotted, was fixed @ Rs 38 

lakhs per acre. This fixation was challenged, by the Sabha, by way of a 

writ petition, which was allowed by this Court, which directed the 

Government to charge, for the entire land, including the excess 1.363 

acres, @ Rs 5000/-per acre. The Union of India appealed to the Supreme 

Court. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 49 of 173 

23. Among the conditions, in the formal letter of allotment, dated 18 th 

July, 1990, issued by the Government of India, was a proscription on the 

Sabha from increasing "the rate of tuition fee without the prior sanction 

of the competent authority". Further, the letter of allotment mandated 

adherence, by the Sabha, to the provisions of the DSE Act and the DSE 

Rules, and other instructions issued from time to time. 

24. The Supreme Court observed that the Sabha had accepted all the 

conditions contained in the letter of allotment. Having done so, it held 

that the Sabha could not seek to challenge the rate fixed by the 

Government for allotting the land. 

25. The concluding paragraph of the report (paragraph 11) contains 

certain observations, on which the respondents rely. The said paragraph 

reads thus: 

"Before parting with this case, we think it appropriate to 
observe that it is high time the Government reviews the 
entire policy relating to allotment of land to schools and 
other charitable institutions. Where the public property is 
being given to such institutions practically free, stringent 
conditions have to be attached with respect to the user of the 
land and the manner in which schools or other institutions 
established thereon shall function. The conditions imposed 
should be consistent with public interest and should always 
stipulate that in case of violation of any of those conditions, 
the land shall be resumed by the Government. Not only such 
conditions should be stipulated but constant monitoring 
should be done to ensure that those conditions are being 
observed in practice. While we cannot say anything about 
the particular school run by the respondent, it is common 
knowledge that some of the schools are being run on totally 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 50 of 173 

commercial lines. Huge amounts are being charged by way 
of donations and fees. The question is whether there is any 
justification for allotting land at throw-away prices to such 
institutions. The allotment of land belonging to the people at 
practically no price is meant for serving the public interest, 
i.e., spread of education or other charitable purposes; it is 
not meant to enable the allottees to make money or profiteer 
with the aid of public property. We are sure that the 
Government would take necessary measures in this behalf in 
the light of the observations contained herein." 

(Emphasis supplied) 

26. Clearly, the concern expressed, in the italicized sentences from the 

above-extracted paragraph of the judgment, was to schools being run on 

totally commercial lines, indulging in profiteering, after having obtained 

land "practically free" from the Government. The Supreme Court has 

advised that, in order to curb such a malpractice, stringent conditions 

should accompany the allotment of land, and strict adherence, thereto, 

must be ensured. 

27. Minority educational institutions, per se, did not engage the 

attention of the Supreme Court in this case. 

T. M. A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481, 
rendered on 25 th November, 2002, by a Constitution Bench of 11 Hon'ble 
Judges: 

28. Learned counsel appearing for petitioners/appellants before the 

Supreme Court in this case, emphasised the fundamental right, available 

in the Constitution, to establish and administer educational institutions. 

This right, it was argued, was relatable, in the case of non-minority 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 51 of 173 

institutions, to Articles 19(1)(g) and 26, and, in the case of minority 

institutions, to Article 30, of the Constitution. It was further argued that, 

while conditions, for grant of affiliation to private educational 

institutions, could be imposed, such conditions could relate only to the 

quality of education to be provided by the institution(s), and could, 

therefore, govern the qualifications of the teachers, the curriculum to be 

taught and minimum facilities which were to be provided to the students, 

but could not encroach into the arena of administration of the institutions, 

in respect whereof, it was contended, the institutions were entitled to full 

autonomy. Among the objections that were voiced, in this context, was 

the objection to the provisions governing fixing of the fee structure to be 

charged by the institution. 

29. The Supreme Court culled out five main issues, as arising for its 

consideration. 

30. Of these, the first issue, as framed by the Supreme Court, read thus: 

"Is there a fundamental right to set up educational 
institutions and if so, under which provision?" 

31. The Supreme Court examined this issue in the context of Article 

19(1)(g) of the Constitution, which guaranteed the fundamental right "to 

practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business". 

Education, it was held, could not be regarded as a "trade" or "business", 

where the motive was profit. It was, however, liable to be regarded as an 

"occupation". While so holding, the Supreme Court overruled the 

observation, in its earlier judgment in J. P. Unnikrishnan v State of A.P., 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 52 of 173 

(1993) 1 SCC 645, that education "may perhaps fall under the category 

of occupation provided no recognition is sought from the State or 

affiliation from the University is asked on the basis that it is a 

fundamental right", holding, classically, that "the question of whether 

there is a fundamental right or not cannot be dependent upon whether it 

can be made the subject matter of controls". 

32. Equally, held the Supreme Court, the right to establish and 

maintain educational institutions could be sourced to Article 26(a), with 

which this judgment need not concern itself. Suffice it, therefore, to state 

that the Supreme Court upheld the fundamental right to set up and 

administer educational institutions, as available under the Constitution. 

33. The second issue arising for its consideration, as delineated by the 

Supreme Court, read thus: 

"Does Unni Krishnan case require reconsideration?" 

34. In examining this issue, the Supreme Court first referred to its 

earlier decision in Mohini Jain v. State of Karnataka, (1992) 3 SCC 

666, in which it was held that any fee charged, by private educational 

institutions, in excess of that charged by government educational 

institutions, was in the nature of a capitation fee, which was illegal. The 

correctness of this decision was questioned, by private educational 

institutions, in J. P. Unnikrishnan (supra), by contending that they 

would find it unviable to function, without appropriate funds, by way of 

tuition fees. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 53 of 173 

35. J. P. Unnikrishnan (supra) upheld the challenge in part. While 

upholding the right of private unaided educational institutions to charge 

fees higher than those charged by government institutions, it was held, 

nevertheless, that the fee so charged could not exceed the maximum limit 

fixed by the State, on the premise that "commercialization of education" 

was not permissible, and that charging of capitation fee was illegal. The 

Supreme Court went on, further, to formulate a scheme, and directed 

every authority granting recognition/affiliation to impose that scheme on 

the institution(s) concerned. Among the postulates of the scheme were 

(i) that the fee chargeable in each professional college (for Unnikrishnan 

dealt with the case of professional colleges) should be subject to a ceiling 

as may be prescribed by the appropriate authority or by a competent 

court, and (ii) that every State Government should constitute a committee 

to fix a ceiling for the fees chargeable by professional colleges. 

36. The minority educational institutions contended, before the 

Supreme Court in T. M. A. Pai (supra), that the Unnikrishnan scheme 

was unwarranted, inter alia for the reason that the cost incurred in 

educating a student was more than the fee which would be realized on the 

basis of the formula devised in the said scheme. 

37. The Supreme Court agreed with this contention in substance, 

holding (in paragraphs 35 and 36 of the report) thus: 

"35. It appears to us that the scheme framed by this Court 
and thereafter followed by the Governments was one that 
cannot be called a reasonable restriction under Article 19(6) 
of the Constitution. Normally, the reason for establishing an 
educational institution is to impart education. The institution 
thus needs qualified and experienced teachers and proper 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 54 of 173 

facilities and equipment, all of which require capital 
investment. The teachers are required to be paid properly. 
As pointed out above, the restrictions imposed by the 
scheme, in Unni Krishnan case [(1993) 1 SCC 645] made it 
difficult, if not impossible, for the educational institutions to 
run efficiently. Thus, such restrictions cannot be said to be 
reasonable restrictions. 

36. The private unaided educational institutions impart 
education, and that cannot be the reason to take away their 
choice in matters, inter alia, of selection of students and 
fixation of fees. Affiliation and recognition has to be 
available to every institution that fulfils the conditions for 
grant of such affiliation and recognition. The private 
institutions are right in submitting that it is not open to the 
Court to insist that statutory authorities should impose the 
terms of the scheme as a condition for grant of affiliation or 
recognition; this completely destroys the institutional 
autonomy and the very objective of establishment of the 
institution." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

38. Observing that private educational institutions were "a necessity", 

the judgment in T. M. A. Pai (supra) held (in paragraph 45 of the report) 

that "the decision in Unni Krishnan case insofar as it framed the scheme 

relating to the grant of admission and the fixing of fee, was not correct". 

39. The third issue arising for its consideration, as framed by the 

Supreme Court in T. M. A. Pai (supra), read thus: 

"In case of private institutions (unaided and aided), can there 
be government regulations and, if so, to what extent?" 

40. The Supreme Court preferred to examine this issue firstly in the 

context of private unaided non-minority educational institutions, 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 55 of 173 

deferring examination of the issue in the context of minority educational 

institutions to a later stage of the judgment. 

41. At the very outset of the discussion, the Supreme Court held that, 

among the rights which comprised the right to establish and administer 

educational institutions, was the right "to set up a reasonable fee 

structure". Referring, with approval and respect, to the recommendations 

of a University Education Commission, appointed on 4 th November, 

1948, under the Chairmanship of Dr S. Radhakrishnan, the Supreme 

Court went on (in paragraph 52 of the report) to hold that "governmental 

domination of the educational process must be resisted" and that 

educational institutions were contemplated as "soaring to great heights in 

pursuit of intellectual excellence and being free from unnecessary 

governmental controls". While recognizing the right of private unaided 

educational institutions to "set up a reasonable fee structure", it held (in 

paragraph 53 of the report) that, in doing so, "the element of profiteering 

is not as yet accepted in Indian conditions". It was held that "the fee 

structure must take into consideration the need to generate funds to be 

utilized for the betterment and growth of the educational institution, the 

betterment of education in that institution and to provide facilities 

necessary for the benefit of the students". Paragraph 54 of the report 

went on to hold thus: 

"The right to establish an educational institution can be 
regulated; but such regulatory measures must, in general, be 
to ensure the maintenance of proper academic standards, 
atmosphere and infrastructure (including qualified staff) and 
the prevention of maladministration by those in charge of 
management. The fixing of a rigid fee structure, dictating the 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 56 of 173 

formation and composition of a governing body, compulsory 
nomination of teachers and staff for appointment or 
nominating students for admissions would be unacceptable 
restrictions." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Thus, the Supreme Court held, in unmistakable words, that no "rigid fee 

structure" could be fixed by the Government, in respect of private 

unaided educational institutions. 

42. Paragraphs 55 to 57 of the report are even more instructive, in this 

regard: 

"55. The Constitution recognizes the right of the individual 
or religious denomination, or a religious or linguistic 
minority to establish an educational institution. If aid or 
financial assistance is not sought, then such institution will 
be a private unaided institution. Although, in Unni 
Krishnan case [(1993) 1 SCC 645] the Court emphasized 
the important role played by private unaided institutions and 
the need for private funding, in the scheme that was framed, 
restrictions were placed on some of the important 
ingredients relating to the functioning of an educational 
institution. There can be no doubt that in seeking affiliation 
or recognition, the Board or the university or the affiliating 
or recognizing authority can lay down conditions consistent 
with the requirement to ensure the excellence of education. 
It can, for instance, indicate the quality of the teachers by 
prescribing the minimum qualifications that they must 
possess, and the courses of study and curricula. It can, for 
the same reasons, also stipulate the existence of 
infrastructure sufficient for its growth, as a prerequisite. But 
the essence of a private educational institution is the 
autonomy that the institution must have in its management 
and administration. There, necessarily, has to be a 
difference in the administration of private unaided 
institutions and the government-aided institutions. Whereas 
in the latter case, the Government will have greater say in 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 57 of 173 

the administration, including admissions and fixing of fees, 
in the case of private unaided institutions, maximum 
autonomy in the day-to-day administration has to be with 
the private unaided institutions. Bureaucratic or 
governmental interference in the administration of such an 
institution will undermine its independence. While an 
educational institution is not a business, in order to examine 
the degree of independence that can be given to a recognized 
educational institution, like any private entity that does not 
seek aid or assistance from the Government, and that exists 
by virtue of the funds generated by it, including its loans or 
borrowings, it is important to note that the essential 
ingredients of the management of the private institution 
include the recruiting students and staff, and the quantum of 
fee that is to be charged. 

56. An educational institution is established for the 
purpose of imparting education of the type made available 
by the institution. Different courses of study are usually 
taught by teachers who have to be recruited as per 
qualifications that may be prescribed. It is no secret that 
better working conditions will attract better teachers. More 
amenities will ensure that better students seek admission to 
that institution. One cannot lose sight of the fact that 
providing good amenities to the students in the form of 
competent teaching faculty and other infrastructure costs 
money. It has, therefore, to be left to the institution, if it 
chooses not to seek any aid from the Government, to 
determine the scale of fee that it can charge from the 
students. One also cannot lose sight of the fact that we live 
in a competitive world today, where professional education 
is in demand. We have been given to understand that a large 
number of professional and other institutions have been 
started by private parties who do not seek any governmental 
aid. In a sense, a prospective student has various options 
open to him/her where, therefore, normally economic forces 
have a role to play. The decision on the fee to be charged 
must necessarily be left to the private educational institution 
that does not seek or is not dependent upon any funds from 
the Government. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 58 of 173 

57. We, however, wish to emphasize one point, and that is 
that inasmuch as the occupation of education is, in a sense, 
regarded as charitable, the Government can provide 
regulations that will ensure excellence in education, while 
forbidding the charging of capitation fee and profiteering by 
the institution. Since the object of setting up an educational 
institution is by definition "charitable", it is clear that an 
educational institution cannot charge such a fee as is not 
required for the purpose of fulfilling that object. To put it 
differently, in the establishment of an educational 
institution, the object should not be to make a profit, 
inasmuch as education is essentially charitable in nature. 
There can, however, be a reasonable revenue surplus, which 
may be generated by the educational institution for the 
purpose of development of education and expansion of the 
institution." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

43. The point was stressed, yet again, in paragraph 61 of the report, in 

the following words: 

"It is in the interest of the general public that more good 
quality schools are established; autonomy and non-
regulation of the school administration in the right of 
appointment, admission of the students and the fee to be 
charged will ensure that more such institutions are 
established." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

44. The discussion on the issue was concluded, in paragraph 66 of the 

report, thus: 

"In the case of private unaided educational institutions, the 
authority granting recognition or affiliation can certainly lay 
down conditions for the grant of recognition or affiliation; 
these conditions must pertain broadly to academic and 
educational matters and welfare of students and teachers − 
but how the private unaided institutions are to run is a 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 59 of 173 

matter of administration to be taken care of by the 
management of those institutions." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

45. In the case of private unaided educational institutions, therefore, 

the Supreme Court, in T. M. A. Pai (supra) took pains to underscore the 

autonomy to which they were entitled in the matter of fixation of fees. 

Bureaucratic and governmental interference, therein, was categorically 

proscribed, to the extent that, in paragraph 21 of the judgment, a policy of 

"non-regulation" was advocated. Governmental control, if any, was, it 

was clearly held, to be limited to "academic and educational matters and 

welfare of students and teachers", within which, (as per the judgment), 

the fees to be charged from the students would not merit inclusion. That 

was, on the other hand, a "matter of administration", falling within the 

exclusive province of the institution concerned. The sole caveat that the 

Supreme Court chose to enter, in this context, was to the effect that the 

fees charged ought not to be such as would result in "profiteering", or be 

in the nature of a "capitation fee", even while recognizing the right, of the 

institution, to maintain a "reasonable revenue surplus". 

46. The fourth issue arising for its consideration, as framed by the 

Supreme Court in T. M. A. Pai (supra), related to the question of 

whether, in order to determine the existence of a religious or linguistic 

minority in relation to Article 30 of the Constitution of India, the 

appropriate unit would be the State, or the country as a whole. This issue 

does not really concern the controversy at hand; accordingly, reference, 

thereto, may conveniently be eschewed. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 60 of 173 

47. The fifth issue, as framed by the Supreme Court, read thus: 

"To what extent can the rights of aided private minority 
institutions to administer be regulated?" 

48. Interestingly, though the issue, as thus worded, referred to the 

regulation of administration of aided private minority institutions, the 

Supreme Court, in examining the issue and pronouncing thereon, laid 

down the law in respect of private minority institutions in general. 

49. Article 26(a) of the Constitution, the Supreme Court noted, gave 

every religious denomination the right to establish and maintain 

institutions for religious and charitable purposes. 
Treating the 

proposition that every educational institution was eligible to be regarded 

as having been established for a "charitable purpose", the Supreme Court 

brought, within the ambit of Article 26(a), the right of religious 

denominations to establish and administer educational institutions. 

50. While Article 26(a) thus applied to all religious denominations, the 

right of religious, as well as linguistic minorities to establish and 

administer educational institutions, it was observed, also flowed from 

Article 30(1). Noting, further, that, unlike Articles 25 and 26, Article 

30(1) did not specifically state, either, that the right thereunder was 

subject to public order, morality or health, or to other provisions of Part 

III of the Constitution, or that the said right would be subject to any rules 

or regulations, the Supreme Court put, to itself, the following posers (in 

paragraph 93 of the report): 

"Can Article 30(1) be so read as to mean that it contains an 
absolute right of the minorities, whether based on religion or 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 61 of 173 

language, to establish and administer educational institutions 
in any manner they desire, and without being obliged to 
comply with the provisions of any law? Does Article 30(1) 
give the religious or linguistic minorities a right to establish 
an educational institution that propagates religious or racial 
bigotry or ill will amongst the people? Can the right under 
Article 30(1) be so exercised that it is opposed to public 
morality or health? In the exercise of its right, would the 
minority while establishing educational institutions not be 
bound by town planning rules and regulations? Can they 
construct and maintain buildings in any manner they desire 
without complying with the provisions of the building bye-
laws or health regulations?" 

It is interesting to note that, while posing these posers, the Supreme 

Court did not choose to travel into the arena of fees. 

51. Dealing with this issue, the Supreme Court first referred to the 

judgment in In Re. Kerala Education Bill, AIR 1958 SC 956, which, 

while recognizing that Article 30(1) gave minorities two rights, viz. (i) to 

establish, and (ii) to administer, educational institutions of their choice, 

went on to clarify that the right to administer could not, obviously, 

include the right to maladminister, and that, therefore, where aid was 

sought from the State, it was open to the State, as a condition precedent, 

to prescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of the 

institution concerned. 

52. This was clarified, yet again, in Rev. Sidhajbhai Sabhai v. State of 

Bombay, AIR 1963 SC 540 (to which the Supreme Court, in T. M. A. Pai 

(supra) next referred), by postulating that "any law or executive direction 

which seeks to infringe the substance of" the right of minorities, to 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 62 of 173 

establish and administer educational institutions of their choice, "would 

to that extent be void". At the same time, it was held that it was open to 

the State to impose regulations upon the exercise of the said right, 

provided the regulations were "made in the true interests of efficiency of 

instruction, discipline, health, sanitation, morality, public order and the 

like". Such regulations, it was clarified, were "not restrictions on the 

substance of the right which is guaranteed: they secure the proper 

functioning of the institution, in matters educational." 

53. The following passage, from Sijadbhai Sabhai (supra), was, 

thereafter, extracted: 

"The right established by Article 30(1) is a fundamental 
right declared in terms absolute. Unlike the fundamental 
freedoms guaranteed by Article 19 it is not subject to 
reasonable restrictions. It is intended to be a real right for 
the protection of the minorities in the matter of setting up of 
educational institutions of their own choice. The right is 
intended to be effective and is not to be whittled down by so-
called regulative measures conceived in the interest not of 
the minority educational institution, but of the public or the 
nation as a whole. If every order which while maintaining 
the formal character of a minority institution destroys the 
power of administration is held justifiable because it is in 
the public or national interest, though not in its interest as 
an educational institution the right guaranteed by Article 
30(1) will be but a 'teasing illusion' a promise of unreality. 
Regulations which may lawfully be imposed either by 
legislative or executive action as a condition of receiving 
grant or of recognition must be directed to making the 
institution while retaining its character as a minority 
institution effective as an educational institution. Such 
regulation must satisfy a dual test -the test of 
reasonableness, and the test that it is regulative of the 
educational character of the institution and is conducive to 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 63 of 173 

making the institution an effective vehicle of education for 
the minority community or other persons who resort to it." 

(Emphasis supplied) 

Qua the law enunciated in the above-extracted passage, however, the 

Constitution Bench, in T. M. A. Pai (supra), chose to enter a note of 

disapproval, opining that, once "regulations made in the true interests of 

efficiency of instruction, discipline, health, sanitation, morality and 

public order could be imposed", it was "difficult to appreciate how the 

Government can be prevented from framing regulations that are in the 

national interest", as the passage seemed to indicate. It was observed that 

"the right under Article 30(1) cannot be such as to override the national 

interest or to prevent the Government from framing regulations in that 

behalf", subject, of course, to the caveat that "government regulations 

cannot destroy the minority character of the institution or make the right 

to establish and administer a mere illusion". This enunciation is of 

significance, as one of the main contentions advanced by Mr. Ramesh 

Singh, learned Senior Standing Counsel appearing for the DoE, was that 

the only limitation on the power to impose regulations, regulating the 

right of the minority to establish and administer the educational 

institution, was that the regulation could not destroy the minority 

character of the institution. As the above extracted words from T. M. A. 

Pai (supra) disclose, this is not really the true legal position; the 

regulations, if any, were not permitted either to destroy the minority 

character of the institution or to render the right, of the minority, to 

establish and administer the institution, illusory. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 64 of 173 

54. The Supreme Court also noted the following elucidation, in State 

of Kerala v. Very Rev. Mother Provincial, (1970) 2 SCC 417, of the 

concept of "administration": 

"Administration means 'management of the affairs' of the 
institution. This management must be free of control so that 
the founders or their nominees can mould the institution as 
they think fit, and in accordance with their ideas of how the 
interests of the community in general and the institution in 
particular will be best served. No part of this management 
can be taken away and vested in another body without an 
encroachment upon the guaranteed right." 

55. The concept of "administration" was also explained, in 

Ahmedabad St. Xaviers' College Society v. State of Gujarat, (1974) 1 

SCC 717, in the concurring judgment of H. R. Khanna, J., thus: 

"Administration connotes management of the affairs of the 
institution. The management must be free of control so that 
the founders or their nominees can mould the institution as 
they think fit and in accordance with their ideas of how the 
interest of the community in general and the institution in 
particular will be best served." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

56. While referring to Ahmedabad St. Xaviers' College Society 

(supra), p aragraphs 115 and 116 of the report in T. M. A. Pai (supra) 

cull out the principles enunciated in the said decision, thus: 

"115. The Court then considered whether the religious and 
linguistic minorities, who have the right to establish and 
administer educational institutions of their choice, had a 
fundamental right to affiliation. Recognizing that the 
affiliation to a university consisted of two parts, the first part 
relating to syllabi, curricula, courses of instruction, the 
qualifications of teachers, library, laboratories, conditions 
regarding health and hygiene of students (aspects relating to 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 65 of 173 

establishment of educational institutions), and the second 
part consisting of terms and conditions regarding the 
management of institutions, it was held that with regard to 
affiliation, a minority institution must follow the statutory 
measures regulating educational standards and efficiency, 
prescribed courses of study, courses of instruction, the 
principles regarding the qualification of teachers, 
educational qualifications for entry of students into 
educational institutions etc. 

116. While considering the right of the religious and 
linguistic minorities to administer their educational 
institutions, it was observed by Ray, C.J., at SCR p. 194, as 
follows: (SCC pp. 745-46, paragraph 19) 

"The right to administer is said to consist of four 
principal matters. First is the right to choose its 
managing or governing body. It is said that the 
founders of the minority institution have faith and 
confidence in their own committee or body consisting 
of persons elected by them. Second is the right to 
choose its teachers. It is said that minority institutions 
want teachers to have compatibility with the ideals, 
aims and aspirations of the institution. Third is the 
right not to be compelled to refuse admission to 
students. In other words, the minority institutions 
want to have the right to admit students of their choice 
subject to reasonable regulations about academic 
qualifications. Fourth is the right to use its properties 
and assets for the benefit of its own institution." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

57. The expostulation of the concept of "reasonable regulations", in 

the context of Articles 29(1) and 30 of the Constitution of India, as 

contained in the concurring report of Khanna, J., in the said judgment, 

were also referred to, with approval, in T. M. A. Pai (supra), in 

paragraph 122 of the report, in the following words: 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 66 of 173 

"The learned Judge then observed that the right of the 
minorities to administer educational institutions did not 
prevent the making of reasonable regulations in respect of 
these institutions. Recognizing that the right to administer 
educational institutions could not include the right to 
maladminister, it was held that regulations could be lawfully 
imposed, for the receiving of grants and recognition, while 
permitting the institution to retain its character as a minority 
institution. The regulation "must satisfy a dual test -the test 
of reasonableness, and the test that it is regulative of the 
educational character of the institution and is conducive to 
making the institution an effective vehicle of education for 
the minority community or other persons who resort to it". 
(SCC p. 783, paragraph 92) It was permissible for the 
authorities to prescribe regulations, which must be complied 
with, before a minority institution could seek or retain 
affiliation and recognition. But it was also stated that the 
regulations made by the authority should not impinge upon 
the minority character of the institution. Therefore, a 
balance has to be kept between the two objectives -that of 
ensuring the standard of excellence of the institution, and 
that of preserving the right of the minorities to establish and 
administer their educational institutions. Regulations that 
embraced and reconciled the two objectives could be 
considered to be reasonable. This, in our view, is the correct 
approach to the problem." 
(Emphasis partly supplied) 

58. Referring to the judgment in St Stephen's College v. University of 

Delhi, (1992) 1 SCC 558, the Supreme Court extracted, in paragraph 126 

of the report in T. M. A. Pai (supra), paragraph 59 of the said judgment, 

which read thus: 

"The need for a detailed study on this aspect is indeed not 
necessary. The right to minorities whether religious or 
linguistic, to administer educational institutions and the 
power of the State to regulate academic matters and 
management is now fairly well settled. The right to 
administer does not include the right to maladminister. The 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 67 of 173 

State being the controlling authority has right and duty to 
regulate all academic matters. Regulations which will serve 
the interests of students and teachers, and to preserve the 
uniformity in standards of education among the affiliated 
institutions could be made. The minority institutions cannot 
claim immunity against such general pattern and standard 
or against general laws such as laws relating to law and 
order, health, hygiene, labour relations, social welfare 
legislations, contracts, torts etc. which are applicable to all 
communities. So long as the basic right of minorities to 
manage educational institution is not taken away, the State 
is competent to make regulatory legislation. Regulations, 
however, shall not have the effect of depriving the right of 
minorities to educate their children in their own institution. 
That is a privilege which is implied in the right conferred by 
Article 30(1)." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

59. After referring to the above, and a host of other, authorities on the 

issue, the Supreme Court noted, in paragraph 133 of the report in T. M. 

A. Pai (supra), that "the two competing rights are the right of the citizen 

not to be denied admission granted under Article 29(2), and right of the 

religious or linguistic minority to administer and establish an institution 

of its choice granted under Article 30(1)." In this context, paragraph 136 

of the report went on to crystallize the raison d'être of the law, as it 

emerged from the above cited authorities, thus: 

"Decisions of this Court have held that the right to 
administer does not include the right to maladminister. It 
has also been held that the right to administer is not 
absolute, but must be subject to reasonable regulations for 
the benefit of the institutions as the vehicle of education, 
consistent with national interest. General laws of the land 
applicable to all persons have been held to be applicable to 
the minority institutions also -for example, laws relating to 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 68 of 173 

taxation, sanitation, social welfare, economic regulation, 
public order and morality." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

60. Thereafter, Paragraphs 137 to 139 of the report went on to hold 

thus: 

"137. It follows from the aforesaid decisions that even 
though the words of Article 30(1) are unqualified, this Court 
has held that at least certain other laws of the land 
pertaining to health, morality and standards of education 
apply. The right under Article 30(1) has, therefore, not been 
held to be absolute or above other provisions of the law, and 
we reiterate the same. By the same analogy, there is no 
reason why regulations or conditions concerning, generally, 
the welfare of students and teachers should not be made 
applicable in order to provide a proper academic 
atmosphere, as such provisions do not in any way interfere 
with the right of administration or management under 
Article 30(1). 

138. As we look at it, Article 30(1) is a sort of guarantee or 
assurance to the linguistic and religious minority institutions 
of their right to establish and administer educational 
institutions of their choice. Secularism and equality being 
two of the basic features of the Constitution, Article 30(1) 
ensures protection to the linguistic and religious minorities, 
thereby preserving the secularism of the country. 
Furthermore, the principles of equality must necessarily 
apply to the enjoyment of such rights. No law can be framed 
that will discriminate against such minorities with regard to 
the establishment and administration of educational 
institutions vis-à-vis other educational institutions. Any law 
or rule or regulation that would put the educational 
institutions run by the minorities at a disadvantage when 
compared to the institutions run by the others will have to be 
struck down. At the same time, there also cannot be any 
reverse discrimination. It was observed in St. Xavier's 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 69 of 173 

College case [(1974) 1 SCC 717 : (1975) 1 SCR 173] at 
SCR p. 192 that : (SCC p. 743, paragraph 9) 

"The whole object of conferring the right on 
minorities under Article 30 is to ensure that there will 
be equality between the majority and the minority. If 
the minorities do not have such special protection they 
will be denied equality." 

In other words, the essence of Article 30(1) is to ensure 
equal treatment between the majority and the minority 
institutions. No one type or category of institution should be 
disfavoured or, for that matter, receive more favourable 
treatment than another. Laws of the land, including rules 
and regulations, must apply equally to the majority 
institutions as well as to the minority institutions. The 
minority institutions must be allowed to do what the non-
minority institutions are permitted to do. 

139. Like any other private unaided institutions, similar 
unaided educational institutions administered by linguistic 
or religious minorities are assured maximum autonomy in 
relation thereto; e.g. method of recruitment of teachers, 
charging of fees and admission of students. They will have to 
comply with the conditions of recognition, which cannot be 
such as to whittle down the right under Article 30." 

(Emphasis supplied) 

61. It is not necessary, in my view, to refer, any further, to T. M. A. 

Pai (supra), or to the passages that follow the above. They deal with the 

position as it applies to aided minority institutions, and the right, of 

minority institutions to admit students, and autonomy enjoyed by them in 

that regard. This judgment is not concerned with the right to admit 

students. Mr. Ramesh Singh did exhort this Court to analogise grant of 

aid with grant of land by the DDA at concessional rates, but the two, in 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018

my view, are distinct and different concepts. "Aid", in the context of 

educational institutions, has its own definite contours, and cannot be 

confused with the price at which land is granted for establishment of 

educational institutions. This is besides the fact that Mr. Sunil Gupta, 

learned Senior Counsel, did seek to contend, on facts, that, in fact, the 

petitioners had not been granted land at concessional rates at all. 

62. The majority opinion in T. M. A. Pai (supra), as authored by B. N. 

Kirpal, J, the Hon'ble Chief Justice, condensed the findings, in the 

judgment, in the form of eleven questions, and the answers thereto (in 

paragraph 161 of the report). One may refer, profitably, to Questions 

Nos. 4, 5(a), and 9, and to the answers thereto, as rendered in the opinion 

(in part), thus: 

"Q. 4. Whether the admission of students to minority 
educational institution, whether aided or unaided, can be 
regulated by the State Government or by the university to 
which the institution is affiliated? 

A. 
Admission of students to unaided minority educational 
institutions viz. schools and undergraduate colleges where 
the scope for merit-based selection is practically nil, cannot 
be regulated by the State or university concerned, except for 
providing the qualifications and minimum conditions of 
eligibility in the interest of academic standards. 

The right to admit students being an essential facet of 
the right to administer educational institutions of their 
choice, as contemplated under Article 30 of the Constitution, 
the State Government or the university may not be entitled to 
interfere with that right, so long as the admission to the 
unaided educational institutions is on a transparent basis and 
the merit is adequately taken care of. The right to administer, 
not being absolute, there could be regulatory measures for 
ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 71 of 173 

thereof, and it is more so in the matter of admissions to 
professional institutions. 

Q. 5. (c) Whether the statutory provisions which regulate the 
facets of administration like control over educational 
agencies, control over governing bodies, conditions of 
affiliation including recognition/withdrawal thereof, and 
appointment of staff, employees, teachers and principals 
including their service conditions and regulation of fees, etc. 
would interfere with the right of administration of 
minorities? 

A. 
So far as the statutory provisions regulating the facets 
of administration are concerned, in case of an unaided 
minority educational institution, the regulatory measure of 
control should be minimal and the conditions of recognition 
as well as the conditions of affiliation to a university or 
board have to be complied with, but in the matter of day-to-
day management, like the appointment of staff, teaching and 
non-teaching, and administrative control over them, the 
management should have the freedom and there should not 
be any external controlling agency. However, a rational 
procedure for the selection of teaching staff and for taking 
disciplinary action has to be evolved by the management 
itself. 

For redressing the grievances of employees of aided 
and unaided institutions who are subjected to punishment or 
termination from service, a mechanism will have to be 
evolved, and in our opinion, appropriate tribunals could be 
constituted, and till then, such tribunals could be presided 
over by a judicial officer of the rank of District Judge. 

The State or other controlling authorities, however, 
can always prescribe the minimum qualification, experience 
and other conditions bearing on the merit of an individual for 
being appointed as a teacher or a principal of any 
educational institution. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 72 of 173 

Regulations can be framed governing service 
conditions for teaching and other staff for whom aid is 
provided by the State, without interfering with the overall 
administrative control of the management over the staff. 

Fees to be charged by unaided institutions cannot be 
regulated but no institution should charge capitation fee." 

Q. 9. Whether the decision of this Court in Unni Krishnan, 
J.P. v. State of A.P.[(1993) 1 SCC 645] (except where it 
holds that primary education is a fundamental right) and the 
scheme 
framed 
thereunder 
require 
reconsideration/modification and if yes, what? 

A. 
The scheme framed by this Court in Unni Krishnan 
case [(1993) 1 SCC 645] and the direction to impose the 
same, except where it holds that primary education is a 
fundamental right, is unconstitutional. However, the 
principle that there should not be capitation fee or 
profiteering is correct. Reasonable surplus to meet cost of 
expansion and augmentation of facilities does not, however, 
amount to profiteering. 

(Emphasis supplied) 
The takeaway from T. M. A. Pai (supra) 

63. What, then, is the takeaway from T. M. A. Pai (supra)? 

64. Though it may tantamount to holding a candle to the sun, one may, 

with profound respect, identify the following propositions, as clearly 

emerging from the pronouncement in T. M. A. Pai (supra): 

(i) 
All rights, constitutionally available, under Article 26(a), to 

non-minority unaided educational institutions, are equally available 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 73 of 173 

to unaided minority educational institutions. In addition, they are 

entitled to the further protection of Article 30(1) thereof. 

(ii) The Constitution guarantees, to every citizen, the 

fundamental right to set up and administer educational institutions. 

The essence of every private educational institution was the 

autonomy enjoyed by the institution in its management and 

administration. Bureaucratic or governmental interference in the 

administration of such an institution would undermine its 

independence. "Administration" meant "management of the affairs 

of the institution". 

(iii) This right could be regulated by the Government. Such 

regulation had, however, to be with a view to ensure the 

maintenance of proper academic standards, atmosphere and 

infrastructure (including qualified staff), and prevention of 

maladministration, and to ensure excellence in education. Such 

regulations could, for instance, govern the quality of teachers, by 

prescribing minimum qualifications required to be possessed by 

them, the courses and curricula of study, and the existence of 

infrastructure sufficient for the growth of the institution. The 

conditions had to pertain to academic and educational matters, and 

to the welfare of students and teachers, and could not govern the 

manner in which the institution was to be run, which was a matter 

of administration, to be ensured by the management of the 

institution. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 74 of 173 

(iv) For proper imparting of education, qualified and experienced 

teachers, as also proper facilities and equipment, were essential. 

These required capital investment. Private unaided educational 

institutions, therefore, had a choice in the matter of selection of 

students and fixation of fees, which could not be taken away. 

Conditions could, no doubt, be attached, to grant of affiliation or 

recognition; such conditions could not, however, be destructive of 

the institutional autonomy of the institution. For this reason, the 

"scheme", framed in J. P. Unnikrishnan (supra), which governed 

grant of admission and fixation of fee, was termed to be without 

authority of law. Any restriction which fixed a rigid fee structure, 

was, therefore, unacceptable. 

(v) The right to set up a reasonable fee structure was one of the 

rights which comprised the right to establish and administer the 

institution. The essential ingredients of the management of a 

private educational institution included the quantum of fee to be 

charged by it. An institution, which chose not to seek aid from the 

Government, was entitled to determine the scale of fee to be 

charged from its students. 

(vi) Profiteering, and charging of capitation fee, was, however, 

not permissible, and the Government was within its right to 

introduce regulations to the said effect. Education was essentially 

a charitable function, and the purpose thereof could not be the 

making of profit. It was not permissible for the institution to 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 75 of 173 

charge such a fee, as was not required for the purpose of fulfilling 

the said object. 

(vii) There had necessarily to be a difference in the 

administration, and regulation, of government-aided institutions 

and private unaided institutions. 

(viii) Maintenance of a reasonable revenue surplus, which was 

required for the purpose of development of education and 

expansion of the institution would, however, not amount to 

profiteering. 

(ix) In addition to the rights available under Article 26(a), 

linguistic and regional minority educational institutions were also 

entitled to the protection of Article 30(1) of the Constitution, which 

clothed them with an independent right to, inter alia, establish and 

administer educational institutions. 

(x) Any law, or executive direction, which sought to infringe the 

substance of the right of minorities, to establish and administer 

educational institutions of their choice, would, to that extent, be 

void. 

(xi) Unlike Article 26(a), Article 30(1) did not specifically state 

that the right guaranteed thereunder was subject to public order, 

morality or health. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 76 of 173 

(xii) The right could not, however, be regarded as completely 

unbridled. It was open to the State to impose regulations upon the 

exercise of the said right provided the regulations were made in the 

true interests of efficiency of instruction, discipline, health, 

sanitation, morality, public order, and the like. Regulations, which 

remained confined within these parameters, were not restrictions 

on the substance of the guaranteed right, but secured the proper 

function of the institution, in matters educational. The institution 

was also required to follow statutory measures regulating 

educational standards and efficiency, prescribed courses of study, 

courses of instruction, principles regarding qualification of 

teachers, educational qualifications for entry of students into the 

institution, and the like. Minority institutions could not claim 

immunity against general laws, such as laws relating to law and 

order, health, hygiene, labour relations, social welfare legislations, 

contract, tort, etc., which were applicable to all communities. So 

long as the basic right of minorities to manage educational 

institutions was not taken away, the state was competent to make 

regulatory legislation. 

(xiii) The "administration" of the minority institution had, 

however, necessarily to be free of control, so that the management 

of the institution could mould the institution as it thought fit, in 

accordance with their ideas of how the interests of the community 

in general, and of the institution in particular, would be best 

served. No part of this administration could be taken away and 

vested in another body without encroachment on the guaranteed 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 77 of 173 

right. The regulations, framed by the Government, in respect of 

minority institutions, could neither impinge on their minority 

character, nor be such as to render the right to establish and 

administer the institution, illusory. Neither could they place 

educational institutions run by minorities at a disadvantage, when 

compared to institutions run by others. At the same time, reverse 

discrimination, in favour of minorities vis-à-vis others, was also 

not permissible. 

(xiv) Like any other private unaided institution, unaided 

educational institutions administered by linguistic or religious 

minorities were assured maximum autonomy in relation thereto, as, 

for example, in the matter of method of recruitment of teachers, 

charging of fees and admission of students. They would, however, 

have to comply with the conditions of recognition which could not 

be permitted to whittle down the right available under Article 30 of 

the Constitution of India. 

Islamic Academy of Education v. State of Karnataka, (2003) 6 SCC 697 
(rendered, on 14 th August, 2003, by a bench of 5 Hon'ble Judges) 

65. This Bench came to be constituted only because the Union of 

India, various State Governments, and educational institutions, chose to 

interpret the judgment in T. M. A. Pai (supra) in different ways, each to 

suit its own intended objective. The following note of anguish, as 

contained in the concurring opinion of S. B. Sinha, J., to be found in 

paragraph 221 of the report, is significant: 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 78 of 173 

"It is unfortunate that a Constitution Bench had to be 
constituted for interpreting an eleven-Judge Bench judgment. 
Probably, in judicial history of India, this has been done for 
the first time. It is equally unfortunate that all of us cannot 
agree on all the points, despite the fact that the matter 
involves construction of a judgment. In the name of 
interpretation we have to some extent, however little it may 
be rewritten the judgment. We have laid down new laws and 
issued directions purported to be in terms of Article 142 of 
the Constitution. We have interpreted T.M.A. Pai [(2002) 8 
SCC 481] , but we have also made endeavours to give effect 
to it. In some areas it was possible, in some other, it was 
not." 

Sinha, J., was, therefore, apparently not in entire agreement with the 

wisdom of the exercise which they had to undertake in Islamic Academy 

of Education (supra), or even of the permissibility thereof, in law. Be 

that as it may, this Court is bound by the view of the majority in the said 

decision, as authored by V. N. Khare, J., the then Hon'ble Chief Justice. 

66. The submission, of the petitioners before the Supreme Court in 

Islamic Academy of Education (supra), who were educational 

institutions, both minority and non-minority, was that the answers to the 

questions, set out at the conclusion of the majority judgment in T. M. A. 

Pai (supra), represented the entire judgment, in a microcosm, as it were, 

and that it was not necessary, therefore, to look outside the said questions, 

or the answers as postulated thereto, in order to understand the majority 

judgment. This submission was rejected, outright, in the following words 

(in paragraph 2 of the report): 

"On behalf of the petitioners/applicants it was submitted that 
the answers given to the questions, as set out at the end of 
the majority judgment, lay down the true ratio of the 
judgment. It was submitted that any observation made in the 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 79 of 173 

body of the judgment had to be read in the context of the 
answers given. We are unable to accept this submission. The 
answers to the questions, in the majority judgment in Pai 
case [(2002) 8 SCC 481] are merely a brief summation of 
the ratio laid down in the judgment. The ratio decidendi of a 
judgment has to be found out only on reading the entire 
judgment. In fact, the ratio of the judgment is what is set out 
in the judgment itself. The answer to the question would 
necessarily have to be read in the context of what is set out 
in the judgment and not in isolation. In case of any doubt as 
regards any observations, reasons and principles, the other 
part of the judgment has to be looked into. By reading a line 
here and there from the judgment, one cannot find out the 
entire ratio decidendi of the judgment. We, therefore, while 
giving our clarifications, are disposed to look into other parts 
of the judgment other than those portions which may be 
relied upon." 

67. On merits, the submission, of the petitioners before the Supreme 

Court in Islamic Academy of Education (supra), was that private 

unaided educational institutions had complete autonomy, even as regards 

the determination of their fee structure, which could include a reasonable 

revenue surplus for the purposes of development of education and 

expansion of the institution, and that the only restraint, thereon, was to 

the extent that profiteering and capitation fee were not permitted. As 

against this, the Union of India contended that States and universities had 

the statutory right to fix the fees and to regulate admission of students, in 

order to ensure that there was no profiteering, capitation fees were not 

charged, admissions were based on merit, and persons from backward 

classes and poorer sections had an opportunity to receive education. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 80 of 173 

68. As in T. M. A. Pai (supra), the Constitution bench, Islamic 

Academy of Education (supra), also chose to delineate the issues arising 

before it, for consideration. Four specific issues were framed, of which 

the first two, alone, are of any significance, insofar as the present 

controversy is concerned. They read thus: 

"(1) whether educational institutions are entitled to fix 
their own fee structure; 

(2) whether minority and non-minority educational 
institutions stand on the same footing and have the same 
rights." 

69. The answer to Issue (1), as thus framed by the Supreme Court, was 

provided, by it, in paragraph 7 of the report. While the latter part of the 

said paragraph recommended the setting up of Committees to examine 

the fee structures of educational institutions, the following words, from 

the said paragraph, are relevant: 

"So far as the first question is concerned, in our view the 
majority judgment is very clear. There can be no fixing of a 
rigid fee structure by the Government. Each institute must 
have the freedom to fix its own fee structure taking into 
consideration the need to generate funds to run the 
institution and to provide facilities necessary for the benefit 
of the students. They must also be able to generate surplus 
which must be used for the betterment and growth of that 
educational institution. In paragraph 56 of the judgment it 
has been categorically laid down that the decision on the fees 
to be charged must necessarily be left to the private 
educational institutions that do not seek and which are not 
dependent upon any funds from the Government. Each 
institute will be entitled to have its own fee structure. The 
fee structure for each institute must be fixed keeping in mind 
the infrastructure and facilities available, the investments 
made, salaries paid to the teachers and staff, future plans for 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 81 of 173 

expansion and/or betterment of the institution etc. Of course 
there can be no profiteering and capitation fees cannot be 
charged. It thus needs to be emphasized that as per the 
majority judgment imparting of education is essentially 
charitable in nature. Thus the surplus/profit that can be 
generated must be only for the benefit/use of that educational 
institution. Profits/surplus cannot be diverted for any other 
use or purpose and cannot be used for personal gain or for 
any other business or enterprise." 
(Underscoring supplied) 

70. Issue (2), as framed by the Supreme Court, was also answered, by 

it, in the negative, thus (in paragraph 9 of the report): 

"Undoubtedly, at first blush it does appear that these 
paragraphs equate both types of educational institutions. 
However, on a careful reading of these paragraphs it is 
evident that the essence of what has been laid down is that 
the minority educational institutions have a guarantee or 
assurance to establish and administer educational 
institutions of their choice. These paragraphs merely provide 
that laws, rules and regulations cannot be such that they 
favour majority institutions over minority institutions. We do 
not read these paragraphs to mean that non-minority 
educational institutions would have the same rights as those 
conferred on minority educational institutions by Article 30 
of the Constitution of India. Non-minority educational 
institutions do not have the protection of Article 30. Thus, in 
certain matters they cannot and do not stand on a similar 
footing as minority educational institutions. Even though the 
principle behind Article 30 is to ensure that the minorities 
are protected and are given an equal treatment yet the special 
right given under Article 30 does give them certain 
advantages."

The takeaway from Islamic Academy (supra) 

71. The following propositions emerge from Islamic Academy 

(supra): 

(i) 
No rigid fee structure could be fixed, by the Government, in 

respect of unaided educational institutions. Each institute must 

have the freedom to fix its own fee structure taking into 

consideration the need to generate funds to run the institution and 

to provide facilities necessary for the benefit of the students. 

(ii) Unaided educational institutions were also permitted to 

generate a reasonable surplus, which had to be utilised towards 

advancement of the institution and betterment of the students, and 

diversion thereof was not allowed. 

(iii) Discretion, regarding the quantum of fees to be charged, had 

to be left to the unaided educational institution concerned. This was 

required to be exercised, keeping in mind the infrastructure and 

facilities available, the investments made, salaries paid to the 

teachers and staff, future plans for expansion and/or betterment of 

the institution etc. 

(i) 
Profiteering, or charging of capitation fees, was, however, 

completely prohibited. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 83 of 173 

(ii) "The protection of Article 30" was uniquely available only 

to minority educational institutions, and was not available to non-

minority educational institutions, unaided or otherwise. 

Modern School v U.O.I., (2004) 5 SCC 583, rendered by a bench of 3 
Hon'ble Judges on 27 th April, 2004 

72. This judgment, or, more particularly, paragraph 27 thereof, 

constitutes the sheet-anchor to employ a time-worn cliché of the 

respondents' case. 

73. Modern School (supra), as already noted hereinabove, was an 

appeal from Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-I (supra). 

74. The constitution of the bench which decided Modern School 

(supra) is significant, constituting, as it did, of V. N. Khare, the Hon'ble 

Chief Justice, S. B. Sinha, J. and S. H. Kapadia, J. (as he then was). The 

judgment was authored by Kapadia, J., for himself and Khare, C. J., with 

Sinha, J., penning a dissent. This is significant because Khare, C. J., was 

also part of the bench which decided T. M. A. Pai (supra) and Islamic 

Academy of Education (supra) and was, in fact, the author of the 

majority judgment in Islamic Academy (supra). It would be reasonable, 

therefore, to presume that Modern School (supra) could not be 

interpreted as breaking away from the legal position as enunciated in T. 

M. A. Pai (supra) and Islamic Academy (supra). The attempt has, at all 

times, therefore, to be to harmonize these decisions, and read them as a 

cohesive whole, representing the law on the issue. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 84 of 173 

75. 
The Supreme Court, in this case, framed the following questions, 

as arising for its consideration: 

"(1) Whether the Director of Education has the authority to 
regulate the quantum of fees charged by unaided schools 
under Section 17(3) of the Delhi School Education Act, 
1973? 

(2) Whether the direction issued on 15-12-1999 by the 
Director of Education under Section 24(3) of the Act 
stating inter alia that no fees/funds collected from 
parents/students shall be transferred from the Recognised 
Unaided School Fund to the society or trust or any other 
institution, is in conflict with Rule 177 of the Delhi School 
Education Rules, 1973 ("The Rules")? 

(3) Whether managements of recognised unaided schools 
are entitled to set up a Development Fund Account under the 
provisions of the Delhi School Education Act, 1973?" 

76. Of these, only Issue (a) concerns the present controversy. 

77. The Supreme Court distilled the judgment of this Court in Delhi 

Abhibhavak Mahasangh-I (supra) thus (in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the 

report): 

"7. Delhi Abibhavak Mahasangh, a federation of parents' 
association moved the Delhi High Court by Writ Petition 
No. 3723 of 1997 challenging the fee hike in various schools 
in Delhi. It was a public interest writ petition filed on 8-9-
1997 impleading thirty unaided recognised public schools. 
The grievance of the Mahasangh was that recognised private 
unaided schools in Delhi are indulging in large-scale 
commercialisation of education which was against public 
interest. That commercialisation has reached an alarming 
situation on account of failure of the Government to perform 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 85 of 173 

its statutory functions under the Delhi School Education Act, 
1973 (hereinafter for the sake of brevity referred to as "the 
Act"). One of the serious charges in the writ petition against 
the said unaided recognised schools was transfer of funds by 
the said schools to the society/trust and/or to other schools 
run by the same society/trust. In this connection, it was 
alleged that there was excess of income over expenditure 
under the head "Tuition fee" and further interest-free loans 
of huge amount have been taken from parents for giving 
admissions to the children. It was also alleged that huge 
amounts collected remained unspent under the head 
"Building fund". On the other hand, before the High Court, 
it was submitted on behalf of the schools that the above 
increase in fees, annual charges, admission fees and security 
deposit was justified on account of increase in the expenses 
and in particular, salaries of teachers in compliance with 
recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission. 

8. 
The key issue before the High Court, therefore, was 
whether unaided recognised schools were indulging in 
commercialisation of education. The High Court found from 
the reports submitted by the inspection teams appointed by 
the Government that there were irregularities in the 
management of the accounts. Therefore, by the impugned 
judgment, directions were given regarding utilisation of 
tuition fees for payment of salaries of teachers and 
employees and also for utilisation of the surplus under the 
specific head of tuition fees. By the impugned judgment, the 
High Court declared that the said Act and the Rules framed 
thereunder prohibited transfer of funds from the schools to 
the society/trust or to other schools run by the same 
society/trust. By the impugned judgment, the High Court 
appointed a committee headed by Ms Justice Santosh 
Duggal (hereinafter referred to as "the Duggal Committee") 
to examine the economics of each of the recognised unaided 
schools in Delhi. Being aggrieved, the unaided recognised 
schools and the Action Committee of Unaided Private 
Schools have come by way of appeal to this Court. During 
the pendency of the civil appeals, the Duggal Committee 
submitted its report which has been accepted by the 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 86 of 173 

Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi 
(Directorate of Education), consequent upon which the 
Director of Education has issued directions to the Managing 
Committees of all recognised unaided schools in Delhi under 
Section 24(3) read with Sections 18(4) and (5) of the Act, 
which directions are the subject-matter of the civil appeals 
herein." 

The dispute which engaged this Court in Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh 

(supra) -and, consequently, the Supreme Court in Modern School 

(supra) -was whether schools were indulging in "commercialisation of 

education" by charging fees which were excessive and disproportionate 

in comparison to their requirement, and whether, therefore, the DoE had 

acted within, or in excess of, the jurisdiction vested in it, by issuing 

directives to control the same. 

78. The appellant, before the Supreme Court, is a well known private 

unaided recognized school. It sought to fault the judgment, of this Court 

in Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-I (supra), and the contention 

advanced, in this regard, stands precisely distilled, in paragraph 12 of the 

report, thus: 

"It was urged on behalf of the management that in the 
impugned judgment the High Court had erred in holding that 
tuition fees should be ordinarily utilised for payment of 
salaries and if incidental surplus remained, it could be used 
for other educational purposes but that would not empower 
the management to levy higher tuition fees. It was submitted 
on behalf of the management that the Government has no 
authority to regulate the fees payable by the students of 
unaided schools as indicated by Section 17(3) of the Act 
which required the management only to submit to the 
Director a full statement of fees leviable during the ensuing 
academic session. In this connection, Section 17(3) was 
contrasted with Section 17(1) and Section 17(2) of the Act, 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 87 of 173 

which empower the Government to regulate the fees payable 
by the students of aided schools." 

79. "The first point for determination", says the judgment in paragraph 

13, "is whether the Director of Education has the authority to regulate the 

fees of unaided schools". Having thus got, straightaway as it were, to the 

meat of the matter, the judgment proceeds, in paragraph 14, to hold thus: 

"At the outset, before analysing the provisions of the 1973 
Act, we may state that it is now settled by a catena of 
decisions of this Court that in the matter of determination of 
the fee structure unaided educational institutions exercise a 
great autonomy as they, like any other citizen carrying on an 
occupation, are entitled to a reasonable surplus for 
development of education and expansion of the institution. 
Such institutions, it has been held, have to plan their 
investment and expenditure so as to generate profit. What is, 
however, prohibited is commercialisation of education. 
Hence, we have to strike a balance between autonomy of 
such institutions and measures to be taken to prevent 
commercialisation of education. However, in none of the 
earlier cases, this Court has defined the concept of 
reasonable surplus, profit, income and yield, which are the 
terms used in the various provisions of the 1973 Act." 

(Emphasis supplied) 

The emphasis, in these opening words of the Supreme Court, on 

"commercialisation of education", is of paramount significance. The 

balance that is required to be struck -as postulated in the above-extracted 

passage -is not between the autonomy of the institutions and the power 

of the DoE to regulate, but between the autonomy of the institutions and 

measures to be taken to prevent commercialization of education. In so 

holding, Modern School (supra) reiterates what T. M. A. Pai (supra) so 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 88 of 173 

painstakingly clarified -viz., that the regulatory power of the DoE was to 

be directed at preventing commercialization of education. It was not, 

therefore, a regulatory power to be exercised in such a manner as to take 

over the autonomy of the schools in the matter of fixation of their fees, or 

even appropriation of their financial resources. Paragraph 15 of the 

report, in fact, goes on to note that, in T. M. A. Pai (supra), the Supreme 

Court "observed … that the right to establish and administer an institution 

included the right to admit students; right to set up a reasonable fee 

structure; right to constitute a governing body, right to appoint staff and 

right to take disciplinary action." 

80. What falls for consideration is, therefore, the extent to which, given 

the right of the unaided educational institution to "set up a reasonable fee 

structure", and, for the said purpose, to fix its fees, the DoE could 

exercise its regulatory jurisdiction, and the point at which the exercise of 

such jurisdiction overstepped its legitimate boundaries and transgressed 

into the domain of the discretion vested in the institution. 

81. In this context, paragraph 15 of the report goes on to note thus: 

"However, the right to establish an institution under Article 
19(1)(g) is subject to reasonable restriction in terms of clause 
(6) thereof. Similarly, the right conferred on minorities, 
religious or linguistic, to establish and administer 
educational institution of their own choice under Article 
30(1) is held to be subject to reasonable regulations 
which inter alia may be framed having regard to public 
interest and national interest. In the said judgment, it was 
observed (vide paragraph 56) that economic forces have a 
role to play in the matter of fee fixation. The institutions 
should be permitted to make reasonable profits after 
providing for investment and expenditure. However, 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 89 of 173 

capitation fee and profiteering were held to be forbidden. 
Subject to the above two prohibitory parameters, this Court 
in T.M.A. Pai Foundation case [(2002) 8 SCC 481] held that 
fees to be charged by the unaided educational institutions 
cannot be regulated. Therefore, the issue before us is as to 
what constitutes reasonable surplus in the context of the 
provisions of the 1973 Act." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

The above extracted passage clarifies two important aspects, which have 

necessarily to be borne in mind while appreciating the judgment in 

Modern School (supra), viz. that (i) the position, in law, emanating from 

T. M. A. Pai (supra), that private unaided educational institutions should 

be permitted reasonable profits after providing for investment and 

expenditure, subject to a proscription against charging of capitation fee 

and profiteering, was noted and, needless to say, approved, and (ii) the 

issue, with which the Supreme Court engaged itself, was "as to what 

constitutes reasonable surplus", in the context of the DSE Act. 

82. Proceeding, thereafter, to deal with the judgment in Islamic 

Academy (supra) in the light of the provisions of the DSE Act and the 

DSE Rules, the Supreme Court held, in paragraph 17 of the report, thus: 

"Therefore, reading Section 18(4) with Rules 172, 173, 174, 
175 and 177 on one hand and Section 17(3) on the other 
hand, it is clear that under the Act, the Director is authorised 
to regulate the fees and other charges to prevent 
commercialisation of education. Under Section 17(3), the 
school has to furnish a full statement of fees in advance 
before the commencement of the academic session. Reading 
Section 17(3) with Sections 18(3) and (4) of the Act and the 
Rules quoted above, it is clear that the Director has the 
authority to regulate the fees under Section 17(3) of the 
Act." 
(Emphasis supplied) 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 90 of 173 

Here, again, the Supreme Court is at pains to emphasize that the authority 

of the DoE, to regulate fees and other charges, is "to prevent 

commercialisation of education". "Commercialisation of education", and 

the necessity of preventing it at all costs, for which regulatory power 

vests in the DoE, therefore, runs as the constant undercurrent behind the 

surface of the DSE Act and the DSE Rules, and the rights and powers 

conferred on various entities thereby and thereunder. It is also significant 

that the Supreme Court localizes this regulatory power and authority, of 

the DoE, to Section 17(3) of the DSE Act. The parameters and 

peripheries of Section 17(3) must, therefore, necessarily inform any 

examination of the balance of powers conferred by the said provision. 

83. Paragraphs 18 to 26 of the report, thereafter, go on to discuss the 

second and third issues framed by the Supreme Court, as extracted 

hereinabove. Inasmuch as these issues do not concern the controversy in 

the present petition, these paragraphs need not detain us. 

84. Then follows the "Conclusion", as set out in paragraph 27 of the 

judgment, which constitutes the essential basis of the submissions of Mr. 

Ramesh Singh, and would, as he would seek to contend, provide sublime 

justification for all subsequent actions of the DoE, including the issuance 

of the impugned order dated 13 th April, 2018. The said paragraph reads 

thus: 

"27. In addition to the directions given by the Director of 
Education vide Order No. DE.15/Act/Duggal.Com/203/99/ 
23989-24938 dated 15-12-1999, we give further directions 
as mentioned hereinbelow: 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 91 of 173 

(a) Every recognised unaided school covered by 
the Act shall maintain the accounts on the principles 
of 
accounting 
applicable 
to 
non-business 
organisation/not-for-profit organisation. 

In this connection, we inter alia direct every 
such school to prepare their financial statement 
consisting of the balance sheet, profit-and-loss 
account, and receipt-and-payment account. 

(b) Every school is required to file a statement of 
fees every year before the ensuing academic session 
under Section 17(3) of the said Act with the Director. 
Such statement will indicate estimated income of the 
school derived from fees, estimated current 
operational expenses towards salaries and allowances 
payable to employees in terms of Rule 177(1). Such 
estimate will also indicate provision for donation, 
gratuity, reserve fund and other items under Rule 
177(2) and savings thereafter, if any, in terms of the 
proviso to Rule 177(1). 

(c) It shall be the duty of the Director of Education 
to ascertain whether terms of allotment of land by the 
Government to the schools have been complied with. 
We are shown a sample letter of allotment issued by 
the Delhi Development Authority issued to some of 
the schools which are recognised unaided schools. We 
reproduce herein clauses 16 and 17 of the sample 
letter of allotment: 

"16. The school shall not increase the rates of 
tuition fee without the prior sanction of the 
Directorate of Education, Delhi Administration 
and shall follow the provisions of the Delhi 
School Education Act/Rules, 1973 and other 
instructions issued from time to time. 

17. The Delhi Public School Society shall 
ensure that percentage of freeship from the 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 92 of 173 

tuition fee, as laid down under the rules by the 
Delhi Administration, is from time to time 
strictly complied with. They will ensure 
admission to the student belonging to weaker 
sections to the extent of 25% and grant freeship 
to them." 

28. We are directing the Director of Education to look 
into letters of allotment issued by the Government and 
ascertain whether they have been complied with by the 
schools. This exercise shall be complied with within a period 
of three months from the date of communication of this 
judgment to the Director of Education. If in a given case, the 
Director finds non-compliance with the above terms, the 
Director shall take appropriate steps in this regard." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

85. The above extracted paragraphs 27 and 28 of the report direct the 

DoE to ascertain whether the terms of allotment of land by the 

Government to the schools have been complied with, and to look into the 

letters of allotment for the said purpose. Among the conditions of 

allotment, as extracted verbatim by the Supreme Court, is the proscription 

on increasing the rates of tuition fee without the prior sanction of the 

DoE. 

86. A holistic and conjoint reading of the above directions, with the 

earlier decision in T. M. A. Pai (supra), would make it clear that the 

Supreme Court could not have intended the implementation of its 

directions to have been undertaken either de hors the provisions of the 

DSE Act and the DSE Rules, or in the teeth of the Pai pronouncement. 

T. M. A. Pai (supra) conferred complete autonomy, on private unaided 

schools, in the matter of fixation of their fees. The only limitation -if 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 93 of 173 

one may call it that -to the sweep of this right is in the stipulation that 

the fees fixed should not be in the form of capitation, or amount to 

profiteering. Absent these interdictions, it is clearly not open to the DoE 

to entrench on the territory of the schools, insofar as the matter of fixation 

of their fees is concerned. 

87. The emphasis, by the Supreme Court, in paragraph 27 of the 

Modern School judgment, on compliance with the provisions of the DSE 

Act and the DSE Rules, makes it clear that the Supreme Court intended 

compliance, with its directions, to be in tandem with the provisions 

thereof, and not blind thereto. How, then, is that possible, if at all? The 

answer, quite obviously, is that, if the provisions of the DSE Act and/or 

the DSE Rules contain anything which harmonizes with paragraphs 16 

and 17 of the terms of allotment of the land, those provisions have to be 

borne in mind while examining whether compliance, with the "land 

clause", has, or has not, taken place. 

88. The submission of Mr. Sunil Gupta, learned Senior Counsel 

appearing for the petitioner, is that such harmonization is possible only if 

the requirement of "prior approval", contemplated by Clause 16 of the 

terms of allotment of the land, is dovetailed into Section 17(3) of the DSE 

Act. Thus viewed, Mr Gupta would submit, the directions issued by the 

Supreme Court required the schools to furnish their statement of fee, to 

the DoE, before the commencement of the academic session, and the DoE 

to examine the same and take a decision thereon before such 

commencement. The directions contained in Modern School (supra), 

Mr. Gupta would exhort us to hold, do not afford a carte blanche to the 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 94 of 173 

DoE to sit, as it were, over the statement of fees submitted by the schools, 

thereby preventing them from increasing their fees, and, as a result, 

trespassing on their right to establish and administer the schools, as 

guaranteed by Article 26(a) of the Constitution of India. Mr. Gupta 

would also emphasize, repeatedly, the position -which, he submits, is 

practically gilt-edged -that, so long as the schools do not charge 

capitation fee, and do not indulge in profiteering, their decision, qua the 

fees to be charged by them, cannot brook interference at the hands of any 

governmental authority, including the DoE. 

The takeaway from Modern School (supra) 

From Modern School (supra), the following propositions emerge: 

(i) 
The issue for consideration, before the Supreme Court, was 

whether schools were indulging in "commercialisation of 

education", by charging excessive and disproportionate fees 

and whether, therefore, the DoE had acted within its 

jurisdiction in issuing directives to control the same. 

(ii) Unaided educational institutions enjoyed greater autonomy, 

in the matter of determination fee structure, and were also 

entitled to a reasonable surplus for development of education 

and expansion of the institution. Such institutions are to be 

allowed to plan their investment and expenditure, so as to 

generate profit. Reasonable profit, after providing for 

investment and expenditure, was permissible 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 95 of 173 

(iii) In the garb thereof, however, these institutions could not be 

permitted to engage or indulge in "commercialisation of 

education". Charging of capitation fees, and profiteering, 

could not be allowed. The Government was, therefore, 

justified in taking measures to prevent this malady. 

(iv) A balance, therefore, was required to be struck between 

autonomy of the institutions and measures to be taken to 

prevent commercialisation of education. The prevalent 

undercurrent of the discussion and conclusion, in Modern 

School (supra) was, therefore, that "commercialisation of 

education" had, at all costs, to be prevented. It is this 

"commercialisation of education" which, according to the 

Supreme Court, had to be curbed, and for the curbing 

whereof, regulatory measures could legitimately be put in 

place by the Government. These regulatory measures have, 

however, to operate, and be operated, within the parameters 

and peripheries of Section 17(3) of the DSE Act. 

(v) These regulatory measures could not, however, be permitted 

to trespass on the autonomy of the unaided educational 

institutions, or take it over, in the matter of fixation of fees, 

or even appropriation of financial resources. The right to set 

up a reasonable fee structure, therefore, transcendentally 

remained with the unaided educational institution concerned. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 96 of 173 

(vi) The right to establish and administer minority educational 

institutions, while independently conferred, on such 

institutions, by Article 30(1) of the Constitution, was subject 

to reasonable regulations, in public and national interest. 

(vii) Subject to the prohibitory parameters, regarding charging of 

capitation fee and profiteering, fees chargeable by unaided 

educational institutions could not be regulated. 

(viii) The "issue before it", as encapsulated by the Supreme Court, 

was "as to what constitutes reasonable surplus in the context 

of the provisions of the 1973 Act". 

(ix) Among the directions, issued to the DoE at the conclusion of 

the judgment, was the direction to "ascertain whether terms 

of allotment of land by the Government to the schools have 

been complied with, by the schools". In the event of non-

compliance being detected, the DoE was directed to take 

"appropriate steps in that regard". 

P. A. Inamdar v. State of Maharashtra, (2005) 6 SCC 537 [rendered, on 
12 th August, 2005, by a bench of 7 Hon'ble judges] 

89. This Bench was constituted, essentially, to iron out the creases in 

the Pai fabric, which, according to the appellants before the Supreme 

Court, had been created by Islamic Academy (supra). Paragraphs 2 to 4 

of the judgment, as authored by R. C. Lahoti, C. J., encapsulate, tellingly 

the brief, before the Supreme Court, thus: 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 97 of 173 

"2. A coram of 11 Judges, not a common feature in the 
Supreme Court of India, sat to hear and decide T.M.A. Pai 
Foundation v. State of Karnataka [(2002) 8 SCC 481] 
(hereinafter "Pai Foundation" [(2002) 8 SCC 481] for 
short). It was expected that the authoritative pronouncement 
by a Bench of such strength on the issues arising before it 
would draw a final curtain on those controversies. The 
subsequent events tell a different story. A learned 
academician observes that the eleven-Judge Bench decision 
in Pai Foundation is a partial response to some of the 
challenges posed by the impact of liberalisation, 
privatisation and globalisation (LPG); but the question 
whether that is a satisfactory response, is indeed debatable. It 
was further pointed out that "the decision raises more 
questions than it has answered". (See Annual Survey of 
Indian Law, 2002 at pp. 251, 254.) The survey goes on to 
observe "the principles laid down by the majority in Pai 
Foundation are so broadly formulated that they provide 
sufficient leeway to subsequent courts in applying those 
principles while the lack of clarity in the judgment allows 
judicial creativity …" (ibid. at p. 256). 

3. 
The prophecy has come true and while the ink on the 
opinions in Pai Foundation was yet to dry, the High Courts 
were flooded with writ petitions, calling for settlements of 
several issues which were not yet resolved or which cropped 
up post Pai Foundation . A number of special leave 
petitions against interim orders passed by the High Courts 
and a few writ petitions came to be filed directly in this 
Court. A Constitution Bench sat to interpret the eleven-
Judge Bench decision in Pai Foundation which it did vide 
its judgment dated 14-8-2003 in Islamic Academy of 
Education v. State of Karnataka [(2003) 6 SCC 697] 
("Islamic Academy" for short). The 11 learned Judges 
constituting the Bench in Pai Foundation delivered five 
opinions. The majority opinion on behalf of six Judges was 
delivered by B.N. Kirpal, C.J. Khare, J. (as His Lordship 
then was) delivered a separate but concurring opinion, 
supporting the majority. Quadri, J., Ruma Pal, J. and 
Variava, J. (for himself and Bhan, J.) delivered three 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 98 of 173 

separate 
opinions 
partly 
dissenting 
from 
the 
majority. Islamic Academy too handed down two opinions. 
The majority opinion for four learned Judges was delivered 
by V.N. Khare, C.J. S.B. Sinha, J., delivered a separate 
opinion. 

4. 
The events following Islamic Academy judgment 
show that some of the main questions have remained 
unsettled even after the exercise undertaken by the 
Constitution Bench in Islamic Academy in clarification of 
the eleven-Judge Bench decision in Pai Foundation. A few 
of those unsettled questions as also some aspects of 
clarification are before us calling for settlement by this 
Bench of seven Judges which we hopefully propose to do." 

90. The Supreme Court delineated, thereafter, the duty cast on it, in 

paragraph 20 of the report, thus: 

"... At the very outset, we may state that our task is not to 
pronounce our own independent opinion on the several 
issues which arose for consideration in Pai Foundation. 
Even if we are inclined to disagree with any of the findings 
amounting to declaration of law by the majority in Pai 
Foundation we cannot; that being a pronouncement by an 
eleven-Judge Bench, we are bound by it. We cannot express 
dissent or disagreement howsoever we may be inclined to do 
so on any of the issues. The real task before us is to cull out 
the ratio decidendi of Pai Foundation and to examine if the 
explanation or clarification given in Islamic Academy runs 
counter to Pai Foundation and if so, to what extent. If we 
find anything said or held in Islamic Academy in conflict 
with Pai Foundation we shall say so as being a departure 
from the law laid down by Pai Foundation and on the 
principle of binding efficacy of precedents, overrule to that 
extent the opinion of the Constitution Bench in Islamic 
Academy." 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 99 of 173 

91. The judgment goes on, in paragraph 26, to set out the three issues, 

arising before it, for consideration, of which the controversy before this 

Court pertains only to the third, i.e., "the fee structure". Paragraph 27 of 

the judgment proceeded to frame four issues, which arose for 

determination, before the Supreme Court. Of these, the third and the 

fourth issues alone are relevant for the purpose of the present controversy 

and may, therefore, be reproduced thus: 

"(3) Whether Islamic Academy could have issued 
guidelines in the matter of regulating the fee payable by the 
students to the educational institutions? 

(4) Can the admission procedure and fee structure be 
regulated or taken over by the committee ordered to be 
constituted by Islamic Academy?" 

92. Paragraphs 68 to 79 of the report, thereafter, proceed to record the 

rival submissions advanced before the Court. Reliance was placed, by 

Mr. Ramesh Singh, on paragraph 70 of the report; however, reference to 

the said paragraph may conveniently be eschewed, as it does not reflect 

the findings of the Supreme Court, but only records the submission made 

by learned Counsel before it. 

93. Paragraphs 91 to 93 of the report proceed, thereafter, to juxtapose 

Articles 19(1)(g) and 30(1) of the Constitution of India, thus: 

"91. The right to establish an educational institution, for 
charity or for profit, being an occupation, is protected by 
Article 19(1)(g). Notwithstanding the fact that the right of a 
minority to establish and administer an educational 
institution would be protected by Article 19(1)(g) yet the 
founding fathers of the Constitution felt the need of enacting 
Article 30. The reasons are too obvious to require 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 100 of 173 

elaboration. Article 30(1) is intended to instil confidence in 
minorities against any executive or legislative encroachment 
on their right to establish and administer educational 
institution of their choice. Article 30(1) though styled as a 
right, is more in the nature of protection for minorities. But 
for Article 30, an educational institution, even though based 
on religion or language, could have been controlled or 
regulated by law enacted under clause (6) of Article 19, and 
so, Article 30 was enacted as a guarantee to the minorities 
that so far as the religious or linguistic minorities are 
concerned, educational institutions of their choice will enjoy 
protection from such legislation. However, such institutions 
cannot be discriminated against by the State solely on 
account of their being minority institutions. The minorities 
being numerically less qua non-minorities, may not be able 
to protect their religion or language and such cultural values 
and their educational institutions will be protected under 
Article 30, at the stage of law-making. However, merely 
because Article 30(1) has been enacted, minority 
educational institutions do not become immune from the 
operation of regulatory measures because the right to 
administer does not include the right to maladminister. To 
what extent the State regulation can go, is the issue. The real 
purpose sought to be achieved by Article 30 is to give 
minorities some additional protection. Once aided, the 
autonomy conferred by the protection of Article 30(1) on the 
minority educational institution is diluted as provisions of 
Article 29(2) will be attracted. Certain conditions in the 
nature of regulations can legitimately accompany the State 
aid. 

92. As an occupation, right to impart education is a 
fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) and, therefore, 
subject to control by clause (6) of Article 19. This right is 
available to all citizens without drawing a distinction 
between minority and non-minority. Such a right is, 
generally speaking, subject to the laws imposing reasonable 
restrictions in the interest of the general public. In particular, 
laws may be enacted on the following subjects: (i) the 
professional or technical qualifications necessary for 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 101 of 173 

practising any profession or carrying on any occupation, 
trade or business; (ii) the carrying on by the State, or by a 
corporation owned or controlled by the State of any trade, 
business, industry or service whether to the exclusion, 
complete or partial of citizens or otherwise. Care is taken of 
minorities, religious or linguistic, by protecting their right to 
establish and administer educational institutions of their 
choice under Article 30. To some extent, what may be 
permissible by way of restriction under Article 19(6) may 
fall foul of Article 30. This is the additional protection which 
Article 30(1) grants to the minorities. 

93. The employment of expressions "right to establish and 
administer" and "educational institution of their choice" in 
Article 30(1) gives the right a very wide amplitude. 
Therefore, a minority educational institution has a right to 
admit students of its own choice, it can, as a matter of its 
own free will, admit students of non-minority community. 
However, non-minority students cannot be forced upon it. 
The only restriction on the free will of the minority 
educational institution admitting students belonging to a 
non-minority community is, as spelt out by Article 30 itself, 
that the manner and number of such admissions should not 
be violative of the minority character of the institution." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

94. Paragraph 94 of the judgment went on, nevertheless, to 

acknowledge the legal position, flowing from earlier pronouncements 

including Rev. Sidhajbhai Sabhai (supra) and Ahmedabad St Xaviers' 

College Society (supra) that grant of aid, and affiliation or recognition, 

could be made conditional on fulfilment of regulations, but that such 

regulations had to be (i) reasonable and rational, (ii) regulative of the 

essential character of the institution and conducive to making the 

institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community 

or other person who resort to it, (iii) directed towards maintaining 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 102 of 173 

excellence of education and efficiency of administration so as to prevent 

it from falling in standards. These tests, it was also noted, stood approved 

in T. M. A. Pai (supra). 

95. The Supreme Court went on to classify minority educational 

institutions into three categories, in paragraph 103 of the report, thus: 

"To establish an educational institution is a fundamental 
right. Several educational institutions have come up. 
In Kerala Education Bill [1959 SCR 995 : AIR 1958 SC 
956] "minority educational institutions" came to be 
classified into three categories, namely, (i) those which do 
not seek either aid or recognition from the State; (ii) those 
which want aid; and (iii) those which want only recognition 
but not aid. It was held that the first category protected by 
Article 30(1) can "exercise that right to their hearts' content" 
unhampered by restrictions. The second category is most 
significant. Most of the educational institutions would fall in 
that category as no educational institution can, in modern 
times, afford to subsist and efficiently function without some 
State aid. So it is with the third category. An educational 
institution may survive without aid but would still stand in 
need of recognition because in the absence of recognition, 
education imparted therein may not really serve the purpose 
as for want of recognition the students passing out from such 
educational institutions may not be entitled to admission in 
other educational institutions for higher studies and may also 
not be eligible for securing jobs. Once an educational 
institution is granted aid or aspires for recognition, the State 
may grant aid or recognition accompanied by certain 
restrictions or conditions which must be followed as 
essential to the grant of such aid or recognition. This Court 
clarified in Kerala Education Bill [1959 SCR 995: AIR 
1958 SC 956] that "the right to establish and administer 
educational institutions" conferred by Article 30(1) does not 
include the right to maladminister, and that is very obvious. 
Merely because an educational institution belongs to a 
minority it cannot ask for aid or recognition though running 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 103 of 173 

in unhealthy surroundings, without any competent teachers 
and which does not maintain even a fair standard of 
teaching or which teaches matters subversive to the welfare 
of the scholars. Therefore, the State may prescribe 
reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of the 
educational institutions to be granted aid or to be 
recognised. To wit, it is open to the State to lay down 
conditions for recognition such as, an institution must have a 
particular amount of funds or properties or number of 
students or standard of education and so on. The dividing 
line is that in the name of laying down conditions for aid or 
recognition the State cannot directly or indirectly defeat the 
very protection conferred by Article 30(1) on the minority to 
establish and administer educational institutions. Dealing 
with the third category of institutions, which seek only 
recognition but not aid, Their Lordships held that "the right 
to establish and administer educational institutions of their 
choice" must mean the right to establish real institutions 
which will effectively serve the needs of the community and 
scholars who resort to these educational institutions. The 
dividing line between how far the regulation would remain 
within the constitutional limits and when the regulations 
would cross the limits and be vulnerable is fine yet 
perceptible and has been demonstrated in several judicial 
pronouncements which can be cited as illustrations. They 
have been dealt with meticulous precision coupled with 
brevity by S.B. Sinha, J. in his opinion in Islamic 
Academy [(2003) 6 SCC 697]. The considerations for 
granting recognition to a minority educational institution 
and casting accompanying regulations would be similar as 
applicable to a non-minority institution subject to two 
overriding considerations: (i) the recognition is not denied 
solely on the ground of the educational institution being one 
belonging to minority, and (ii) the regulation is neither 
aimed at nor has the effect of depriving the institution of its 
minority status."

96. Apropos "minority unaided educational institutions asking for 

affiliation or recognition", it was further held, in Paragraphs 121 and 122 

of the report, thus: 

"121. Affiliation or recognition by the State or the Board or 
the university competent to do so, cannot be denied solely on 
the ground that the institution is a minority educational 
institution. However, the urge or need for affiliation or 
recognition brings in the concept of regulation by way of 
laying down conditions consistent with the requirement of 
ensuring merit, excellence of education and preventing 
maladministration. For example, provisions can be made 
indicating the quality of the teachers by prescribing the 
minimum qualifications that they must possess and the 
courses of studies and curricula. The existence of 
infrastructure sufficient for its growth can be stipulated as a 
prerequisite to the grant of recognition or affiliation. 
However, there cannot be interference in the day-to-day 
administration. The essential ingredients of the management, 
including admission of students, recruiting of staff and the 
quantum of fee to be charged, cannot be regulated. 
(Paragraph 55, Pai Foundation [(2002) 8 SCC 481] ) 

122. Apart from the generalised position of law that the 
right to administer does not include the right to 
maladminister, an additional source of power to regulate by 
enacting conditions accompanying affiliation or recognition 
exists. A balance has to be struck between the two 
objectives: (i) that of ensuring the standard of excellence of 
the institution, and (ii) that of preserving the right of the 
minority to establish and administer its educational 
institution. Subject to a reconciliation of the two objectives, 
any regulation accompanying affiliation or recognition must 
satisfy the triple tests: (i) the test of reasonableness and 
rationality, (ii) the test that the regulation would be 
conducive to making the institution an effective vehicle of 
education for the minority community or other persons who 
resort to it, and (iii) that there is no inroad into the protection 
conferred by Article 30(1) of the Constitution, that is, by 
framing the regulation the essential character of the 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 105 of 173 

institution being a minority educational institution, is not 
taken away. 
(Paragraph 122, Pai Foundation [(2002) 8 
SCC 481] ) 
(Emphasis supplied) 

97. Specifically addressing the issue of regulation of fees, Paragraphs 

139 to 141 of the report held thus: 

"139. To set up a reasonable fee structure is also a 
component of "the right to establish and administer an 
institution" within the meaning of Article 30(1) of the 
Constitution, as per the law declared in Pai 
Foundation [(2002) 8 SCC 481] . Every institution is free to 
devise its own fee structure subject to the limitation that 
there can be no profiteering and no capitation fee can be 
charged directly or indirectly, or in any form (Paragraphs 56 
to 58 and 161 [answer to Question 5(c)] of Pai 
Foundation[(2002) 8 SCC 481] are relevant in this regard). 

Capitation fees 

140. Capitation fee cannot be permitted to be charged and 
no seat can be permitted to be appropriated by payment of 
capitation fee. "Profession" has to be distinguished from 
"business" or a mere "occupation". While in business, and to 
a certain extent in occupation, there is a profit motive, 
profession is primarily a service to society wherein earning 
is secondary or incidental. A student who gets a professional 
degree by payment of capitation fee, once qualified as a 
professional, is likely to aim more at earning rather than 
serving and that becomes a bane to society. The charging of 
capitation fee by unaided minority and non-minority 
institutions for professional courses is just not permissible. 
Similarly, profiteering is also not permissible. Despite the 
legal position, this Court cannot shut its eyes to the hard 
realities of commercialisation of education and evil practices 
being adopted by many institutions to earn large amounts for 
their private or selfish ends. If capitation fee and profiteering 
is to be checked, the method of admission has to be 
regulated so that the admissions are based on merit and 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 106 of 173 

transparency and the students are not exploited. It is 
permissible to regulate admission and fee structure for 
achieving the purpose just stated. 

141. Our answer to Question 3 is that every institution is 
free to devise its own fee structure but the same can be 
regulated in the interest of preventing profiteering. No 
capitation fee can be charged." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

98. In paragraph 143, the report reiterated that "even unaided minority 

institutions can be subjected to regulatory measures with a view to curb 

commercialisation of education, profiteering and exploitation of 

students". 

99. Apropos the two Committees constituted by Islamic Academy 

(supra), the Supreme Court held that the constitution of the said two 

Committees was, in its view, "permissible as regulatory measures aimed 

at protecting the interest of the student community as a whole as also the 

minorities themselves, in maintaining required standards of professional 

education on non-exploitative terms in their institutions". Thus, though 

the authority of the Court, to constitute Committees to regulate or monitor 

the fees, or the fee structure, of unaided educational institutions,, 

including those administered by minorities, was affirmed, the question, 

nevertheless, arises whether the DoE could also exercise a similar 

authority. 

100. The following words, from Paragraphs 145 to 148 of the Report, 

are relevant in this regard: 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 107 of 173 

"145. The suggestion made on behalf of minorities and non-
minorities that the same purpose for which Committees have 
been set up can be achieved by post-audit or checks after the 
institutions have adopted their own admission procedure 
and fee structure, is unacceptable for the reasons shown by 
experience of the educational authorities of various States. 
Unless the admission procedure and fixation of fees is 
regulated and controlled at the initial stage, the evil of 
unfair practice of granting admission on available seats 
guided by the paying capacity of the candidates would be 
impossible to curb. 

146. Non-minority unaided institutions can also be 
subjected to similar restrictions which are found reasonable 
and in the interest of the student community. Professional 
education should be made accessible on the criterion of merit 
and on non-exploitative terms to all eligible students on a 
uniform basis. Minorities or non-minorities, in exercise of 
their educational rights in the field of professional education 
have an obligation and a duty to maintain requisite standards 
of professional education by giving admissions based on 
merit and making education equally accessible to eligible 
students through a fair and transparent admission procedure 
and based on a reasonable fee structure. 

147. In our considered view, on the basis of judgment 
in Pai Foundation [(2002)8 SCC 481] and various previous 
judgments of this Court which have been taken into 
consideration in that case, the scheme evolved out of setting 
up the two Committees for regulating admissions and 
determining fee structure by the judgment in Islamic 
Academy [(2003)6 SCC 697] cannot be faulted either on the 
ground of alleged infringement of Article 19(1)(g) in case of 
unaided professional educational institutions of both 
categories and Article 19(1)(g) read with Article 30 in case 
of unaided professional institutions of minorities. 

148. A fortiori, we do not see any impediment to the 
constitution of the Committees as a stopgap or ad hoc 
arrangement made in exercise of the power conferred on this 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 108 of 173 

Court by Article 142 of the Constitution until a suitable 
legislation or regulation framed by the State steps in. Such 
Committees cannot be equated with Unni Krishnan [(1993) 
1 SCC 645] Committees which were supposed to be 
permanent in nature." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

101. The challenge, before it, to the earlier decision in Islamic Academy 

(supra), to the extent of the constitution, in the said judgment, of two 

Committees, to monitor the admission and the fee structure of the 

educational institutions, it was therefore held, failed, as, in doing so, the 

said judgment did "not go beyond the law laid down in Pai Foundation 

and earlier decisions of this Court, which had been approved in that 

case". 

The takeaway from Inamdar (supra) 

102. Inamdar (supra), therefore, in sum and substance, holds thus: 

(i) 
The right to establish an educational institution, whether for 

charity or profit, was protected by Article 19(1)(g) of the 

Constitution of India. 

(ii) The educational institution was entitled to set up a 

reasonable fee structure, which was one of the primary components 

of the right to establish and administer the institution. The only 

limitations, thereon, were that, there could not be any profiteering, 

and no capitation fee could be charged directly or indirectly. 

Commercialisation of education was entirely impermissible. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 109 of 173 

(iii) Even so, Article 30 was conceptualised, and conceived, as an 

independent and separate dispensation in favour of minorities, 

intended to instil confidence in minorities against any executive or 

legislative encroachment on their right to establish and administer 

educational institutions of their choice. The said Article, therefore, 

though styled as a right, was more in the nature of protection of 

minorities. 

(iv) By virtue of the said additional protection, minority 

educational institutions could not be subjected to laws, relatable to 

Article 19(6) of the Constitution. What, therefore, could amount to 

a "reasonable restriction", within the meaning of Article 19(6) of 

the Constitution might, nevertheless, fall foul of Article 30 thereof. 

(v) That, however, did not immunise minority educational 

institutions from the operation of regulatory measures, for the 

simple reason that the right to administer did not include the right 

to maladminister. These regulatory measures had to be, however, 

reasonable and rational, as well as regulative of the essential 

character of the institution, conducive to making the institution an 

effective vehicle of education for the minority community, and 

directed towards ensuring excellence of education and efficiency of 

administration, so as to prevent the institution from falling in 

standards. 

(vi) Grant of recognition could legitimately be made subject to 

reasonable conditions or restrictions, aimed at ensuring excellence 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 110 of 173 

of the educational institution concerned. These could, for example, 

regulate the amount of funds, or properties, or number of students, 

or standard of education to be dispensed by the institution. They 

could not, however, be such as to defeat the protection conferred, 

on the minority institution by Article 30(1) of the Constitution, or 

dilute the right, of the minority, to establish and administer the 

educational institution. In this respect, the considerations, for 

granting recognition to minority educational institution would be 

similar to those applicable to a non-minority institution, subject to 

the stipulation that the regulation did not deprive the institution of 

its minority status. 

(vii) Neither could such regulations interfere with the day-to-day 

administration of the institution, nor the essential ingredients of the 

management thereof, which would include, inter alia, the quantum 

of fee to be charged for admission of the students. 

(viii) The setting up, in Islamic Academy (supra), of the two 

Committees, to regulate the admissions made by the minority 

institutions, and the fees charged by them, did not infract either 

Article 19(1)(g) or Article 30 of the Constitution. This was, 

however, permissible only because the Committees were 

temporary, and would not be permissible, were the committees to 

be permanent entities. 

Cochin University of Science and Technology v. Thomas P. John, 
(2008) 8 SCC 82, rendered by a bench of 3 Hon'ble Judges on 6 th May, 
2008 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 111 of 173 

103. It is not necessary to refer, in any detail, to the facts of this case, 

inasmuch as the ratio decidendi thereof, to the extent it is relevant for the 

controversy in issue, is fairly clear. Suffice it to state that the dispute 

pertained to the fixation of fees, by the appellant-University before the 

Supreme Court, for the years 1995-1996 and 1996-1997, with which the 

students claimed to be aggrieved. While observing that, for the years in 

question, the fee structure had been devised by Committees set up by the 

Supreme Court in the aftermath of T. M. A. Pai (supra), the Supreme 

Court, nevertheless, opined, clearly, in paragraph 11 of the report, that 

"the matter relating to the fixation of fee is a part of the administration of 

an educational institution and it would impose a heavy onus on such an 

institution to be called upon to justify the levy of a fee with mathematical 

precision". It was noted that the Supreme Court had laid down broad 

principles with regard to the fixation of the fees, which were being 

universally adopted. 

104. Thereafter, in paragraph 12 of the report, the Supreme Court 

observed that "an educational institution chalks out its own program 

year-wise on the basis of the projected receipts and expenditure and for 

the court to interfere in this purely administrative matter would be 

impinging excessively on this right". Even so, it was held, "it should not 

be understood that the educational institution has a carte blanche to fix 

any fee that it likes but substantial autonomy must be left to it." The 

principles enunciated in T. M. A. Pai (supra), regarding regulatory 

control over unaided minority educational institutions being required to 

be minimal, with complete absence of any external controlling agency in 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 112 of 173 

the matter of day-to-day administration, was again emphasised. Also 

emphasised were the principles, so clearly enunciated in T. M. A. Pai 

(supra), that, subject to the proscriptions on profiteering or charging of 

capitation fee, fees to be charged by unaided educational institutions 

cannot be regulated. The Supreme Court also observed that reasonable 

surplus, for expansion and augmentation of the facilities in the institution, 

was permissible, and would not amount to profiteering. 

105. Referring, thereafter, to the principles laid down in Islamic 

Academy (supra) and Inamdar (supra), the Supreme Court went on, in 

Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the report, to hold, thus: 

"16. A reading of the aforesaid judgments would reveal 
that the broad principle is that an educational institution 
must be left to its own devices in the matter of fixation of fee 
though profiteering or the imposition of capitation fee is to 
be ruled out and that some amount towards surplus funds 
available to an institution must be permitted and visualised, 
but it has also been laid down by inference that if the broad 
principles with regard to fixation of fee are adopted, an 
educational institution cannot be called upon to explain the 
receipts and the expenses as before a Chartered 
Accountant. We find that the observations of the Division 
Bench of the High Court that no rational basis for the 
fixation of a higher fee for two years had been furnished lays 
down an onus on the educational institution, which would be 
difficult for it to discharge with accuracy. 

17. It bears repetition that the University had set up the 
self-financing BTech course in the year 1995 and no grant-
in-aid was available during this period or later and it had to 
make arrangements for its own funds. We have also 
examined the budget estimates, receipts and expenditure 
from the years 1996-1997 to 1999-2000. We do find that 
there is a surplus in the hands of the institution but in the 
facts that a new course was being initiated which would 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 113 of 173 

require huge investments, the surplus was not 
unconscionable so as to require interference. Moreover, the 
University had made its budget estimates keeping in view the 
proposed receipts and if the fee levied by it and accepted by 
the students was permitted to be cut down midterm on the 
premise that the University had not been able to explain 
each and every item to justify the levy, it would perhaps be 
impossible for it to function effectively." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

The above extracted passages, from Cochin University (supra), carried 

the principles enunciated in the decisions which preceded it, and to which 

reference has already been made hereinabove, a notch further. It was held 

that the said principles also implied, inferentially, that the educational 

institution could not be called upon to explain its receipts and expenses as 

before a Chartered Accountant, once it was found that the institution was 

not engaging in profiteering and charging of capitation fee, and that the 

surplus funds available with it, if any, were reasonable. The Supreme 

Court specifically disapproved the finding, by the High Court, that the 

fixation of higher fee, for two years, by the appellant-University before it, 

did not have any rational basis, holding that this cast, on the University, 

the onus to explain the fixation, the accurate discharging of which would 

be difficult. On facts, the Supreme Court found that there was a surplus in 

the hands of the appellant-University before it, but that, keeping in view 

the fact that it was starting a new course, the surplus could not be 

regarded as unconscionable. The decision, of the said University, to work 

out its budget estimates keeping in view proposed receipts, was also 

impliedly approved.

106. Much would turn on this judgment, authored by A. K. Sikri, J. (as 

his Lordship then was), on behalf of the Division Bench of this Court, as 

it involved a challenge to an Order, dated 11 th February, 2009, issued by 

the DoE, in the wake of the recommendations of the 6 th CPC, and the 

acceptance, thereof, by the Government, the terms thereof were 

considerably similar to those of the Order dated 17 th October, 2017 supra, 

with which the present controversy is, inter alia, concerned. Moreover, it 

also considered the various judgments, of the Supreme Court, which 

preceded it, and to which reference already stands made hereinabove. 

Rendered, as it is, by a Division Bench of this Court, the judgment is 

binding upon me, in the absence of any subsequent decision to the 

contrary. 

107. Some clauses, of the said Order, dated 11 th February, 2009 supra, 

as set out in paragraph 10 of the judgment of this Court, as reported in 

2011 SCC Online 3394, may be reproduced thus: 

"2. All schools must, first of all, explore the possibility of 
utilizing the existing reserves to meet any shortfall in 
payment of salaries and allowances, as a consequence of 
increase in the salaries and allowances of the employees. 

3. 
If any school still feels it necessary to hike the Tuition 
Fee, it shall present its case, along with detailed financial 
statements indicating income and expenditure on each 
account, to the Parent Teacher Association to justify the 
need for any hike. Any increase in Tuition Fee shall be 
effected only after fulfilling this requirement and further 
subject to the cap prescribed in Paragraph 4 below. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 115 of 173 

4. 
All schools have been placed in 5 categories based on 
their monthly Tuition Fee in present. Increase in the Tuition 
Fee, as mentioned below, is permitted with effect from 
1 st September, 2008 for those schools who need to raise 
additional funding for additional requirement on account of 
the implementation of the 6 th Central Pay Commission 
recommendations:-

The first installment may be deposited by 31 st March, 2009 
and the second by 30 th September, 2009. Schools, however, 
are at liberty to prescribe late dates." 

108. The above Order, dated 11 th February, 2009, was called into 

question by parents, who were aggrieved by the increase in fees, as well 

as by the Schools, who were aggrieved by what they perceived to be the 

unconstitutionally regulatory framework provided in the said Order. The 

arguments advanced by both sides, before the Court, were, to an extent, 

predictable, with the affected parents complaining that the hike in fees 

was unjustified and disproportionate in nature, and the Schools claiming, 

per contra, that the framework set out in the Order dated 11 th February, 

2009 supra, trespassed on their fundamental rights, guaranteed by Article 

19 and Article 29 of the Constitution of India. Additionally, some of the 

petitioners, who were minority schools, also sought to invoke Article 30 

of the Constitution of India. 

109. After painstakingly setting out, at the outset, the principles 

enunciated in Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-I (supra), T. M. A. Pai 

(supra), Islamic Academy (supra), Inamdar (supra) and Modern School 

(supra), this Court opined, in paragraph 56 of the report, that a conjoint 

reading of these decisions would clearly demonstrate, inter alia, that the 

"DoE has the authority to regulate the quantum of fee charged by unaided 

schools under Section 17(3) of the 1973 Act … it has to ensure that the 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 117 of 173 

schools are not indulging in profiteering." It is important to note that the 

regulatory authority, conferred on the DoE, has been, thus, attributed, by 

this Court, to Section 17(3) of the DSE Act, and that the objective, to be 

achieved while exercising the said authority, is also recognised as 

ensuring that the schools are not indulging in profiteering. 

110. Paragraphs 62 to 64 of the report, which are of stellar significance, 

read as under: 

"62. With this, we revert back to the issues On Merits: 

The clear legal position which emerges from the 
combined reading of the judgments of the Supreme Court, 
directly on the issue of revising tuition fee by Delhi schools 
under the Delhi Education Act, and already stated in detail 
above, demonstrates that the schools cannot indulge in 
commercialization of education which would mean that the 
fee structure has to be kept within bound so as to avoid 
profiteering. At the same time, "reasonable surplus" is 
permissible as fund in the form of such surplus may be 
required for development of various activities in the schools 
for the benefit of students themselves. The guiding principle, 
in the process, is "to strike a balance between autonomy of 
such institution and measures to be taken in avoiding 
commercialization of education". The autonomy of the 
schools can be ensured by giving first right to such schools 
to increase the fee. At the same time, quantum of fee to be 
charged by unaided schools is subject to regulation by the 
DoE which power is specifically conferred upon the DoE by 
virtue of Section 17(3) of 1973 Act. This is specifically held 
by the Supreme Court in Modern School (supra) and Action 
Committee Unaided Private Schools (supra). Normally, 
therefore, in the first instance, it is for the schools to fix their 
fee and/or increase the same which right is conferred upon 
the schools as recognized in TMA Pai (supra). The DoE can 
step in and interfere if hike in fee by a particular school is 
found to be excessive and perceived as "indulging in 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 118 of 173 

profiteering". It would be a procedure to be resorted to 
routinely. However, validity of the orders dated 11.02.2009 
passed by the DoE is to be judged in a different hue 
altogether. Situation arose because of the implementation of 
pay structure recommended by the 6 th Pay Commission, 
which was to be done mid-session albeit from retrospective 
effect, i.e., with effect from 01.01.2006. All aided and 
unaided recognized schools in Delhi were under obligation 
to give increase to their teachers and staff members which 
resulted in substantial hike in pay package of the employees 
of these schools. Further, it happened across the board and 
it was not a situation specific to a particular school. As a 
result of this added financial burden whereas the schools 
wanted to increase the fee, PTAs on the other hand, 
maintained that some of the schools enjoyed robust financial 
health, which was sufficient to bear the additional monetary 
burden without hike in the fee to be charged from the 
students. This necessitated going into the records of each 
school. Therefore, in a situation like this where on the one 
hand, there was perceptible additional financial burden 
created on account of increase in the pay of the staff and on 
the other hand, the exercise demanded by the PTAs of going 
into the financial records of each schools was time 
consuming, the issuance of orders dated 11.02.2009 by the 
Government, as an interim measure, proposing to increase 
the tuition fee in the manner provided in the said order with 
a lid on the upper limit cannot be faulted with. It is moreso, 
when the proposed increase is not based on any whims of the 
DoE, but was preceded by the constitution of a Committee 
under the Chairmanship of Shri S.L. Bansal, a retired I.A.S. 
officer and the impugned orders were the result of the 
reports submitted by the said Committee after undertaking 
requisite exercise, albeit, of preliminary nature, but after 
giving hearing to all stakeholders. At this stage, while 
passing such an order, there could not have been any option, 
but to pass a general order for increase in fee. 

63. We are of the opinion that in the aforesaid exceptional 
circumstance in which such an order came to be passed, it 
did not impinge upon the autonomy of the recognized aided 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 119 of 173 

or unaided private schools as well. We, therefore, uphold 
Paragraph 7 of the impugned order, making it clear that was 
only an interim measure adopted by the Court. When we 
look into the matter in the aforesaid perspective, which 
according to us, is the only manner in which orders dated 
11.02.2009 are to be viewed, we are clear in mind that the 
increase in fees stipulated in the said orders as ad-
hoc measure is legal and valid. However, as clarified above, 
we hasten to add that it would only be treated as an interim 
measure and would be subject to scrutiny into the records of 
each school to see as to whether there was any necessity to 
increase the fee having regard to the financial position of the 
said schools. Outcome of such an exercise could result in 
higher hike in fee than stipulated in the orders dated 
11.02.2009 or reducing the fee than what is permitted in the 
said orders. 

64. At the same time, we again point out that the orders 
dated 11.02.2009 were issued under exceptional 
circumstances. We, therefore, clarify that in the normal 
course when the fee is to be fixed at the start of academic 
session, no permission from DoE is necessary before or after 
fixing tuition fee. Of course, once the requirement of Section 
17(3) of the Act is fulfilled, it would be open to the DoE to 
see whether such fixation is valid or it is irrational or 
arbitrary. The position in sub-paragraph (iii) of Paragraph 
65 of DAM-1 is reiterated in this behalf." 

(Emphasis supplied) 

That the fee hike, provided in the notification dated 11 th February, 2009 

supra, was by way of an interim measure, as reiterated in paragraph 83 of 

the report. 

111. Dealing separately with the objections voiced by the minority 

educational institutions, this Court observed that Modern School (supra) 

had clarified, categorically, the legal position that minorities, too, were 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 120 of 173 

not exempt from the interdiction against indulging in commercial 

exploitation in the name of education and, to that extent, therefore, the 

regulatory power of the DoE would continue to apply. In paragraph 69 of 

the report, this Court held thus, qua minorities: 

"The reasons given by us holding paragraph 7 of the 
notification dated 11.02.2009 to be valid would prompt us to 
further hold that such an order would be applicable to the 
minority schools as well and does not impinge upon their 
minority rights. It is for the reason that the principle laid 
down by the Apex Court to the effect that schools are not to 
be converted into commercial ventures and are not to resort 
to profiteering is applicable to minority schools as well." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

112. Finally, this Court deemed it appropriate to constitute a three-

member Committee, headed by Anil Dev Singh, J., the former Chief 

Justice of the High Court of Rajasthan, which was required to look into 

the aspect of the increase of fee, which each individual school would be 

requiring, consequent to the implementation of the recommendations of 

the 6 th CPC, by examining the records and accounts of each of the 

schools, and taking into account the available funds and the principles 

enunciated by the Supreme Court in, inter alia, Modern School (supra). 

The rationale for constitution of this Committee was provided, in 

paragraph 82, thus: 

"If and when such measures are adopted that may provide 
lasting solution to the problem. However, even when the 
Government is willing this process is likely to take 
substantial time. In the integerrum, neither the deserving 
schools who need to increase fee but are not permitted, nor 
the poor parents who may be coughing out much more fee 
than what is justified and charged by certain schools cannot 
be left in lurch. Since we have held that fee hike in the 
orders dated 11.02.2009 is to be construed as an interim 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 121 of 173 

measure, to resolve the matter finally, this exercise is to be 
completed and taken to its logical end." 

It is apparent, on a reading of the judgment, that this Court has been 

overcautious in clarifying that the fee hike, provided by the Order dated 

11 th February, 2009 supra, was only an interim measure. 

The takeaway from Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II 

113. Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra) is significant, as, for the 

first time, it signalled a breakaway from the Pai-Islamic Academy-

Inamdar-Modern School regime, in the case of the Order, dated 11 th 

February, 2009 supra, even while otherwise reiterating the principles 

contained in the said decisions which may, justifiably, be regarded, by 

now, as fossilised in education jurisprudence. The following principles, as 

contained in the earlier decisions, of the Supreme Court, to which 

reference has already been made hereinabove, find iteration in Delhi 

Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra): 

(i) 
Schools could not indulge in commercialisation of 

education. "Commercialisation of education" was equated, by this 

Court, to "indulging in profiteering". 

(ii) For this purpose, the fee structures of schools had to remain 

within bounds. 

(iii) At the same time, a "reasonable surplus" was permissible, 

for development of the school and for the benefit of the students. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 122 of 173 

(iv) In the ultimate eventuate, a balance was required to be struck 

between the autonomy of the institution and the measures to be 

taken in order to avoid commercialisation of education. 

(v) The first right, to fix the fee or increase the fee, was with the 

schools. 

(vi) The DoE could step in and interfere, if the fee was found to 

be excessive and amounted to "indulging in profiteering". This 

exercise would be relatable to Section 17(3) of the DSE Act. 

(vii) The situation that arose, consequent to their requirement of 

compliance with the recommendations of the Pay Commission 

was, however, required to be "judged in a different hue altogether". 

This was a pan-school phenomenon, covering all aided and 

unaided recognised schools in Delhi. Conflicting interests came 

into being, with the schools claiming that the additional burden, 

which had fallen on their shoulders, could be borne only if they 

were permitted to increase their fees, and the parents contending, 

on the other hand, that the financial health of the schools was 

robust enough to bear the burden, without fee increase -or, at 

least, without increase to the extent to which it had been effected. 

Examination of the merits of these rival contentions required going 

into the financial condition of each school, which would be a time 

consuming exercise. In such circumstances, it was permissible to 

allow an "interim fee hike", as was done by the Order dated 11 th 

February, 2009 supra, which would temporarily still the waters, 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 123 of 173 

with a cap on the upper limit of fees chargeable. The circumstances 

being exceptional, it could not be said that the order, allowing such 

interim fee hike, trespassed on the autonomy of the schools to fix 

their fees. 

(viii) In the normal course, however, the position that, at the time 

of fixation of fees, by the school at the start of the academic 

session, no prior permission of the DoE was required, continued to 

operate. 

Justice for All v. G.N.C.T.D., 2016 SCC Online Del 355 ["Justice for 
All-I"] and Justice for All v. G.N.C.T.D., 2016 SCC Online Del 4114 
["Justice for All-II"] 

114. This was a public interest litigation, which sought enforcement of 

the "land clause", as contained in the allotment letters, whereunder land 

was allotted, to private unaided schools by the DDA at concessional rates. 

Reliance was, needless to say, placed, almost exclusively, on Modern 

School (supra). The schools, on the other hand, placed reliance on the 

judgment of this Court in Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra). 

115. The Division Bench of this Court, speaking through G. Rohini, 

C.J., held that the reliance, placed by the schools, on the decision in Delhi 

Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra) was misplaced, as the said decision 

did not deal with the liability of private unaided schools who had been 

allotted land, by the DDA, at concessional rates. After having culled out 

the passages, containing the enunciation of the law in Delhi Abhibhavak 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 124 of 173 

Mahasangh-II (supra), this Court concluded, in paragraphs 17 and 18 of 

the report, thus: 

"17. Thus it is clear that the schools cannot indulge in 
profiteering and commercialization of school education. 
Quantum of fees to be charged by unaided schools is subject 
to regulation by DoE in terms of the power conferred under 
Section 17(3) of DSE Act, 1973 and he is competent to 
interfere if hike in fee by a particular school is found to be 
excessive and perceived as indulging in profiteering. So far 
as the unaided schools which are allotted land by DDA are 
concerned, in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court 
in Modern School v. Union of India (supra), we are clear 
in our mind that they are bound to comply with the 
stipulation in the letter of allotment. Paragraph 28 of the 
majority judgment in Modern School v. Union of 
India (supra) upholds the binding nature of the stipulation 
in the letter of allotment issued by the DDA that the school 
shall not increase the rate of tuition fees without the prior 
sanction of DoE. 

18. For the aforesaid reasons, we consider it appropriate 
to dispose of the writ petition with a direction that the 
respondent No. 1/DoE shall ensure the compliance of term, 
if any, in the letter of allotment regarding the increase of the 
fees by all the recognized unaided schools which are allotted 
land by DDA. The respondent No. 2/DDA shall also take 
appropriate steps in accordance with law in case of 
violation of such stipulation in the letter of allotment by the 
unaided schools." 
(Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 

116. A Review Petition, seeking review of the above judgment was 

filed, by certain societies, which were claiming to promote the right of 

education. While holding that no ground, for review of its decision, was 

made out, this Court entered the following important caveat, in paragraph 

25 of the report: 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 125 of 173 

"However, in view of the fact that the issues relating to the 
purport of the Delhi Development Authority (Disposal of 
Developed Nazul Land) Rules, 1981 and the applicability of 
the same to the lands allotted by the DDA and the related 
issues which may have bearing on enforcement of sub-
section (3) of Section 17 of Delhi School Education Act, 
1973 and the Rules made thereunder were neither urged in 
the writ petition decided by us nor any opinion was 
expressed by us, we make it clear that the order under 
review shall not preclude the aggrieved party including the 
applicants to challenge the action, if any, taken by the DOE 
for enforcement of terms of allotment of land with regard to 
increase of fees by raising all the grounds available under 
law." 

(Emphasis supplied) 

The upshot 

117. In sum and substance, therefore, the position that emerges, is this: 

The right to establish, and administer, unaided educational institutions, is 

essentially absolute, and bureaucratic and governmental interference, 

therewith, has necessarily to be minimal. Among the facets of this right 

is the right to set up a fee structure, which included determination of the 

quantum of fee to be charged by it. Regulation, of the right to establish 

and administer educational institutions by the Government was, however, 

permissible, to ensure excellence in education and prevent 

maladministration. Such regulation could govern, for example, the 

quality of teachers (by prescribing minimum qualifications for 

appointment), the courses and curricula of study, and the existence of 

requisite and sufficient infrastructure. It could not, however, trespass into 

the arena of administration, complete discretion, in respect whereof, had 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 126 of 173 

to be left to the institution and those who managed it. Maintenance of a 

reasonable revenue surplus, for augmentation of the institution and its 

facilities, and for the betterment of the students studying therein, was 

perfectly in order. While, therefore, a reasonable profit could be earned 

by the institution, after providing for investment and expenditure, 

profiteering, and charging of capitation fee, was entirely impermissible, 

and the Government introduce regulations to ensure that this did 

not happen. The Government could not, however, fix a rigid fee 

structure, for unaided educational institutions. 

118. Profiteering appears, in the above-cited decisions, to have, 

impliedly, be distinguished from earning of profit. While the latter is 

permissible, to a reasonable extent, the former is not. The distinction, 

between the two, appears to be relatable to the essentially "charitable" 

character of the exercise of dispensation of education. Education is 

classically regarded as "charitable", and not geared at earning profit. 

Money, however, does not grow on trees, and, while educational 

institutions are entitled to earn profit, in order to survive, and to augment 

their resources and aim at higher standards, they cannot be vehicles 

geared at earning profits. If the aim and objective, of running educational 

institution, is earning of profit, rather than dissemination of knowledge, it 

would be treated as indulging in "profiteering". Earning of profit is, 

however, by itself, not "profiteering". 

119. Minorities were entitled to "additional protection" under Article 30 

of the Constitution of India, in the matter of establishment and 

administration of educational institutions of their choice. A study of the 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 127 of 173 

various judicial pronouncements on the issue reveals, however, that, in 

the matter of fixation and determination of fees, the rights of minority, 

and non-minority, educational institutions, were nearly alike. Regulation 

of minority educational institutions, too, was permissible, in the interests 

of efficiency of instruction, discipline, health, sanitation, morality, public 

order, and the like. Such institutions, too, were subject to the ordinary 

laws of the land, and had to follow the statutory measures regulating 

educational standards and efficiency, prescribed courses and curricula of 

study, qualifications of teachers and students, and the like. Regulatory 

control, of minority educational institutions had, however, to stop short of 

encroaching on the "minority character" of the institutions, or the 

establishment and administration thereof. 

120. Specifically in the matter of charging of fees, and the fixation and 

determination of the quantum thereof, all decisions, at least of the 

Supreme Court, have been uniform in asserting that maximum autonomy, 

to unaided educational institutions, whether minority or non-minority, 

was guaranteed by the Constitution, the only curbs, thereon, being in 

relation to commercialisation of education, i.e., profiteering and charging 

of capitation fee. So long as the fees charged by the concerned 

educational institution(s) did not amount to "commercialisation of 

education", thus understood, the Constitution clearly advocates a "hands 

off" approach by the Government, insofar as the establishment and 

administration of the institution, including the fixation of fees by it, was 

concerned. This would also immunise the institution from the 

requirement of being called upon to explain its receipts and expenses, as 

before a Chartered Accountant. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 128 of 173 

121. Regulatory measures, in every case, were relatable to Article 17(3) 

of the DSE Act. 

122. Exceptional situations, however, justified exceptional measures 

and where, for example, schools, across the board, were subjected to 

escalated financial burden, by having to disburse higher salaries to their 

employees, consequent to the acceptance of the recommendations of the 

CPC by the Government, it could not be expected that, pending 

evaluation of the financials of every school, to assess whether the hiking 

fees, proposed by it as contained in the statement of fees filed under 

Section 17(3) of the DSE Act, was, or was not, disproportionate and did, 

or did not, therefore, amounted to "profiteering", a situation of flux 

should continue to exist. To maintain an equilibrium, while such an 

exercise was undertaken (for which the Justice Anil Dev Singh 

Committee was constituted), it was permissible for the DoE to, by an 

across-the-board executive order, applicable to all schools, provide for an 

"interim fee hike", subject to an upper limit. Such an interim hike, as a 

temporary measure, did not infract the fundamental rights, either of the 

institution, or of those to whom it imparted education. 

Applying the law to the facts 

123. The "interim fee hike", as provided in the Order dated 17 th 

October, 2017, therefore, was perfectly in order, in view of the law laid 

down in Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra). I am not entering 

into the legality, or otherwise, of any of the other clauses of the said 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 129 of 173 

Order -though the discussion, hereinabove, make throws sufficient hints 

in that direction -as the Order dated 17 th October, 2017 is not under 

challenge in these proceedings. 

124. Given this position, the DoE seeks to justify the issuance, by it, of 

the impugned Order, dated 13 th April, 2018, on the anvil of the 

pronouncement of this Court in Justice for All-I (supra). At this juncture, 

I may observe that, in my opinion, the caveat, contained in the concluding 

paragraph of the order passed in Justice For All-II (supra), reproduced in 

paragraph 114 supra, cannot be used as a handle to escape Justice For 

All-I (supra). All that is said, in the said concluding paragraph, is that 

the decision in Justice For All-I (supra) would not foreclose the right of 

any party, aggrieved by action taken by the DoE for enforcement of the 

"land clause", from challenging the same, "by raising all the grounds 

available under law". The "law", for the purposes of this caveat, would, 

needless to say, include the first Justice For All judgment. The legality, 

or otherwise, of the act of the DoE in issuing the impugned Order dated 

13 th April, 2018 has, therefore, to be gauged in the light of Justice For 

All-I (supra), and de hors the said decision. 

125. Justice For All-I (supra) directs the DoE to ensure compliance of 

the "land clause", and directs the DDA to take appropriate steps, in 

accordance with law, in case of violation of the said stipulation by 

unaided schools. Taking of action for violation of the clause, therefore, is, 

clearly, to be by the DDA, and not by the DoE. Even so, Mr. Ramesh 

Singh, appearing for the DoE, would seek to content that "ensuring 

compliance" with the "land clause" necessarily required obtaining of 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 130 of 173 

prior approval, by any school which desired to increase its fees. The 

"interim fee hike", provided in the Order dated 17 th October, 2017, he 

would submit, violated this requirement and had, therefore, to go. And so, 

he would submit, had the said Circular to be eviscerated, in respect of 

schools governed by the "land clause", by the impugned Order dated 13 th 

April, 2018. 

126. Did, however, the provision for "interim fee hike", as contained in 

the Order dated 17 th October, 2017, infract the "land clause", in respect of 

educational institutions to which the said clause applied? 

127. The "land clause" read thus: 

"The school shall not increase the rates of tuition fee without 

the prior sanction of the Directorate of Education, Delhi 

Administration…" 

128. The afore-extracted clause, quite clearly, operates as a proscription 

on the school(s). Schools , the allotment documents in respect where of 

contained this clause were, by operation thereof, not permitted to increase 

the rates of tuition fee without the prior sanction of the DoE. Even for this 

simple reason, the entire argument, of Mr. Ramesh Singh, that the 

issuance of the impugned Order, dated 13 th April, 2018, was necessitated 

as the provision for "interim fee hike", as contained in the Order dated 

17 th October, 2017, infracted the "land clause", has necessarily to fail. 

The "interim fee hike", permitted by the Order dated 17 th October, 2017, 

was a dispensation by the DoE itself, which had the imprimatur of the 

Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II decision. It was not an act of increase 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 131 of 173 

of fees by the schools. The "land clause", as contained in the allotment 

documents of the DDA, did not, at any point of time, inhibit the DoE 

from allowing an interim fee hike. 

129. Indeed, even logistically, the argument of Mr. Ramesh Singh 

appears incomprehensible, as there could be no question of the DoE 

taking its own prior approval before allowing an interim fee hike. The 

interim fee hike being a decision of the DoE, the requirement of "prior 

approval" -which, even otherwise, did not apply -could not be said to 

have been violated. 

130. The decision for allowing an interim fee hike, as contained in the 

Order dated 17 th October, 2017, being that of the DoE, there was no 

justification for jettisoning the said Order, in respect of schools governed 

by the "land clause", as was done by the impugned Order dated 13 th 

April, 2018. 

131. The impugned Order, dated 13 th April, 2018, therefore, cannot 

sustain, in law on facts, and is, accordingly, quashed and set aside. 

132. In the light of the law, as enunciated in the judgments cited 

hereinabove, the "interim fee hike" would operate immediately, in favour 

of all private unaided schools, without the requirement of any prior 

approval. The statements of fees, submitted by the schools under Section 

17(3) of the DSE Act would, however, be subjected to scrutiny, by the 

DoE, with a view to ensuring that the schools were not indulging in 

commercialisation of education, by resorting to profiteering, or charging 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 132 of 173 

of capitation fee. While undertaking this exercise, the DoE would be 

required to keep in mind the principles enunciated hereinabove. 

133. Needless to say, if any school is, in fact, found to be indulging in 

commercialisation of education, the DoE would be well within its rights 

in proceeding, against such institution, in accordance with law, and 

keeping in mind the provisions of the DSE Act and the DSE Rules. 

134. The writ petition stands allowed, accordingly, with no order as to 

costs. 

WP (C) 13456/2018 -Mount Carmel School v. DoE 

135. The petitioner, in this writ petition, is a minority educational 

institution, which was granted minority status, by the National 

Commission for Minority Educational Institutions, on 3 rd August, 2006. It 

was granted recognition, prior thereto, under the DSE Act, in 2000. It is 

affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). It is an 

unaided institution, not dependent, for any aid or assistance, on 

governmental funds. 

136. As in the case of the 325 schools, with which WP (C) 4374/2018 

was concerned, the letter, dated 9 th March, 2000, issued by the DDA, 

whereunder land was allotted to the petitioner, also contained a clause 

(Clause No 17), which was identical to the "land clause" as quoted in 

Modern School (supra) but which may, nevertheless, for the sake of the 

record, be reproduced thus: 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 133 of 173 

"The School shall not increase the rates of tuition fee 
without the prior sanction of Directorate of Education Delhi 
Admn. and shall follow the provisions of Delhi School 
Education Act/ Rules, 1973 and other instructions issued 
from time to time." 

The petitioner is, however, at pains to point out, in the writ petition, that 

land was, in fact, allotted to it at the prevalent institutional rates, as per 

Circular dated 24 th May, 2004, issued by the Land Costing Wing of the 

DDA and that, therefore, it could not be said that the petitioner had been 

allotted land at any "concessional rate". The said Circular reads thus: 

"Delhi Development Authority 
(Land Costing Wing) 

No. F. 2(4) 96/AO (P)/95/33 
Dated: 24.05.2004 

Subject: 
Institutional Land rates for the year 2002-03, 
2003-04 and 2005 

The Ministry of UD&PA vide their letter No.J-
13036/3/2000-DDVA dated 20.02.2004 has conveyed the 
approval of the Government for the rates of institutional land 
premium for the year 2002-03, 2003-04and 2004-05.While 
the rates for 2002-03 and 2003-04 are the same as circulated 
vide even no.16 dated 01.04.04 the rates for 2004-05 are 
10% higher than the rates for the year 2003-04 as against the 
proposed increase of 5%. Further, the Ministry has directed 
that no allotment may be done other than on rates approved 
by the Government. 

Now in pursuance of the approval of the Government 
a fresh schedule of the institutional land rates incorporating 
the rates for 2002-03, 2Q03-04 and 2004-05 as approved has 
been drawn and is annexed for reference and necessary 
action.

137. Subsequently, a lease agreement, dated 22 nd November, 2007, was 

executed between the DDA and the petitioner, and it is not in dispute that 

the said lease agreement did not contain any "land clause", akin to Clause 

17 of the letter dated 9 th March, 2000 supra. Mr. Sunil Gupta, learned 

Senior Counsel was, however, customarily fair in submitting that, as such 

a clause did figure, in the letter dated 9 th March, 2000, he would proceed 

on the premise that the allotment of land, to the petitioner, was subject to 

the "land clause". 

138. On 15 th March, 2016, the petitioner filed its Statement of Fees, for 

the ensuing academic session 2016-17, with the DoE, under Section 17(3) 

of the DSE Act. 

139. On 16 th April, 2016, the DoE issued an Order, referring to the "land 

clause", and directing thus: 

"Now, therefore, all the HoSs /Managers of Private Unaided 
recognised Schools, allotted land by the land owning 
agencies on the condition of seeking prior sanction of 
Director of Education for increase in fee, are directed to 
submit their proposals, if any, for prior sanction of the 
Director of Education for increase in tuition fee/fee for the

140. Simultaneously, another Order was issued, by the DoE, on the 

same date, i.e. 16 th April, 2016, referring to Rule 180 of the DSE Rules 

and, after observing that returns and documents submitted by various 

schools, thereunder, were not uniform in format, resulting in difficulty in 

ensuring transparency and accountability to all stakeholders, directed that 

the returns on documents submitted by the schools were to be as per the 

format specified by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, in its 

Guidance Note on Accounting by Schools (2005). The Order purported to 

be issued in exercise of powers conferred by clause (xviii) of Rule 50 and 

Rule 180 of the DSE Rules. 

141. This, it is averred, was followed by an e-mail, dated 21 st April, 

2016, by the DoE, to all private unaided recognised schools (including 

the petitioner) in the South West District, built on land to which the "land 

clause" applied, to submit the proposal, if any, for prior sanction of the 

DoE for increase in tuition fee for the academic session 2016-2017. The 

petitioner responded vide return e-mail dated 25 th April, 2016. 

142. Further similar communications, on the same lines, ensued, 

between the petitioner and the DoE. 

143. On 3 rd October, 2016, a Show Cause Notice was issued, to the 

petitioner, by the DoE, directing the petitioner to show cause, within 10 

days, as to why its recognition be not withdrawn under Rule 56 of the 

DSE Rules. The Show Cause Notice noted the fact that the petitioner had 

submitted its statement of fees, for the session 2016-2017, on 15 th March, 

2016, in which an enhancement of 25%, in comparison to the fees being 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 136 of 173 

charged for earlier years, was contemplated. Recounting, thereafter, the 

further communications that took place, between the DoE and the 

petitioner, to which reference already stands made hereinabove, the Show 

Cause Notice concluded thus: 

" 
And whereas, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the 
judgment dated 27-04-2004 in the matter of Modern School 
Vs Union of India & Ors, failed that so far as allotment of 
land by the DDA is concerned, suffice it to point out that the 
same has no bearing with the enforcement of the provisions 
of the Act and the rules framed there under but indisputably 
the institutions are bound by the terms and conditions of 
allotment. In the event such terms and conditions of 
allotment been violated by the allottees, the appropriate 
statutory authorities would be at liberty to take appropriate 
step as is permissible in law. 

And whereas, in view of the above, it is evident that 
the school has violated the condition of allotment of land 
laid down in Sl. No. 17 of the allotment letter dated 09-03-
2000 by increasing the fee without prior sanction of Director 
(Education) as well as a direction of Hon'ble Supreme Court 
in Modern School case and the Hon'ble High Court in WPC 
4109/2013 and orders dated 19-02-2016, 16-04-2016 of this 
Directorate. 

Now therefore, the Managing Committee/Manager of 
the Mount Carmel School, Sector-22, Dwarka, New Delhi is 
hereby directed to show cause in writing as to why the 
recognition of the school may not be withdrawn under rule 
56 of DSE AR, 1973 for non-compliance of this 
Directorate's Order as mentioned above in the matter of 
violation of condition of allotment of land may not be 
referred to DDA for cancellation of lease deed of the society. 
The reply should reach the undersigned within 10 days of 
receipt of this notice failing which the action as deemed fit 
shall be taken against the School without any further notice. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 137 of 173 

This issues with the prior approval of Director 
(Education)." 

144. The petitioner responded, vide communication dated 8 th November, 

2016. Besides furnishing reasons for its decision to increase its fees for 

the academic session 2015-16, the petitioner also submitted that, as a 

minority educational institution, the "land clause" could not be so 

operated, against it, as to surpass the constitutional mandate. 

145. Be that as it may, the writ petition avers that the petitioner did, in 

fact, release, to all staff members, enhanced pay scales, as recommended 

by the 7 th CPC, along with arrears. 

146. On 25 th May, 2018, a second Show Cause Notice was issued, to the 

petitioner, by the DoE, again reiterating its intention to withdraw the 

recognition granted to the petitioner, under Rule 56 of the DSE Rules, for 

non-compliance with the orders dated 19 th February, 2016 and 16 April, 

2016, issued by the DoE, and for violation of the "land clause". The 

petitioner was also directed to show cause as to why the matter be not 

referred to the DDA for cancellation of the lease deed of the petitioner. 

The petitioner responded, to this Show Cause Notice, vide 

communication dated 11 th June, 2018. 

147. On 6 th December, 2018, the DoE issued the impugned Order, 

withdrawing the recognition granted to the petitioner, with immediate 

effect. The order was purportedly issued in exercise of the powers 

conferred on the DoE by Section 24(4) of the DSE Act, but was made 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 138 of 173 

effective from 1 st April, 2019, so as not to prejudice students studying in 

the school. The reasoning in the impugned Order is contained in the 

following passages: 

" 
the foremost issue raised by Mount Carmel School is 
that the school is not running on the land allotted by DDA at 
concessional rates as was the matter of Modern School. It 
was allotted at an institutional rate; therefore, judgment of 
Hon'ble High Court does not apply to their school. The plea 
taken by the school does not hold good since as per 
allotment letter dated 9.3.2000, the land measuring 1.5 Acre 
was allotted on perpetual lease deed and the land measuring 
0.5 Acre was allotted to society for playfield on temporary 
basis on payment of nominal ground rent @ ₹ 5000/-+120% 
enhanced per acre per annum. Thus, the allotment letter 
substantiates that land has been allotted on 
nominal/concessional rates to the Mount Carmel School. 

The next issue to be examined and decided by the 
department, is whether the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme 
Court in Modern School's Case and Hon'ble High Court in 
Justice for All Vs. GNCTD in respect of seeking prior 
sanction of Director (Education) for any fee increase due to 
"condition of allotment of land" is applicable to Minority 
Schools or not. 

The plea taken by the school regarding immunity 
granted to the minority schools from the obligation attached 
to the allotment of the land and reliance on the judgments of 
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Paramati case and Hon'ble 
High Court in St. Columba case, is without merit as these 
rulings only deal with the admission of non-minority 
students under the EWS category minority school. 

In case of St Columba School Vs. Lt Governor, the 
petitioner, which was unaided minority schools has 
challenged the directions of DoEs admit children belonging 
to EWS category to the extent of 20% at entry level on the 
ground that the school was obliged to do so in view of terms 
and conditions of lease deed as the land was allotted to them 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 139 of 173 

by DDA on concessional rate. Hon'ble High Court 
considering the matter from that aspect held that state cannot 
abrogate the rights of minorities to establish and administer 
the schools of their choice, then by covenant in lease deed, 
government certainly cannot appropriate the right to 
nominate non-minority EWS students to a minority school. 
The concern of the Hon'ble High Court was to protect the 
minority feature of the school as regards admission of non-
minority students. 

Hon'ble High Court in the aforementioned judgment 
dated 19.01.2016 in WPC 4109/2013 has again clarified in 
respect of compliance of allotment of land by the Private 
Schools in respect of seeking prior sanction of Director 
(Education) for any fee increase. The relevant paragraph is 
as under: -

" 
So far as the unaided schools which are allotted 
land by DDA are concerned, in the light of the 
decision of the Supreme Court in Modern School vs. 
Union of India & Ors., (2004) 5 SCC 583, we are 
clear in our mind that they are bound to comply with 
the stipulation in the letter of allotment. Paragraph 28 
of the majority judgment in Modern School vs. Union 
of India & Ors (supra) upholds the binding nature of 
the stipulation in the letter of allotment issued by the 
DDA that the school shall not increase the rate of 
tuition fees without the prior sanction of DoE." 

Thus the judgment dated 19.01.2016 of Hon'ble High 
Court is also applicable to the unaided Minority Schools and 
there seems to be no infringement of constitutional rights of 
Minority Schools in this regards. 

Further, it is relevant to mention here that no 
differentiation was made in the minority and non-minority 
schools in the judgment of Modern School's case as well as 
in "Justice for All Vs. GNCTD" case. This seems quite 
plausible as the parents of the students studying in the 
minority schools are equally affected like parents of 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 140 of 173 

nonminority schools with any such arbitrary increase of fee 
despite the restriction to that effect i.e. with the prior 
approval of the Directorate of Education in terms of lease 
deed. 

In view of above, it is quite evident that both the 
abovementioned judgment had been passed in two different 
perspectives. In case of St Columba School Vs Lt Governor, 
the concern of the Hon'ble High Court was to protect the 
minority feature of the Schools as regards admission of non-
minority students. Whereas in the case of Justice for All vs. 
GNCTD of Delhi, the PIL was disposed with the directions 
that any school which obtained land on concessional rate, are 
bound to comply with the stipulation in the letter of 
allotment. 

Thus, it is evident that the schools has violated the 
terms of allotment of the allotment letter dated 09.03.2000 
by increasing the fee without prior sanction of Director 
(Education) and thereby has also violated the directions of 
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Modern School case and of 
the Hon'ble High Court in WPC no 4109/2013 and orders 
dated 19.02.2016, 16.04.2016, and 25.05.2018 of this 
Directorate. 

And Whereas, notice for a personnel hearing was 
issued for 16.08.2018 which was deferred for 24.08.2018 on 
the receipt of written request of the Principal of the School. 
Upon hearing on 24.08.2018, Dr. Michael Williams, Dean 
appearing for school reiterated their earlier reply and stated 
that being minority unaided school, the Hon'ble High Court 
of Delhi order dated 19.01.2016 is not applicable to them. 

Now, therefore, in the larger interest of the students, 
the undersigned is left with no other option but to exercise 
the powers conferred under sub-section 4 of Section 24 of 
the DSEAR, 1973, for withdrawal of recognition with 
immediate effect. However, keeping in view of the interest 
of students studying in the school and appearing in the Board 
examination, the recognition granted to the Mount Carmel 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 141 of 173 

School, Sector-22, Dwarka, new Delhi is hereby withdrawn 
w.e.f. 01.04.2019 for non-compliance of this Directorate's 
orders and Hon'ble Supreme Court's and High Courts orders 
as mentioned above. The school is further directed not to 
take any fresh admission for the academic session 2019-
2020." 

148. Impacted, and aggrieved, thereby, the petitioner-School has 

knocked at the doors of this Court, seeking a writ of certiorari, quashing 

the Order, dated 6 th December, 2018 supra, issued by the DoE. 

Statutory provisions relating to withdrawal of recognition by the 

DoE 

149. Withdrawal of recognition, to an unaided school, is covered by 

Section 24 of the DSE Act and Rules 50 and 56 of the DSE Rules. These 

provisions may be reproduced thus:

(4) If the manager fails to comply with any direction 
given under sub-section (3), the Director may, after

the Metropolitan Council of Delhi, as the case may 
be." 

"56. Suspension or withdrawal of recognition -

(1) If a school ceases to fulfill any requirement of 
the Act or any of the conditions specified in rule 50 or 
fails to provide any facility specified in rule 51, the 
appropriate authority may, after giving to the school a 
reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the 
proposed action, withdraw for reason to be recorded in 
writing, recognition from the school: Provided that 
where the appropriate authority is satisfied that the 
deficiencies or defects are capable of immediate or 
early removal, it may, instead of withdrawing the 
recognition suspend the recognition for such period as 
it may think fit to enable I he managing committee of 
the school to remedy the deficiencies or defects to the 
satisfaction of the appropriate authority: Provided 
further that where the recognition of a school has been 
withdrawn or suspended, no appropriate authority 
shall grant recognition of such school whether run by 
the name by which it was known at the time of such 
withdrawal or suspension or by any other name, 
unless the school has removed the deficiencies or 
defects for which the recognition has been withdrawn 
or suspended. 

(2) A recognised school which provides for hostel 
facilities shall comply with the provisions of rule 39 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 146 of 173 

and the instructions made there under, and in case of 
any default in complying with such provisions or 
instructions, the appropriate authority may for reasons 
to be recorded in writing, withdraw the recognition in 
relation to the school itself. 

(3) Where recognition of any school is withdrawn, 
the reasons for withdrawal of such recognition shall be 
communicated to the managing committee within 
seven days from the date on which the recognition is

withdrawal of recognition of the school managed by it 
may, within thirty days from the date of 
communication to it of the withdrawal of recognition, 
prefer an appeal against such withdrawal to the 
authority specified in rule 58." 

150. Withdrawal of recognition, of a running school, is an extreme step. 

It throws, into complete jeopardy, not only the school but, more 

importantly, the teachers, the staff and the students studying in the school. 

The damage caused, by an act of withdrawal of recognition, is often as 

immeasurable as it is irremediable. The compliance, with the above-

extracted provisions in the DSE Act and the DSE Rules, under which, 

alone, withdrawal of recognition, of the school, may be effected is, 

therefore, of the utmost essence. 

Rival submissions at the Bar 

151. Mr. Sunil Gupta, who acted as helmsman, steering the course of 

the petitioner, in this case, as well, through the murky Pai-Islamic 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 147 of 173 

Academy-Inamdar-Modern School-DAM-Justice for All waters, 

advanced the following submissions: 

(i) 
The act of withdrawing recognition of the petitioner was 

contrary to the provisions of the DSE Act and the DSE 

Rules, which stands reproduced hereinabove. Even if it were 

to be assumed that there was a violation, by the petitioner, of 

the "land clause", that could not invite de-recognition. The 

contract between the petitioner and the DDA, the allotment 

letter, whereby land was allotted for setting up of the 

petitioner-School, did not contemplate de-recognition of the 

School, as a consequence of violation of the said clause. 

(ii) The Recognition Certificate, issued to the petitioner by the 

DoE, did not refer to any "prior approval", but referred, 

instead, only to Section 17(3). 

(iii) The Modern School mandate, even if it were to be deemed 

to exist, did not direct the DoE to recognise the school, if it 

was found to be violating the "land clause". 

(iv) There was no allegation of profiteering, against the 

petitioner. In the absence thereof, there was no requirement, 

on the part of the petitioner, to take prior approval of the 

DoE, before increasing its fees. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 148 of 173 

(v) The "land clause" could not override the spirit and the 

scheme of Section 17(3) of the DSE Act, which had the 

imprimatur of Delhi Abhibhavak Mahasangh-II (supra). 

(vi) The DoE could not sit, indefinitely, over the Statement of 

Fees, submitted by the petitioner under Section 17(3) of the 

DSE Act and, thereafter, when the petitioner enhanced its 

fees, proceed to withdraw recognition from the petitioner on 

the ground that it had violated the provisions of the Act. 

(vii) The manner in which the DoE had proceeded, in the present 

case, was in stark violation of the fundamental rights of the 

petitioner, under Article 19(1)(g) read with Article 30(1) of 

the Constitution of India. 

(viii) Minority schools were not required to take "prior approval", 

before enhancing their fees. Reliance was placed, for this 

purpose, on the following decisions: 

(a) Ahmedabad St. Xaviers' College Society (supra), 

(b) Lily Kurian v. Lewina, (1979) 2 SCC 124, 

(c) All Saints High School v. Govt of Andhra Pradesh, 
(1980) 2 SCC 478 and 

(d) Frank Anthony Public School v. U.O.I., (1986) 4 
SCC 707, 

(e) St. Columba's School v. Lieutenant Governor of 
Delhi, (2014) SCC OnLine Del 4448 and 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 149 of 173 

(f) 
Mount Carmel School v. D.D.A., (2017) SCC OnLine 
Del 6620 

(ix) Mr. Sunil Gupta sought to point out that, in the above 

decisions, the conditions regarding admission of students 

from the economically weaker sections, and the 

"neighbourhood" clause, which were also part of the 

allotment letter whereby land had been allotted by the DDA, 

had been held to be not enforceable against minority schools. 

Equally, Mr. Gupta would seek to submit, the "land clause" 

was also not enforceable against minority schools. 

(x) The law, as enunciated in the decisions to which reference 

has already been made hereinabove, only required the school 

to desist from profiteering and from charging of capitation 

fee. 

(xi) The DoE had sat on the Statement of Fee, submitted by the 

petitioner on 15 th March, 2018. 

(xii) The recital, in the very first sentence of the impugned Order 

dated 6 th December, 2018, to the effect that "numerous 

complaints" had been received, in the office of the DoE, 

against the petitioner School, was misleading as well as 

untrue. The counter-affidavit of the DoE revealed that there 

were only two such complaints, which had been annexed, 

collectively, as Annexure R-4 to the counter-affidavit. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 150 of 173 

(xiii) It was stated, in the impugned Order, that the reply, dated 8 th 

November, 2016, submitted by the petitioner to the Show 

Cause Notice dated 3 rd October, 2016, had been "examined 

in the light of the provisions of section 17(3) of the Delhi 

School Education Act, 1973…". The outcome of the said 

examination was, however, neither known, nor disclosed. 

152. Responding to the above submissions of Mr. Gupta, Mr. Ramesh 

Singh, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the DoE, submitted that 

the judgment of the Supreme Court in Modern School (supra) clearly 

confirmed the requirement, of the school, to take prior approval of the 

DoE, before increasing its fee. The power of the DoE to regulate the fees 

fixed by the school was upheld, Mr. Singh would submit, in the said 

decision. The enforcement of the "land clause", vis-à-vis the fee fixed by 

the School was, he submits, directly in issue in Modern School (supra). 

The regulatory power of the DoE, as confirmed in the said decision, 

according to him, would apply, equally, to minority schools, subject to 

the sole caveat that such application did not denude or affect the minority 

character of the school. For this purpose, reliance was placed on 

paragraphs 122, 124, 125, 126 and 138 of the report in T. M. A. Pai 

(supra). 

153. Mr. Singh took me through the various judgments, to which 

reference has already been made hereinabove, and also relied on a 

decision, of the High Court of Gujarat, in Atulkumar Niranjanbhai Dave 

v. State of Gujarat (MANU/GJ/2152/2017). 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 151 of 173 

154. Drawing attention to the fact that Modern School (supra) had 

mandated that his client ensure compliance with the "land clause", by the 

schools, who had been allotted land, with the said clause thrown in, Mr. 

Singh sought to "ask himself" as to how he could ensure such 

compliance, save and except by resorting to the coercive measure of 

withdrawal of recognition, were such compliance not to be forthcoming 

from the School. It was also pointed out that Condition 11, in the 

conditions governing grant of provisional recognition, to the petitioner, 

also clarified that fees, during the ensuing academic session, would not be 

enhanced without the prior approval of the DoE. 

155. Mr. Singh also sought to place reliance on Section 4(4) of the DSE 

Act. Inasmuch as the said sub-section refers back to sub-section (1) of 

the same Section, sub-Sections (1) and (4) of Section 4 of the DSE Act 

may, to advantage, be reproduced thus: 

"4. Recognition of schools. -

(1) The appropriate authority may, on an 
application made to it in the prescribed format the 
prescribed manner, recognise any private school: 

Provided that no school shall be recognised unless -

(a) it has adequate funds to ensure its 
financial stability and regular payment of salary 
and allowances to its employees; 

(b) it has a duly approved scheme of 
management as required by section 5; 

(c) it 
has 
suitable 
or 
adequate 
accommodation and sanitary facilities having 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 152 of 173 

regard, among other factors, to the number, age 
and sex of the pupils attending it; 

(d) it provides for approved courses of study 
and efficient instruction; 

(e) it has features with prescribed 
qualifications; and 

(f) 
It has the prescribed facilities for physical 
education, library service, laboratory work, 
workshop practice of co-curricular activities. 

(4) Where the managing committee of the school 
obtains recognition by fraud, misrepresentation or 
suppression of material particulars or where, after 
obtaining recognition, the school failed to continue to 
comply with any of the conditions specified in the 
proviso to sub-section(1), the authority granting the 
recognition may, after giving the managing committee 
of the school a reasonable opportunity of showing 
cause against the proposed action, withdraw the 
recognition granted to such school under sub-section 
(1)." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Mr. Singh also placed reliance on clause (xviii) of Rule 50 of the DSE 

Rules, which already stands reproduced, in extenso, hereinabove. Under 

the DSE Act, therefore, Mr. Singh would seek to point out that the only 

manner in which the DoE could take action against the delinquent school, 

would be to derecognise the school, or to take over the management. The 

latter option being not available in the case of minority schools, the DoE 

was, he would submit, well within its right in withdrawing the 

recognition granted to the petitioner. Modern School (supra), it is 

pointed out, directed the DoE to undertake investigation and ensure 

compliance with the "land clause". The said direction was reiterated by 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 153 of 173 

this Court in Justice for All-I (supra). The only manner in which the 

DoE could "ensure" such "compliance", it is submitted, was by taking 

recourse to sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 24 of the DSE Act. Where 

the judgment was silent, on the manner in which it was to be 

implemented, Mr. Singh would submit, it was permissible to take 

recourse to the statute, for which proposition he relies on Gajraj Singh v. 

State of U.P., (2001) 5 SCC 762. 

156. It is not as if, Mr. Singh would submit, the DoE acted in haste. As 

many as three notices were issued, to the petitioner, resulting, in each 

case, in the petitioner "stonewalling" the DoE, by merely submitting a 

reply to the notice, without ensuring compliance therewith. In these 

circumstances, Mr. Singh would submit that the school had, as it were, 

pushed the DoE to the wall, leaving it with no option but to pass the 

impugned order. Even at this stage, Mr. Singh would seek to point out, 

the petitioner could seek prior approval of the DoE, for the increase of 

fees, and rectify the omission. 

157. Advancing submissions by way of rejoinder, Mr. Sunil Gupta, 

learned Senior Counsel, pointed out that the petitioner had filed its 

Statement of Fee, under Section 17(3) of the DSE Act and had, thereby, 

complied with the Modern School (supra) mandate. The DoE, on the 

other hand, did nothing with the said Statement, but sat on it, deeming the 

petitioner with no option but to increase the fees, as per its Statement of 

Fee. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 154 of 173 

158. Mr. Gupta further pointed out that the communication, dated 9 th 

March, 2000, of the DDA, whereby land was allotted to the petitioner, did 

not contain any condition of prior approval, before the petitioner were to 

enhance its fees. The reference of the "ensuing academic session", in 

Clause 11 of the said document, Mr. Gupta would seek to submit, related 

to the second part of Section 17(3) of the DSE Act. 

159. Mr. Gupta also emphatically opposes the submission, of Mr. Singh, 

that his client had, at any stage, "stonewalled" the DoE. All that his client 

had done, Mr. Gupta points out, was to impress, on the DoE, the fact that 

the condition of prior approval would not apply to it, as it was a minority 

educational institution and to request the DoE, therefore, to examine the 

Statement of Fees submitted by it. This, in his submission, could never be 

regarded as "stonewalling". Despite this aspect having been brought to 

the notice of the DoE repeatedly, no decision was taken, by the DoE, for 

as long as three years. In fact, Mr. Gupta would seek to submit, it was the 

DoE which was in contempt of Modern School (supra) and Justice For 

All (supra). 

160. The mandamus in paragraph 28 of Modern School (supra), Mr. 

Gupta would seek to point out, was effectively to proceed under Section 

17(3) of the DSE Act. The attempt, of Mr. Singh, to read the said 

direction as empowering the DoE to proceed, against the petitioner, under 

Section 24 of the said Act, it was submitted, was totally misguided. Mr. 

Gupta emphatically refutes the submission of Mr. Singh, that Section 24 

of the DSE Act was the only avenue open to the DoE, to ensure 

compliance with the "land clause", pointing out that it was always open 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 155 of 173 

to the DoE to examine the Statement of Fees submitted by the petitioner 

and take a decision, thereon, on merits, as to whether the increase in fee, 

stated therein, was justifiable, or unjustifiable. He draws my attention, in 

this context, to Section 18(5) of the DSE Act, read with Rules 59 and 180 

of the DSE Rules which requires every return, submitted by the school, to 

be audited. This, Mr. Gupta would submit, was never done. 

161. Making a final submission by way of surrejoinder, as it were, Mr. 

Singh would seek to point out that, by submitting its Statement of Fee 

under Section 17(3) of the DSE Act, the petitioner convey the impression 

that the said submission was not for the purpose of obtaining "prior 

approval" as, under the said sub-section, prior approval was required to 

be obtained only in the case of midsession hike of fees. 

Analysis 

Whether the impugned action of withdrawal of recognition of the 
petitioner-School was bad for want of jurisdiction 

162. It would be appropriate, at the very outset, to examine the 

objection, of the petitioner, that the DoE did not have the jurisdiction to 

withdraw the petitioner's recognition, vide the impugned Order dated 6 th 

December, 2018. 

163. Mr. Ramesh Singh seeks to source the jurisdiction, of his client, to 

pass the impugned Order, withdrawing the petitioner's recognition, to the 

directions contained in paragraph 27 of the judgment in Modern School 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 156 of 173 

(supra), which stands reproduced in paragraph 84 supra. Direction (c), in 

the said paragraph, directs the DoE "to ascertain whether terms of 

allotment of land by the Government to the schools have been complied 

with". Paragraph 28 of the report clarifies, once again, that the Supreme 

Court was "directing the DoE to look into letters of allotment issued by 

the Government and ascertain whether they have been complied with by 

the schools." Towards the conclusion of the said paragraph, the Supreme 

Court directs the DoE, in case he finds non-compliance with the terms of 

allotment, to "take appropriate steps" in this regard. 

164. Nowhere, in paragraph 28 of the judgment in Modern School 

(supra), does the Supreme Court even direct the DoE to ensure 

compliance with the "land clause"; far less does it, expressly or by 

necessary implication, authorise the DoE to withdraw the recognition of 

the School, for such non-compliance. Even the steps, which the said 

paragraph directs the DoE to take, in the event of non-compliance with 

the allotment conditions (including the "land clause"), had necessarily to 

be "appropriate". 

165. The question that would then arise is, therefore, whether the law 

permits the DoE, in the event of non-compliance with the "land clause", 

by any particular School, to withdraw the recognition granted to it. 

166. No provision, akin to the "land clause", i.e., requiring the petitioner 

to take prior approval of the DoE, before increasing its fees, is to be 

found, anywhere in the DSE Act, or in the DSE Rules. It cannot, 

therefore, be said that, even if a particular school violates the "land 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 157 of 173 

clause", i.e. increase its fees without taking prior approval of the DoE, it 

has violated any provision of the DSE Act, or the DSE Rules. Prior 

approval of the DoE, before increase of fees, it is conceded at the Bar by 

both sides, is required only where increase of fees is a mid-session 

exercise, and not otherwise. 

167. Mr. Ramesh Singh has sought to submit that the action, of 

withdrawing the petitioner's recognition, was taken, by the DoE, in 

exercise of the powers conferred by Section 24(4), and, that the judgment 

of the Supreme Court in Modern School (supra) authorised the DoE to 

do so. I have already noted, hereinabove, that the Supreme Court, in 

Modern School (supra) only authorised the DoE to "take appropriate 

action", in case any school was found not to be complying with the 

allotment conditions. 

168. There is no reference, in the said judgment, to Section 24, and Mr. 

Ramesh Singh does not dispute this fact. It is a well settled proposition of 

law that no more can be read into a judgment than is expressly stated 

therein. Equally well-settled is the ancillary proposition that the judgment 

is an authority only for what it states, and not for what may be read into 

the judgment by implication. (Refer: Union of India v. Chajju Ram 

(dead) by LRs. AIR 2003 SC 2339) 

169. What Mr. Ramesh Singh would seek to contend, however, is that 

the power to act, under Section 24(4), can be read into the directions 

contained in paragraph 24 of the judgment in Modern School (supra). 

Can it, though? 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 158 of 173 

170. I am of the opinion that the attempt, of Mr. Ramesh Singh, to trace 

the authority of the DoE, in the present case, to withdraw the recognition 

granted to the petitioner, to Section 24(4) of the DSE Act, is completely 

misguided. Section 24 constitutes a self-contained scheme, dealing with 

"Inspection of schools". At the cost of reiteration, the said Section may be 

reproduced, thus: 

"24. Inspection of schools. -

(1) Every recognised school shall be inspected at 
least once in each financial year in such manner as 
may be prescribed. 

(2) The Director may also arrange special 
inspection of any school on such aspects of its 
working as may, from time to time, be considered 
necessary by him. 

(3) The Director may give directions to the 
manager to rectify any defects or deficiency found at 
the time of inspection or otherwise in the working of 
the school. 

(4) If the manager fails to comply with the direction 
given under sub-section (3), the Director may, after 
considering the explanation or report, if any, given or 
made by the manager, take such action as he may 
think fit, including -

(a) stoppage of aid, 
(b) withdrawal of recognition, or 
(c) except in the case of minority school 
taking over of the school under section 20." 

171. The scheme of Section 24 is unmistakable. The withdrawal of the 

recognition of a school may be resorted to, under sub-section (4) of the 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 159 of 173 

said Section, only if the Manager of the school fails to comply with the 

direction given under sub-section (3) thereof. Such direction, in its place, 

has to be "to rectify any defects or deficiency found at the time of 

inspection or otherwise in the working of the school", and has to follow 

any inspection, which takes place under sub-section (1), or sub-section 

(2). There has, therefore, in the first instance, to be an inspection of the 

school. Following on the inspection, if any defects or deficiencies, in the 

working of the school, are found, the Director is to give directions to the 

Manager of the school to rectify the same. It is only where such directions 

are not complied with, that the DoE can proceed, under sub-section (4), to 

take further action, which may include withdrawal of recognition. 

172. It is significant that, even under sub-section (4), withdrawal of 

recognition is not the inevitable sequitur to non-compliance, by the 

Manager of the school, with the directions issued under sub-section (3) of 

Section 24. It is only one of the measures which could be taken by the 

Director, which, themselves, need not be limited to the three measures 

enumerated at (a) to (c) of Section 24(4), as is made clear by the use of 

the word "including", in the said sub-section. If, therefore, the DoE 

chooses to adopt the extreme step of withdrawal of recognition of the 

school, it would be necessary for the order, passed to the said effect, to 

justify taking of such an extreme step, instead of any other step which 

could, alternatively, be taken. 

173. In the present case, however, it is not necessary for this Court to 

proceed to that stage as, in my view, sub-section (4) of Section 24 was 

totally inapplicable. The impugned Order of withdrawal of recognition 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 160 of 173 

does not purport to have been passed as a sequel to non-compliance, by 

the petitioner, which any directions issued under sub-section (3) of the 

DSE Act, following upon an inspection of the School, in accordance with 

the scheme of Section 24. 

174. In this context, it is necessary to note, once again, that sub-section 

(3) of Section 24 contemplates directions being issued by the DoE, to the 

school to rectify any defect or deficiency found in the working of the 

school. These are words of definite import. "Defect" is defined, in P. 

Ramanatha Aiyar's Major Law Lexicon, as "a shortcoming; a fault, flaw, 

imperfection". In Tale v. Latham, 66 LJQB 351, Bruce, J., speaking for 

the Queen's Bench, defined "defect" in the following terms: 

"A want or absence of something necessary or essential for 
completeness or perfection; shortcoming; blemish. It 
includes the idea of a fault or want of perfection. It means a 
lack or absence of something essential to completeness." 

175. Similarly, the following definition of "deficiency" as contained in 

the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, was adopted, with approval, by the 

Supreme Court, in Patel Roadways v. Birla Yamaha Ltd, (2000) 4 SCC 

91: 

" 'Deficiency' means any fault, imperfection, shortcoming or 
inadequacy in the quality, nature and manner of performance 
which is required to be maintained by or under any law for 
the time being in force or has been undertaken to be 
performed by a person in pursuance of a contract or 
otherwise in relation to any service." 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 161 of 173 

176. These definitions, it would be apparent, conform, by and large, to 

the etymological, common parlance understanding of the expressions 

"defect" and "deficiency". 

177. Thus understood, irrespective of the correctness, or even legality, 

of the manner in which the petitioner was fixing its fees, it cannot, in my 

opinion, be said that, for that reason, any "defect" or "deficiency", in the 

working of the petitioner-School, existed. There is no allegation, 

whatsoever, that any deficiency existed, in the working of the 

establishment of the petitioner. 

178. On its plain terms, therefore, Section 24(3) of the DSE Act would 

have no application to a case such as this. Per sequitur, sub-section (4), of 

Section 24, equally, could have no application. It would, therefore, be 

entirely improper to read the directions, contained in paragraph 24 of the 

report in Modern School (supra) as directing the DoE to proceed, against 

the petitioner, in a manner which was not permissible under the statute. 

179. In fact, a bare reading of paragraph 24 of Modern School (supra) 

makes it clear that the directions, contained therein, were issued in 

exercise of the extraordinary power, vested in the Supreme Court by 

Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Needless to say, under the said 

provision, the Supreme Court could, at all times, direct statutory 

authorities to perform acts which were not required to be relatable to any 

existing statutory provision, guided solely by the consideration of the 

interests of justice. It would be doing disservice to the said extraordinary 

jurisdiction, of the Supreme Court, and the exercise thereof, as reflected 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 162 of 173 

in paragraph 24 of Modern School (supra), to read the said paragraph as 

requiring the DoE to exercise powers vested in it by Section 24 of the 

DSE Act. 

180. The submission of Mr. Ramesh Singh, to the effect that paragraph 

24 of the judgment in Modern School (supra) authorised the DoE to take 

action under Section 24(4) of the DSE Act has, therefore, to be rejected 

as completely misconceived. 

181. Can, then, the DoE seek recourse to the DSE Rules, to justify this 

action? Mr. Ramesh Singh would seek to do so, basing his submission on 

Rule 50 and 56 of the DSE Rules. 

182. The power to make rules conferred by Section 28 of the DSE Act. 

Sub-section (1) thereof empowers the Administrator to, with the previous 

approval of the Central Government, and by previous publication by 

notification, "make rules to carry out the provisions of the Act". This, by 

itself, indicates that the DSE Rules cannot be so interpreted as to permit 

something which the DSE Act does not. I have already opined, 

hereinabove, that the withdrawal of recognition of the petitioner, by the 

DoE, and the manner in which the said withdrawal was effected, was not 

in accordance with any provision of the DSE Act, and could not be stated 

to be authorised thereby. The inevitable corollary would be that the said 

decision could not be authorised by any provisions of the DSE Rules, 

either, as, then, the Rules would be infracting Section 28(1) of the DSE 

Act and would, to that extent, be ultra vires. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 163 of 173 

183. Strictly speaking, therefore, it would not be necessary to embark 

into an analysis of the DSE Rules, or of Rule 50 or 56 therein. As the said 

provisions have been pressed into service by Mr. Singh, however, I would 

make the requisite allusion thereto. 

184. Before doing so, however, it is significant to note that, while sub-

section (2) of Section 28 enumerates certain aspects in respect of which 

the said provision specifically empowers the framing of Rules, 

withdrawal of recognition of unaided schools is not one of them. 

185. Adverting, now, to the DSE Rules, the Show Cause Notice, dated 

25 th May, 2018 supra invokes Rule 56 of the said Rules. Rule 56, which 

already stands reproduced hereinabove, contemplates, in sub-rule (1) 

thereof, issuance of a Show Cause Notice, against proposed withdrawal 

of recognition, in any one of three circumstances. These are (i) if the 

school ceases to fulfil any requirement of the DSE Act, (ii) if the school 

ceases to fulfil any of the conditions specified in Rule 50 of the DSE 

Rules, or (iii) if the school fails to provide any facility specified in Rule 

51 of the DSE Rules. The third of these circumstances, clearly, would not 

apply, there is no allegation that the petitioner failed to provide any 

facility specified in Rule 51 of the DSE Rules. Insofar as the first and 

second circumstances are concerned, it is significant that the Show Cause 

Notice contains the following clear acknowledgement: 

"And whereas, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgement 
dated 27.04.2004 in the matter of Modern School Vs Union 
of India & Ors held that so far as allotment of land by DDA 
is concerned, suffice it to point out that the same has no 
bearing with the enforcement of the provisions of the Act and 
the rules framed thereunder but indisputable the institutions 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 164 of 173 

are bound by the terms and conditions of allotment. In the 
event of such terms and conditions of allotment have been 
violated by the allottees, the appropriate statutory authorities 
would be at liberty to take appropriate step as is permissible 
in law." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

This single assertion, in the Show Cause Notice is, by itself, more than 

sufficient to discountenance the reliance, placed by Mr. Ramesh Singh, 

on the provisions of the DSE Act and the DSE Rules, or the contention 

that the withdrawal of recognition, of the petitioner, by the DoE, could be 

justified thereunder. Even otherwise, inasmuch as the DSE Act does not 

contain any provision which requires an unaided school to obtain prior 

approval, before increasing its fees, save and except in the case of mid-

session increase, it cannot be said that the petitioner had, for want of 

obtaining any such prior approval, infracted any of the provisions of the 

DSE Act. There could be no question, therefore, of invocation of Rule 56 

of the DSE Rules, either, as the justification for the decision, of the DoE, 

to withdraw the recognition of the petitioner-School. 

186. But how then, Mr. Singh would seek to "ask himself", could the 

DoE ensure compliance, by the schools, with the "land clause"? As I have 

already noted hereinabove, paragraph 24 of the judgment in Modern 

School (supra) did not require the DoE to ensure any such compliance, 

but only to ascertain whether such compliance had taken place, or not 

and, in the latter eventuality, to act in accordance with the law. The 

"law", in that regard, would unquestionably include the provisions of the 

DSE Act and the DSE Rules. If, therefore, the DSE Act and the DSE 

Rules did not authorise the DoE to withdraw the recognition of the 

petitioner, for the perceived default, on its part, in obtaining "prior 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 165 of 173 

approval" of the DoE, before increasing its fees, paragraph 24 or Modern 

School (supra), too, could not do so. 

187. While Modern School (supra) did not direct the DoE to ensure 

compliance, by the schools, with the "land clause", paragraph 18 of the 

report of the judgment of this Court in Justice For All (supra), 

unquestionably, does so. In the said paragraph, this Court directed the 

DoE to "ensure the compliance of term, if any, in the letter of allotment 

regarding the increase of fees by all the recognised unaided schools 

which are allotted land by DDA". The respondent would, therefore, be 

justified in contending that it was required to "ensure compliance", by the 

schools, of the "land clause", where the said clause applied. 

188. Apropos the query posed by Mr. Singh, i.e., as to how the DoE 

could "ensure compliance", by the schools, with the "land clause". 

Needless to say, such "ensuring" of compliance could not be in a manner 

for it to the provisions of the statute, or alien to the powers conferred, on 

the DoE, thereby and thereunder. Indeed, as no such "land clause" finds 

itself in the DSE Act, the DSE Rules, the statutes would not, quite 

obviously, provide for the action to be taken in the eventuality of non-

compliance with the said clause. 

189. "The land clause" is a creature of contract. It was inserted in the 

contracts/letters whereby land was allotted, to the schools, by the DDA. It 

does not, expressly or by necessary implication, seek to source itself to 

any provision of the DSE Act, of the DSE Rules. It is, therefore, in a way 

sui generis. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 166 of 173 

190. Being a creature of the contract between the DDA and the schools 

to which the land had been allotted, the consequence of infraction of the 

"land clause" would also necessarily have to be traced to the said contract 

itself. It is not necessary for this Court to enter into this arena, as I am 

seized only with the issue of the legality, or otherwise, of the impugned 

Order, passed by the DoE, withdrawing the recognition from the 

petitioner-School. It appears, however, that the answer to the above poser 

is to be found in the judgment of this Court in Justice For All (supra) 

itself, in the concluding directions, whereby it has been directed that "the 

Respondent No. 2/DDA shall also take appropriate steps, in accordance 

with law, in case of violation of such stipulation in the letter of allotment 

by the unaided schools". In view thereof, it may be a moot point as to 

whether the DDA can take action, against the School, for violation of the 

said clause. As already noted hereinabove, I, however, do not propose to 

venture any opinion on the said issue, as it does not fall for consideration 

in these proceedings. 

191. It has, therefore, necessarily to be held that, in withdrawing the 

recognition of the petitioner-School, the DoE acted in excess of the 

authority vested in it, and that the said action cannot be sought to be 

sustained on the basis of the directions contained, either in Modern 

School (supra), or in Justice For All (supra). Neither of these decisions 

could be said to have empowered the DoE to take action, against the 

petitioner, in a manner unknown to the DSE Act or the DSE Rules. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 167 of 173 

192. Proceeding, now, to the merits of the impugned Order, i.e., to the 

validity of the objection, by the DoE, regarding non-obtaining, by the 

petitioner, "prior approval" of the DoE, before enhancing its fees, it 

would become apparent, from a reading of the discussion hereinabove, 

and the law laid down by the various decisions cited in that regard, that, 

in the matter of fixation of fees, the distinction, between the rights of 

unaided non-minority schools, and unaided minority schools, is 

practically chimerical. In both cases, the schools are entitled to complete 

autonomy in the matter of fixation of their fees and management of their 

accounts, subject only to the condition that they do not indulge in 

profiteering, and do not charge capitation fee, thereby "commercialising" 

education. There is no requirement for the school to take "prior 

approval", of the DoE, before enhancing its fees. The only responsibility, 

on the School, is to submit its statement of fee, as required by Section 

17(3) of the DSE Act. Mr. Gupta is right in his submission that, having 

done so, the schools could not be expected to wait ad infinitum, before 

the said statement of fees, submitted by them, was examined and verified 

by the DoE. Any such examination and verification, too, it is clarified, 

would have to be limited to the issue of whether, by fixing its fees, or 

enhancing the same, the school was "commercialising" education, either 

by charging capitation fee or by indulging in profiteering. If, therefore, 

pending the decision of the DoE on its Statement of Fee, the school 

decided to commence charging the enhanced fee from the beginning of 

the next academic session, it cannot be said that the school had, in any 

manner, infracted the provisions of the DSE Act or the DSE Rules. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018

193. The impugned Order dated 6 th December, 2018 contains no 

allegations, against the petitioner of "commercialisation" of education, by 

profiteering or charging capitation fee. A fortiori, the impugned Order, in 

withdrawing the recognition of the petitioner-School on the ground that it 

has not obtained "prior approval" of the DoE before increasing its fees, is 

completely unsustainable, on facts as well as in law. 

194. In St. Columba's School (supra), the Order, dated 18 th December, 

2013, and the Notification, dated 30 th December, 2013, issued by the 

Hon'ble Lieutenant Governor, which were challenged, directed private 

unaided minority schools to admit children, belonging to the 

Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), to the extent of 20% at the entry 

level and to provide free ship to them till the completion of the school 

education. One of the submissions, advanced by the respondent, to justify 

the issuance of the said Notification in the Order was that land had been 

provided, to the school, at concessional rates, because of the sponsorship 

by the DoE, which carried, with it, the obligation to admit students 

belonging to the EWS category. The following passage, from the 

judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Pramati 

Educational & Cultural Trust v. U.O.I., (2014) 8 SCC 1, was relied 

upon, by a learned Single Judge of this Court, adjudicating the above 

controversy: 

"Under Article 30(1) of the Constitution, all minorities, 
whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to 
establish and administer educational institutions of their 
choice. Religious and linguistic minorities, therefore, have a 
special constitutional right to establish and administer 
educational schools of their choice and this Court has 
repeatedly held that the State has no power to interfere with 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 169 of 173 

the administration of minority institutions and can make only 
regulatory measures and has no power to force admission of 
students from amongst non-minority communities, 
particularly in minority schools, so as to affect the minority 
character of the institutions." 

Taking a leaf, as it were, from the above extracted passage from Pramati 

Educational & Cultural Trust (supra), this Court proceeded to hold, in 

paragraph 5 of the judgment, that "as the Constitution Bench has held that 

even after amending the Constitution, the State cannot abrogate the rights 

of the minorities to establish and administer schools of their choice, then 

by a covenant in a lease deed, Government certainly cannot appropriate 

the right to nominate non-minority EWS students to minority school." In 

the circumstances, this Court opined that "the Constitutional mandate will 

prevail de hors any alleged provision in the lease deed." 

195. I have already noted, hereinbefore, that the submission of Mr. 

Ramesh Singh, to the effect that the protective umbrella, of Article 30(1) 

of the Constitution of India only extended to ensuring that the minority 

status of institutions established by minorities, would remain preserved, is 

not strictly correct and that the said Article not only preserves the 

minority status of such institutions, but also preserves their autonomy to 

establish and administer themselves, and manage their affairs, a core 

ingredient, whereof, was the right to fix their fees. It would not, therefore, 

be permissible to the respondents to enforce, against a minority 

institution, any covenant, in the deed whereunder land was allotted to it, 

in such a manner as to abrogate the fundamental right of such institution, 

as conferred by Article 30. 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 170 of 173 

196. In view of the above, it becomes unnecessary for me to adjudicate 

on the controversy of whether land had, or had not, in fact, been allotted 

to the petitioner at concessional rate. Even if it were to be assumed that 

the land allotted to the petitioner was at concessional rate, that would not 

justify the issuance of the impugned Order dated 6 th December, 2018. 

197. Mount Carmel School (supra) -filed by the petitioner before this 

Court in the instant case -sought quashing of a Notification, dated 7 th 

January, 2017, issued by the DoE, to the extent applied to the petitioner, 

and for reading down Condition No. 20 of the allotment letter issued by 

the DDA, with an attendant declaration that the said clause could not 

override the constitutional rights of the petitioner. The clauses, in the said 

Notification, with which the petitioner claimed to be aggrieved, required 

the school to offer admission to students residing within 1 km, failing 

which the students residing within 1 to 3 km, and, failing that, to students 

residing within 3 to 6 km, of the school, before opening admission to 

students residing beyond the said distance. Specifically in respect of 

minority schools, the Notification, while acknowledging the right of 

minority schools to reserve seats for students belonging to the minority 

concerned, directed that the remaining unreserved seats would be treated 

as Open/General seats, and admission to these seats would be conducted 

on the basis of the "neighbourhood" limits, to which reference has 

already been made hereinabove. The vexing Clause 20 of the allotment 

letter, whereunder land was allotted to the petitioner, prohibited the 

petitioner from refusing admission "to the residents of the locality". 

These clauses, the petitioner sought to contend, infringed the right 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 171 of 173 

available to it under Article 30 (1) of the Constitution of India, to which 

any clause in the lease deed would necessarily have to subjugate itself. 

This Court, adjudicating the controversy, placed reliance on the decision 

in Ahmedabad St Xavier's College (supra), observing that, in the said 

decision, it had been categorically held that "minorities based on religion 

have the right to establish and administer educational institutions 

imparting general secular education within the meaning of Article 30 of 

the Constitution of India. It was also noted that the 11-Judge bench of the 

Supreme Court had, in T. M. A. Pai (supra), held that unaided private 

schools were entitled to maximum autonomy with regard to admission of 

students at the school level, and that "autonomy and non-regulation of the 

school administration in the right of appointment, admission of the 

students and the fee to be charged will ensure that more such institutions 

are established." Further, it was noted that Pramati (supra) held that the 

power, under Article 21-A of the Constitution, could not extend to 

making of law which would abrogate the right of minorities to establish 

and administer schools of their choice. The DoE had, in the said case, 

advanced a submission that the impugned Notification only sought to 

enforce a contractual term, which constituted a waiver of the fundamental 

right of the schools. This argument, too, was negatived, relying, inter 

alia, on the earlier decision of this Court in Modern School (supra). The 

matter was reiterated, in this decision, with greater emphasis, in the 

following words: 

"Consequently, this Court is prima facie of the view that the 
State cannot enforce the contract of a covenant in the lease 
deed/allotment letter in violation of the fundamental right 
guaranteed under Article 30 of the Constitution, as it 
constitutes a basic feature of the Constitution." 
(Emphasis supplied) 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018

198. Though the above observations were entered, by this Court, at the 

interlocutory stage and are, therefore, necessarily prima facie in nature, 

they represent, in my opinion, the correct legal position. 

Conclusion 

199. For all the above reasons, the impugned Order, dated 6 th December, 

2018, issued by the DoE, whereby the recognition of the petitioner-

School has been withdrawn, cannot sustain the scrutiny of the law, and 

deserves, therefore, to be set aside. 

200. It is ordered accordingly. 

201. The writ petition is therefore allowed, with no order as to costs. 

A Postscript 

202. It is, probably, too much to expect that the omega to the 

controversy in this case will stand written with this pronouncement. If 

eleven Hon'ble Judges of the highest court of the land, the exercise of 

their collective wisdom, and the classic exposition of the law, as it 

emerged therefrom in the form of T. M. A. Pai (supra), could not still the 

waters, my humble effort is hardly likely to do so. I can only, therefore, 

close with the fond -perhaps too fond? -hope that, some day, calm 

would descend on the issue, and the educational edifice of our country 


W.P.(C) 4374/2018 & W.P.(C) 13546/2018 

Page 173 of 173 

would get down to doing what it was created, and intended, to do from 

the beginning -which is the dissemination of education, and the bringing 

forth, for the eons to come, of a generation enlightened and illumined 

with the light of knowledge and learning.
