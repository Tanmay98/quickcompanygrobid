brother Bharat had also gone to Imphal and stayed there and attended the 

ceremonies. He further stated that he made the payment for their stay and 

accommodation. He further submitted that during the ceremonies, traditional 

dress and jewelleris had been given to Reena and he made payment for the 

same. The accused played reliance on the bills regarding the payment of 

accommodation and stay of family of Reena and also regarding the purchase of 

various gifts, the bills of jewellery and furniture Ex.DW-1/A (collectively 04 in 

number), the bills of traditional dress, i.e., Fanek Ex.DW-1/B (collectively 6 in 

number) and the bills of hotel accommodation and stay of family of Reena 

Ex.DW1/C (collectively 15 in number) were also put forth for evidence by the 

accused in support of his plea of innocence. 

95. Through the cross-examination conducted on behalf of the State, it was 

stated by this witness that he had not handed over these bills to the Investigating 

Officer but stated that he had obtained them after his arrest, but denied that 

these bills had been fabricated only to create the defence. The witness further 

denied that the parents of Reena were the ones who had made the payment in 

cash to the tune of Rs.25,000/-and Rs.40,000/-which they gave to him with 

regard to their stay in Imphal and also for the other miscellaneous expenses 

connected with the customary dress and jewellery. The witness further denied 

that he deliberately did not hand over the said bills to the IO as it would have 

exposed the fact of fabrication on their verification and denied that he was 

deposing falsely. 

CONCLUSIONS OF THE TRIAL COURT 

96. Vide the impugned judgment the learned trial court concluded to the 

effect : -


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 58 of 88 

 that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 got married to Reena 

Goyal on 2.11.2011; 

 that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 belongs to Manipur and 

was the only son of his parents and had two sisters; 

 that the parents of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 were 

Government Servants, living in Manipur; 

 that the death of the deceased took place on 3.4.2012 i.e. within 

seven years from the date of her marriage; 

 that the deceased was an advocate by profession; 

 that the deceased knew the accused no. 1 and accused no. 2 / 

respondent no. 1 and respondent no. 2 since school days; 

 that the deceased had a love affair with the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 and the deceased was fully aware about the 

different customs and cultures; 

 that the parents and brothers of the deceased knew about the love 

affair between the deceased and the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 

1 much before their marriage and had accepted the said alliance; 

 that PW-13 & PW-14, parents of the deceased had visited Manipur 

in August, 2011 before the marriage; 

 that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had a good finance 

business and was earning handsome amount from that business; 

 that the parents of the deceased had satisfied themselves regarding 

the family background and financial status of the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 before the marriage; 

 that it could be held that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 was a 

qualified person and was earning an handsome amount and once 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 59 of 88 

the parents of the deceased were satisfied with the background and 

the financial status of the accused, they gave the final nod; 

 that the demand of Rs.1.5 lacs and gold items as dowry from the 

parents and brothers of the deceased at the time of the engagement 

was not proved by the prosecution; 

 that the prosecution had also failed to prove that PW-13 i.e. father 

of the deceased had incurred Rs.15 to Rs.16 lacs on the marriage as 

expenses; 

 that though the EON car was given by the father of the deceased, it 

was purchased in the name of the deceased and remained in the 

possession of the deceased to use and even after the death of the 

deceased, the car was released on superdari to PW-13 i.e. father of 

the deceased, which established that the car, which was registered 

in the name of the deceased had not been used by the accused no. 1 

/ respondent no. 1 and the claim of the prosecution that the accused 

no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had raised a demand of a car as dowry 

from the deceased or her parents, does not inspire the confidence; 

 that the claim of PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased that he gave 

Rs.30,000/-to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and claim of 

PW-14 i.e. mother of the deceased that she gave Rs.25,000/-to the 

deceased in addition to what they had spent i.e. Rs.40,000/-on the 

ceremony had not been proved; 

 that the marriage of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had been 

performed at Manipur according to Manipur customs, but it had not 

been established that Rs.30,000/-was paid to the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 as a dowry demand and furthermore, PW-13 i.e. 

father of the deceased had admitted that the arrangement of the stay 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 60 of 88 

in the hotel was made by the parents of the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 and that the father of the deceased had stated that 

he had not seen the original bills regarding the payment made by 

the deceased at any time nor was he aware what amounts were paid 

by the deceased in relation to the customary rights at Manipur. 

97. The learned trial court thus held that the prosecution had failed to prove 

that PW-13 had paid any amount to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 during 

his visit in Manipur as dowry and observed that it was rather the parents of the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1, who had made all arrangements of the stay and 

also borne the expenses for the same. 

98. The learned trial court concluded that the deceased left for Manipur on 

27.11.2011 and stayed there for 19-20 days when PW-13 i.e. father of the 

deceased came back with his family at Delhi on 02.12.2011 and the deceased 

stayed at Manipur for 10-11 days more after 09.12.2011 and it was observed 

thus that according to PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased, on 08/09.12.2011, the 

deceased informed them that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had given 

beatings to her to bring more dowry and demanded gold items for his family 

members and in relation to this, PW-14 i.e. mother of the deceased had deposed 

that the deceased had informed her about the said demands on telephone and it 

was thus observed by the learned trial court that there was a contradiction, as to 

whom, the deceased had informed about the said demand. 

99. The further conclusions drawn by the learned trial court were to the effect 

that the deceased was an advocate by profession and thus it was highly 

improbable that the deceased being an advocate and having sufficient money 

with her, stayed with the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 at Manipur even 

thereafter, without any protest against his alleged cruel acts; that it was not 

claimed by the prosecution that even after the deceased came to Delhi, either 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 61 of 88 

she visited her parents or her parents visited her to console her for the said 

incident and that they had even not talked to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 

1 to that effect. The learned trial court further held to the effect that it was not 

the prosecution version that the parents of the deceased had talked to the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 in relation to the maltreatment made to the 

deceased at Manipur and that the allegations levelled by the prosecution against 

the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1, thus did not inspire any confidence. In 

relation to the alleged claimed by PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased that a sum 

of Rs.50,000/-had been paid to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 on his 

demand on 21.1.2012 when he demanded a sum of Rs.1 lakh from PW-14, 

mother of the deceased PW-13 i.e. father of deceased had claimed that PW-14 

i.e. mother of the deceased had informed him about this demand though PW-14 

i.e. mother of the deceased had deposed that PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased 

did not know that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had come to their house 

on 21.01.2012 and that she had told the factum of payment of Rs.50,000/-to the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 after the death of the deceased. It was 

concluded by the learned trial court that the giving of the amount of Rs.50,000/-

by PW-14 i.e. mother of the deceased was wholly circumspect in view of the 

evidence led. 

100. As regards the claim of the prosecution that on 12.02.2012, the accused 

no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had slapped the deceased and gave leg blows on her 

stomach and the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had caught hold of her by hair 

and also gave beatings to her, it was observed by the learned trial court that 

there was a contradiction in the testimony of PW-13 and PW-14, in as much 

as, PW-14 had deposed that on 13.02.2012 the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 

had left the deceased at her parental home, and at that time the deceased had 

informed her about beatings and that PW-13 while claiming that the said assault 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 62 of 88 

was given on 12.02.2012, had not disclosed as to when and how he came to 

know of the said facts. It was also observed by the learned trial court that in her 

cross-examination, PW-14 had deposed that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 

1 was not in Delhi on 12.02.2012 and it was thus concluded by the learned trial 

court that there were contradictions in the statements of PW-13 and PW-14 and 

the prosecution version and the prosecution had failed to prove that the accused 

no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and the accused no. 2 respondent no. 2 had given 

beatings to the deceased on 12.02.2012. 

101. As regards the claim of the prosecution that on 29.02.2012, the accused 

no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had got the deceased taken to the Hans Hospital for her 

abortion and got her aborted, the learned trial court observed to the effect that 

PW-13 in his cross-examination had deposed that in February, 2012, the 

deceased got pregnant and on 13.02.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 

had left the deceased at her parental home and had stated that he would not take 

care of a pregnant lady and resultantly on 29.02.2012, he got her aborted, 

whereas PW-14 remained silent about any such talk by the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 on 13.02.2012. The learned trial court further observed to the 

effect that PW-14 had deposed that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had 

taken the deceased to the hospital for treatment on 29.02.2012 and had got her 

aborted but also stated that in December, 2011, she came to know about the 

pregnancy of the deceased and thus it was observed by the learned trial court 

that it was implicit that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 was also aware of 

the pregnancy from December, 2011 till 13.02.2012 and that he had not made 

any grievance in relation to the pregnancy of the deceased. 

102. It was also observed by the learned trial court that there were 

contradictions in the version of PW-13 and PW-14 in relation to the aspect as to 

for what purpose the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 herein had taken the 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 63 of 88 

deceased to the Hans Hospital, for whereas PW-13 had stated that she had been 

taken for an abortion, PW-14 had stated that it was for treatment. It was further 

observed by the learned trial court to the effect that if the version of PW-13 was 

believed to be correct, it implied that PW-13 had learned on 13.02.202 that the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 was not happy with the pregnancy of the 

deceased and thus on 29.02.2012, he was sure that the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 had taken the deceased for an abortion, then it was not 

explained by PW-13 why he remained silent and had not protested and how he 

had allowed the deceased to go to the hospital with the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1. The learned trial court also observed to the effect that the 

prosecution had not led any evidence of any doctor from the Hans Hospital to 

prove that the abortion had taken place that day too due to the malafide 

intention of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and observed that it was the 

specific case of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 that the deceased had got 

aborted because of her weak condition. 

103. PW-16 in her cross-examination had admittedly stated that the 

deceased was physically weak and her weight was 36 kg. only and PW-12 

also deposed that at the time of death, the weight of the deceased was 36 kg. 

It was thus observed by the learned trial court that in the given 

circumstances, the prosecution had failed to prove that the accused was 

responsible for the abortion of the deceased. 

104. As regards the alleged demand of a house made by the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 from the parents of the deceased, it was observed by the 

learned trial court that whereas PW-13 had deposed on 08.03.2012 that the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 alongwith his mother left the deceased at his 

place because her condition was not good and she was mentally and physically 

disturbed, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had told him that they would take 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 64 of 88 

her back only when they would provide him a house at Sant Nagar, Burari and 

PW-13 had taken the deceased to Dr. Mukesh Yadav but no treatment was 

given there and thereafter, she was taken to the Hindu Rao Hospital where she 

was got admitted for one or two days and was treated for 15-16 days. The 

learned trial court further observed to the effect that PW-14 i.e. mother of the 

deceased had also deposed to the effect that according to PW-13 and PW-14, 

the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 for the first time had raised the demand of a 

house on 08.03.2012. It was also observed by learned trial court that there was a 

contradiction in the statements of PW-13 and PW-14 in as much as PW-14 in 

her statement Ex.PW23/E had stated that after one month of the marriage, the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had started harassing the deceased and had 

demanded a new house at Sant Nagar, Burari and it can thus be held that on 

08.03.2012, the demand of the house was not raised by the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 for the first time but had been raised just after a month of the 

marriage. The learned trial court also concluded that the prosecution had not led 

any evidence to establish that on 08.03.2012, the condition of the deceased was 

not good and she was mentally and physically disturbed due to the acts of the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1. It was observed by the learned trial court in the 

testimony of PW-13 that on 12.03.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 

along with his mother had left for Manipur and that it was not the prosecution 

version that after 08.03.2012 till 03.04.2012, the deceased ever visited her 

matrimonial house or the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 came to her parental 

home to take her back. 

INCIDENT OF 03.04.2012 

105. In relation to the fateful night of the incident dated 03.04.2012, PW-

14 had testified on oath that the deceased informed her that she had been 

called by the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 herein at the house and had 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 65 of 88 

left for her place in her car about 9.30 p.m. and PW-13 had also deposed 

that the deceased had gone at about 9.30 p.m. to the house of the accused 

no. 1 / respondent no. 1 to make inquiries about him and at 10.30 p.m. the 

accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had informed them about the deceased 

falling down. It was also observed by the learned trial court that 

admittedly, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 was not in Delhi on that 

day. The learned trial court also observed to the effect that according to 

PW-14, the deceased had not only informed her at 8.30 pm, that she had 

been called by the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 but she waited up to 

9.30 p.m. i.e. for an hour, to leave for that place and what was the exact 

conversation between the deceased and PW-14 from 8.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. 

was within the specific knowledge of PW-14 but the same had not been 

disclosed by the prosecution. It was thus observed by the learned trial court 

that in the given circumstances, it could not be believed that the deceased 

simply told her mother i.e. PW-14 that she was going to inquire about the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 as deposed by PW-13. 

106. The learned trial court further observed to the effect that it was 

evident from the record that at 9.30 p.m. the deceased had left her parental 

home alone and this fact was within the knowledge of PW-13 and PW14 

i.e. her parents and after that the deceased had left her parental home after 

a gap of one hour, and there would have been some discussion between her 

parents and deceased regarding going to that place and they would have 

allowed her to go alone at 9.30 p.m. only once they were satisfied. It was 

observed by the learned trial court that if there was any threat whatsoever 

from the side of the accused or else the parents of the deceased would not 

have allowed her to go alone or the deceased would have gone alone. The 

learned trial court also observed to the effect that if there was a threat then 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 66 of 88 

the prosecution had failed to explain as to why PW-13 and PW-14 had 

allowed the deceased to go alone, and that the prosecution had failed to 

explain that once the deceased and her parents were aggrieved by the 

cruelties of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 on the deceased then why 

they allowed her to go alone on that day and that too in the night and in her 

own vehicle. The learned trial court also observed to the effect that there 

was a time gap of one hour when the deceased left the home and when the 

accused no. 2 informed about her falling down and that it was nowhere the 

case of the prosecution that during the said period, PW-13 and PW-14 even 

tried once to contact the deceased about her well being nor that the 

deceased talked to her parents during the said period. It was also observed 

by the learned trial court that this kind of conduct of the deceased and PW-

13 and PW-14 i.e. parents of the deceased, whose daughter had already 

been treated cruelty by the accused, as claimed by the prosecution, was 

unnatural. It was thus observed by the learned trial court that it can be 

held that parents of the deceased were not apprehensive of the well being 

of the deceased at the hands of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1. Rather, 

accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had not only informed them about the 

incident, but had also informed that the deceased had been taken to the 

Trauma Centre and had asked them to come immediately and it was 

observed by the learned trial court that if the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 

2 was at fault then she would not have done so. 

LACK OF COMPLAINTS MADE TO THE POLICE 

107. The prosecution through witnesses, PW-13, PW-14, PW-15, PW-16 and 

PW-17 i.e. father, mother, step brothers and step sister of the deceased, brought 

forward the allegation of demand of dowry and it was observed by the learned 

trial court that though these witnesses had deposed about the alleged cruelties 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 67 of 88 

meted out by the accused and allegedly noticed by them from time to time, they 

made no complaint to the police against the accused till 04.04.2012. The learned 

trial court also observed that PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased in his testimony 

had stated that on 25.03.2012, he had asked the deceased as to why the deceased 

was not making a police complaint and she had replied that she loved the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 a lot and for betterment of her matrimonial life, 

she had hesitated to make any complaint to the police. The learned trial court 

also observed to the effect that vide the statement Ex.PW11/A recorded on 

04.04.2012, PW-13 had stated that the allegation made against the accused no. 1 

/ respondent no. 1 was that after the marriage, he had made a demand of a car 

and in his statement Ex.PW11/A, PW-13 had raised the suspicion only against 

the sister of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 i.e. the accused no. 2 / 

respondent no. 2 herein and not the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 herein. 

108. It was also observed that PW-13 had only stated in his testimony on 

oath that he i.e. PW-13 could not give the complete details of the cruelties 

to the SDM as he was in a state of shock but despite the same the statement 

Ex.PW11/A remained conspicuously silent as to why the name of the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 was not mentioned as suspect at that time. 

The learned trial court further observed that even if it is presumed for the 

sake of arguments that PW-13 was in the state of shock at that time but it 

is highly improbable that he was in a shock to such an extent that he had 

forgotten to mention the name of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 as 

suspect. 

VARIATIONS IN THE STATEMENTS OF THE WITNESSES AT 

DIFFERENT STAGES 

109. The learned trial court has also observed that in the supplementary 

statement dated 05.04.2012 of PW-13 recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C., he 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 68 of 88 

had stated that the in-laws of the deceased had demanded a car, which he 

fulfilled and thereafter the in-laws of the deceased kept on raising their demands 

which he kept on fulfilling to make the deceased happy and that on 08.03.2012, 

the mother of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and the accused no. 2 / 

respondent no. 2 had left the deceased at her parental home after harassing her 

and the deceased allegedly died because of the harassment and demand of 

dowry made by her in-laws. The learned trial court observed to the effect that 

the statement dated 05.04.2012 i.e. supplementary statement of PW-13 recorded 

under Section 161 Cr.P.C. when compared to the statement dated 04.04.2013 

reveals that PW-13 made material improvements in his statement dated 

05.04.2012 and had also included the in-laws of the deceased in the making of 

dowry demands and alleged cruelties. It was also observed by the learned trial 

court that the statement made by PW-13 in court also had material improvement 

and apart from making improvements, PW-13 had gone to the extent of 

bringing note Mark PW13/N and deposed that it was in the hand writing of the 

deceased and if the said note was so vital and came to his notice at an early 

stage then he had failed to give any explanation for his silence in relation 

thereto till his deposition and thus it was observed that PW-13 had made 

material improvements in his statements from time to time and that further 

there was a failure of the investigating agency to record the statements of the 

family members on 04.04.2012. 

110. The learned trial court also observed to the effect that apart from the 

statement of PW-13 recorded on 04.04.2012, the statement of no other person 

was recorded by the investigating agency on that day and specifically the 

statements of PW-14, PW-15, PW-16 and PW-17 were not recorded despite 

their availability. The statements of PW-14 and PW-15 indicate that their 

statements were recorded on 27-04-2012 and it was thus observed by the 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 69 of 88 

learned trial court that even between 04.04.2012 and 27.04.2012, the 

investigating agency did not attempt to record the statements of the family 

members nor had they given their willingness to give their statements. The 

learned trial court also observed that the statements of PW-14 and PW-15 

recorded on 27.04.2012, were not their voluntary statements but it had been 

made at the instance of PW-13 and it was observed by the learned trial court 

also that the investigating agency had recorded the statements of PW-14 and 

PW-15 which were undated with the sole objective of the prosecution to fill up 

the lacunae in the prosecution case. 

111. The learned trial court also concluded to the effect that the testimony 

of PW-13 and PW-14 brought forward the existence of a wedlock between 

the father of the deceased and Kamla Goyal through which four sons were 

born out and that two sons namely Bharat Goyal and Gaurav Goyal and 

one daughter i.e. the deceased were born of the second wedlock and that a 

property dispute was going on between PW-13 on the one hand and his 

children on the other hand and the deceased was disturbed and used to 

remain under depression and had filed the complaint qua which aspect 

investigation was not conducted by the investigating agency and thus it was 

held that the deceased had committed suicide, in which the accused had no 

role to play. 

112. The learned trial court also concluded to the effect that the prosecution 

had miserably failed to establish that the accused ever treated the deceased with 

cruelty in terms of Section 498A of the IPC. The learned trial court further 

observed to the effect that since the prosecution had failed to prove that the 

accused had treated the deceased with cruelties within the meaning of Section 

498A IPC, the presumption under Section 113B of Indian Evidence Act of 

dowry death cannot be raised against the accused and thus it was observed that 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 70 of 88 

the prosecution had failed to prove that the accused had committed an offence 

under Section 304B of IPC. 

113. The learned trial court also observed to the effect that the death of the 

deceased was homicidal in nature in which the accused had no role to play and 

thus the prosecution had failed to prove that the accused had committed the 

offence punishable under Section 302 of IPC. 

CONTENTIONS OF THE STATE 

114. Through Criminal Leave Petition No. 74/2016, the State is aggrieved by 

the impugned judgment dated 16.09.2015 of the learned trial court and has 

submitted : -

(a) that the impugned judgment is based on conjectures and surmises 

and is against the facts and law; 

(b) that the learned trial court had not dealt with the presumption of 

dowry death under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 in 

relation to the death of the victim having taken place under unnatural 

circumstances within seven years of her marriage and that the 

presumption had been successfully rebutted; 

(c) that the two material witnesses i.e. PW-13 Sh. Sita Ram Goyal and 

PW-14 Smt. Veena Goyal, parents of the deceased had consistently stated 

about the dowry demand and the death of the victim having taken place 

within five months from her marriage with the accused no. 1 / respondent 

no. 1 and thus the presumption of dowry death was attracted, which had 

been rebutted by the accused; 

(d) that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate that there were 

only minor contradictions in the statements of PW-13 Sh. Sita Ram 

Goyal (the father of the deceased Smt. Reena Goyal), PW-14 Smt. Veena 

Goyal (the mother of the deceased), PW-15 Smt. Mamta Goyal (step 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 71 of 88 

sister-in-law of the deceased) and PW-16 Tanjeev Kumar Goyal and that 

they were not of a nature as to be fatal to the case of the prosecution; 

(e) that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate the post-mortem 

report which had clearly stated that the death was caused due to coma and 

shock consequent upon multiple injuries that could be caused by blunt / 

surface impact due to fall from a height; 

(f) 
that the learned trial court had erred in observing that the deceased 

had suicidal tendency and the same is based on conjectures and surmises 

and that there was no evidence on record to show the same ; 

(g) that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate that there was no 

occasion for the victim to commit suicide at the house of the accused no. 

1 / respondent no. 1; 

(h) that the learned trial court had erroneously disbelieved the 

statement of PW-13 on the ground that there were improvements in the 

statement made by PW-13 before the SDM and that PW-13 had duly 

explained the improvements made at the time of giving his first statement 

before the SDM submitting that he was in a state of shock and that the 

same was a plausible explanation and ought not to have been described 

by the learned trial court; 

(i) 
that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate that PW-13 had 

deposed that he had handed over Rs.30,000/-to the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 at Manipur and that he had further deposed that on 

8/9.11.2011, the deceased had informed him that the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 had given beatings to her at Manipur for more dowry 

and had demanded three gold sets for his three sisters, gold rings and gold 

chain for his parents and had also demanded on gold chain for his 

brother-in-law ; 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 72 of 88 

(j) 
that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate the deposition of 

PW-13 that on 21.01.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had 

come to his house and had demand Rs.1 lakh from PW-14 in relation to 

which a sum of Rs.50,000/-was paid to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 

1 on his persistent demand; 

(k) that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate that PW-13 had 

deposed that on 12.02.2012 the deceased had gone to her matrimonial 

house at Indira Vihar where the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had 

caught hold of the deceased by her hairs and had given beatings to her 

and she had fallen down on the ground and that PW-13 had also deposed 

that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had slapped the deceased and 

had also given leg blows on her stomach; 

(l) 
Interalia, it is submitted on behalf of the State that the learned trial 

court had erred in disbelieving the testimony of the witnesses, in as much 

as all the witnesses were persistent in relation to material particulars in 

relation to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 having demanded a car 

and dowry and of that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 having made a 

demand for gold sets and a sum of Rs.50,000/-and a house and also in 

relation to the assault and maltreatment with the deceased and also in 

relation to the abortion of the deceased having been got done of the 

deceased child by the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and of his having 

been happy about the same. It was further contended on behalf of the 

State that merely because the complainant had not made any complaint 

prior to 03.04.2012 by the deceased or any other family members about 

the alleged demand of dowry and cruelty cannot be a ground for 

discrediting the witnesses in view of the fabric of Indian society where 

the foremost concern of the family is to ensure that the matrimonial 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 73 of 88 

alliance is continued and generally police complaints are made. The State 

thus had sought the conviction of the respondents under Sections 

498A/304B/34 of IPC. 

CONTENTIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS 

115. On behalf of the respondents is contended that there was no infirmity in 

the impugned judgment of the learned trial court and that the testimony of the 

prosecution witnesses were wholly variant in relation to material particulars. It 

was submitted on behalf of the respondents that the record established that the 

deceased had not been able to adjust herself to the difference in culture, 

traditions, linguistic aspects besides food habits at her matrimonial home at 

Imphal, Manipur, which is a small and different town in comparison to Delhi 

where the deceased was an advocate by profession. It was also submitted on 

behalf of the respondents that merely because the deceased had committed 

suicide, did not bring the respondents under the ambit of Sections 304B and 

498A of IPC, as the allegations of demand of dowry and consequently cruelty 

and harassment for the same had not been proved on record and thus there was 

no presumption that can be raised under Section 113(a) of the Indian Evidence 

Act, 1872. 

116. It was also submitted on behalf of the respondents that as per the 

requirement of Section 304B of IPC, firstly there has to be a demand of dowry 

and secondly, it had to be shown that the same had to be raised soon before the 

death and thirdly, the deceased had been subjected to cruelty and harassment by 

her husband or his relations and it was thus submitted on behalf of the 

respondents that qua the statement of PW-13 and PW-14 i.e. the parents of the 

deceased, to the effect that the car was demanded on 05.11.20111 and was 

given on 07.11.2011. 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 74 of 88 

117. It was further submitted on behalf of respondents that no averment had 

been made in relation to any harassment or cruelty caused to the deceased for 

that demand and that admittedly the Hyundai Eon car was in the name of the 

deceased, who was driving the car throughout and even after her death the said 

car was taken away by the father of the deceased i.e. PW-13. It was also 

submitted on behalf of the respondents that the allegations of beating given to 

the deceased on 12.02.2012 and of the pregnancy of the deceased having been 

got aborted on 29.02.2012 were not made by PW-13 to the SDM in his 

statement nor were they so stated by PW-13 to the police nor were they so 

stated by PW-14. It is further submitted on behalf of the respondents that the 

evidence on record establishes that the deceased was physically and mentally 

weak and was having 36 kg. weight and that no medical evidence had been 

placed on record by the prosecution of any forced abortion. 

VERDICTS RELIED UPON BY THE RESPONDENTS 

118. Reliance was placed on behalf of the respondents on the verdict of the 

Supreme Court titled as Satvir Singh and others vs. State of Punjab and 

another, AIR 2001 Supreme Court 2828 to contend that the commission of 

the offence punishable under Section 304B IPC was not even attracted in the 

facts and circumstances of the instant case, in as much as, there was nothing on 

record to indicate that there was any cruelty inflicted on the deceased soon after 

her death which could establish that there was no perceptible nexus between her 

death and the dowry related harassment or cruelty inflicted upon her. 

119. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondents on the verdict of 

the Supreme Court in the case Hans Raj vs. State of Haryana, AIR 2004 SC 

2790 to contend that the mere fact that a woman committed suicide within a 

period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that she had been 

subjected to cruelty by her husband does not automatically give rise to the 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 75 of 88 

presumption and that the court is required to look into all the other 

circumstances of the case and that one of the circumstances which has to be 

considered by the Court was whether the alleged cruelty was likely to drive the 

woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to the life, limb or 

health of the woman. It was thus contended on behalf of the respondents that 

there were no circumstances brought forward on record in the instant case to 

show that there was any cruelty at any stage inflicted on the deceased which 

was likely to drive her to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to 

her life limb or health. 

120. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondents on the verdicts of 

the Hon'ble Apex Court tiled as "Mangat Ram vs. State of Haryana, 2014 (3) 

JCC 1730 to contend that under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, 

1872, a statutory presumption does not arise by operation of law merely on the 

proof of circumstances enumerated in Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence 

Act, 1872 and merely because a married woman committed suicide within a 

period of seven years from the date of her marriage, the presumption under 

Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 would not automatically apply. 

ANALYSIS 

121. It is essential to observe that through the present Criminal Leave Petition 

No. 74/2016, the State seeks leave to appeal against the impugned judgment of 

the learned trial court whereby the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and the 

accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 have been acquitted in relation to the alleged 

commission of the offences punishable under Section 498A/304B/34 IPC and 

also of the alternative charge under Section 302/34 IPC and thus it has 

essentially to be borne under consideration that though an Appellate Court has 

full powers to review and reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which 

an order of acquittal is founded and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 76 of 88 

no limitation, restriction or condition on the exercise of such powers and an 

Appellate Court on the evidence before it, may reach its own conclusion both on 

question of conviction and law as laid down in Chandrappa vs. State of 

Karnataka & Ors. 2007(4) SCC 415 and Prandas vs. The State AIR 1954 SC 

36, however, it cannot be overlooked that the verdict of the Supreme Court in 

Chandrappa vs. State of Karnataka & Ors. 2007(4) SCC 415 also lays down 

categorically that: 

"(4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in 
case of acquittal, there is double presumption in 
favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of 
innocence is available to him under the fundamental 
principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person 
shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved 
guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the 
accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption 
of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and 
strengthened by the trial court. 

(5) if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of 
the evidence on record, the appellate court should not 
disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial 
court." 

120. 
In the case of Ghurey Lal Vs. State of U.P. 2008(10) SCC 450 the 

Supreme Court has laid down the following guiding principle, to be adhered 

to before leave to appeal against an order of acquittal may be granted: 

". The appellate court may only overrule or otherwise 
disturb the trial court's acquittal if it has 'very 
substantial and compelling reasons' for doing so. 

A number of instances arise in which the appellate 
court would have 'very substantial and compelling 
reasons' to discard the trial court's decision. 'Very 
substantial and compelling reasons' exist when: 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 77 of 88 

i)The trial court's conclusion with regard to the facts 
is palpably wrong; 
ii) The trial court's decision was based on an 
erroneous view of law; 

iii) The trial court's judgment is likely to result in 
"grave miscarriage of justice"; 
iv) The entire approach of the trial court in dealing 
with the evidence was patently illegal; 

v) The trial court's judgment was manifestly unjust 
and unreasonable; 

vi) The trial court has ignored the evidence or 
misread the material evidence or has ignored material 
documents like dying declarations/report of the 
Ballistic expert, etc. 

vii) This list is intended to be illustrative, not 
exhaustive. 

2. The Appellate Court must always give proper 
weight and consideration to the findings of the trial 
court. 

3. If two reasonable views can be reached-one that 
leads to acquittal, the other to conviction-the High 
Courts/appellate courts must rule in favour of the 
accused." 

121. To similar effect is the verdict of the Supreme Court in State of Madhya 

Pradesh Vs. Dal Singh & Ors. JT 2013(8) SC 625. 

122. Gauged on the above parameters laid down by the Supreme Court of 

India in the afore-mentioned cases, it is apparent that there is nothing on the 

record to indicate that the learned trial court's decision was based on an 

erroneous view of law or that the learned trial court had ignored the evidence or 

misread the material evidence or had ignored the material documents. Rather, 

the analysis of evidence put forth by the learned trial court is based on a 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 78 of 88 

reasonable conclusion possible on the evidence on record and there are no 

substantial and compelling reasons to discard the findings of the learned trial 

court. 

123. The factum that the presumption of innocence is available to an accused 

in criminal jurisprudence where each person is presumed to be innocent unless 

he is proved guilty by a competent court of law, and the aspect of the 

presumption of his innocence being further reinforced and reaffirmed by his 

acquittal by the trial Court strengthens the conclusion drawn on the evidence on 

the record by the learned trial court and thus there is now in the present case the 

double presumption in favour of the innocence of the accused / respondents. 

124. The evidence before the learned trial court establishes that the deceased 

and the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had married pursuant to a love affair 

between them and that they were attached to each other even till the demise of 

the deceased. This aspect reinforces the testimonies of the parents of the 

deceased, who have categorically stated that the deceased had stated that she 

loved the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and that she wanted a good 

matrimonial life. The accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 in his statement under 

Section 313 Cr.P.C., 1973 has also stated that the deceased and he were very 

much in love and that there was no problem between them. The factum that the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 of his own came back to Delhi on 04.04.2012 

from Manipur immediately on learning of the demise of the deceased, who 

expired on 03.04.2012 speaks volumes in favour of his innocence, in as much as 

the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 made no attempt to abscond though he was 

not even in Delhi at the time of the demise of the deceased. 

125. The evidence on record also proves the weak physique of the deceased 

which corroborates the plea of defence put forth by the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 that the abortion took place as it was advised medically in view 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 79 of 88 

of the frail health of the deceased. As rightly observed by the learned trial court, 

there is no evidence that has been led on the record to show that there was 

coerced abortion. 

126. The factum that there was no complaint made prior to the demise of the 

deceased in relation to any demands for dowry, coupled with the factum that 

even Mark PW-13/N the alleged hand writing of the deceased in which she 

stated allegedly that her life had been made hell by the respondents was not 

produced during investigation of the father of the deceased and he chose to 

produce it only in the witness box when he was being examined, coupled with 

the factum that the said hand writing of the deceased was not sent for any 

forensic hand writing examination nor compared with any admitted hand 

writing of the deceased in any manner lend credence to the observation of the 

learned trial court that there were categorical improvements in the testimonies 

of the prosecution witnesses from the version put forth by them during the 

investigation. Furthermore, the factum that the Mark PW-13/N is written in 

English script with Hindi words makes it all the more circumspect. 

127. The available record also establishes that the deceased was unable to 

adjust to the life style at Manipur having lived in the Metropolitan City of Delhi 

and was unable to adjust to the cultural differences between herself and her 

upbringing and that of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and his parents were 

residing at Manipur. 

128. The available record further brings forth that the prosecution has been 

unable to establish its claim that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had 

demanded an EON Car as dowry from the deceased and her parents which 

purchased by the PW-13 i.e. the father of the deceased on 7.11.2011 for a sum 

of Rs.3,46,758/-and was purchased in the name of his daughter i.e. the 

deceased who continued to be in possession of the deceased and was driven by 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 80 of 88 

the deceased who even drove to the house No.364, Indira Vihar on the fateful 

day i.e. 03.04.2012 to the house of the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 and 

thereafter the vehicle was handed over on superdari to the father of the 

deceased. 

129. The further contention of the State that there was a demand of a sum of 

Rs.1 Lakh made to the mother of the deceased by the accused no. 1 / respondent 

no. 1 is also not substantiated in view of the testimonies of PW-13, PW-15 who 

allegedly gave Rs.50,000/-to her step mother-in-law i.e. PW-14 to hand over 

the same to the accused, in as much as PW-14 stated that she gave Rs.50,000/-

to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 when he demanded Rs.1 Lakh which she 

took from PW-15, she did not even inform her sons namely Bharat Goyal and 

Gaurav Goyal about the same and she did not arrange the same through PW-13 

nor through her sons nor did she ask her own daughters-in-law and asked for the 

amount from her step daughter-in-law and she did not even disclose the same to 

her daughter (since deceased), are all aspects which cast a doubt on the veracity 

of the prosecution version in relation to the alleged demand of Rs.1 Lakh, 

especially as even PW-17 Sh. Manjeev Goyal and PW-15 Smt. Mamta Goyal 

(his wife) did not ask for the money amounting to Rs.50,000/-when they shifted 

and separated from PW-13 and PW-14. 

130. The allegations against the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 of having 

made demands of three gold sets for his three sisters and the gold rings and gold 

chains for his parents and also of his having demanded one gold chain for his 

brother-in-law (Jija), was also not conclusively established through the 

prosecution evidence led. As regards the allegations levelled against the 

respondents to the effect that on 12.02.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 

1 / husband of the deceased had slapped her and had given her leg blows and the 

accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had caught hold of the deceased by her hairs 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 81 of 88 

and had given beatings, have also not been substantiated through the evidence 

on record as it has not been brought forward on record as to when and how PW-

13 had learnt of the said fact. Furthermore, PW-14 had deposed that on 

13.02.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had left the deceased at her 

parental home and at that time he had informed about the said beatings and in 

his cross-examination, PW-14 had deposed that the accused no. 1 / respondent 

no. 1 was not in Delhi on 12.02.2012. The accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 in 

his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C., 1973 had also categorically stated that 

he reached at Delhi on 12.02.2012 at about 9.30 p.m. by an Air India flight 

which the prosecution has been unable to refute thus casting a grave doubt on 

the veracity of the prosecution version in relation to the allegations that have 

been levelled against the accused / respondents of harassment and maltreatment 

of the deceased for dowry demands. 

131. As per the record, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had left the 

deceased on 08.03.2012 at her parental home and did not come to take her back 

at any stage. The prosecution has sought to contend that the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 told PW-13 that they would take back Smt. Reena Goyal (since 

deceased) only when the family members of the deceased would provide him a 

house in Sant Nagar, Burari. As per Ex.PW11/A, the statement of PW-13 

recorded by the Executive Magistrate though it has been stated by Sh. Sita Ram 

Goyal (father of the deceased) that the marriage between the deceased and the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 took place on 02.11.2011, he further stated that 

his daughter was an advocate and that on 07.03.2012, a Wednesday, the accused 

no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had taken his daughter (since deceased) to his rented 

accommodation at Indira Vihar (the house number has not been mentioned) 

and on 08.03.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1, his mother and the 

sister of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 i.e. Ms. Chanchan / the accused no. 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 82 of 88 

2 / respondent no. 2 herein, left his daughter (since deceased) at his house i.e. 

PW-13 and never came back to take her back thereafter and the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 went away with his mother to Manipur, there is not a whisper 

of an averment in Ex.PW11/A in relation to any demand of dowry for any 

harassment meted out to the deceased. That such facts were not stated by the 

father of the deceased i.e. PW-13, to the SDM in the first statement made to the 

Executive Magistrate renders circumspect the prosecution version in relation to 

the alleged harassment, demand of dowry and maltreatment of the deceased by 

the respondents and also in relation to the alleged demand of a house at Sant 

Nagar, Burari. 

132. The testimony of PW-13 also does not bring forth that between 

02.11.2011 and 07.03.2012, the deceased had ever stayed at her matrimonial 

home. The testimony of PW-13 also states that when the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 had taken his daughter on 07.03.2012 to his house at Indira 

Vihar, the next day i.e. on 08.03.2012, the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had 

informed PW-13 i.e. Sita Ram Goyal that the condition of Smt. Reena Goyal 

(since deceased) was not good and thereafter, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 

1, the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 and their mother had brought Smt. Reena 

Goyal (since deceased) to the house of her father and had left her at her house at 

which time she i.e. Smt. Reena Goyal was not in a good condition and was not 

able to stand and was mentally and physically disturbed. The testimony of the 

PW-13 also states that at that time, the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 stated 

that they would bring back the deceased only when her family members had 

provided her a house at Sant Nagar, Burari. PW-13 further stated that he and his 

family members had taken the deceased to Dr. Mukesh Yadav for medical 

treatment but she was not treated there and thereafter they took her to Hindu 

Rao Hospital wherein the deceased was medically treated for 15-16 days after 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 83 of 88 

her admission in the hospital for one or two days. He further stated that the 

accused persons and their mother did not visit the hospital to see the condition 

of Smt. Reena Goyal despite having been informed about the condition of Smt. 

Reena Goyal and that thereafter the accused did not come to the house to take 

his daughter and on 12.03.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 went to 

Manipur along with his mother. 

133. As to what medical treatment was given to Smt. Reena Goyal d/o PW-13 

i.e. Sh. Sita Ram Goyal at the Hindu Rao Hospital and for what she was 

medically treated for upto 20 days, has not been explained anywhere on the 

record. From the date 08.03.2012 till the date of her demise, admittedly there 

was no contact between the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and the accused no. 

2 / respondent no. 2 and the deceased. 

134. The testimonies of PW-13 Sh. Sita Ram Goyal (the father of the deceased 

Smt. Reena Goyal), PW-14 Smt. Veena Goyal (the mother of the deceased), 

PW-15 Smt. Mamta Goyal (step sister-in-law of the deceased), PW-16 Tanjeev 

Kumar Goyal and PW-17 Sh. Manjeev Goyal (both step brothers of the 

deceased), the family members of the deceased, bring forth that there were 

property disputes between PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased and her children, in 

as much as the first wife of PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased and her children 

were living separately and the children of PW-13 (i.e. father of the deceased) 

born of the wedlock with PW-14 were living separately and that complaints 

were regularly made at the Police Station Civil Lines on account of property 

disputes are aspects which bring forth the probability of the deceased being 

under depression on account of the disputes between PW-13 i.e. father of the 

deceased and his other sons namely Bharat Goyal and Gaurav Goyal. 

135. Furthermore, the Investigating Officer Inspector Subhash Chand i.e. PW-

24 also admittedly made no inquiries in relation to the aspect of property dispute 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 84 of 88 

between the family members of Sh. Sita Ram Goyal in view of his two 

marriages, he having stated that he learnt of the two marriages only at this last 

stage and neither did he make any inquiries in relation to the aspect of the first 

wife, nor in relation to the aspect whether there was some civil disputes in 

relation to the property of Sh. Sita Ram Goyal. 

136. Significantly, the Investigating Officer has also categorically stated that 

he had not visited to Manipur and made no inquiries in relation to the business 

of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 or his alibi. 

CONCLUSION 

137. The testimonies of the prosecution witnesses i.e. PW-13 Sh. Sita Ram 

Goyal (the father of the deceased Smt. Reena Goyal), PW-14 Smt. Veena Goyal 

(the mother of the deceased), PW-15 Smt. Mamta Goyal (step sister-in-law of 

the deceased), PW-16 Tanjeev Kumar Goyal and PW-17 Sh. Manjeev Goyal 

(both step brothers of the deceased) bring forth that the accused no. 1 / 

respondent no. 1 had a good finance business at Manipur. that the parents of the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 were Government servants and father of the 

accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had already retired. The evidence on the record 

thus, as rightly held by the learned trial court does not establish any cruelty 

meted out to the deceased by the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and the 

accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 for dowry in terms of Sections 498A of IPC, 

1860 as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment titled as "Kanwar Pal 

vs. Shakuntala and Ors." reported in 2015 IV AD (Delhi) 450 that : -

"to establish the offence under section 304B IPC of dowry death, 
the presumption under section 113B of Evidence Act cannot be 
raised against an accused until independently the offence under 
Section 498A IPC is proved by leading evidence qua the specific 
allegation with regard to time and date of such demand and 
cruelty and furthermore establishing the proximate live link 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 85 of 88 

between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand (offence 
under Section 498A IPC) and the death of the victim" 

138. It is evident thus that the prosecution has failed to prove that the accused 

nos. 1 and 2 / respondent nos. 1 and 2 had treated the deceased with cruelty 

within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, 1860 and thus the presumption under 

Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 of a dowry death cannot be 

raised against the accused nos. 1 and 2 / respondent nos. 1 and 2, as there is 

nothing on record to establish any credible evidence led by the prosecution to 

prove any specific allegation with regard to the time and date of any demands or 

cruelty meted out to the deceased having not established any proximate live link 

between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demands and the death of the 

victim i.e. deceased. 

139. It is essential to observe that to bring the accused nos. 1 and 2 / 

respondent nos. 1 and 2 within the ambit of culpability under Sections 304B of 

IPC, 1860, the prosecution has to established the following essential ingredients 

of Section 304B of IPC, 1860: -

(i) 
that soon before her death, the woman must have been 
subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband / or in-laws, 
which cruelty must be for or in connection with demand for dowry; 
and 
(ii) such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been meted out 
to the woman soon before her death. 

140. The verdict of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Raman Kumar v. State of 

Punjab, 2009(3) JCC 1840 : (2009) 16 SCC 35 categorically lays down that 

the presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act is a presumption of 

law which can be raised only on proof of the following ingredients : -

(i) 
The death of a woman should be caused burns or bodily injury or 
otherwise than under a normal circumstance; 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 86 of 88 

(ii) Such a death should have occurred within seven years of her 
marriage; 
(iii) She must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her 
husband or any relative of her husband; 
(iv) Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with 
demand of dowry; 
(v) Such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been meted out to 
the woman soon before her death; 

141. It was further laid down by the Supreme Court in the said verdict in para 

16 to the effect : -

"16. A conjoint reading of Section 113B of the Evidence Act and 
Section 304B IPC shows that there must be material to show that 
soon before her death the victim was subjected to cruelty or 
harassment. The prosecution has to rule out the possibility of a 
natural or accidental death so as to bring it within the purview of 
the "death occurring otherwise than in normal circumstances". 
The expression "soon before" is very relevant where Section 
113B of the Evidence Act and Section 304B IPC are pressed into 
service. The prosecution is obliged to show that soon before the 
occurrence there was cruelty or harassment and only in that case 
presumption operates. Evidence in that regard has to be led in by 
the prosecution. "Soon before" is a relative term and it would 
depend upon the circumstances of each case and no strait jacket 
formula can be laid down as to what would constitute a period of 
soon before the occurrence. It would be hazardous to indicate 
any fixed period, and that brings in the importance of a proximity 
test both for the proof of an offence of dowry death as well as for 
raising a presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act. 
The expression "soon before for death" used in the substantive 
Section 304B IPC and Section 113B of the Evidence Act is 
present, with the idea of proximity test. No definite period has 
been indicated and the expression "soon before" is not defined. A 
reference to the expression "soon before" used in Section 114 
Illustration (a) of the Evidence Act is relevant. It lays down that a 
court may presume that a man who is in the possession of goods 
soon after the theft, is either the thief who had received the goods 
knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for his 
possession. The determination of the period which can come 


Crl.L.P.74/2016 

Page 87 of 88 

within the term "soon before" is left to be determined by the 
courts, depending upon facts and circumstances of each case. 
Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression "soon before" 
would normally imply that the interval should not be much 
between the cruelty or harassment concerned and the death in 
question. There must be existence of a proximate and live link 
between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the 
death concerned. If the alleged incident of cruelty is remote in 
time and has become stale enough not to disturb the mental 
equilibrium of the woman concerned, it would be no 
consequence." 

142. Tested on the anvil on the above parameters, the prosecution evidence 

led, does not bring forth that there was any harassment or cruelty meted out to 

the deceased soon before her death to compel her to commit suicide. 

143. In view thereof, the submissions made on behalf of the State through the 

Criminal Leave Petition No. 74/2016 seeking leave to appeal to contend that the 

learned Additional Sessions Judge had not appreciated the evidence cannot be 

accepted in as much as there is nothing on record to indicate that the learned 

trial court has ignored any material evidence, nor to indicate that there has been 

any misappreciation of evidence. 

144. In view thereof, the Criminal Leave Petition No. 74/2016 whereby the 

State seeks the setting aside of the impugned judgment dated 16.09.2015 of the 

learned Additional Sessions Judge-II (North West), Rohini Courts, Delhi in 

Session Case no. 67/12 in relation to FIR no. 95/12 registered at police station 

Mukherjee Nagar, under Section 498A/304B/34 IPC whereby the accused no. 1 

/ respondent no. 1 namely B. Raj Sharma and the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 

2 namely Chanchan were acquitted in relation to the alleged commission of 

offence punishable under Section 498A/304B/34 IPC, 1860 and also for the 

alternative charge framed under Section 302/34 IPC, 1860 is thus, -dismissed.
