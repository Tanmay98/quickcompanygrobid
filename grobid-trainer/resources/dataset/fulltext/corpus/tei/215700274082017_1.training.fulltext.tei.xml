			<lb />
			mainly responsible for the signing of the M.O.U and

		</item>

		<item>

			any national investigating agency to probe into all the

		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			The substantial contention urged by the petitioner is
			<lb />
			that the Comptroller and Auditor General of India in its report has
			<lb />
			listed out several irregularities in the conditions incorporated in
			<lb />
			an agreement between the State of Kerala and Adani Ports
			<lb />
			Private Ltd., which were unfavourable to the State. But despite
			<lb />
			such reports, no action is taken by the Government to consider
			<lb />
			whether the agreement would protect the interest of the State
			<lb />
			and therefore he seeks appropriate modification to the
			<lb />
			agreement and to
			<lb />
			ensure proper enquiry being conducted
			<lb />
			through an appropriate agency into the kickbacks if any that
			<lb />
			would have passed on between the parties while entering into the
			<lb />
			agreement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			The respondents have filed their counter affidavit
			<lb />
			denying the allegations. During the course of the proceedings,
			<lb />
			this Court had sought the response of the Government by an
			<lb />
			interim order dated 13/9/2017. By yet another interim order
			<lb />
			dated 9/10/2017, it was observed that the State Government had
			<lb />
			appointed a Commission of Enquiry under the Commission of
			<lb />
			Enquiry Act, 1952, headed by a retired Judge of this Court as per
			<lb />
			notification dated 18/7/2019 and therefore, it is not appropriate
			<lb />
			to consider the matter while awaiting for the recommendation of
			<lb />
			the Commission. By a further interim order dated 15/3/2019, it
			<lb />
			was indicated by this Court that the commission of enquiry has
			<lb />
			finalised the report and it has to be placed before the State
			<lb />
			Legislature.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			When the above matter came up for hearing on
			<lb />
			18/12/2020, we heard Sri.M.K.Salim, the petitioner as party in
			<lb />
			person through video conferencing, learned State Attorney
			<lb />
			Sri.K.V.Sohan,
			<lb />
			Sri.K.P.Dandapani,
			<lb />
			learned
			<lb />
			Senior
			<lb />
			counsel
			<lb />
			appearing on behalf of the 4 th respondent, Sri.C.S.Ajith Prakash,
			<lb />
			learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 5 th respondent and
			<lb />
			Sri.Sasthamangalam S.Ajith Kumar, learned Special Public
			<lb />
			Prosecutor appearing on behalf of the 6 th respondent.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			The petitioner reiterated his contentions in the matter.
			<lb />
			The learned State Attorney placed before us Government letter
			<lb />
			dated 2/12/2020 sent by the Additional Chief Secretary to the
			<lb />
			Director,
			<lb />
			Vigilance
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			Anti-Corruption
			<lb />
			Bureau,
			<lb />
			Thiruvananthapuram. The purport of the letter is that based on
			<lb />
			the Commission Report of Justice C.N.Ramachandran Nair and the
			<lb />
			infirmities which were pointed out, Government had decided to
			<lb />
			conduct vigilance enquiry and therefore sanction was given to
			<lb />
			conduct investigation under Section 17A of the Prevention of
			<lb />
			Corruption Act, 1988. The relevant portion of the said letter reads
			<lb />
			as under:-
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;xxx
			<lb />
			A Concession agreement has been entered into between
			<lb />
			the Government of Kerala and Adani Vizhinjam Port Private
			<lb />
			Limited for the construction of the Vizhinjam International
			<lb />
			Multi-purpose Seaport. lt is reported as per the references
			<lb />
			cited (copies enclosed) that actions as elaborated below
			<lb />
			have resulted in financial advantage to the Concessionaire,
			<lb />
			which were not conceived at the time of RFP.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			1. It was proposed to construct breakwater as per EPC
			<lb />
			(Engineering, Procurement and Construction) mode. This
			<lb />
			proposal was subsequently canceled and incorporated as a
			<lb />
			work to be carried-out by, the Concessionaire an amount of
			<lb />
			Rs. 1463 Crores. As the EPC tender was canceled, the
			<lb />
			market rate for the above project could not be worked out.
			<lb />
			It has resulted in huge benefit to Concessionaire.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			2. As per EPC proposal, the cost required for the
			<lb />
			completion of breakwater and Fishing harbour was Rs.747
			<lb />
			Crores, fixed by the Consultant. The same was increased
			<lb />
			to Rs.1463 crores. Though the cost of funded work was
			<lb />
			increased, since only one offer was received, the cost of the
			<lb />
			project was not meticulously analyzed and vetted at the
			<lb />
			Government level and the cost seems to be without
			<lb />
			considering the actual requirement. This has also resulted
			<lb />
			in benefit to the Concessionaire.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			3. Extension of Concession period from 30 years to
			<lb />
			40 years against the provisions under the Model Concession
			<lb />
			Agreement has resulted in huge benefit to the
			<lb />
			Concessionaire.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			4. The construction of breakwater and Fishing
			<lb />
			Harbour as funded work, development of Port Estate, etc,
			<lb />
			were not originally contemplated at the tine of RFQ. This
			<lb />
			has also made for undue benefit to the Concessionaire.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			5. A comparative study of certain rates to ascertain
			<lb />
			the cost of funded works on DPR and Basic Engineering
			<lb />
			Report shows that rate calculated in the Concession
			<lb />
			agreement gives undue benefit to the Concessionaire.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			6. The rate of rock which is a substantial component
			<lb />
			of breakwater is based on the rates fixed by AECOM &amp; the
			<lb />
			rate assessed by the C&amp;AG on the rate fixed by HED shows
			<lb />
			huge difference. While fixing such rates no proper scrutiny
			<lb />
			has been made.
			<lb />
			I am directed to inform you that the Government
			<lb />
			have decided to conduct a Vigilance Enquiry on the above
			<lb />
			aspects. Accordingly, sanction is also given to conduct the
			<lb />
			Enquiry under Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption
			<lb />
			Act,1988. I am also to request you to take expeditious
			<lb />
			steps to conduct the Vigilance Enquiry.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			As far as the relief sought for by the petitioner is
			<lb />
			concerned, it is substantially met when the Government had
			<lb />
			ordered enquiry through a Commission who was a former Judge
			<lb />
			of this Court. On the basis of the report submitted by the
			<lb />
			Commission, the Vigilance Wing of the State had also been
			<lb />
			directed to conduct investigation.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			In the light of the aforesaid factual situation, we do not
			<lb />
			think that there is any necessity to keep the matter pending as
			<lb />
			the grievance brought to the notice of the court to a certain
			<lb />
			extent had been taken care of by the Government itself while
			<lb />
			appointing a Commission of Enquiry as well as by directing a
			<lb />
			vigilance investigation to be held in the matter. Once the
			<lb />
			vigilance investigation is complete, the law shall take its own
			<lb />
			course.
			<lb />
			Therefore, we do not think that any further directions are
			<lb />
			required in the matter. Writ petition is disposed of taking note of
			<lb />
			the above facts.
