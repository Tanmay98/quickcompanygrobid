		<head>CORAM:HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K.GAUBA</head>
		<p>
			1. The petition at hand invokes Article 227 of the Constitution of
			India to bring a challenge to the order dated 03.08.2017 passed bythe Senior Civil Judge (South) at Saket Courts, New Delhi in the
			<lb />
			course of proceedings arising out of the civil suit, presently
			<lb />
			registered as CS no. SCJ 82862/16, which was originally instituted
			<lb />
			by the petitioner on 06.11.1989, whereby the application under
			<lb />
			Order I Rule 10 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (CPC) of the
			<lb />
			tenth respondent, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was
			<lb />
			allowed and it was impleaded as tenth defendant.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2. It may be noted at the outset that the civil suit, which has been
			<lb />
			pending since 1989, concerns a plot of land described by the
			<lb />
			petitioner (plaintiff) as Lal Masjid Qabristan in Khasra no. 389,
			<lb />
			360 and 361 within revenue record of the village, Aliganj, Lala
			<lb />
			Lajpatrai Marg, New Delhi, the prayer in the civil suit being for a
			<lb />
			decree for permanent injunction against interference in the peaceful
			<lb />
			possession and enjoyment thereof or from committing trespass into
			<lb />
			it or against putting any malba into it or causing any damage and
			<lb />
			demolition to the graveyard and the property or leveling any
			<lb />
			portion by the parties in the case arrayed as defendants.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3.The array of defendants in the suit, as originally presented by
			<lb />
			the petitioner, included Union Of India through its Secretary in the
			<lb />
			Ministry of Home Affairs (first defendant); Delhi Administration
			<lb />
			through its Chief Secretary now Government of NCT of Delhi
			<lb />
			(second defendant); Central Public Works Department (CPWD)
			<lb />
			through its Chief Engineer
			<lb />
			(third defendant);
			<lb />
			Land and
			<lb />
			Development Officer (fourth defendant); Delhi Development
			<lb />
			Authority (fifth defendant); Municipal Corporation of Delhi (sixth
			<lb />
			defendant); the Commissioner of Police New Delhi (seventh defendant); Station House Officer of Police Station Lodhi Colony
			<lb />
			(eighth defendant); and New Delhi Municipal Committee (ninth
			<lb />
			defendant).
			<lb />
			It may also be noted here that the defendants,
			<lb />
			particularly the Union of India in the course of contest, have taken
			<lb />
			the position that suit property is government land and that the
			<lb />
			plaintiff is an unauthorized and illegal occupier of the same.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4. It is stated that the Land and Development Officer of
			<lb />
			Government of India (fourth defendant in the suit) had originally
			<lb />
			earmarked the land in question to CPWD (third defendant) but, by
			<lb />
			letter dated 28.02.2017, it has allotted land admeasuring
			<lb />
			2.23
			<lb />
			acres, to CRPF for construction of its office accommodation,
			<lb />
			shifting of Canteen, barracks for men and parking of vehicles etc.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5. It is against the aforesaid backdrop that the application under
			<lb />
			Order I Rule 10 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908(CPC) was
			<lb />
			moved before the Senior Civil Judge on 29.04.2017 by the Senior
			<lb />
			Central Government Counsel seeking impleadment of CRPF (to be
			<lb />
			represented through its Director General) as one of the defendants.
			<lb />
			The application was contested by the petitioner/plaintiff, as noticed
			<lb />
			in the order, by pleadings to the effect that such impleadment was
			<lb />
			not necessary inter alia because it was in breach of the doctrine of
			<lb />
			lis-pendens under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882
			<lb />
			and that such move is belated and would delay the trial. The Trial
			<lb />
			Judge has found such objections to be devoid of substance and
			<lb />
			found it appropriate to implead CRPF as an additional defendant.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6. The petition is pressed to challenge the above mentioned order
			<lb />
			on the same very contentions as were urged before the learned trial
			<lb />
			MAC App. No. 1247/2017
			<lb />
			Page 3 of 4judge. Reliance is placed on decisions of learned single judges of
			<lb />
			this court in Sanjay Gupta Vs. Smt. Kala Wati 85 (2000) DLT 828,
			<lb />
			Prakash Khattar Vs. Shanta Jindal &amp; Ors. 181 (2011) DLT 138
			<lb />
			and Bhim Singh Vs. Amar Nath &amp; Ors. 149 (2008) DLT 34 to
			<lb />
			submit that the allotment in favour of the CRPF was in breach of
			<lb />
			the doctrine of lis-pendens as per Section 52 of the Transfer of
			<lb />
			Property Act, 1882. It is also argued that the impleadment of a
			<lb />
			party against the stand taken by the plaintiff is permitted only if
			<lb />
			there is a legal right vesting in such additional party making him a
			<lb />
			necessary party within the meaning of the provision contained in
			<lb />
			Order I Rule 10 CPC.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7. Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned
			<lb />
			counsel representing the respondents, this Court finds no merit in
			<lb />
			the petition. The view taken by the learned trial judge in the
			<lb />
			impugned order does not call for any interference. The validity of
			<lb />
			allotment in favour of CRPF cannot be questioned or determined
			<lb />
			without the party in question (the allottee) being arrayed as
			<lb />
			defendant. By such allotment, CRPF claims to have acquired a
			<lb />
			vested interest. In these circumstances, it is not merely a proper
			<lb />
			party, but a necessary party to the proceedings.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			8.The petition is, therefore, dismissed.
			<lb />
			R.K.GAUBA, J.
