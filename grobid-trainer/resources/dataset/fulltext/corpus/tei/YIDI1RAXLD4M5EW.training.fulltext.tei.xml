			<lb />
			This Regular First Appeal under Section 96 of the Code
			<lb />
			of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) is filed by the defendant impugning
			<lb />
			the judgment of the Trial Court dated 16.10.2017 in the suit for
			<lb />
			possession of the suit property being first floor and second floor of
			<lb />
			Khasra Nos.64/6, 14/1, 64/10/1, 65/10/1 situated in Palam Village,
			<lb />
			Colony Raj Nagar-1, New Delhi. By the impugned judgment besides
			<lb />
			decreeing the suit for possession filed by the respondents/plaintiffs, an
			<lb />
			independent suit filed by the appellant/defendant for seeking
			<lb />
			cancellation of the Sale Deed dated 17.04.2014 executed by the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs has been
			<lb />
			dismissed i.e. the Sale Deed dated 17.04.2014 executed by the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs was held to
			<lb />
			be duly executed and hence valid.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			The facts of the case are that parties entered into a
			<lb />
			collaboration agreement whereby on the plot/property owned by the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant, the respondents/plaintiffs were to make a new
			<lb />
			construction.
			<lb />
			For making of the new construction and the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant also receiving an amount of Rs.8 lacs, the
			<lb />
			respondents/plaintiffs were to become owners of the suit property
			<lb />
			being the first and second floor of the property. I may note that as per
			<lb />
			the case of the respondents/plaintiffs for execution of the sale deed of
			<lb />
			the first floor and second floor the appellant/defendant had received ,
			<lb />
			not a sum of Rs.8 lacs as stated above, but a total amount of Rs.13 lacs
			<lb />
			with a sum of Rs.10 lacs being received in cash and Rs.3 lacs by
			<lb />
			means of a cheque.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			The disputes between the parties arose inasmuch as
			<lb />
			respondents/plaintiffs had become owners of the first and second floor
			<lb />
			in terms of the Sale Deed dated 17.04.2014 executed by the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs but the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant contended that appellant/defendant did not receive
			<lb />
			the consideration of Rs.13 lacs as stated in the sale deed and the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant further claimed that appellant/defendant had
			<lb />
			executed the sale deed only as a nominal document so that the
			<lb />
			respondents/plaintiffs could raise monies for further construction on
			<lb />
			the suit property. Accordingly after construction on the property was
			<lb />
			complete, the respondents/plaintiffs filed their suit for possession,
			<lb />
			pleading to be the owners of the first and second floor in terms of the
			<lb />
			registered Sale Deed dated 17.04.2014, and to which defence of the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant including by way of filing of the independent suit
			<lb />
			was to plead and claim that the sale deed dated 17.04.2014 was an
			<lb />
			nominal and illegal document and it did not transfer title of the first
			<lb />
			and second floor of the property to the respondents/plaintiffs.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			After pleadings were complete in both the suits, the
			<lb />
			following issues were framed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;5. On the basis of the pleadings of the parties, in the suit for possession,
			<lb />
			the following issues were framed on 09.03.2017:
			<lb />
			ISSUES
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i) Whether the suit filed by the plaintiff is bad due to mis-joinder of the
			<lb />
			parties ? OPD.
			<lb />
			(ii) Whether the defendant has not been paid the entire sale consideration
			<lb />
			as shown in the sale deed dated 17.04.2014 ? OPD.

			<lb />
			the property bearing no. RZ-643D/1, measuring 50 sq. yards, i.e. 41.80 sq.
			<lb />
			meters, out of khasra nos. 64/6, 14/1, 64/10/1, 65/10/1 situated in
			<lb />
			revenue estate of Palam Village, Delhi Estate, area abadi known as
			<lb />
			Colony, Raj Nagar-I, New Delhi ? OPP.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of damages and mesne
			<lb />
			profits, pendent lite and future damages at the rate of Rs. 300 per day, as
			<lb />
			prayed for ? OPP.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) Relief.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			6. On the basis of the pleadings of the parties, in the suit for cancellation,
			<lb />
			the following issues were framed on 19.05.2017 :
			<lb />
			ISSUES
			<lb />
			i). Whether the defendant no.1 neither completed the building
			<lb />
			within the period of ten months nor paid balance amount of Rs. 9 Lacs
			<lb />
			to the plaintiff ? OPD.
			<lb />
			ii). Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of cancellation thereby
			<lb />
			canceling the sale deed dated 17.04.2014 registered vide Regd. No.
			<lb />
			4771, registered with Sub-Registrar-IX, Delhi ? OPP.
			<lb />
			iii). Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of permanent injunction,
			<lb />
			as prayed for ? OPP.
			<lb />
			iv). Relief.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			Trial court by the impugned judgment has held that the
			<lb />
			respondents/plaintiffs have been successful in proving that a valid Sale
			<lb />
			Deed dated 17.04.2014 was executed and registered in their favour by
			<lb />
			the appellant/defendant whereunder the appellant/defendant had
			<lb />
			received the consideration of Rs.13 lacs as stated in the sale deed.
			<lb />
			Trial court has also held that the appellant/defendant is barred because
			<lb />
			of Section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 from questioning the
			<lb />
			terms of the registered sale deed that the appellant/defendant did not
			<lb />
			receive the sale consideration of Rs.13 lacs.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			From the facts of the present case it is seen that
			<lb />
			admittedly there is a duly executed and registered sale deed of the suit
			<lb />
			property comprising of the first and second floor by the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs and the
			<lb />
			issue to be decided is as to whether appellant/defendant could have
			<lb />
			argued or has successfully argued that the appellant/defendant did not
			<lb />
			receive payment of Rs.13 lacs as stated in the registered sale deed
			<lb />
			dated 17.04.2014 or that the sale deed was only a nominal
			<lb />
			document/sham transaction.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			I completely agree with the conclusion of the trial court
			<lb />
			that once the sale deed has been proved to have been executed and
			<lb />
			registered by the appellant/defendant in favour of the
			<lb />
			respondents/plaintiffs then the contents of the sale deed as regards the
			<lb />
			receipt of the consideration by the appellant/defendant from the
			<lb />
			respondents/plaintiffs cannot be questioned and that such a plea of the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant is barred because of Section 92 of the Indian
			<lb />
			Evidence Act. I may note that it is an undisputed fact that
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant admits that she did execute and register the
			<lb />
			subject sale deed in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs but the case of
			<lb />
			the appellant/defendant is that she did not receive the consideration as
			<lb />
			mentioned in the sale deed because the sale deed was executed as a
			<lb />
			nominal document in order that the respondents/plaintiffs can arrange
			<lb />
			monies for construction.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			10(i)
			<lb />
			So far as the plea of sale deed being a nominal document,
			<lb />
			counsel for the appellant/defendant has relied upon the judgment of
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court in the case of Smt. Gangabai vs Smt.Chhabubai
			<lb />
			(1982) 1 SCC 4 and which holds that the bar under Section 92 of the
			<lb />
			Indian Evidence Act will not apply if the document is a nominal
			<lb />
			document.
			<lb />
			(ii)
			<lb />
			I cannot agree with the argument urged on behalf of the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant by placing reliance upon the judgment of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in the case of Gangabai (supra) inasmuch as to take
			<lb />
			benefit of the ratio of the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of
			<lb />
			Gangabai (supra) it has to be proved first that the document was only
			<lb />
			a nominal document or that the transaction was a sham transaction.
			<lb />
			Appellant/defendant except making her self-serving averment has led
			<lb />
			no evidence whatsoever that the subject sale deed was not executed
			<lb />
			and registered by her for consideration. Making of self-serving
			<lb />
			averment is not discharge of onus of proof with respect to vital issue
			<lb />
			of alleged nominal document because if simple oral statements are to
			<lb />
			be taken as proof of the document being a nominal document then
			<lb />
			there will be no sale deed which is duly executed and registered and as
			<lb />
			a result of which valuable rights in an immoveable property are
			<lb />
			transferred, will be safe. Argument urged on behalf of the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant placing reliance upon Gangabai&apos;s case (supra) is
			<lb />
			rejected.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			11(i)
			<lb />
			Learned counsel for the appellant/defendant then argued
			<lb />
			that in the subject Sale Deed dated 17.04.2014 it is mentioned in para
			<lb />
			2 that appellant/defendant had transferred possession whereas
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant did not transfer possession and therefore this
			<lb />
			shows that the terms of the document cannot be read in finality. It is
			<lb />
			also argued that whereas the sale deed talks of receipt of consideration
			<lb />
			of Rs.13 lacs in cash the admitted fact is that a sum of Rs.3 lacs was in
			<lb />
			fact received by the appellant/defendant by means of a cheque, and
			<lb />
			which aspect again shows that the terms of the document should not
			<lb />
			be taken as final. For not taking terms of the document as final,
			<lb />
			reliance on behalf of the appellant/defendant is placed upon the
			<lb />
			judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Kaliaperumal vs.
			<lb />
			Rajagopal and Another (2009) 4 SCC 193. By relying upon this
			<lb />
			judgment, it is argued on behalf of the appellant/defendant that
			<lb />
			whether or not title in an immoveable property is transferred by a sale
			<lb />
			deed depends on the intention of the parties and if it is established that
			<lb />
			the sale consideration is not paid being a pre-requisite to transfer of
			<lb />
			title, then title in the property does not pass and parties can always
			<lb />
			lead evidence, without the bar of the Section 92 of Indian Evidence
			<lb />
			Act coming into play, that the consideration did not pass under a sale
			<lb />
			deed, although it is so stated in the sale deed.
			<lb />
			(ii)
			<lb />
			I cannot agree with the argument urged on behalf of the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant by placing reliance upon the judgment of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in the case of Kaliaperumal&apos;s (supra) because the
			<lb />
			judgment of the Supreme Court in Kaliaperumal&apos;s case (supra)
			<lb />
			applies only to those facts where the seller under the sale deed after
			<lb />
			execution of the document did not appear before the Sub-Registrar for
			<lb />
			registration and where the buyer got the sale deed registered before the
			<lb />
			Sub-Registrar by exercising of the powers by the Sub-Registrar under
			<lb />
			the Registration Act, 1908 in holding that the sale deed was executed.
			<lb />
			In other words the observations which have been made by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in Kaliaperumal&apos;s case (supra) are confined to facts
			<lb />
			of the said case where there was dispute between the buyer and the
			<lb />
			seller with respect to execution of the sale deed because after
			<lb />
			execution of the sale deed which mention receipt of consideration, the
			<lb />
			seller did not appear before the Sub-Registrar on the ground that the
			<lb />
			consideration as stated in the sale deed has not been received by the
			<lb />
			seller. Therefore there was dispute with respect to the execution of the
			<lb />
			document being the sale deed itself and in such circumstances
			<lb />
			Supreme Court held that evidence could be looked into to examine as
			<lb />
			to whether consideration passed or did not pass under the sale deed. I
			<lb />
			may note that in the present case the sale deed is admittedly executed
			<lb />
			and registered by the appellant/defendant before the Sub-Registrar,
			<lb />
			and which sale deed clearly mentions receipt of consideration of Rs.13
			<lb />
			lacs, and therefore once the document is proved to have been duly
			<lb />
			executed, registered and having coming into existence, therefore the
			<lb />
			terms of the document can only be those terms as stated in the sale
			<lb />
			deed by virtue of Section 91 of the Indian Evidence Act and
			<lb />
			exception contained in Section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act would
			<lb />
			not apply unless the document was proved to be a nominal document
			<lb />
			and which has not been proved on behalf of the appellant/defendant.
			<lb />
			Kaliaperumal&apos;s case (supra) does not lay down a ratio that even if
			<lb />
			there is a duly executed and registered sale deed, and which is not
			<lb />
			proved to be a nominal document, yet the parties to the transaction
			<lb />
			being the sale deed can question the terms of the document as to that
			<lb />
			consideration which is stated to be received in the sale deed, is not
			<lb />
			received. In my opinion therefore appellant/defendant cannot place
			<lb />
			reliance upon the ratio of the judgment of Kaliaperumal&apos;s case
			<lb />
			(supra) in which facts were different and especially because there was
			<lb />
			no finality to the sale deed, and consequently only after there is
			<lb />
			finality of the sale deed only thereafter that the document only can be
			<lb />
			looked into for its terms as per Section 91 of the Indian Evidence Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			12(i)
			<lb />
			Learned counsel for the appellant/defendant then placed
			<lb />
			reliance upon the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Janak
			<lb />
			Dulari Devi And Another vs. Kapildeo Rai And Another (2011) 6
			<lb />
			SCC 555 to argue that in para 13 of this judgment, Supreme Court has
			<lb />
			held that with respect to a registered sale deed where possession is to
			<lb />
			be delivered on payment of entire consideration, then where the
			<lb />
			purchaser admits that he had not paid the entire consideration or where
			<lb />
			the vendor proves that the consideration was not paid, then the title
			<lb />
			would not pass. Accordingly, it is argued that as per Janak Dulari&apos;s
			<lb />
			case (supra) appellant/defendant is entitled to lead evidence to show
			<lb />
			that consideration as stated in the subject Sale Deed dated 17.04.2014
			<lb />
			did not pass to the appellant/defendant. Para 13 of the judgment in
			<lb />
			Janak Dulari&apos;s case (supra) which is relied upon reads as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;13. Where the sale deed recites that on receipt of the total
			<lb />
			consideration by the vendor, the property was conveyed and possession
			<lb />
			was delivered, the clear intention is that title would pass and possession
			<lb />
			would be delivered only on payment of the entire sale consideration.
			<lb />
			Therefore, where the sale deed recited that on receipt of the entire
			<lb />
			consideration, the vendor was conveying the property, but the purchaser
			<lb />
			admits that he has not paid the entire consideration (or if the vendor proves
			<lb />
			that the entire sale consideration was not paid to him), title in the property
			<lb />
			would not pass to the purchaser.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			I cannot agree with the argument urged on behalf of the
			<lb />
			appellant/defendant because the answer to the argument urged on
			<lb />
			behalf of the appellant/defendant by relying upon Janak Dulari&apos;s case
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>(</item>

		<p>
			supra) is given by the Supreme Court in para 24 of that judgment
			<lb />
			itself, clarifying that the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Janak Dulari&apos;s case (supra) is peculiar to the facts of that case on
			<lb />
			account of practice which has developed in Bihar of the registration
			<lb />
			receipt of the sale deed remaining with the seller till the consideration
			<lb />
			was paid, although consideration is stated to have been paid in terms
			<lb />
			of the sale deed. This para 24 of the judgment in Janak Dulari&apos;s case
			<lb />
			reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;24. We hasten to add that the practice of ta khubzul badlain (of title
			<lb />
			passing on exchange of equivalent) is prevalent only in Bihar. Normally,
			<lb />
			the recitals in a sale deed about transfer of title, receipt of consideration
			<lb />
			and delivery of possession will be evidence of such acts and events; and on
			<lb />
			the execution and registration of the sale deed, the sale would be complete
			<lb />
			even if the sale price was not paid, and it will not be possible to cancel the
			<lb />
			sale deed unilaterally. The exception to this rule is stated in Kaliaperumal.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			The practice of ta khubzul badlain in Bihar recognizes that a duly executed
			<lb />
			sale deed will not operate as a transfer in preasenti but postpones the
			<lb />
			actual transfer of title, from the time of execution and registration of the
			<lb />
			deed, to the time of exchange of equivalents that is registration receipt and
			<lb />
			the sale consideration, if the intention of the parties was that title would
			<lb />
			pass only on payment of entire sale consideration. As a result, until and
			<lb />
			unless the duly executed and registered sale deed comes into the
			<lb />
			possession of the purchaser, or until the right to receive the original sale
			<lb />
			deed is secured by the purchaser by obtaining the registration receipt, the
			<lb />
			deed of sale remains merely an agreement to be performed and will not be
			<lb />
			a completed sale. But in States where such a practice is not prevalent,
			<lb />
			possession of Registration Receipt by the Vendor, may not, in the absence
			<lb />
			of other clear evidence, lead to an inference that consideration has not been
			<lb />
			paid or that title has not passed to the purchaser as recited in the duly
			<lb />
			executed deed of conveyance. Where the purchaser is from an outstation,
			<lb />
			the vendor being entrusted with the registration receipt, to collect the
			<lb />
			original sale deed and deliver it to the purchaser, is common. Be that as it
			<lb />
			may.&quot;
			<lb />
			(iii)
			<lb />
			Therefore, appellant/defendant cannot place any reliance
			<lb />
			on judgment of Supreme Court surely because Janak Dulari&apos;s case
			<lb />
			(supra) did not intend to wipe out the provisions of Sections 91 and 92
			<lb />
			of the Indian Evidence Act from the statute book. I may also note that
			<lb />
			there is no observation and nor any ratio laid down by the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in Janak Dulari&apos;s case (supra) that even if a document being a
			<lb />
			sale deed is proved to have been executed and registered and even
			<lb />
			though it is not proved to be a nominal document, yet the seller of the
			<lb />
			sale deed can question the fact that consideration has not passed to the
			<lb />
			seller although recorded otherwise in the duly executed and registered
			<lb />
			sale deed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			13.
			<lb />
			Finally learned counsel for the appellant/defendant
			<lb />
			argued that since admittedly the sale deed mentions receipt of amount
			<lb />
			in cash whereas admittedly a sum of Rs.3 lacs is received by cheque
			<lb />
			therefore the sale deed must fail is an argument in my opinion only a
			<lb />
			technicality because the issue is that even if it is wrongly mentioned in
			<lb />
			the sale deed of consideration being received in cash, although the
			<lb />
			consideration is received both by cash and cheque, yet the fact of the
			<lb />
			matter remains is that the appellant/defendant is taken to have received
			<lb />
			the entire consideration as stated in the subject Sale Deed dated
			<lb />
			17.04.2018.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			14.
			<lb />
			In view of the aforesaid discussion, I do not find any
			<lb />
			merit in the appeal. Dismissed.
