			<p>(Order of the Court was made by Mr.Justice S.MANIKUMAR)<lb/> Mr.Senthil Kumar, resident of Thalavaipuram, Rajapalayam Taluk,<lb/> Virudhunagar District, has filed this writ petition, for issuance of a Writ of<lb/> Mandamus, forbearing the respondents from undertaking any construction<lb/> activity in Survey No.50/2, Chettiyarpatti Village, Thalavaipuram, which has<lb/> been earmarked as Kalam Poromboke.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.In the supporting affidavit, he has contended that in the village, there is<lb/> a temple called, Sithi Vinayagar temple, located on the southern side of Kalam<lb/> Poromboke (thrashing field). The field is surrounded by temples and all the<lb/> festivals are conducted in the thrashing field, by the village people. For their<lb/> village, there is a police station located near Thalavaipuram bus stand and it is<lb/> functioning for the past 20 years. On 12.02.2016, the Tahsildar, Rajapalayam<lb/> Taluk, Virudhunagar District, performed Boomi pooja, in the said Kalam<lb/> Poromboke. After enquiry, the villagers came to know that a new police station<lb/> is proposed to be constructed in the said place. They objected to the same. Even<lb/> in the Peace Committee Meeting convened, no settlement was arrived at. On<lb/> 19.03.2016, despite objections, the respondents demolished the Kalam situated in<lb/> S.No.50/2, Chettiyarpatti Village, Thalavaipuram.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.According to the petitioner, there are 2500 families living in the said<lb/> area. Agriculture is their main occupation. Kalam has been used for time<lb/> memorial days and alteration of the same would affect the villagers. thrashing<lb/> field at S.No.50/2, Chettiyarpatti Village, Thalavaipuram, is the place used by the<lb/> villagers both for agricultural purposes and to conduct public festivals. In the<lb/> abovesaid circumstances, Writ of Mandamus is sought for.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.Considering the prayer sought for, we directed Mr.M.Alagadevan,<lb/> learned Special Government Pleader, to take notice on behalf of the respondents<lb/> and get instructions.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.Reverting, he submitted that as early as on 06.10.2013 itself, the District<lb/> Collector, vide proceedings in Na.Ka.B4/11246/2012, dated 06.10.2013, has<lb/> accorded permission for transfer of lands, under Section 23-A of the Board<lb/> Standing Orders, measuring an extent of 0.05.0 hectare out of 0.41.0 hectare,<lb/> Kalam Poromboke in S.No.50/2, Chettiyarpatti Village, Thalavaipuram,<lb/> Rajapalayam Taluk, for construction of a police station. We further directed the<lb/> learned Special Government Pleader to produce the records.<lb/></p>

			<item>6.Learned Special Government Pleader by placing reliance on the<lb/> documents and records enclosed in the typed set of papers, dated 31.03.2016,<lb/> submitted that all the objections raised in the present writ petition, do not merit<lb/> any consideration and prayed for dismissal for the writ petition.<lb/></item>

			<p>7.Per contra, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there was<lb/> no consultation with Thalavaipuram Village Panchayat Council, nor there was<lb/> any resolution passed by the Council permitting transfer of land. Based on the<lb/> recent objections dated 22.03.2016, he further submitted that when 5 out of 9<lb/> ward members have objected to construction of a police station, the District<lb/> Collector, Virudhunagar, ought to have considered the same. It is also his<lb/> contention that the order of the District Collector passed without following the<lb/> procedure, is null and void, and for the abovesaid reasons, prayed to issue a<lb/> Writ of Mandamus.<lb/> Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials<lb/> available on record.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.Section 134 of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, reads as follows:-<lb/></p>

			<item>&apos;&apos;134. (1) The provisions of this section shall apply only in<lb/> ryotwari tracts.<lb/></item>

			<item>(3) The Collector, afler consulting the village panchayat,<lb/> may, by notification, exclude from the operation of this Act, any<lb/> poramboke referred to in sub-section (2), and may also modify or<lb/> cancel such notification.<lb/></item>

			<item>(4) The village panchayat shall also have power, subject to<lb/> such restrictions and control as may be prescribed, to regulate the<lb/> use of any other poramboke which is at the disposal of the<lb/> Government, if the village panchayat is authorised in that behalf by<lb/> an order of the Government. (5) The village panchayat may, subject<lb/> to such restrictions and control as may be prescribed, plant trees on<lb/> any poramboke, the use of which is regulated by it under<lb/> subsection (2) or sub-section (4). &apos;&apos;<lb/></item>

			<item>9.Government have issued orders in G.O(Ms)No.503, Revenue (Ni.Mu.<lb/></item>

			<p>4-1) Department, dated 21.9.99, empowering the District Collectors to transfer<lb/> Government poromboke lands to the Government departments when requested<lb/> and the same reads as follows:-<lb/></p>

			<p>10.The Superintendent of Police, Virudhunagar District, has submitted an<lb/> application requesting transfer of land for construction of a police station and<lb/> sought for appropriate orders. The application and covering letter read as<lb/> follows:-<lb/></p>

			<p>11.Extract from the resolution book of the village panchayat shows that<lb/> the Council has passed a resolution No.203 on 03.10.2007 permitting<lb/> construction of police station in S.No.50/2.<lb/></p>

			<p>12.Spot inspection has been done on 14.02.2008 and the report of the<lb/> Tahsildar, Rajapalayam Taluk reads as follows:-<lb/></p>

			<p>13.Thereafter, the Tahsildar, Rajapalayam Taluk, in his letter<lb/> Roc.No.B5/4815/2007 dated 15.02.2008 has sent the particulars to the District<lb/> Revenue Officer, Virudhunagar District:-<lb/></p>

			<p>14.Letter of the Revenue Divisional Officer, Sivagangai, addressed to the<lb/> District Revenue Officer, Virudhunagar District, reads as follows:-<lb/>23<lb/> 24<lb/></p>

			<p>15.Copy of the District Gazette both in Tamil and English have been<lb/> published excepting 0.05 H of land.<lb/></p>

			<p>16.Vide letter dated 24.04.2011, the Director of Agriculture Department<lb/> has given consent for conversion of land and it is extracted hereunder:-<lb/></p>

			<p>17.Thereafter, the District Collector, Virudhunagar District, has sent a<lb/> letter dated 15.06.2011 to the Principal Secretary and Commissioner for<lb/> Municipal Administration, Chennai and it reads as follows:-<lb/></p>

			<item>18.Letter dated 26.07.2011 of the Principal Secretary and Commissioner of<lb/> Land Administration, Chennai, to the Principal Secretary to the Government,<lb/> Revenue Department, Chennai, reads thus.<lb/></item>

			<p>19.Finally orders have been passed by the District Collector,<lb/> Virudhunagar District, in 2013, which reads as follows:-<lb/></p>

			<p>20.From the extract from the typed set of papers dated 31.03.2016, it is<lb/> evident that the District Collector, Virudhunagar District, has followed the<lb/> procedure and transfer of land has been gazetted in Virudhunagar District<lb/> Gazette. Though the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there was<lb/> no proper consultation with Thalavaipuram Village Panchayat Council, copy of<lb/> the Resolution Book of Thalavaipuram Village Panchayat Council, enclosed in<lb/> the typedset of papers, filed by the respondents, shows that Thalavaipuram<lb/> Village Panchayat Council has passed a resolution on 03.10.2007, in Resolution<lb/> No.203, agreeing for transfer of lands, for the purpose of construction of a police<lb/> station.<lb/></p>

			<p>21.Thalavaipuram Village Panchayat Council has passed a resolution way<lb/> back in 2007 and transfer of land has been effected by following the procedure.<lb/> Therefore, it is too late in the day, to make any objection, for construction of a<lb/> police station, by the present ward members. Moreover, thrashing field<lb/> measures 0.41.0 hectares in S.No.50/2. The extent of land allotted to the police,<lb/> for construction of a police station in the abovesaid S.No.50/2, is only 0.05.0<lb/> hectares, which is marginal. Contention of the petitioner that police station can<lb/> be constructed in some other place, cannot be accepted, as it is not for the<lb/> petitioner to say. It is for the District Administration and Police Department to<lb/> decide.<lb/></p>

			<p>22.Going through the documents extracted supra, we are of the view that<lb/> there is no procedural impropriety. Public purpose is per se evident. The<lb/> decision taken by the district administration would not affect the livelihood of<lb/> the villagers as contended.<lb/></p>

			<p>23.Writ of mandamus cannot be issued merely because a person is praying<lb/> for. One must first establish a right and then he must seek for the prayer to<lb/> enforce the said right. If there is failure of duty by the authorities or inaction,<lb/> one can approach the Court for a mandamus.<lb/></p>

			<p>24.Though the petitioner has contended that the entire villagers would be<lb/> affected, by taking away a portion of the land, used by them, as thrashing field<lb/> and to conduct functions and festivals, having regard to the steps taken by the<lb/> departments right from the year 2007, which has culminated to an order in the<lb/> year 2013, this Court is not inclined to issue any mandamus as prayed for.<lb/> In the result, the writ petition is dismissed. No costs. Consequently,<lb/> W.M.P(MD)No.5231 of 2016 is closed.<lb/></p>
