			CORAM:
			<lb />
			HON&apos;BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K.GAUBA
			<lb />
			ORDER (ORAL)
			<lb />
		</head>

		<p>
			1.
			<lb />
			The second respondent was married to Jai Inder singh, son of
			<lb />
			the petitioner, as per Hindu rites and ceremonies on 02.10.2006. Out
			<lb />
			of their cohabitation, a female child named Pearl was born on
			<lb />
			12.10.2007. On 12.11.2014, the second respondent lodged first
			<lb />
			information report (FIR) no.547/2014 with police station Palam
			<lb />
			Village, South West Delhi, alleging offences punishable under
			<lb />
			Sections 498A, 406, 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) against her
			<lb />
			husband and his father (the petitioner). On conclusion of the
			<lb />
			investigation, police filed report (charge sheet) under Section 173 of
			<lb />
			the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr. PC) on which cognizance
			<lb />
			was taken, the said matter being pending on the file of the
			<lb />
			Metropolitan Magistrate.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			It is stated that the Metropolitan Magistrate discharged Jai Inder
			<lb />
			Singh (husband), the case surviving against the petitioner for offence
			<lb />
			under Section 498-A IPC alone. The second respondent and Jai Inder
			<lb />
			Singh entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on
			<lb />
			30.01.2018 by which they agreed to amicably resolve their disputes,
			<lb />
			and to approach as per the timelines indicated, the appropriate forum
			<lb />
			for obtaining a decree of divorce, they also having agreed inter alia
			<lb />
			for the criminal case arising out of the aforementioned FIR to be
			<lb />
			sought to be quashed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			The petition, thus, has been moved before this court invoking
			<lb />
			Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 seeking
			<lb />
			quashing of FIR no.547/2014 under Sections 406, 498A, 34 IPC of
			<lb />
			Police Station Palam Village, South West, Delhi.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			The second respondent on being served with the notice has
			<lb />
			appeared and, pursuant to the directions, has sworn a detailed affidavit
			<lb />
			on 16.08.2018 which has come on record on 15.11.2018. Through the
			<lb />
			said affidavit, and in person, she has confirmed that she has settled all
			<lb />
			the disputes with the petitioner in terms of the above-mentioned MoU,
			<lb />
			out of her own free will and volition, without any pressure or coercion.
			<lb />
			At the hearing, both sides confirmed that they have already moved the
			<lb />
			Family Court by two separate petitions, one after the other, on the
			<lb />
			basis of which their marriage has been dissolved by a decree of
			<lb />
			divorce by mutual consent granted on 18.05.2018 in HMA 1015/2018
			<lb />
			by the Family Court for South-West District. As per the MoU, the
			<lb />
			custody of the child is to remain with the second respondent (mother),
			<lb />
			the father to have visitation rights, the second respondent to receive
			<lb />
			from Jai Inder Singh, a total amount of Rs.35 Lakhs towards all her
			<lb />
			claims. It is confirmed by the second respondent that she has already
			<lb />
			received Rs.30 Lakhs in the form of two equal instalments at the time
			<lb />
			of hearing on the first motion and the second motion petitions for
			<lb />
			divorce by mutual consent. At the hearing, Jai Inder Singh, son of the
			<lb />
			petitioner, has handed over to the second respondent a demand draft
			<lb />
			bearing no.067584 dated 05.03.2019, drawn on Axis Bank Ltd., for
			<lb />
			the balance sum of Rs.5,00,000/-(Rupees Five lakhs) which she has
			<lb />
			received against proper acknowledgement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			Pertinent to note here that offence under Section 498A IPC is
			<lb />
			not compoundable. The parties are constrained to move this court for
			<lb />
			quashing on the basis of amicable resolution arrived at by them in the
			<lb />
			facts and circumstances noted above.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			The scope and ambit of the power conferred on this court by
			<lb />
			Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr. PC) read
			<lb />
			with Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, in the particular
			<lb />
			context of prayer for quashing criminal proceedings, was examined by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court in B.S. Joshi and Ors. Vs. State of Haryana and
			<lb />
			Anr., (2003) 4 SCC 675, against the backdrop of a catena of earlier
			<lb />
			decisions. Noting, with reference to the decision in State of
			<lb />
			Karnakata Vs. L Muniswamy, (1977) 2 SCC 699, that in exercise of
			<lb />
			this &quot;inherent&quot; and &quot;wholesome power&quot;, the touchstone is as to
			<lb />
			whether &quot;the ends of justice so require&quot;, and it was observed thus :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;10. ... that in a criminal case, the veiled object
			<lb />
			behind a lame prosecution, the very nature of the
			<lb />
			material on which the structure of the prosecution
			<lb />
			rests and the like would justify the High Court in
			<lb />
			quashing the proceeding in the interest of justice and
			<lb />
			that the ends of justice are higher than the ends of
			<lb />
			mere law though justice had got to be administered
			<lb />
			according to laws made by the legislature. ...that the
			<lb />
			compelling necessity for making these observations is
			<lb />
			that without a proper realization of the object and
			<lb />
			purpose of the provision which seeks to save the
			<lb />
			inherent powers of the High Court to do justice
			<lb />
			between the State and its subjects, it would be
			<lb />
			impossible to appreciate the width and contours of
			<lb />
			that salient jurisdiction.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			7.
			<lb />
			The Supreme Court in B.S. Joshi (supra) further noted as
			<lb />
			under :-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;What would happen to the trial of the case where
			<lb />
			the wife does not support the imputations made in
			<lb />
			the FIR of the type in question. As earlier noticed,
			<lb />
			now she has filed an affidavit that the FIR was
			<lb />
			registered at her instance due to temperamental
			<lb />
			differences and implied imputations. There may be
			<lb />
			many reasons for not supporting the imputations.
			<lb />
			It may be either for the reason that she has
			<lb />
			resolved disputes with her husband and his other
			<lb />
			family members and as a result thereof she has
			<lb />
			again started living with her husband with whom
			<lb />
			she earlier had differences or she has willingly
			<lb />
			parted company and is living happily on her own
			<lb />
			or has married someone else on the earlier
			<lb />
			marriage having been dissolved by divorce on
			<lb />
			consent of parties or fails to support the
			<lb />
			prosecution on some other similar grounds. In
			<lb />
			such eventuality, there would almost be no chance
			<lb />
			of conviction. Would it then be proper to decline to
			<lb />
			exercise power of quashing on the ground that it
			<lb />
			would be permitting the parties to compound non-
			<lb />
			compoundable offences? The answer clearly has to
			<lb />
			be in the &quot;negative&quot;. It would, however, be a
			<lb />
			different matter if the High Court on facts declines
			<lb />
			the prayer for quashing for any valid reasons
			<lb />
			including lack of bona fides.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			Holding that &quot;special features in ...matrimonial matters are
			<lb />
			evident&quot; and that it is &quot;the duty of the court to encourage genuine
			<lb />
			settlements of matrimonial disputes&quot;, referring to Madhavrao
			<lb />
			Jiwajirao Scindia Vs. Sambhajirao Chandrojiroo Angre, (1988) 1
			<lb />
			SCC 692, it was further observed that :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;11. ... Where, in the opinion of the court, chances
			<lb />
			of an ultimate conviction are bleak and, therefore,
			<lb />
			no useful purpose is likely to be served by allowing
			<lb />
			a criminal prosecution to continue, the court may,
			<lb />
			while taking into consideration the special facts of
			<lb />
			a case, also quash the proceedings.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			9.
			<lb />
			In Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab and Anr. (2012) 10 SCC 303,
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court contrasted the request for quashing of criminal
			<lb />
			proceedings on the basis of settlement with the possibility of
			<lb />
			compounding of an offence and observed thus :-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;57. Quashing of offence or criminal proceedings
			<lb />
			on the ground of settlement between an offender
			<lb />
			and victim is not the same thing as compounding of
			<lb />
			offence. They are different and not interchangeable.
			<lb />
			Strictly speaking, the power of compounding of
			<lb />
			offences given to a court under Section 320 is
			<lb />
			materially different from the quashing of criminal
			<lb />
			proceedings by the High Court in exercise of its
			<lb />
			inherent jurisdiction. In compounding of offences,
			<lb />
			power of a criminal court is circumscribed by the
			<lb />
			provisions contained in Section 320 and the court is
			<lb />
			guided solely and squarely thereby while, on the
			<lb />
			other hand, the formation of opinion by the High
			<lb />
			Court for quashing a criminal offence or criminal
			<lb />
			proceeding or criminal complaint is guided by the
			<lb />
			material on record as to whether the ends of justice
			<lb />
			would justify such exercise of power although the
			<lb />
			ultimate consequence may be acquittal or dismissal
			<lb />
			of indictment.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			10. The above views in the context of matrimonial disputes
			<lb />
			resulting in criminal proceedings have been consistently followed over
			<lb />
			the years, as may be further illustrated by the decision of a bench of
			<lb />
			three Hon&apos;ble Judges of the Supreme Court in Jitendra Raghuvanshi
			<lb />
			and Ors. Vs. Babita Raghuvanshi and Anr., (2013) 4 SCC 58, the
			<lb />
			following observations summarising the philosophy succinctly :-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;15. In our view, it is the duty of the courts to
			<lb />
			encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial
			<lb />
			disputes, particularly, when the same are on
			<lb />
			considerable increase. Even if the offences are non-
			<lb />
			compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes
			<lb />
			and the Court is satisfied that the parties have settled
			<lb />
			the same amicably and without any pressure, we hold
			<lb />
			that for the purpose of securing ends of justice,
			<lb />
			Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar to the
			<lb />
			exercise of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or
			<lb />
			the subsequent criminal proceedings.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			16. There has been an outburst of matrimonial
			<lb />
			disputes in recent times. The institution of marriage
			<lb />
			occupies an important place and it has an important
			<lb />
			role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort
			<lb />
			should be made in the interest of the individuals in
			<lb />
			order to enable them to settle down in life and live
			<lb />
			peacefully. If the parties ponder over their defaults
			<lb />
			and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual
			<lb />
			agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law,
			<lb />
			in order to do complete justice in the matrimonial
			<lb />
			matters, the courts should be less hesitant in
			<lb />
			exercising their extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite
			<lb />
			to state that the power under Section 482 should be
			<lb />
			exercised sparingly and with circumspection only
			<lb />
			when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material
			<lb />
			on record, that allowing the proceedings to continue
			<lb />
			would be an abuse of process of court or that the ends
			<lb />
			of justice require that the proceedings ought to be
			<lb />
			quashed...&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			11. In a case where criminal proceedings arise essentially out of
			<lb />
			matrimonial dispute and the parties have decided to bury the hatchet,
			<lb />
			the court must examine if there is any likelihood of the criminal
			<lb />
			prosecution resulting in conviction. In fact-situation wherein the
			<lb />
			matrimonial relation has been brought to an end by mutual consent
			<lb />
			and the parties are eager to move on with their respective lives seeking
			<lb />
			closure and if there is nothing to indicate lack of bonafide on the part
			<lb />
			of any side, denial of the prayer for quashing the criminal case would
			<lb />
			restore acrimony rather than bring about peace. Allowing continuance
			<lb />
			of the criminal action would be fruitless and clearly an abuse of
			<lb />
			judicial process.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			12. The case at hand passes the muster of the above-noted tests.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			13. In the above facts and circumstances, the petition is allowed.
			<lb />
			The crime registered by the police vide FIR 547/2014 under Sections
			<lb />
			406, 498A, 34 IPC of Police Station Palam Village, South West Delhi,
			<lb />
			and the proceedings emanating therefrom are hereby quashed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			14. The petition is disposed of accordingly.
			<lb />
			Dasti to both sides.
			<lb />
