			1
			<lb />
			This appeal raises significant issues of public importance, engaging as it
			<lb />
			does, the interface between citizens and their businesses with the fiscal
			<lb />
			administration. Legislation enacted for the levy of goods and services tax confers
			<lb />
			a power on the taxation authorities to impose a provisional attachment on the
			<lb />
			properties of the assessee, including bank accounts. The legislation in Himachal
			<lb />
			Pradesh, which comes up for interpretation in the present case, has conferred the
			<lb />
			power on the Commissioner to order provisional attachment of the property of the
			<lb />
			assessee, subject to the formation of an opinion that such attachment is
			<lb />
			necessary in the interest of protecting the government revenue. What specifically,
			<lb />
			is the ambit of this power? What are the safeguards available to the citizen? In
			<lb />
			interpreting the law, the court has to chart a course which will ensure a fair
			<lb />
			exercise of statutory powers. The legitimate concerns of citizens over arbitrary
			<lb />
			exercises of power have to be protected while ensuring that the legislative
			<lb />
			purpose in entrusting the authority to order a provisional attachment is fulfilled.
			<lb />
			The rule of law in a constitutional framework is fulfilled when law is substantively
			<lb />
			fair, procedurally fair and applied in a fair manner. Each of these three
			<lb />
			components will need to be addressed in the course of interpreting the tax statute
			<lb />
			in the present case.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>

			<lb />
			This appeal arises from a judgment and order dated 1 January 2021 of a
			<lb />
			Division Bench of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh. The High Court dismissed
			<lb />
			the writ petition instituted under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging orders
			<lb />
			of provisional attachment on the ground that an alternate remedy is available.
			<lb />
			The appellant challenged the orders issued on 28 October 2020 by the Joint
			<lb />
			Commissioner of State Taxes and Excise, Parwanoo 1 provisionally attaching the
			<lb />
			appellant&apos;s receivables from its customers. The provisional attachment was
			<lb />
			ordered while invoking Section 83 of the Himachal Pradesh Goods and Service
			<lb />
			Tax Act, 2017 2 and Rule 159 of Himachal Pradesh Goods and Service Tax
			<lb />
			Rules, 2017 3 . While dismissing the writ petition on grounds of maintainability the
			<lb />
			High Court was of the view that the appellant had an &apos;alternative and efficacious
			<lb />
			remedy&apos; of an appeal under Section 107 of the HPGST Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3
			<lb />
			At issue in this case is whether the orders of provisional attachment
			<lb />
			issued by the third respondent against the appellant on 28 October 2020 are
			<lb />
			in consonance with the conditions stipulated in Section 83 of the HPGST Act. The
			<lb />
			answer to this will require the court to embark on an interpretative journey of
			<lb />
			unravelling the substantive and procedural content of the power. The preliminary
			<lb />
			issue is whether the High Court was right in concluding that the provisional
			<lb />
			attachment could not be challenged in a petition under Article 226.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>

			<lb />
			The facts in the context of which this case arises are thus: the appellant
			<lb />
			manufactures lead according to the specific requirements of its clients, and has a
			<lb />
			factory at village Meerpur Gurudwara, Kala-Amb in the District of Sirmaur of
			<lb />
			Himachal Pradesh. The appellant has been in the same line of business since
			<lb />
			2008. Upon the introduction of the Goods and Services tax 4 , the appellant
			<lb />
			migrated to and was registered under GST -GSTIN No. O2AAKFR7402H2ZE -
			<lb />
			with effect from 1 July 2017.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			5
			<lb />
			On 3 October 2018, a notice 5 was issued to the appellant under Section
			<lb />
			74 of the HPGST Act and the Central Goods and Services Tax Act 6 by the third
			<lb />
			respondent requiring it to appear on 9 October 2018 and produce (i) invoices
			<lb />
			pertaining to inward and outward supplies for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19; (ii)
			<lb />
			party-wise summary/ledger of inward supplies; (iii) proof of payment of GST with
			<lb />
			a commodity-wise breakup; and (iv) copies of GSTR-1, GSTR-2 and GSTR-3
			<lb />
			returns from July 2017 to July 2018. The appellant appeared before the third
			<lb />
			respondent and submitted original tax invoices pertaining to inward and outward
			<lb />
			supplies for 2017-18 and 2018-19 by a letter dated 15 October 2018.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6
			<lb />
			On 10 October 2018, a &apos;detection case&apos; was registered against GM
			<lb />
			Powertech, Kala-Amb 7 , one of the suppliers of the appellant, under Section 74 of
			<lb />
			the HPGST Act and the CGST Act read with Section 20 of the Integrated Goods
			<lb />
			and Services Tax Act, 2017 8 . This was through a search and seizure under
			<lb />
			Section 67 of the HPGST Act and CGST Act. The partners of GM Powertech
			<lb />
			were arrested on 3 December 2018 on the ground of raising fraudulent claims of
			<lb />
			input tax credit 9 from fake/fictitious firms in Delhi and Kanpur.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7
			<lb />
			The appellant received a memo by an e-mail dated 15 December 2018
			<lb />
			from the third respondent directing it to be present on 17 December 2018 for
			<lb />
			explaining the allegedly illegal claim of ITC made during 2017-18 and 2018-19.
			<lb />
			By its letter dated 17 December 2018, the appellant contended that it had validly
			<lb />
			claimed ITC as it fulfilled the conditions under Section 16 and other provisions of
			<lb />
			the HPGST Act and the CGST Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			8
			<lb />
			On 9 January 2019, a notice 10 was issued to Fujikawa Power, Bagbania,
			<lb />
			BBN Baddi, one of the customers of the appellant, for provisionally attaching an
			<lb />
			amount of Rs. 5 crores due to the appellant, under Section 83 of the HPGST Act.
			<lb />
			On 19 January 2019, the third respondent passed an order of provisional
			<lb />
			attachment in respect of receivables worth Rs. 5 crores due from Fujikawa
			<lb />
			Power. This order inadvertently referred to Sarika Industries instead of the
			<lb />
			appellant. The appellant responded by a representation dated 29 January 2019,
			<lb />
			claiming inter alia, that the order of attachment was without affording a hearing.
			<lb />
			The appellant also claimed that on 26 December 2018, they had noticed that the
			<lb />
			ITC had been blocked without prior notice. On 30 January 2019, the notice of
			<lb />
			attachment was withdrawn by the third respondent.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			9
			<lb />
			According to the respondents, after the case of GM Powertech was
			<lb />
			investigated, tax evasion was detected. GM Powertech was found to have
			<lb />
			claimed and utilized ITC against invoices issued by &quot;fake fictitious firms without
			<lb />
			actual movement of goods…&quot; GM Powertech had issued invoices to various
			<lb />
			recipients in Himachal Pradesh including the appellant. On 4 July 2020, the third
			<lb />
			respondent issued an intimation to the appellant under Section 74(5) of the
			<lb />
			HPGST Act of tax ascertained as being payable 11 , advising it to pay tax, interest
			<lb />
			and penalty of Rs. 5.03 crores. The appellant was given an opportunity to file its
			<lb />
			submissions against the ascertainment of the amount by 4 August 2020.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			10
			<lb />
			A tax liability of Rs 39.48 crores was confirmed against GM Powertech on
			<lb />
			the conclusion of the proceedings against it. GM Powertech was found to have
			<lb />
			no business establishment or property in Himachal Pradesh and the case was
			<lb />
			considered to fall into the category of a serious tax fraud.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			11
			<lb />
			On 21 October 2020, the Commissioner of State Taxes and Excise,
			<lb />
			Himachal Pradesh 12 delegated his powers under Section 83 of the HPGST Act to
			<lb />
			the third respondent. In exercise of the powers delegated by the Commissioner,
			<lb />
			the third respondent issued two orders of provisional attachment 13 dated 28
			<lb />
			October 2020 attaching the receivables of the appellant from its customers,
			<lb />
			Fujikawa Power and M/s Deepak International. The attachment order issued to
			<lb />
			Fujikawa Power under Rule 159(1) of the HPGST Rules noted that it owed about
			<lb />
			Rs. 4 crores to the appellant. The order states that the appellant was found to be
			<lb />
			involved in an ITC fraud amounting to Rs.5,03,82,554/-(Rs. 5.03 crores) during
			<lb />
			2017-18 and 2018-19. The order, in its relevant part, provides:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;In order to protect the interests of revenue and in exercise of the
			<lb />
			powers conferred/delegated by Commissioner of the State Taxes
			<lb />
			&amp; Excise, HP vide office order No.12-4/78-EXN-Tax-Part-
			<lb />
			278/22(a)-26780-82 dated 21.10.2020 under section 83 of the
			<lb />
			Act, I, U.S. Rana, Joint Commissioner of State Taxes &amp; Excise,
			<lb />
			South Enforcement Zone, Parwanoo, hereby provisionally attach
			<lb />
			the payment to the extent of Rs.5,03,82,554/-of M/s Radha
			<lb />
			Krishan Industries, Kala-Amb. Henceforth, no payment shall be
			<lb />
			allowed to be made from your company to M/s RadhaKrishan
			<lb />
			Industries without the prior permission of this department / office.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			A similar order was issued to Deepak International, noting that a payment of Rs.
			<lb />
			2.91 crores was owed by it to the appellant.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			12
			<lb />
			On 4 November 2020, the appellant filed a representation and objections
			<lb />
			against the attachment and denied liability. By an order dated 6 November 2020,
			<lb />
			the third respondent rejected the objections of the appellant. The third respondent
			<lb />
			stated that collectively payments &quot;only&quot; worth Rs. 4.92 crores from both of the
			<lb />
			appellant&apos;s customers were attached.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			13
			<lb />
			On 27 November 2020, the third respondent issued a notice to show cause
			<lb />
			to the appellant under Section 74(1) of the HPGST Act for recovering the ITC,
			<lb />
			interest and penalty. The notice was issued on the basis that the appellant had
			<lb />
			claimed ITC on the supplies received from GM Powertech and since the inward
			<lb />
			supplies made by GM Powertech were found to be fake, the appellant&apos;s claim of
			<lb />
			ITC was also in question.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			14
			<lb />
			The orders of provisional attachment and the order passed by the
			<lb />
			Commissioner on 21 October 2020 delegating his powers under Section 83 of the
			<lb />
			HPGST Act to the third respondent, were challenged by the appellant before the
			<lb />
			High Court in a writ petition 14 under Article 226.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15
			<lb />
			While dismissing the writ petition, the High Court held that it was
			<lb />
			undisputed that the third respondent and the Divisional Commissioner, who has
			<lb />
			been appointed as Commissioner (Appeals) under the GST Act, are constituted
			<lb />
			under the HPGST Act, and therefore, it is assumed that there is no illegal or
			<lb />
			irregular exercise of jurisdiction. The High Court further observed that even if
			<lb />
			there is some defect in the procedure followed during the hearing of the case, it
			<lb />
			does not follow that the authority acted without jurisdiction, and though the order
			<lb />
			may be irregular or defective, it cannot be a nullity so long it has been passed by
			<lb />
			the competent authority.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16
			<lb />
			The High Court held that a writ is ordinarily not maintainable when there
			<lb />
			exists an alternative remedy. The exceptions to this rule are where the statutory
			<lb />
			authority has not acted in accordance with the provisions of the legislation; or
			<lb />
			acted in defiance of the fundamental principles of judicial procedure or where an
			<lb />
			order has been passed in violation of the principles of natural justice. The High
			<lb />
			Court held that it would not entertain a petition under Article 226 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution, if an efficacious remedy is available to the aggrieved person or
			<lb />
			where the statute under which the action complained of has been taken contains
			<lb />
			a mechanism for redressal of grievances. The High Court held that when a
			<lb />
			statutory forum of appeal exists, an appeal should &quot;not be entertained ignoring
			<lb />
			the statutory dispensation&quot;.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			17
			<lb />
			Noting that the appellant has an alternative and efficacious remedy of
			<lb />
			appeal under Section 107 of the HPGST Act, the High Court refused to entertain
			<lb />
			the writ petition. The High Court held that it was fortified in this view by the fact
			<lb />
			that the writ petition filed by GM Powertech, has also not been entertained and
			<lb />
			that it has been relegated to avail of the alternative remedy.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18
			<lb />
			Subsequent to the dismissal of the writ petition by the High Court, certain
			<lb />
			developments have taken place. On 12 January 2021, the appellant sought to
			<lb />
			inspect the files for GM Powertech and stated that no documents in this regard
			<lb />
			had been provided to it in context of the proceedings initiated under Section 74.
			<lb />
			In response, the third respondent allowed the appellant to inspect the contents of
			<lb />
			the appellant&apos;s case file. According to the respondent, the appellant failed to
			<lb />
			exercise this option and did not reply to the show cause notice dated 27
			<lb />
			November 2020. Thereafter, on 18 February 2021, an order under Section 74(9)
			<lb />
			of the HPGST Act was passed by the third respondent confirming a tax demand
			<lb />
			of Rs. 8,30,27,218. This order under Section 74(9) has been assailed by the
			<lb />
			appellant before the appellate authority under Section 107. The dismissal of the
			<lb />
			petition challenging the orders of provisional attachment is in question in the
			<lb />
			present proceedings.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			B
			<lb />
			Submissions
			<lb />
			19
			<lb />
			Mr Puneet Bali, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
			<lb />
			appellant addressed the following submissions:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			B.1 Maintainability of the writ petition before the High Court:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			No efficacious alternative remedy is available against the orders of
			<lb />
			provisional attachment passed under Section 83 of the HPGST Act. The
			<lb />
			jurisdiction to pass an order under Section 83 is conferred on the
			<lb />
			Commissioner of State Taxes. Although the power stands delegated to the
			<lb />
			third respondent, the order is still deemed to be passed by the
			<lb />
			Commissioner (second respondent). Under the GST Act, an appeal
			<lb />
			against the order of the Commissioner lies before the GST Appellate
			<lb />
			Tribunal which has not been constituted till date. Thus, the only remedy
			<lb />
			available to the appellant was by filing a writ petition;
			<lb />
			<item>
		</item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Reliance was placed on Whirlpool Corporation v Registrar of
			<lb />
			Trademarks, Mumbai 15 to argue that an alternative remedy is not a bar to
			<lb />
			the exercise of the writ jurisdiction of the High Court if the writ petition is
			<lb />
			filed for enforcement of fundamental rights; where there has been a
			<lb />
			violation of the principles of natural justice; where the order or the
			<lb />
			proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction; or when the vires of an Act is
			<lb />
			challenged;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii)
			<lb />
			The third respondent had withdrawn the earlier orders of provisional
			<lb />
			attachment issued in January 2019 after considering the representation
			<lb />
			filed by the appellant. The impugned orders of provisional attachment were
			<lb />
			issued on 28 October 2020, on the same set of facts and allegations. Thus,
			<lb />
			the impugned orders of provisional attachment amount to a review of the
			<lb />
			earlier orders by the same respondent, which is contrary to the HPGST
			<lb />
			Act, as it does not provide for powers of review;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) The impugned orders of provisional attachment are in violation of the
			<lb />
			procedure established under sub-rule (5) of Rule 159 of HPGST Rules,
			<lb />
			which provides that an opportunity of being heard is to be given against the
			<lb />
			provisional attachment as a mandatory requirement. In this case, the
			<lb />
			appellant filed objections to the orders of provisional attachment on 4
			<lb />
			November 2020 and the objections were rejected by the third respondent
			<lb />
			on 6 November 2020, without providing an opportunity of being heard to
			<lb />
			the appellant;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v)
			<lb />
			The reliance placed by the High Court on the judgment in the case of GM
			<lb />
			Powertech and others v State of H.P 16 to state that a similar petition was
			<lb />
			not entertained is misplaced. In that case, GM Powertech had challenged
			<lb />
			the order of assessment in the writ petition, while the appellant has
			<lb />
			challenged the orders of provisional attachment made prior to the
			<lb />
			assessment. Additionally, the case of GM Powertech did not fall within the
			<lb />
			exceptions to the rule of alternate remedy;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi) The High Courts should not have dismissed the writ petition on grounds of
			<lb />
			maintainability if the facts of the case are not disputed by the State as held
			<lb />
			in Rajasthan State Electricity Board v Union of India 17 ; and
			<lb />
			(vii) Reliance was placed on Calcutta Discount Co. Ltd. v Income Tax
			<lb />
			Officer, Companies District I, Calcutta 18 and Commissioner of Income
			<lb />
			Tax, Gujarat v M/s A Raman and Co. 19 to argue that the High Court can
			<lb />
			exercise its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue an order
			<lb />
			prohibiting the tax officer from proceedings to assess the liability, if the
			<lb />
			conditions precedent to the exercise of such jurisdiction have not been
			<lb />
			met.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			B.2 Challenge on merits: improper invocation of Section 83
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The power of provisional attachment under Section 83 of the HPGST Act is
			<lb />
			a drastic power and must be exercised with extreme care and caution;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			The power under Section 83 of the HPGST Act cannot be exercised unless
			<lb />
			there is sufficient material on record to justify that the assessee is about to
			<lb />
			dispose of the whole or part of its property to thwart the ultimate collection
			<lb />
			of tax;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii)
			<lb />
			The existence of relevant material is a pre-condition to the formation of an
			<lb />
			opinion by the Commissioner;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv)
			<lb />
			The third respondent failed to show any material on record to indicate that
			<lb />
			the appellant is a &quot;fly by night operator&quot; or is disposing off assets to defeat
			<lb />
			the collection of tax;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v)
			<lb />
			The stated reason for provisional attachment -the initiation of proceedings
			<lb />
			and passing of an order under Section 74 against the appellant&apos;s supplier,
			<lb />
			GM Powertech -is insufficient to invoke the powers of provisional
			<lb />
			attachment against the appellant;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi)
			<lb />
			The third respondent has failed to show that there is a threat to the
			<lb />
			interests of the revenue on account of the appellant&apos;s alleged involvement
			<lb />
			in the said ITC fraud of GM Powertech;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vii) The appellant has paid an output tax of Rs. 12,49,90,267.14 (Rs. 12.49
			<lb />
			crores) for the relevant period, which is more than the ITC of Rs. 3.25
			<lb />
			crores which the appellant has allegedly taken fraudulently;
			<lb />
			(viii) Even if the revenue has to attach the properties of the assessee,
			<lb />
			immovable properties must be attached. Attachment of bank accounts and
			<lb />
			trading assets should be a last resort only as it paralyses the business of
			<lb />
			the assessee;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ix)
			<lb />
			The pendency of proceedings under Sections 62, 63, 64, 67, 73 or 74, of
			<lb />
			the HPGST Act, is a pre-condition for invoking the provisions of Section 83
			<lb />
			of the HPGST Act;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(x)
			<lb />
			The provisional attachment of the appellant&apos;s assets was made on 28
			<lb />
			October 2020, before the proceedings were initiated against the appellant
			<lb />
			under Section 74 of the HPGST Act on 27 November 2020. Thus, the
			<lb />
			provisional attachment was made without jurisdiction and in violation of
			<lb />
			Section 83;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xi)
			<lb />
			The provisions of Section 83 of the HPGST Act do not provide for making
			<lb />
			provisional attachment a second time, once the first attachment is
			<lb />
			withdrawn. Moreover, the HPGST Act, does not provide the third
			<lb />
			respondent the power of review to review his earlier decision regarding
			<lb />
			provisional attachment;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xii) The first provisional attachment against the appellant was &quot;withdrawn
			<lb />
			completely with immediate effect&quot; in January 2019 and the same had
			<lb />
			gained finality. Thus, the impugned orders of provisional attachment for the
			<lb />
			second time, are without the authority of law and should be set aside;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xiii) Provisional attachment of 100% of the alleged amount is not permissible
			<lb />
			as per law;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xiv) While Section 83 of the HPGST Act does not provide for the percentage of
			<lb />
			alleged amount to be attached, the powers under this section must be
			<lb />
			guided by other provisions of the Act;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xv) Under Section 74 of the HPGST Act, once the tax demand becomes
			<lb />
			payable, an assessee can only challenge this demand in appeal after
			<lb />
			depositing 10% of the disputed amount and the remaining demand is
			<lb />
			stayed. In contrast, the provisional attachment of 100% of the alleged
			<lb />
			amount even before the finalisation of the tax demand is contrary to the
			<lb />
			legislative intent;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xvi) The third respondent has taken a contradictory stand with respect to
			<lb />
			collection of tax from the appellant. Even if it is admitted that the
			<lb />
			transaction between the appellant and GM Powertech was a fake
			<lb />
			transaction without actual movement of goods, it follows that the appellant
			<lb />
			cannot claim refund of ITC and nor would the appellant be liable to pay tax
			<lb />
			on outward supplies. However, the appellant has already paid Rs. 12.49
			<lb />
			crores of tax on outward supplies;
			<lb />
		</item>

			(xvii) The third respondent has raised a demand of Rs. 39 crores against GM
			<lb />
			Powertech for illegally availing ITC. Once the tax demand has been
			<lb />
			confirmed against GM Powertech, refusal to grant ITC to the appellant
			<lb />
			would amount to double collection of tax.

			<lb />
			Opposing these submissions, Mr Akshay Amritanshu, learned counsel
			<lb />
			appearing on behalf of the State of Himachal Pradesh, submitted that:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The SLP should be dismissed as the appellant has an alternate and
			<lb />
			efficacious remedy of an appeal under Section 107 of the HPGST Act.
			<lb />
			Moreover, the SLP has been rendered infructuous due to the order dated
			<lb />
			18 February 2021 under Section 74(9) of the HPGST Act and the
			<lb />
			consequent appeal filed by the appellant against this order before the
			<lb />
			appellate authority;
			<lb />
			(ii)
			<lb />
			In paragraph 4 of the impugned judgment, it has been noted that the
			<lb />
			appellant had admitted that it had an alternative remedy by way of an
			<lb />
			appeal under Section 107 of the HPGST Act;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii)
			<lb />
			The delegation of powers under Section 83 of the HPGST Act by the
			<lb />
			second respondent to the third respondent does not imply that there was
			<lb />
			an irregular or illegal exercise of jurisdiction by the second respondent;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv)
			<lb />
			The order under Section 74(9) against GM Powertech has not been
			<lb />
			challenged and has gained finality. Since it has been found that all
			<lb />
			purchases of GM Powertech were fraudulent, there could have been no
			<lb />
			outward sale to the appellant. Thus, the transaction between GM
			<lb />
			Powertech and appellant would also be fraudulent;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v)
			<lb />
			The orders of provisional attachment were issued after the proceedings
			<lb />
			against GM Powertech had concluded;
			<lb />
			(vi)
			<lb />
			GM Powertech had no property or business establishment in Himachal
			<lb />
			Pradesh. In order to avoid a similar situation against the appellant and to
			<lb />
			protect the interests of revenue, the impugned orders of provisional
			<lb />
			attachment were passed;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vii) The proceedings of provisional attachment under Section 83 of the HPGST
			<lb />
			Act had concluded after rejection of the objections filed by the appellant on
			<lb />
			6 November 2020. The appellant participated in these proceedings and did
			<lb />
			not challenge the orders of provisional attachment. Thus, the appellant is
			<lb />
			estopped from challenging the initiation of proceedings under Section 83 of
			<lb />
			the HPGST Act;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(viii) The impugned orders of provisional attachment were based on a fresh set
			<lb />
			of allegations, after the proceedings against GM Powertech had been
			<lb />
			concluded and it was found that GM Powertech had no business or
			<lb />
			properties in Himachal Pradesh;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ix)
			<lb />
			After the appellant filed objections to the orders of provisional attachment,
			<lb />
			it was in the discretion of the Commissioner whether or not to grant an
			<lb />
			opportunity of a hearing to the appellant;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(x)
			<lb />
			Merely because the appellant has paid Rs. 12 crores of tax, does not imply
			<lb />
			that the appellant did not engage in the ITC fraud;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xi)
			<lb />
			There was no violation of the principles of natural justice as an order of
			<lb />
			provisional attachment does not require a prior notice to be issued to the
			<lb />
			assessee;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xii) The necessary prerequisites for triggering Section 83 of the HPGST Act
			<lb />
			were complied with;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xiii) The appellant had not sought any prior stay on the orders of provisional
			<lb />
			attachment and thus, it is not conceivable that the business of the
			<lb />
			appellant has become paralyzed due to these orders;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xiv) The provisional attachment is not only for the purpose of recovery, but is
			<lb />
			intended to safeguard the interests of the revenue while the proceedings
			<lb />
			are pending; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(xv) The legislature did not provide any quantum or percentage for the purpose
			<lb />
			of provisional attachment under Section 83 of the Act. Thus, a comparison
			<lb />
			with other provisions of the HPGST Act, including Section 107, is incorrect.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			C
			<lb />
			Legal Position
			<lb />
			21
			<lb />
			The following issues arise in the present case:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Whether a writ petition challenging the orders of provisional attachment
			<lb />
			was maintainable under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High
			<lb />
			Court; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			If the answer to (i) is in the affirmative, whether the orders of provisional
			<lb />
			attachment constitute a valid exercise of power.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			22
			<lb />
			The appellant has advanced submissions on and adverted to the merits of
			<lb />
			the proceedings initiated under Section 74 of the HPGST Act. The order dated 18
			<lb />
			February 2021 under Section 74 (9) of the HPGST Act is not in challenge before
			<lb />
			this Court. An appeal against the order is pending before the appellate authority
			<lb />
			under Section 107 of the HPGST Act. We will not adjudicate upon the merits of
			<lb />
			the order under section 74(9). This judgment is confined to the two issues
			<lb />
			formulated above.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			23
			<lb />
			We shall now review the position of law on the questions before us.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			C.1 Maintainability of writ petition before the High Court
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			24
			<lb />
			The High Court has dealt with the maintainability of the petition under
			<lb />
			Article 226 of the Constitution. Relying on the decision of this Court in Assistant
			<lb />
			Commissioner (CT) LTU, Kakinada and others v Glaxo Smith Kline
			<lb />
			Consumer Health Care Limited 20 , the High Court noted that although it can
			<lb />
			entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, it must not do so when
			<lb />
			the aggrieved person has an effective alternate remedy available in law.
			<lb />
			However, certain exceptions to this &quot;rule of alternate remedy&quot; include where, the
			<lb />
			statutory authority has not acted in accordance with the provisions of the law or
			<lb />
			acted in defiance of the fundamental principles of judicial procedure; or has
			<lb />
			resorted to invoke provisions, which are repealed; or where an order has been
			<lb />
			passed in violation of the principles of natural justice. Applying this formulation,
			<lb />
			the High Court noted that the appellant has an alternate remedy available under
			<lb />
			the GST Act and thus, the petition was not maintainable.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			25
			<lb />
			In this background, it becomes necessary for this Court, to dwell on the
			<lb />
			&quot;rule of alternate remedy&quot; and its judicial exposition. In Whirlpool Corporation v
			<lb />
			Registrar of Trademarks, Mumbai 21 , a two judge Bench of this Court after
			<lb />
			reviewing the case law on this point, noted:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the
			<lb />
			Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other
			<lb />
			provision of the Constitution. This power can be exercised by the
			<lb />
			High Court not only for issuing writs in the nature of habeas
			<lb />
			corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari for
			<lb />
			the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights contained in
			<lb />
			Part III of the Constitution but also for &quot;any other purpose&quot;.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			15. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having
			<lb />
			regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not
			<lb />
			to entertain a writ petition. But the High Court has imposed upon
			<lb />
			itself certain restrictions one of which is that if an effective and
			<lb />
			efficacious remedy is available, the High Court would not
			<lb />
			normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy
			<lb />
			has been consistently held by this Court not to operate as a
			<lb />
			bar in at least three contingencies, namely, where the writ
			<lb />
			petition has been filed for the enforcement of any of the
			<lb />
			Fundamental Rights or where there has been a violation of
			<lb />
			the principle of natural justice or where the order or
			<lb />
			proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an
			<lb />
			Act is challenged. There is a plethora of case-law on this point
			<lb />
			but to cut down this circle of forensic whirlpool, we would rely on
			<lb />
			some old decisions of the evolutionary era of the constitutional
			<lb />
			law as they still hold the field.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			26
			<lb />
			Following the dictum of this Court in Whirlpool (supra), in Harbanslal
			<lb />
			Sahnia v Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. 22 , this court noted that
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;7. So far as the view taken by the High Court that the remedy by
			<lb />
			way of recourse to arbitration clause was available to the
			<lb />
			appellants and therefore the writ petition filed by the appellants
			<lb />
			was liable to be dismissed is concerned, suffice it to observe that
			<lb />
			the rule of exclusion of writ jurisdiction by availability of an
			<lb />
			alternative remedy is a rule of discretion and not one of
			<lb />
			compulsion. In an appropriate case, in spite of availability of
			<lb />
			the alternative remedy, the High Court may still exercise its
			<lb />
			writ jurisdiction in at least three contingencies: (i) where the
			<lb />
			writ petition seeks enforcement of any of the fundamental
			<lb />
			rights; (ii) where there is failure of principles of natural
			<lb />
			justice; or (iii) where the orders or proceedings are wholly
			<lb />
			without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged.
			<lb />
			(See Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade Marks [(1998) 8
			<lb />
			SCC 1] .) The present case attracts applicability of the first two
			<lb />
			contingencies. Moreover, as noted, the appellants&apos; dealership,
			<lb />
			which is their bread and butter, came to be terminated for an
			<lb />
			irrelevant and non-existent cause. In such circumstances, we feel
			<lb />
			that the appellants should have been allowed relief by the High
			<lb />
			Court itself instead of driving them to the need of initiating
			<lb />
			arbitration proceedings.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			27
			<lb />
			The principles of law which emerge are that :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The power under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue writs can be
			<lb />
			exercised not only for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but for any
			<lb />
			other purpose as well;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			The High Court has the discretion not to entertain a writ petition. One of
			<lb />
			the restrictions placed on the power of the High Court is where an effective
			<lb />
			alternate remedy is available to the aggrieved person;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii)
			<lb />
			Exceptions to the rule of alternate remedy arise where (a) the writ petition
			<lb />
			has been filed for the enforcement of a fundamental right protected by Part
			<lb />
			III of the Constitution; (b) there has been a violation of the principles of
			<lb />
			natural justice; (c) the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction;
			<lb />
			or (d) the vires of a legislation is challenged;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv)
			<lb />
			An alternate remedy by itself does not divest the High Court of its powers
			<lb />
			under Article 226 of the Constitution in an appropriate case though
			<lb />
			ordinarily, a writ petition should not be entertained when an efficacious
			<lb />
			alternate remedy is provided by law;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v)
			<lb />
			When a right is created by a statute, which itself prescribes the remedy or
			<lb />
			procedure for enforcing the right or liability, resort must be had to that
			<lb />
			particular statutory remedy before invoking the discretionary remedy under
			<lb />
			Article 226 of the Constitution. This rule of exhaustion of statutory
			<lb />
			remedies is a rule of policy, convenience and discretion; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi)
			<lb />
			In cases where there are disputed questions of fact, the High Court may
			<lb />
			decide to decline jurisdiction in a writ petition. However, if the High Court is
			<lb />
			objectively of the view that the nature of the controversy requires the
			<lb />
			exercise of its writ jurisdiction, such a view would not readily be interfered
			<lb />
			with.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			28
			<lb />
			These principles have been consistently upheld by this Court in Seth
			<lb />
			Chand Ratan v Pandit Durga Prasad 23 , Babubhai Muljibhai Patel v Nandlal
			<lb />
			Khodidas Barot 24 and Rajasthan SEB v. Union of India, 25 among other
			<lb />
			decisions.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			C.2 Provisional Attachment
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			29
			<lb />
			At this stage, we will advert to relevant precedents outlining the contours of
			<lb />
			the power of provisional attachment and specifically, in the context of provisions
			<lb />
			worded similarly to Section 83 of the HPGST Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			30
			<lb />
			The decision of this Court in Raman Tech Process Engg Co and Anr v
			<lb />
			Solanki Traders 26 was concerned with the power of a civil court under Order 38
			<lb />
			Rule 5 of the CPC to order an attachment before judgment. In that case,
			<lb />
			proceedings had been instituted by the respondent, for the recovery of moneys
			<lb />
			due for the supply of material to the appellant. The plaintiff moved an application
			<lb />
			under Order 38 Rule 5, for a direction to the defendants to furnish security for the
			<lb />
			suit claim and if they failed to do so, for attachment before judgment. This Court
			<lb />
			described the power of attachment before judgment in the following terms:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;5. The power under Order 38, Rule 5 Civil Procedure Code is a
			<lb />
			drastic and extraordinary power. Such power should not be
			<lb />
			exercised mechanically or merely for the asking. It should be
			<lb />
			used sparingly and strictly in accordance with the Rule. The
			<lb />
			purpose of Order 38, Rule 5 not to convert an unsecured debt
			<lb />
			into a secured debt. Any attempt by a plaintiff to utilize the
			<lb />
			provisions of Order 38 Rule 5 as a leverage for coercing the
			<lb />
			defendant to settle the suit claim should be discouraged.
			<lb />
			Instances are not wanting where bloated and doubtful claims are
			<lb />
			realized by unscrupulous plaintiffs, by obtaining orders of
			<lb />
			attachment before judgment and forcing the defendants for out of
			<lb />
			court settlements, under threat of attachment.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			6. A defendant is not debarred from dealing with his property
			<lb />
			merely because a suit is filed or about to be filed against him.
			<lb />
			Shifting of business from one premises to another premises or
			<lb />
			removal of machinery to another premises by itself is not a
			<lb />
			ground for granting attachment before judgment. A plaintiff
			<lb />
			should show, prima facie, that his claim is bona fide and valid and
			<lb />
			also satisfy the court that the defendant is about to remove or
			<lb />
			dispose of the whole or part of his property, with the intention of
			<lb />
			obstructing or delaying the execution of any decree that may be
			<lb />
			passed against him, before power is exercised under Order 38,
			<lb />
			Rule 5 CPC. Courts should also keep in view the principles
			<lb />
			relating to grant of attachment before judgment [internal citation
			<lb />
			omitted].&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			31
			<lb />
			A body of precedent has emerged in the High Courts on the exercise of the
			<lb />
			power under Section 83 of the CGST Act (akin to the State GST Act 27 ). The
			<lb />
			shared learning which emerges from these decisions of the High Court needs
			<lb />
			recognition. In Valerius Industries v Union of India 28 , the Gujarat High Court
			<lb />
			laid down the principles for the construction of Section 83 of the SGST/CGST
			<lb />
			Act. The High Court noted that a provisional attachment on the basis of a
			<lb />
			subjective satisfaction, absent any cogent or credible material, constitutes malice
			<lb />
			in law. It further outlined the principles for the exercise of the power:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;52. […]
			<lb />
			The order of provisional attachment before the assessment order
			<lb />
			is made, may be justified if the assessing authority or any other
			<lb />
			authority empowered in law is of the opinion that it is necessary
			<lb />
			to protect the interest of revenue. However, the subjective
			<lb />
			satisfaction should be based on some credible materials or
			<lb />
			information…It is not any and every material, howsoever vague
			<lb />
			and indefinite or distant, remote or far-fetching, which would
			<lb />
			warrant the formation of the belief.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(1) The power conferred upon the authority under Section 83 of
			<lb />
			the Act for provisional attachment could be termed as a very
			<lb />
			drastic and far-reaching power. Such power should be used
			<lb />
			sparingly and only on substantive weighty grounds and
			<lb />
			reasons.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(3) The power of provisional attachment under Section 83 of the
			<lb />
			Act should be exercised by the authority only if there is a
			<lb />
			reasonable apprehension that the assessee may default the
			<lb />
			ultimate collection of the demand that is likely to be raised on
			<lb />
			completion of the assessment. It should, therefore, be
			<lb />
			exercised with extreme care and caution.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(4) The power under Section 83 of the Act for provisional
			<lb />
			attachment should be exercised only if there is
			<lb />
			sufficient material on record to justify the satisfaction
			<lb />
			that the assessee is about to dispose of wholly or any
			<lb />
			part of his/her property with a view to thwarting the
			<lb />
			ultimate collection of demand and in order to achieve
			<lb />
			the said objective, the attachment should be of the
			<lb />
			properties and to that extent, it is required to achieve
			<lb />
			this objective.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(5) The power under Section 83 of the Act should neither be
			<lb />
			used as a tool to harass the assessee nor should it be
			<lb />
			used in a manner which may have an irreversible
			<lb />
			detrimental effect on the business of the assessee.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(6) The attachment of bank account and trading assets
			<lb />
			should be resorted to only as a last resort or measure.
			<lb />
			The provisional attachment under Section 83 of the Act
			<lb />
			should not be equated with the attachment in the course
			<lb />
			of the recovery proceedings.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(7) The authority before exercising power under Section 83 of the
			<lb />
			Act for provisional attachment should take into consideration
			<lb />
			two things:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i) whether it is a revenue neutral situation.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) the statement of &quot;output liability or input credit&quot;. Having
			<lb />
			regard to the amount paid by reversing the input tax credit if
			<lb />
			the interest of the revenue is sufficiently secured, then the
			<lb />
			authority may not be justified in invoking its power under
			<lb />
			Section 83 of the Act for the purpose of provisional
			<lb />
			attachment.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			32
			<lb />
			In the same vein, in Jai Ambey Filament Pvt Ltd v Union of India 29 , the
			<lb />
			Gujarat High Court reiterated that the subjective satisfaction as to the need for
			<lb />
			provisional attachment must be based on credible information that the attachment
			<lb />
			is necessary. This opinion cannot be formed based on &quot;imaginary grounds,
			<lb />
			wishful thinking, howsoever laudable that may be.&quot; The High Court further held,
			<lb />
			that on his opinion being challenged, the competent officer must be able to show
			<lb />
			the material on the basis of which the belief is formed.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			33
			<lb />
			In Patran Steel Rolling Mill v Assistant Commissioner of State Tax
			<lb />
			Unit 2 30 , the Gujarat High Court cited two instances in which provisional
			<lb />
			attachment would be apposite, these being where the assessee is a &apos;fly by night
			<lb />
			operator&apos; and if the assessee will not be able to pay its dues after assessment.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			34
			<lb />
			Similar to the decisions of the Gujarat High Court, other High Courts have
			<lb />
			recognized the restrictive nature of the power of provisional attachment under
			<lb />
			Section 83 of the SGST Act and the need for it to be based on adequate
			<lb />
			substantive material. The High Courts have also underscored the extraordinary
			<lb />
			nature of this power, necessitating due caution in its exercise. 31
			<lb />
			35
			<lb />
			The Delhi High Court, in Proex Fashion Private Limited v Government
			<lb />
			of India 32 outlined the following statutorily stipulated conditions for the invocation
			<lb />
			of Section 83 of the SGST Act:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;i) Order should be passed by Commissioner;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			ii) Proceeding under Section 62 or 63 or 64 or 67 or 73 or 74
			<lb />
			should be pending;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			iii) Commissioner must form an opinion;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			iv) Order should be passed to protect interest of revenue;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			v) It must be necessary to attach property.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			36
			<lb />
			In UFV India Global Education v Union of India 33 , the Punjab and
			<lb />
			Haryana High Court held that pendency of proceedings under the sections
			<lb />
			mentioned in Section 83 viz. Sections 62 or 63 or 64 or 67 or 73 or 74 is the sine
			<lb />
			qua non for an order of provisional attachment to be issued under Section 83.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			37
			<lb />
			Another case which is relevant for our purposes is the decision of the
			<lb />
			Bombay High Court in Kaish Impex Private Limited v Union of India 34 . In this
			<lb />
			case, the taxation authorities were enquiring into fraudulent claiming of ITC on
			<lb />
			the basis of fictitious transactions by an export firm in Delhi, against whom
			<lb />
			proceedings under Section 67 of the CGST Act had been initiated. On tracing the
			<lb />
			money trail, the petitioner was summoned under Section 70 of the CGST Act and
			<lb />
			his bank accounts were provisionally attached under Section 83 of the CGST Act.
			<lb />
			On dealing with the question of whether the bank accounts of the petitioner could
			<lb />
			be attached, when there were no pending proceedings against him and
			<lb />
			proceedings were pending against another taxable entity, the High Court held
			<lb />
			that the proceedings referred to under Section 83 of the Act must be pending
			<lb />
			against the taxable entity whose property is being attached. The High Court
			<lb />
			noted that:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;18. […] Section 83 though uses the phrase &apos;pendency of any
			<lb />
			proceedings&apos;, the proceedings are referable to section 62, 63,
			<lb />
			64, 67, 73 and 74 of the Act and none other. The bank
			<lb />
			account of the taxable person can be attached against
			<lb />
			whom the proceedings under the sections mentioned
			<lb />
			above are initiated. Section 83 does not provide for an
			<lb />
			automatic extension to any other taxable person from an
			<lb />
			inquiry specifically launched against a taxable person
			<lb />
			under these provisions. Section 83 read with section 159(2),
			<lb />
			and the form GST DRC-22 show that a proceeding has to be
			<lb />
			initiated against a specific taxable person, an opinion has to
			<lb />
			be formed that to protect the interest of Revenue an order of
			<lb />
			provisional attachment is necessary. The format of the
			<lb />
			order, i.e. the form GST DRC-22 also specifies the
			<lb />
			particulars of a registered taxable person and which
			<lb />
			proceedings have been launched against the aforesaid
			<lb />
			taxable person indicating a nexus between the
			<lb />

			C.3 Delegation of authority under CGST Act
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			38
			<lb />
			The learned counsel for the respondent State, during the course of his
			<lb />
			submissions, has also sought to justify the delegation of powers by the
			<lb />
			Commissioner to the Joint Commissioner by way of the impugned notification
			<lb />
			dated 21 October 2020 for the purpose of attachment of properties under Section
			<lb />
			83 of the HPGST Act. In this regard, reliance was placed on Nathanlal Maganlal
			<lb />
			Chauhan v State of Gujarat, 35 where the Gujarat High Court was considering
			<lb />
			the validity of a notification by which the Commissioner of State Tax had
			<lb />
			delegated all the functions under the SGST Act to the Special Commissioner and
			<lb />
			Additional Commissioners of State Tax. In rejecting a challenge to this
			<lb />
			notification, the High Court held that:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;39. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in the case of Sahni
			<lb />
			Silk Mills [internal citation omitted], the courts should normally be
			<lb />
			rigorous while requiring the power to be exercised by the persons
			<lb />
			or the bodies authorized by the statutes. As noted above, it is
			<lb />
			essential that the delegated power should be exercised by the
			<lb />
			authority upon whom it is conferred and by no one else. At the
			<lb />
			same time, in the present administrative setup, the extreme
			<lb />
			judicial aversion to delegation should not be carried to an
			<lb />
			extreme. There is only one Commissioner of State Tax in the
			<lb />
			State of Gujarat, and having regard to the enormous functions
			<lb />
			and duties to be discharged under the new tax regime, he has
			<lb />
			been empowered to delegate his powers to the Special
			<lb />
			Commissioner of State Tax and the Additional Commissioners of
			<lb />
			State Tax.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			40. We take notice of the fact that the delegation has been
			<lb />
			authorized expressly under Section 5(3) of the Act. We would
			<lb />
			have definitely interfered if the Special Commissioner or the
			<lb />
			Additional Commissioners would have further delegated the
			<lb />
			power to officers subordinate to them. Such is not the case over
			<lb />
			here.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			41. In the impugned notification it has been stated that the
			<lb />
			functions delegated shall be under the overall supervision of the
			<lb />
			Commissioner. When the Commissioner stated that his
			<lb />
			functions were delegated subject to his overall supervision,
			<lb />
			it did not mean or should not be construed as if he reserved
			<lb />
			to himself the right to intervene to impose his own decision
			<lb />
			upon his delegate. The words in the last part of the
			<lb />
			impugned notification would mean that the Commissioner
			<lb />
			could control the exercise administratively as to the kinds of
			<lb />
			cases in which the delegate could take action. In other
			<lb />
			words, the administrative side of the delegate&apos;s duties were
			<lb />
			to be the subject of control and revision but not the essential
			<lb />
			power to decide, whether to take action or not in a particular
			<lb />
			case. Once the powers are delegated for the purpose of
			<lb />
			Section 69 of the Act, the subjective satisfaction, or rather,
			<lb />
			the reasonable belief should be that of the delegated
			<lb />
			authority.&quot;

			<lb />
			Analysis
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			39
			<lb />
			The essence of the present case lies in how the power to order a
			<lb />
			provisional attachment under Section 83 of the HPGST Act is construed. Before
			<lb />
			interpreting it, the provision is extracted below for convenience of reference:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;83. Provisional attachment to protect revenue in certain cases. -
			<lb />
			(1) Where during the pendency of any proceedings under section
			<lb />
			62 or section 63 or section 64 or section 67 or section 73 or
			<lb />
			section 74, the Commissioner is of the opinion that for the
			<lb />
			purpose of protecting the interest of the Government revenue, it
			<lb />
			is necessary so to do, he may, by order in writing attach
			<lb />
			provisionally any property, including bank account, belonging to
			<lb />
			the taxable person in such manner as may be prescribed.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) Every such provisional attachment shall cease to have effect
			<lb />
			after the expiry of a period of one year from the date of the order
			<lb />
			made under sub-section (1).&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			40
			<lb />
			The marginal note to Section 83 provides some indication of Parliamentary
			<lb />
			intent. Section 83 provides for &quot;provisional attachment to protect revenue in
			<lb />
			certain cases&quot;. The first point to note is that the attachment is provisional -
			<lb />
			provisional in the sense that it is in aid of something else. The second point to
			<lb />
			note is that the purpose is to protect the revenue. The third point is the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;in certain cases&quot; which shows that in order to effect a provisional
			<lb />
			attachment, the conditions which have been spelt out in the statute must be
			<lb />
			fulfilled. Marginal notes, it is well-settled, do not control a statutory provision but
			<lb />
			provide some guidance in regard to content. Put differently, a marginal note
			<lb />
			indicates the drift of the provision. With these prefatory comments, the judgment
			<lb />
			must turn to the essential task of statutory construction. The language of the
			<lb />
			statute has to be interpreted bearing in mind that it is a taxing statute which
			<lb />
			comes up for interpretation. The provision must be construed on its plain terms.
			<lb />
			Equally, in interpreting the statute, we must have regard to the purpose
			<lb />
			underlying the provision. An interpretation which effectuates the purpose must be
			<lb />
			preferred particularly when it is supported by the plain meaning of the words
			<lb />
			used.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			41
			<lb />
			Sub-Section (1) of Section 83 can be bifurcated into several parts. The first
			<lb />
			part provides an insight on when in point of time or at which stage the power can
			<lb />
			be exercised. The second part specifies the authority to whom the power to
			<lb />
			order a provisional attachment is entrusted. The third part defines the conditions
			<lb />
			which must be fulfilled to validate the power or ordering a provisional attachment.
			<lb />
			The fourth part indicates the manner in which an attachment is to be leveled. The
			<lb />
			final and the fifth part defines the nature of the property which can be attached.
			<lb />
			Each of these special divisions which have been explained above is for
			<lb />
			convenience of exposition. While they are not watertight compartments,
			<lb />
			ultimately and together they aid in validating an understanding of the statute.
			<lb />
			Each of the above five parts is now interpreted and explained below:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The power to order a provisional attachment is entrusted during the
			<lb />
			pendency of proceedings under any one of six specified provisions:
			<lb />
			Sections 62, 63, 64, 67, 73 or 74. In other words, it is when a proceeding
			<lb />
			under any of these provisions is pending that a provisional attachment can
			<lb />
			be ordered;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			The power to order a provisional attachment has been vested by the
			<lb />
			legislature in the Commissioner;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii)
			<lb />
			Before exercising the power, the Commissioner must be &quot;of the opinion that
			<lb />
			for the purpose of protecting the interest of the government revenue, it is
			<lb />
			necessary so to do&quot;;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv)
			<lb />
			The order for attachment must be in writing;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v)
			<lb />
			The provisional attachment which is contemplated is of any property
			<lb />
			including a bank account belonging to the taxable person; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi)
			<lb />
			The manner in which a provisional attachment is levied must be specified in
			<lb />
			the rules made pursuant to the provisions of the statute.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			42
			<lb />
			Under sub-Section (2) of Section 83, a provisional attachment ceases to
			<lb />
			have effect upon the expiry of a period of one year of the order being passed
			<lb />
			under sub-Section (1). The power to levy a provisional attachment has been
			<lb />
			entrusted to the Commissioner during the pendency of proceedings under
			<lb />
			Sections 62, 63, 64, 67, 73 or as the case may be, Section 74. Section 62
			<lb />
			contains provisions for assessment for non-filing of returns. Section 63 provides
			<lb />
			for assessment of unregistered persons. Section 64 contains provisions for
			<lb />
			summary assessment. Section 67 elucidates provisions for inspection, search
			<lb />
			and seizure. Before we dwell on Section 74, it would be material to note the
			<lb />
			provisions of Section 70 which are extracted below:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;70. Power to summon persons to give evidence and produce
			<lb />
			documents. -(1) The proper officer under this Act shall have
			<lb />
			powers to summon any person whose attendance he considers
			<lb />
			necessary either to give evidence or to produce a document or
			<lb />
			any other thing in any inquiry in the same manner, as provided in
			<lb />
			the case of a civil court under the provisions of the Code of Civil
			<lb />
			Procedure, 1908, (5 of 1908).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) Every such inquiry referred to in sub-section (1) shall be
			<lb />
			deemed to be a &quot;judicial proceedings&quot; within the meaning of
			<lb />
			section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, (45
			<lb />
			of 1860).&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			43
			<lb />
			A power is conferred by Section 70 upon the proper officer to summon a
			<lb />
			person whose attendance is considered necessary to give evidence or produce a
			<lb />
			document or any other things in any enquiry in the manner which is provided in
			<lb />
			the case of a civil court under the CPC.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			44
			<lb />
			Section 74 is extracted below:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;74. Determination of tax not paid or short paid or erroneously
			<lb />
			refunded or input tax credit wrongly availed or utilised by
			<lb />
			reason of fraud or any wilful mis-statement or suppression of
			<lb />
			facts. -
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(1) Where it appears to the proper officer that any tax has not
			<lb />

			<lb />
			of facts to evade tax, he shall serve notice on the person
			<lb />
			chargeable with tax which has not been so paid or which has
			<lb />
			been so short paid or to whom the refund has erroneously
			<lb />
			been made, or who has wrongly availed or utilised input tax
			<lb />
			credit, requiring him to show cause as to why he should not
			<lb />
			pay the amount specified in the notice alongwith interest
			<lb />
			payable thereon under section 50 and a penalty equivalent
			<lb />
			to the tax specified in the notice.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) The proper officer shall issue the notice under sub-section
			<lb />
			(1) at least six months prior to the time limit specified in sub-

		<item>
			(3) Where a notice has been issued for any period under sub-
			<lb />
			section (1), the proper officer may serve a statement,
			<lb />
			containing the details of tax not paid or short paid or

			<lb />
			utilised for such periods other than those covered under
			<lb />
			subsection (1), on the person chargeable with tax.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(4) The service of statement under sub-section (3) shall be
			<lb />
			deemed to be service of notice under sub-section (1) of
			<lb />
			section 73, subject to the condition that the grounds relied

			upon in the said statement, except the ground of fraud, or
			<lb />
			any wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts to evade
			<lb />
			tax, for periods other than those covered under sub-section
			<lb />
			(1) are the same as are mentioned in the earlier notice.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(5) The person chargeable with tax may, before service of
			<lb />
			notice under sub-section (1), pay the amount of tax
			<lb />
			alongwith interest payable under section 50 and a penalty
			<lb />

			<lb />
			own ascertainment of such tax or the tax as ascertained by
			<lb />
			the proper officer and inform the proper officer in writing of
			<lb />
			such payment.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(6) The proper officer, on receipt of such information, shall not
			<lb />
			serve any notice under sub-section (1), in respect of the tax
			<lb />
			so paid or any penalty payable under the provisions of this
			<lb />
			Act or the rules made thereunder.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(7) Where the proper officer is of the opinion that the amount
			<lb />
			paid under sub-section (5) falls short of the amount actually
			<lb />
			payable, he shall proceed to issue the notice as provided for
			<lb />
			in sub-section (1) in respect of such amount which falls short
			<lb />
			of the amount actually payable.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(8) Where any person chargeable with tax under sub-section (1)
			<lb />
			pays the said tax alongwith interest payable under section
			<lb />
			50 and a penalty equivalent to twenty five per cent of such

			<lb />
			within a period of five years from the due date for furnishing

			<lb />
			utilised relates to or within five years from the date of
			<lb />
			erroneous refund.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(11) Where any person served with an order issued under sub-
			<lb />
			section (9) pays the tax along with interest payable thereon
			<lb />
			under section 50 and a penalty equivalent to fifty per cent of

		<item>
			Explanation-1. -For the purposes of section 73 and this
			<lb />
			section,-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i) the expression &quot;all proceedings in respect of the said notice&quot;
			<lb />
			shall not include proceedings under section 132; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) where the notice under the same proceedings is issued to
			<lb />
			the main person liable to pay tax and some other persons,
			<lb />
			and such proceedings against the main person have been
			<lb />
			concluded under section 73 or section 74, the proceedings
			<lb />
			against all the persons liable to pay penalty under sections
			<lb />
			122, 125, 129 and 130 are deemed to be concluded.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Explanation-2. -For the purpose of this Act, the expression
			<lb />
			&quot;suppression&quot; shall mean non-declaration of facts or
			<lb />
			information which a taxable person is required to declare in
			<lb />
			the return, statement, report or any other document
			<lb />
			furnished under this Act or the rules made thereunder, or
			<lb />
			failure to furnish any information on being asked for, in
			<lb />
			writing, by the proper officer.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			45
			<lb />
			Sub-Section (1) of Section 74 empowers the proper officer to serve a
			<lb />
			notice on a person chargeable with tax where it appears that
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Any tax has not been paid;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Tax has been short paid;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii)
			<lb />
			Tax has been erroneously refunded; or
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv)
			<lb />
			Input tax credit has been wrongly availed or utilized by reason of fraud,
			<lb />
			willful statement or suppression of fact to evade tax.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			46
			<lb />
			Sub-Section (1) enables the proper officer to issue a notice to show cause
			<lb />
			for the recovery of tax, interest payable under Section 50 and the penalty
			<lb />
			equivalent to the amount of tax specified in the notice. Sub-Sections (2), (3) and
			<lb />
			(4) lay down procedural provisions which are to be followed by the proper officer.
			<lb />
			Secondly, under sub-Section (5) of Section 74, before the service of a notice
			<lb />
			under sub-Section (1), the person who is chargeable with tax may pay the tax
			<lb />
			together with interest and a penalty equivalent to fifteen per cent of the tax on the
			<lb />
			basis of their own ascertainment of the tax or as ascertained by the proper officer
			<lb />
			and inform the proper officer of the payment having been made upon receipt of
			<lb />
			the information. Sub-Section (6) stipulates that the proper officer shall not serve
			<lb />
			any notice under sub-Section (1) in respect of the tax so paid or any penalty
			<lb />
			payable under the provisions of the Act or the Rules.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			47
			<lb />
			On the other hand, when the proper officer is of the opinion that the
			<lb />
			amount which has been paid under sub-Section (5) falls short of the amount
			<lb />
			which is actually payable, a notice under sub-Section (1) is to issue for the
			<lb />
			amount which falls short of what is actually payable. Sub-Section (8) contains a
			<lb />
			stipulation that where a person who is chargeable with tax under sub-Section (1)
			<lb />
			pays the tax together with interest and a penalty of twenty-five per cent of the tax
			<lb />
			within thirty days of the issuance of the notice, all proceedings in respect of the
			<lb />
			notice shall be deemed to be concluded. Under sub-Section (9), the proper officer
			<lb />
			after considering the representation of the person chargeable to tax is authorized
			<lb />
			to determine the amount of tax, interest and penalty due and to issue an order. A
			<lb />
			period of five years is stipulated by sub-Section (10) for the issuance of an order
			<lb />
			in sub-Section (9). Sub-Section (11) stipulates that upon service of an order
			<lb />
			under sub-Section (9), all proceedings in respect of the notice shall be deemed to
			<lb />
			be concluded upon the person paying the tax with interest under Section 50 and
			<lb />
			a penalty equivalent to 50 per cent of the tax within thirty days of the
			<lb />
			communication of an order. These provisions indicate how sub-Sections (5), (8)
			<lb />
			and (11) operate at different stages of the process.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			48
			<lb />
			Now in this backdrop, it becomes necessary to emphasize that before the
			<lb />
			Commissioner can levy a provisional attachment, there must be a formation of
			<lb />
			&quot;the opinion&quot; and that it is necessary &quot;so to do&quot; for the purpose of protecting the
			<lb />
			interest of the government revenue. The power to levy a provisional attachment is
			<lb />
			draconian in nature. By the exercise of the power, a property belonging to the
			<lb />
			taxable person may be attached, including a bank account. The attachment is
			<lb />
			provisional and the statute has contemplated an attachment during the pendency
			<lb />
			of the proceedings under the stipulated statutory provisions noticed earlier. An
			<lb />
			attachment which is contemplated in Section 83 is, in other words, at a stage
			<lb />
			which is anterior to the finalization of an assessment or the raising of a demand.
			<lb />
			Conscious as the legislature was of the draconian nature of the power and the
			<lb />
			serious consequences which emanate from the attachment of any property
			<lb />
			including a bank account of the taxable person, it conditioned the exercise of the
			<lb />
			power by employing specific statutory language which conditions the exercise of
			<lb />
			the power. The language of the statute indicates first, the necessity of the
			<lb />
			formation of opinion by the Commissioner; second, the formation of opinion
			<lb />
			before ordering a provisional attachment; third the existence of opinion that it is
			<lb />
			necessary so to do for the purpose of protecting the interest of the government
			<lb />
			revenue; fourth, the issuance of an order in writing for the attachment of any
			<lb />
			property of the taxable person; and fifth, the observance by the Commissioner of
			<lb />
			the provisions contained in the rules in regard to the manner of attachment. Each
			<lb />
			of these components of the statute are integral to a valid exercise of power. In
			<lb />
			other words, when the exercise of the power is challenged, the validity of its
			<lb />
			exercise will depend on a strict and punctilious observance of the statutory pre-
			<lb />
			conditions by the Commissioner. While conditioning the exercise of the power on
			<lb />
			the formation of an opinion by the Commissioner that &quot;for the purpose of
			<lb />
			protecting the interest of the government revenue, it is necessary so to do&quot;, it is
			<lb />
			evident that the statute has not left the formation of opinion to an unguided
			<lb />
			subjective discretion of the Commissioner. The formation of the opinion must
			<lb />
			bear a proximate and live nexus to the purpose of protecting the interest of the
			<lb />
			government revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			49
			<lb />
			By utilizing the expression &quot;it is necessary so to do&quot; the legislature has
			<lb />
			evinced an intent that an attachment is authorized not merely because it is
			<lb />
			expedient to do so (or profitable or practicable for the revenue to do so) but
			<lb />
			because it is necessary to do so in order to protect interest of the government
			<lb />
			revenue. Necessity postulates that the interest of the revenue can be protected
			<lb />
			only by a provisional attachment without which the interest of the revenue would
			<lb />
			stand defeated. Necessity in other words postulates a more stringent requirement
			<lb />
			than a mere expediency. A provisional attachment under Section 83 is
			<lb />
			contemplated during the pendency of certain proceedings, meaning thereby that
			<lb />
			a final demand or liability is yet to be crystallized. An anticipatory attachment of
			<lb />
			this nature must strictly conform to the requirements, both substantive and
			<lb />
			procedural, embodied in the statute and the rules. The exercise of unguided
			<lb />
			discretion cannot be permissible because it will leave citizens and their legitimate
			<lb />
			business activities to the peril of arbitrary power. Each of these ingredients must
			<lb />
			be strictly applied before a provisional attachment on the property of an assesses
			<lb />
			can be levied. The Commissioner must be alive to the fact that such provisions
			<lb />
			are not intended to authorize Commissioners to make preemptive strikes on the
			<lb />
			property of the assessee, merely because property is available for being
			<lb />
			attached. There must be a valid formation of the opinion that a provisional
			<lb />
			attachment is necessary for the purpose of protecting the interest of the
			<lb />
			government revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			50
			<lb />
			These expressions in regard to both the purpose and necessity of
			<lb />
			provisional attachment implicate the doctrine of proportionality. Proportionality
			<lb />
			mandates the existence of a proximate or live link between the need for the
			<lb />
			attachment and the purpose which it is intended to secure. It also postulates the
			<lb />
			maintenance of a proportion between the nature and extent of the attachment
			<lb />
			and the purpose which is sought to be served by ordering it. Moreover, the words
			<lb />
			embodied in sub-Section (1) of Section 83, as interpreted above, would leave no
			<lb />
			manner of doubt that while ordering a provisional attachment the Commissioner
			<lb />
			must in the formation of the opinion act on the basis of tangible material on the
			<lb />
			basis of which the formation of opinion is based in regard to the existence of the
			<lb />
			statutory requirement. While dealing with a similar provision contained in Section
			<lb />
			45 36 of the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act 2003 , one of us (Hon&apos;ble Mr Justice MR
			<lb />
			Shah) speaking for a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in Vishwanath
			<lb />
			Realtor v State of Gujarat 37 observed:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;8.3. Section 45 of the VAT Act confers powers upon the
			<lb />
			Commissioner to pass the order of provisional attachment of
			<lb />
			any property belonging to the dealer during the pendency of
			<lb />
			any proceedings of assessment or reassessment of turnover
			<lb />
			escaping assessment. However, the order of provisional
			<lb />
			attachment can be passed by the Commissioner when the
			<lb />
			Commissioner is of the opinion that for the purpose of
			<lb />
			protecting the interest of the Government Revenue, it is
			<lb />
			necessary so to do. Therefore, before passing the order of
			<lb />
			provisional attachment, there must be an opinion formed by the
			<lb />
			Commissioner that for the purpose of protecting the interest of
			<lb />
			the Government Revenue during the pendency of any
			<lb />
			proceedings of assessment or reassessment, it is necessary to
			<lb />
			attach provisionally any property belonging to the dealer.
			<lb />
			However, such satisfaction must be on some tangible
			<lb />
			material on objective facts with the Commissioner. In a
			<lb />
			given case, on the basis of the past conduct of the dealer
			<lb />
			and on the basis of some reliable information that the
			<lb />
			dealer is likely to defeat the claim of the Revenue in case
			<lb />
			any order is passed against the dealer under the VAT Act
			<lb />
			and/or the dealer is likely to sale his properties and/or sale
			<lb />
			and/or dispose of the properties and in case after the
			<lb />
			conclusion of the assessment/reassessment proceedings,
			<lb />
			if there is any tax liability, the Revenue may not be in a
			<lb />
			position to recover the amount thereafter, in such a case
			<lb />
			only,
			<lb />
			however,
			<lb />
			on
			<lb />
			formation
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			subjective
			<lb />
			satisfaction/opinion, the Commissioner may exercise the
			<lb />

			<lb />
			We adopt the test of the existence of &quot;tangible material&quot;. In this context,
			<lb />
			reference may be made to the decision of this Court in the Commissioner of
			<lb />
			Income Tax v Kelvinator of India Limited 38 . Mr Justice SH Kapadia (as the
			<lb />
			learned Chief Justice then was) while considering the expression &quot;reason to
			<lb />
			believe&quot; in Section 147 of the Income Tax Act 1961 that income chargeable to tax
			<lb />
			has escaped assessment inter alia by the omission or failure of the assessee to
			<lb />
			disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment of that
			<lb />
			year, held that the power to reopen an assessment must be conditioned on the
			<lb />
			existence of &quot;tangible material&quot; and that &quot;reasons must have a live link with the
			<lb />
			formation of the belief&quot;. This principle was followed subsequently in a two judge
			<lb />
			Bench decision in Income Tax Officer, Ward No. 162 (2) v Techspan India
			<lb />
			Private Limited 39 . While adverting to these decisions we have noticed that
			<lb />
			Section 83 of the HPGST Act uses the expression &quot;opinion&quot; as distinguished from
			<lb />
			&quot;reasons to believe&quot;. However for the reasons that we have indicated earlier we
			<lb />
			are clearly of the view that the formation of the opinion must be based on tangible
			<lb />
			material which indicates a live link to the necessity to order a provisional
			<lb />
			attachment to protect the interest of the government revenue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			52
			<lb />
			Rule 159 prescribes modalities for effecting a provisional attachment of
			<lb />
			property. Rule 159 provides thus :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;159. Publication of information in respect of persons in
			<lb />
			certain cases. -(1) If the Commissioner, or any other officer
			<lb />
			authorised by him in this behalf, is of the opinion that it is
			<lb />
			necessary or expedient in the public interest to publish the
			<lb />
			name of any person and any other particulars relating to any
			<lb />
			proceedings or prosecution under this Act in respect of such
			<lb />
			person, it may cause to be published such name and particulars
			<lb />
			in such manner as it thinks fit.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(2) No publication under this section shall be made in relation to
			<lb />
			any penalty imposed under this Act until the time for presenting
			<lb />
			an appeal to the Appellate Authority under section 107 has
			<lb />
			expired without an appeal having been presented or the appeal,
			<lb />
			if presented, has been disposed of.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Explanation. -In the case of firm, company or other association
			<lb />
			of persons, the names of the partners of the firm, directors,
			<lb />
			managing agents, secretaries and treasurers or managers of
			<lb />
			the company, or the members of the association, as the case
			<lb />
			may be, may also be published if, in the opinion of the
			<lb />
			Commissioner, or any other officer authorised by him in this
			<lb />
			behalf, circumstances of the case justify it.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			53
			<lb />
			Under sub-Rule (1) of Rule 159, an attachment of property by the
			<lb />
			Commissioner under Section 83 is effected by passing an order mentioning the
			<lb />
			details of the property which is attached. The form in which the order is to be
			<lb />
			made is prescribed in form GST DRC-22. This form is extracted below:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			54
			<lb />
			Under sub-Rule (5) of Rule 159, the person whose property is attached is
			<lb />
			allowed seven days&apos; time to file an objection that the property attached &quot;was or is
			<lb />
			not liable to attachment&quot;. Sub-Rule (5) stipulates that the Commissioner may
			<lb />
			&quot;after affording an opportunity of being heard to the person filing the objection&quot;
			<lb />
			release the property by an order in form GSTDRC-23. Similarly, under sub-Rule
			<lb />
			(6) upon being satisfied that the property was or is no longer liable to be
			<lb />
			attached, the Commissioner is empowered to release the property by issuing an
			<lb />
			order in Form GST DRC-23 for the releasing of the property under attachment.
			<lb />
			The Form is extracted below :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			55
			<lb />
			A significant aspect of Rule 159(5) is that upon the levy of a provisional
			<lb />
			attachment, the person whose property is attached is empowered to file an
			<lb />
			objection within seven days on the ground that the property was or is not liable to
			<lb />
			attachment. In using the expression &quot;was or is no longer liable for attachment&quot;,
			<lb />
			the delegate of the legislature has comprehended two alternative situations. The
			<lb />
			first, evidenced by the use of the words &quot;was&quot; indicates that the property was on
			<lb />
			the date of the attachment in the past not liable to be attached. That is the reason
			<lb />
			for the use of the past tense &quot;was&quot;. The expression &quot;is not liable to attachment
			<lb />
			indicates a situation in praesenti. Even if the property, arguably, was validly
			<lb />
			attached in the past, the person whose property has been attached may
			<lb />
			demonstrate to the Commissioner that it is not liable to be attached in the
			<lb />
			present.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			56
			<lb />
			The second significant aspect of sub-Rule (5) is the mandatory
			<lb />
			requirement of furnishing an opportunity of being heard to the person whose
			<lb />
			property is attached. This is in consonance with the principles of natural justice
			<lb />
			and ensures that a fair procedure is observed. Sub-Rule (5) provides for a post-
			<lb />
			provisional attachment right of:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(i) Submitting an objection to the attachment;
			<lb />
			(ii) An opportunity of being heard.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Sub -Rule (5) contains clear language to the effect that a person whose property
			<lb />
			is attached is entitled to two procedural entitlements: first, the right to submit an
			<lb />
			objection on the ground that the property was not or is not liable to be attached;
			<lb />
			and second, an opportunity of being heard to the person filing an objection. This
			<lb />
			is a clear indicator that in addition the filing of an objection, the person whose
			<lb />
			property is attached is entitled to an opportunity of being heard. It is not open to
			<lb />
			the Commissioner, as has been stated in the present case, to hold the view that
			<lb />
			the only safeguard under sub-Rule 5 is to submit an objection without an
			<lb />
			opportunity of a personal hearing. Such a construction would be plainly contrary
			<lb />
			to sub-Rule 5 which contemplates both the submission of an objection to the
			<lb />
			attachment and an opportunity of being heard. The opportunity of being heard
			<lb />
			can be availed of as a matter of right by the person whose property is attached.
			<lb />
			Both the right to submit an objection and to be afforded an opportunity of being
			<lb />
			heard are valuable safeguards. The consequence of a provisional attachment is
			<lb />
			serious. It displaces the person whose property is attached from dealing with the
			<lb />
			property. Where a bank account is attached, it prevents the person from
			<lb />
			operating the account. A business entity whose bank account is attached is
			<lb />
			seriously prejudiced by the inability to utilize the proceeds of the account for the
			<lb />
			purpose of business. The dual procedural safeguards inserted in sub-Rule 5 of
			<lb />
			Rule 159 demand strict compliance.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			The Commissioner who hears the objections must pass a reasoned order either
			<lb />
			accepting or rejecting the objections. To allow the Commissioner to get by
			<lb />
			without passing a reasoned order will make his decision subjective and defeat the
			<lb />
			purpose of subjecting it to judicial scrutiny. The Commissioner must deal with the
			<lb />
			objections and pass a reasoned order indicating whether, and if not, why the
			<lb />
			objections are not being accepted. Sub-Rule 6 of Rule 159 allows for the release
			<lb />
			of a property which either was or is no longer liable for attachment. The form in
			<lb />
			which such an order has to be passed, namely form GST DRC-23, states that
			<lb />
			&quot;now there is no such proceeding pending against the defaulting person which
			<lb />
			warrants attachment&quot; of the account or as the case may be, the property. Sub-
			<lb />
			Rules 5 and 6 do not expressly contemplate a situation in which the person
			<lb />
			whose property is attached can object on the ground that the attachment is in
			<lb />
			excess of the amount likely to be due for which proceedings have been launched
			<lb />
			under the Act. Nor does it provide for a specific opportunity to the taxable person
			<lb />
			to offer any alternative form of security in lieu of the attachment. Such an
			<lb />
			opportunity must be read in to the provision to allow for a fair working in practice.
			<lb />
			Whether any alternative security that is furnished by the taxable person should be
			<lb />
			accepted and if so, its sufficiency, is a matter for the Commissioner to determine.
			<lb />
			Undoubtedly, the taxable person may not have a right to demand that only a
			<lb />
			particular form of security must be accepted. The Commissioner has to decide
			<lb />
			whether the form of security offered would secure the interest of the revenue.
			<lb />
			Where the taxable person sets up the plea that the extent of the attachment is
			<lb />
			excessive or where the taxable person offers an alternative form of security,
			<lb />
			these are also matters which ought to be determined by the Commissioner in the
			<lb />
			exercise of powers under Rule 159(5). The scope of objection can also extend to
			<lb />
			the nature of the property which is being provisionally attached.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, it is in this backdrop that we proceed to a determination of whether the
			<lb />
			petition under Article 226 was maintainable and if it was, whether Commissioner
			<lb />
			exercised the powers under Section 83 read with Rule 159 in accordance with
			<lb />
			law.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			57
			<lb />
			The material facts for making this determination need to be recapitulated.
			<lb />
			On 3 October 2018, a memo was issued under Section 70 (incorrectly referring to
			<lb />
			the provisions of Section 74) by the Joint Commissioner of State Taxes and
			<lb />
			Excise directing the appellant to appear on 9 October 2018 along with specific
			<lb />
			documents pertaining to the years 2017-18 and 2018-19. The notice stated that
			<lb />
			in the event that the appellant failed to appear, the Commissioner would be
			<lb />
			constrained to issue a notice to show cause under Section 74(1). On 9 October
			<lb />
			2018, two partners of the appellant attended the hearing. On 10 October 2018, a
			<lb />
			&apos;detection case&apos; under Section 74 of the HPGST Act and CGST Act read with
			<lb />
			Section 20 of the IGST Act was initiated against a supplier of the appellant, GM
			<lb />
			Power Tech by a search and seizure operation conducted under Section 67. On
			<lb />
			15 October 2018, the partners of the appellant attended the case hearing and
			<lb />
			provided certain documents which were required by the department. The partners
			<lb />
			of GM Powertech were arrested under the provisions of Sections 69 and 132 of
			<lb />
			the HPGST Act on 3 December 2018, on the allegation that they had made
			<lb />
			fraudulent claims of ITC from fake/fictitious firms of Delhi and Kanpur. On 15
			<lb />
			December 2018, the representatives of the appellant were directed to remain
			<lb />
			present on 17 December 2018 for explaining the allegedly illegal claim of ITC for
			<lb />
			2017-18 and 2018-19. A representative of the appellant attended the enquiry on
			<lb />
			17 December 2018. On 9 January 2019, an order of provisional attachment was
			<lb />
			issued under Section 83 by the Joint Commissioner of State Taxes and Excise by
			<lb />
			which a payment of Rs 5 crores due to the appellant from M/s Fujikawa Power
			<lb />
			was attached on the ground that the appellant had availed of ITC of Rs 3.25
			<lb />
			crores against the purchase of goods valued at about Rs 21 crores from GM
			<lb />
			Powertech for 2017-18 and 2018-19 and a case of GST fraud had been instituted
			<lb />
			against the alleged supplier. On 19 January 2019, Form GST DRC-22 was
			<lb />
			issued to Fujikawa Power regarding the attachment of Rs 5 crores. On 29
			<lb />
			January 2019, the appellant made a representation under Rule 159(5) for
			<lb />
			unblocking the credit and releasing the amount which was provisionally attached.
			<lb />
			On 30 January 2019, the order of provisional attachment was withdrawn
			<lb />
			completely with immediate effect. On 9 April 2019 and 5 July 2019 a
			<lb />
			representative of the appellant attended the case hearing. On 4 July 2020, an
			<lb />
			intimation was furnished to the appellant of the tax ascertained as payable under
			<lb />
			Section 74(5). According to the intimation, the appellant received among other
			<lb />
			items, lead ingots from GM Powertech during FY 2017-18 and 2018-19 and
			<lb />
			investigation had revealed that ITC had been fraudulently availed of by the
			<lb />
			supplier on the basis of the invoices of fake firms. The appellant had also availed
			<lb />
			of ITC due to inward supplies from GM Powertech. On 3 and 5 August 2020, the
			<lb />
			appellant filed its submissions under Rule 142(2) (a) against the proposed
			<lb />
			liability. On 6 October 2020, an order was passed under Section 74(9) against
			<lb />
			GM Powertech confirming a demand of Rs 39.48 crores for 2017-18 and 2018-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			19. The proceedings concluded that GM Powertech had
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			No business establishment or property in Himachal Pradesh; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			No security or surety.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			58
			<lb />
			On 21 October 2020, the Commissioner of State Taxes and Excise,
			<lb />
			Himachal Pradesh delegated, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 5(3) the
			<lb />
			powers vested under Section 83(1) inter alia to the Joint Commissioner of State
			<lb />
			Taxes and Excise. On 28 October 2020, a fresh order was issued under Section
			<lb />
			83 stating that proceedings were initiated against the appellant under Section 74
			<lb />
			since it was found to be involved in an ITC fraud of Rs 5.03 crores during 2017-
			<lb />
			18 and 2018-19. Since a GST fraud case had been initiated against GM
			<lb />
			Powertech on whom a demand had been raised, the ITC claimed by the
			<lb />
			appellant against supplies effected by GM Powertech was held to be inadmissible
			<lb />
			resulting in a provisional attachment of the payments due to the appellant to the
			<lb />
			extent of Rs 5,03,82,554/-. A similar order was issued on 28 October 2020 under
			<lb />
			Section 83 to M/s Deepak International Limited. The appellant submitted a
			<lb />
			detailed representation under Rule 159 (5) to the Joint Commissioner. The
			<lb />
			representation was rejected on 6 November 2020 without affording an
			<lb />
			opportunity of being heard. Thereafter, on 27 November 2020, a notice to show
			<lb />
			cause was issued to the appellant under Section 74(1) recording that the
			<lb />
			appellant had shown inward supplies of lead ingots from GM Powertech and had
			<lb />
			claimed and utilized ITC on that basis. However, all suppliers from whom GM
			<lb />
			Powertech had shown inward supplies of goods were found to be fictitious, fake
			<lb />
			and non-existent. The GST registration of GM Powertech had been cancelled
			<lb />
			and by an order under Section 74(9), an additional demand of Rs 39.48 crores
			<lb />
			was confirmed. The appellant was called upon to show cause as to why interest,
			<lb />
			tax and penalty should not be imposed. The appellant instituted writ proceedings
			<lb />
			before the Himachal Pradesh High Court inter alia for
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			Challenging the delegation by the Commissioner on 21 October 2020;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			The proceedings initiated under Section 83; and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii)
			<lb />
			Revocation of the provisional attachment.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			The writ petition was dismissed by the High Court on the ground that the
			<lb />
			appellant had an alternative remedy available in law.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			59
			<lb />
			The sole ground which has weighed with the High Court in holding that the
			<lb />
			writ proceedings were not maintainable is that &quot;the writ petitioner has not only
			<lb />
			(an) efficacious remedy, rather alternative remedy under the GST Act&quot;. In
			<lb />
			addition, the High Court has observed that the writ petition filed by GM Powertech
			<lb />
			against whom similar allegations have been leveled had been dismissed by
			<lb />
			relegating it to the pursuit of an alternative remedy. The learned senior counsel
			<lb />
			appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that GM Powertech had been
			<lb />
			relegated to the pursuit of an alternative remedy since an order of assessment
			<lb />
			had been passed against it. However, insofar as the appellant is concerned, the
			<lb />
			writ proceedings were instituted to challenge the levy of a provisional attachment
			<lb />
			under Section 83 and there is no alternative remedy provided under the Act for
			<lb />
			challenging an order under Section 83.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			60
			<lb />
			Section 107 of the HPGST Act 2017 is incorporated in Chapter XVIII which
			<lb />
			deals with appeals and revisions. Section 107(1) provides as follows:
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			&quot;107. Appeals to Appellate Authority.-(1) Any person aggrieved
			<lb />
			by any decision or order passed under this Act or the Central
			<lb />
			Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (No.12 of 2017) by an
			<lb />
			adjudicating authority may appeal to such Appellate Authority as
			<lb />
			may be prescribed within three months from the date on which
			<lb />
			the said decision or order is communicated to such person.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			61
			<lb />
			Sub-Section (1) of Section 107 makes it abundantly clear that an appeal to
			<lb />
			the Appellate Authority is available against a decision or order passed under the
			<lb />
			HPGST Act or CGST Act by an &quot;adjudicating authority&quot;. Sub-Section (2) similarly
			<lb />
			provides that:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(2) The Commissioner may, on his own motion, or upon request
			<lb />
			from the Commissioner of central tax, call for and examine the
			<lb />
			record of any proceeding in which an adjudicating authority has
			<lb />
			passed any decision or order under this Act or the Central Goods
			<lb />
			and Services Tax Act, 2017 (No.12 of 2017) for the purpose of
			<lb />
			satisfying himself as to the legality or propriety of the said
			<lb />
			decision or order and may, by order, direct any officer
			<lb />
			subordinate to him to apply to the Appellate Authority within six
			<lb />
			months from the date of communication of the said decision or
			<lb />
			order for the determination of such points arising out of the said
			<lb />
			decision or order as may be specified by the Commissioner in his
			<lb />
			order.
			<lb />
		</item>
		<p>
			Sub-Section (2) confers a revisional power on the Commissioner in regard to the
			<lb />
			legality or propriety of a decision or order passed by an adjudicating authority.
			<lb />
			The expression &apos;adjudicating authority&apos; is defined by Section 2(4) in the following
			<lb />
			terms:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;(4) &quot;adjudicating authority&quot; means any authority, appointed or
			<lb />
			authorized to pass any order or decision under this Act, but does
			<lb />
			not include the Commissioner, Revisional Authority, the Authority
			<lb />
			for Advance Ruling, the Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling,
			<lb />
			the Appellate Authority and the Appellate Tribunal;&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			62
			<lb />
			From the above definition, it is evident that the expression &apos;adjudicating
			<lb />
			authority&apos; does not include among other authorities, the Commissioner. In the
			<lb />
			present case, the narration of facts indicates that on 21 October 2020, the
			<lb />
			Commissioner had in exercise of his powers under Section 5(3) made a
			<lb />
			delegation inter alia to the Joint Commissioner of State Taxes and Excise in
			<lb />
			respect of the powers vested under Section 83(1). The Joint Commissioner, in
			<lb />
			other words, was exercising the powers which are vested in the Commissioner
			<lb />
			under Section 83(1) to order a provisional attachment in pursuance of the
			<lb />
			delegation exercised on 21 October 2020. This being the position, clearly the
			<lb />
			order passed by the Joint Commissioner as a delegate of the Commissioner was
			<lb />
			not subject to an appeal under Section 107(1) and the only remedy that was
			<lb />
			available was in the form of the invocation of the writ jurisdiction under Article 226
			<lb />
			of the Constitution. The High Court was, therefore, clearly in error in declining to
			<lb />
			entertain the writ proceedings.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			63
			<lb />
			The entire procedure which has been followed by the Joint Commissioner
			<lb />
			in the present case is contrary to the provisions contained in Section 83 read with
			<lb />
			Rule 159. The Joint Commissioner (acting on behalf of the Commissioner) has
			<lb />
			proceeded on an understanding that an opportunity of being heard to the person
			<lb />
			whose property is provisionally attached is a matter of discretion, the discretion of
			<lb />
			being that of the Commissioner. In the counter affidavit which has been filed by
			<lb />
			the Commissioner it has been stated that:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;17. It is submitted that the petitioner duly participated in the
			<lb />
			proceedings initialed u/Sec. 83 of the HPGST Act 2017 and also
			<lb />
			filed its objections. Once the petitioner filed its objections and the
			<lb />
			same were rejected on 06.11.2020 then the petitioner could not
			<lb />
			have turned back and challenged the initiation of proceedings
			<lb />
			u/Sec. 83 or the HPGST Act, 2017, only because the
			<lb />
			proceedings did not end up favoring of the Petitioner.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			18. It is reiterated that the fresh order of attachment passed on
			<lb />
			28.10.2020 was not based on the same set or allegations.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			19. It is further submitted that once the Petitioner had filed
			<lb />
			objections, then any opportunity of hearing was the discretion of
			<lb />
			the Ld. Commissioner.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			64
			<lb />
			This understanding of the Commissioner is in the teeth of and clearly
			<lb />
			contrary to the provisions of Rule 159(5). Rule 159(5), as explained earlier
			<lb />
			contemplates two safeguards to the person whose property is attached. Firstly, it
			<lb />
			permits such a person to submit objections to the order of attachment on the
			<lb />
			ground that the property was or is not liable for attachment. Secondly, Rule
			<lb />
			159(5) posits an opportunity of being heard. Both requirements are cumulative.
			<lb />
			The Commissioner&apos;s understanding that an opportunity of being heard was at the
			<lb />
			discretion of the Commissioner is therefore flawed and contrary to the provisions
			<lb />
			of Rule 159(5). There has, hence, been a fundamental breach of the principles of
			<lb />
			natural justice.
			<lb />

			On 28 October 2020, the following order was recorded in the file noting by
			<lb />
			the Joint Commissioner purporting to justify the levy of a provisional attachment :
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			66
			<lb />
			Ex facie, the above order passed by the Joint Commissioner does not
			<lb />
			indicate any basis for the formation of the opinion that the levy of a provisional
			<lb />
			attachment was necessary to protect the interest of the government revenue. The
			<lb />
			order in the file noting refers to the fact that the case of GM Powertech had been
			<lb />
			decided under Section 74 resulting in an additional demand of Rs. 39 crores on
			<lb />
			account of a fraudulent claim of ITC for FY 2017-18 and 2018-19. GM Powertech
			<lb />
			is alleged to have passed on the ITC to various Registered Tax Persons 40
			<lb />
			situated in Himachal Pradesh by issuing invoices inter alia to the appellant during
			<lb />
			2018-19 for which a case under Section 74 had been initiated. The order records
			<lb />
			that the appellant had claimed ITC of Rs 3.25 crores on the strength of the
			<lb />
			invoices issued by GM Powertech. The order merely records that the
			<lb />
			submissions which were urged by the appellant on 5 August 2020 &quot;are not
			<lb />
			sustainable&quot;. &quot;In view of the facts involved in the case&quot;, the Joint Commissioner
			<lb />
			concluded that it is necessary at this stage to safeguard the government revenue
			<lb />
			and since the appellant had sold goods to Fujikawa the payment due to it was
			<lb />
			being attached provisionally. The order of the Joint Commissioner contains
			<lb />
			absolutely no basis for the formation of the opinion that a provisional attachment
			<lb />
			was necessary to safeguard the interest of the revenue. No tangible material has
			<lb />
			been disclosed. The record clearly reveals a breach of the mandatory pre-
			<lb />
			conditions for the valid exercise of powers under Section 83 of the HPGST Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			67
			<lb />
			The order of provisional attachment under Section 83(1) is to be issued
			<lb />
			&quot;during the pendency of any proceedings under Section 62 or Section 63 or
			<lb />
			Section 64 or Section 67 or Section 73 or Section 74&quot;. In the present case, the
			<lb />
			notice to show cause under Section 74(1) of the HPGST Act was issued to the
			<lb />
			appellant on 27 November 2020. After the High Court dismissed the writ petition,
			<lb />
			this Court was moved under Article 136 of the Constitution. Notice was issued in
			<lb />
			the Special Leave Petition on 4 February 2021 returnable on 19 February 2021.
			<lb />
			A day before the case was listed, on 18 February 2021, an ex parte order was
			<lb />
			passed by the Joint Commissioner under Section 74 (9) of the HPGST Act
			<lb />
			confirming the demand of Rs 8,30,27,218 in the notice to show cause.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			68
			<lb />
			It is evident from the facts noted above that the order of provisional
			<lb />
			attachment was passed before the proceedings against the appellant were
			<lb />
			initiated under Section 74 of the HPGST Act. Section 83 of the Act requires that
			<lb />
			there must be pendency of proceedings under the relevant provisions mentioned
			<lb />
			above against the taxable person whose property is sought to be attached. We
			<lb />
			are unable to accept the contention of the respondent that merely because
			<lb />
			proceedings were pending/concluded against another taxable entity, that is GM
			<lb />
			Powertech, the powers of Sections 83 could also be attracted against the
			<lb />
			appellant. This interpretation would be an expansion of a draconian power such
			<lb />
			as that contained in Section 83, which must necessarily be interpreted
			<lb />
			restrictively. Given that there were no pending proceedings against the
			<lb />
			appellant, the mere fact that proceedings under Section 74 had concluded
			<lb />
			against GM Powertech, would not satisfy the requirements of Section 83. Thus,
			<lb />
			the order of provisional attachment was ultra vires Section 83 of the Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			69
			<lb />
			On 1 March 2021, the appellant has filed an appeal under Section 107
			<lb />
			together with a deposit of Rs 32,15,488 representing ten per cent of the tax due.
			<lb />
			Section 107(6) contains the following stipulation:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;(6) No appeal shall be filed under sub-section (1), unless the
			<lb />
			appellant has paid-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) in full, such part of the amount of tax, interest, fine, fee and
			<lb />
			penalty arising from the impugned order, as is admitted by him;
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) a sum equal to ten per cent of the remaining amount of tax in
			<lb />
			dispute arising from the said order, in relation to which the appeal
			<lb />
			has been filed.&quot;
			<lb />
			Sub-Section (7) stipulates that :
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;(7) Where the appellant has paid the amount under sub-section
			<lb />
			(6), the recovery proceedings for the balance amount shall be
			<lb />
			deemed to be stayed.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			70
			<lb />
			Clause (a) of sub-Section (6) provides that no appeal shall be filed without
			<lb />
			the payment in full, of such part of the amount of tax, interest, fine, fee and
			<lb />
			penalty arising from the impugned order as is admitted. In addition, under clause
			<lb />
			(b), ten per cent of the remaining amount of tax in dispute arising from the order
			<lb />
			has to be paid in relation to which the appeal has been filed. Upon the payment
			<lb />
			of the amount under sub-Section (6) the recovery proceedings for the balance
			<lb />
			are deemed to be stayed. Thus, in any event, the order of provisional attachment
			<lb />
			must cease to subsist. The appellant, having filed an appeal under Section 107,
			<lb />
			is required to comply with the provisions of sub-Section (6) of Section 107 while
			<lb />
			the recovery of the balance is deemed to be stayed under the provisions of sub-
			<lb />
			Section (7). As observed hereinabove and under Section 83, the order of
			<lb />
			provisional attachment may be passed during the pendency of any proceedings
			<lb />
			under Section 62 or Section 63 or Section 64 or Section 67 or Section 73 or
			<lb />
			Section 74. Therefore, once the final order of assessment is passed under
			<lb />
			Section 74 the order of provisional attachment must cease to subsist. Therefore,
			<lb />
			after the final order under Section 74 of the HPGST Act was passed on 18
			<lb />
			February, 2021, the order of provisional attachment must come to an end.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			71
			<lb />
			Moreover, an order of provisional attachment was issued by the Joint
			<lb />
			Commissioner which was withdrawn on 30 January 2019, after considering the
			<lb />
			representations made by the petitioner. On the very ground, without any
			<lb />
			material change in circumstances. Another order of provisional attachment came
			<lb />
			to be issued by another Joint Commissioner. Therefore, it was the contention of
			<lb />
			the petitioner before the High Court that the subsequent order of provisional
			<lb />
			attachment is in substance and effect an order reviewing the earlier order
			<lb />
			withdrawing the order of provisional attachment which was not permissible and
			<lb />
			therefore the subsequent order of provisional attachment is without jurisdiction.
			<lb />
			The High Court has not considered this aspect. Both the earlier and the
			<lb />
			subsequent orders of provisional attachment are on the same grounds.
			<lb />
			Therefore, unless there was a change in the circumstances, it was not open for
			<lb />
			the Joint Commissioner to pass another order of provisional attachment, after the
			<lb />
			earlier order of provisional attachment was withdrawn after considering the
			<lb />
			representations made by the petitioner. This is an additional ground to set aside
			<lb />
			the subsequent order of provisional attachment.

			E
			<lb />
			Summary of findings
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			72
			<lb />
			For the above reasons, we hold and conclude that
			<lb />
		</p>
		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			The Joint Commissioner while ordering a provisional attachment under
			<lb />
			section 83 was acting as a delegate of the Commissioner in pursuance of
			<lb />
			the delegation effected under Section 5(3) and an appeal against the order
			<lb />
			of provisional attachment was not available under Section 107 (1);
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii)
			<lb />
			The writ petition before the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution
			<lb />
			challenging the order of provisional attachment was maintainable;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii)
			<lb />
			The High Court has erred in dismissing the writ petition on the ground that
			<lb />
			it was not maintainable;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) The power to order a provisional attachment of the property of the taxable
			<lb />
			person including a bank account is draconian in nature and the conditions
			<lb />
			which are prescribed by the statute for a valid exercise of the power must
			<lb />
			be strictly fulfilled;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v)
			<lb />
			The exercise of the power for ordering a provisional attachment must be
			<lb />
			preceded by the formation of an opinion by the Commissioner that it is
			<lb />
			necessary so to do for the purpose of protecting the interest of the
			<lb />
			government revenue. Before ordering a provisional attachment the
			<lb />
			Commissioner must form an opinion on the basis of tangible material that
			<lb />
			the assessee is likely to defeat the demand, if any, and that therefore, it is
			<lb />
			necessary so to do for the purpose of protecting the interest of the
			<lb />
			government revenue.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi) The expression &quot;necessary so to do for protecting the government
			<lb />
			revenue&quot; implicates that the interests of the government revenue cannot be
			<lb />
			protected without ordering a provisional attachment;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vii) The formation of an opinion by the Commissioner under Section 83(1)
			<lb />
			must be based on tangible material bearing on the necessity of ordering a
			<lb />
			provisional attachment for the purpose of protecting the interest of the
			<lb />
			government revenue;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(viii) In the facts of the present case, there was a clear non-application of mind
			<lb />
			by the Joint Commissioner to the provisions of Section 83, rendering the
			<lb />
			provisional attachment illegal;
			<lb />
			(ix) Under the provisions of Rule 159(5), the person whose property is
			<lb />
			attached is entitled to dual procedural safeguards:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a)
			<lb />
			An entitlement to submit objections on the ground that the property
			<lb />
			was or is not liable to attachment; and
			<lb />
			(b)
			<lb />
			An opportunity of being heard;
			<lb />
			There has been a breach of the mandatory requirement of Rule 159(5) and
			<lb />
			the Commissioner was clearly misconceived in law in coming into
			<lb />
			conclusion that he had a discretion on whether or not to grant an
			<lb />
			opportunity of being heard;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(x)
			<lb />
			The Commissioner is duty bound to deal with the objections to the
			<lb />
			attachment by passing a reasoned order which must be communicated to
			<lb />
			the taxable person whose property is attached;
			<lb />
			(xi) A final order having been passed under Section 74(9), the proceedings
			<lb />
			under Section 74 are no longer pending as a result of which the provisional
			<lb />
			attachment must come to an end; and
			<lb />
			(xii) The appellant having filed an appeal against the order under section 74(9),
			<lb />
			the provisions of sub-Sections 6 and 7 of Section 107 will come into
			<lb />
			operation in regard to the payment of the tax and stay on the recovery of
			<lb />
			the balance as stipulated in those provisions, pending the disposal of the
			<lb />
			appeal.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			73
			<lb />
			For the above reasons, we allow the appeal and set aside the impugned
			<lb />
			judgment and order of the High Court dated 1 January 2021.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			74
			<lb />
			The writ petition filed by the appellant under Article 226 of the Constitution
			<lb />
			shall stand allowed by setting aside the orders of provisional attachment dated
			<lb />
			October 2020.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			75
			<lb />
			There shall be no order as to costs. Pending application(s), if any, stand
			<lb />
			disposed of.
