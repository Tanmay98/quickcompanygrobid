				of Minutes of Meeting of the Recommendation Committee held on 17 th
				<lb />
				September, 2014 was handed over to respondents&apos; counsel to clarify as to
				<lb />

				<lb />
			</p>

				3. On behalf of respondent, it is maintained that the requisite

				<lb />
				the application seeking allotment of alternate plot.
