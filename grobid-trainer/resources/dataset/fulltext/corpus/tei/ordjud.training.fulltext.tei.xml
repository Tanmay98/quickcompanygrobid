		<p>
			ORAL JUDGMENT :-
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			1.
			<lb />
			Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith. Heard finally with
			<lb />
			the consent of both the sides.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2.
			<lb />
			The petitioners have challenged the impugned order passed
			<lb />
			below exhibit 1 in R.C.S. No. 144 of 2008 by 2 nd Joint Civil Judge,
			<lb />
			Junior Division at Kannad.
			<lb />
		</p>


		<p>
			3.
			<lb />
			Mr. Sonpethkar, learned counsel for the petitioners invited
			<lb />
			my attention to the impugned order and submitted that the suit
			<lb />
			was fixed for final argument. The trial Court has framed additional
			<lb />
			issues 6-A and 6-B without giving an opportunity of being heard to
			<lb />
			either side. It has caused serious prejudice to the rights and
			<lb />
			interest of the parties. He submitted that the Court has ample
			<lb />
			power to frame additional issues or strike out any issue even
			<lb />
			before passing the decree. But that exercise needs to be done after
			<lb />
			giving an opportunity of hearing to both the sides. He submitted
			<lb />
			that the suit came to be adjourned on number of occasions for final
			<lb />
			arguments and all of a sudden, this impugned order regarding
			<lb />
			framing of additional issues came to be passed by the trial Court.
			<lb />
			The impugned order below exhibit 1 in R.C.S. No. 144 of 2008
			<lb />
			does not sustain in the eyes of law and it needs to be quashed and
			<lb />
			set aside.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4.
			<lb />
			Mr. Palsikar, learned counsel for respondent no.1 /
			<lb />
			contesting party vehemently submitted that the suit is old one. The
			<lb />
			Court has given sufficient opportunity and thereafter passed the
			<lb />
			impugned order and framed two additional issues after taking into
			<lb />
			consideration the amendment made in the plaint. He has also
			<lb />
			invited my attention to the copy of plaint, more particularly para
			<lb />
			no. 3-a and 4-a. He submitted that the additional issues came to be
			<lb />
			framed in order to cover the entire controversy between the parties
			<lb />
			and to have a finding on it. No injustice is caused to the
			<lb />
			petitioners. He supported the impugned order passed by the trial
			<lb />
			Court.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5.
			<lb />
			I have considered the submissions of the learned counsel
			<lb />
			for both the sides. I have also gone through the provisions of Order
			<lb />
			XV Rule 1 and Rule 5 of the Civil Procedure Code. There cannot
			<lb />
			be a debate that the trial Court has ample power to frame
			<lb />
			additional issues as well as strike out any issue before passing the
			<lb />
			decree. That exercise needs to be done in order to decide the
			<lb />
			controversy between the parties completely and finally. Order XV
			<lb />
			Rule 1 speaks that framing of issues is not an empty formality. The
			<lb />
			trial Court is required to hear both the parties before framing
			<lb />
			issues or additional issues. That exercise is important.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6.
			<lb />
			On perusing the impugned order, it is very much clear that
			<lb />
			the trial Court has framed two additional issues 6-A and 6-B when
			<lb />
			the suit was fixed for final argument. It further appears from the
			<lb />
			impugned order that opportunity of hearing is not given to both
			<lb />
			the sides before framing additional issues. The impugned order has
			<lb />
			certainly caused prejudice to the rights and interest to both the
			<lb />
			sides. It was very much necessary on the part of the learned trial
			<lb />
			Judge to extend an opportunity of being heard to both the sides
			<lb />
			before framing additional issues in view of the provisions of Order
			<lb />
			XV Rule 1 and Rule 5 of the Civil Procedure Code. Framing of
			<lb />
			issues is a very important stage of Civil trial. It is imperative for a
			<lb />
			trial Court Judge to critically examine the pleadings of the parties
			<lb />
			before framing of issues. Order XIV Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure
			<lb />
			Code allows the trial Court Judge to go to the genesis of the lis and
			<lb />
			narrow down or even eliminate the controversy. For that exercise,
			<lb />
			opportunity must be given to both the sides to assist the Court to
			<lb />
			narrow down the controversy.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			8.
			<lb />
			Certainly, the impugned order does not sustain in the eyes
			<lb />
			of law. It has caused serious prejudice to both parties to the suit.
			<lb />
			The impugned order needs to be quashed and set aside. It is
			<lb />
			necessary to issue directions to the trial Court to hear all the
			<lb />
			parties and then frame additional issues, if any, in order to cover
			<lb />
			the entire controversy between the parties. With this, I conclude
			<lb />
			and proceed to pass the following order.
			<lb />
		</p>
