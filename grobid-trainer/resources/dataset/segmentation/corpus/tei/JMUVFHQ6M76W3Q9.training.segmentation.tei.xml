			ORDER (ORAL)
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			The second respondent was married to the first petitioner as per
			<lb />
			Hindu rites and ceremonies on 29.05.2010. On 22.03.2013, she lodged
			<lb />
			first information report (FIR) No. 141/2013 under Sections 498A, 406,
			<lb />
			34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) of Police Station Krishna Nagar
			<lb />
			against her husband (first petitioner) and his mother (second
			<lb />
			petitioner). On conclusion of the investigation, police filed report
			<lb />
			under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr. PC)
			<lb />
			on which cognizance was taken, the said matter being pending on the
			<lb />
			file of the Metropolitan Magistrate. The parties were also locked-in
			<lb />
			various other cases including maintenance petition under Section 125
			<lb />
			of Cr.P.C. (petition No.63/2014) and a case under the Protection of
			<lb />
			Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (Case No.7186/2016)

			filed by second respondent and three criminal cases filed by first
			<lb />
			petitioner against second respondent, they being FIR No.419/2012 in
			<lb />
			District Palwal; complaint case No.307/2015 also before a court in
			<lb />
			District Palwal and FIR No.458/2015 in District Rewari, besides a
			<lb />
			revision petition and a petition under section 482 of Cr.P.C.
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			The parties entered into a Compromise Deed of 26.08.2016
			<lb />
			whereby they agreed to resolve the disputes amicably and withdraw
			<lb />
			the cases against each other.
			<lb />
			3.
			<lb />
			The petition, thus, has been moved before this court invoking
			<lb />
			Article 227 of the Constitution of India and Section 482 Cr. PC
			<lb />
			seeking quashing of the FIR 141/2013 under Sections 498A, 406, 34
			<lb />
			of Indian Penal Code, 1860 of Police Station Krishna Nagar.
			<lb />
			4.
			<lb />
			The second respondent on being served with the notice has
			<lb />
			entered appearance appeared and has sworn an affidavit on 29.11.2018
			<lb />
			confirming the settlement and giving no objection to the prayer for
			<lb />
			quashing of the FIR No.141/2013 under Sections 498A, 406, 34 of
			<lb />
			Indian Penal Code, 1860 of Police Station Krishna Nagar. By the said
			<lb />
			affidavit, she has confirmed the statement of the petitioner that her
			<lb />
			marriage with petitioner has been dissolved by a decree of divorce
			<lb />
			granted by family court at Palwal. The second respondent has
			<lb />
			furnished the proof of identity in the form of copy of Aadhar Card.
			<lb />
			5.
			<lb />
			Pertinent to note here that offence under Section 498A IPC is
			<lb />
			not compoundable. The parties are constrained to move this court for

			quashing on the basis of amicable resolution arrived at by them in the
			<lb />
			facts and circumstances noted above.
			<lb />
			6.
			<lb />
			The scope and ambit of the power conferred on this court by
			<lb />
			Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr. PC) read
			<lb />
			with Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, in the particular
			<lb />
			context of prayer for quashing criminal proceedings, was examined by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court in B.S. Joshi and Ors. Vs. State of Haryana and
			<lb />
			Anr., (2003) 4 SCC 675, against the backdrop of a catena of earlier
			<lb />
			decisions. Noting, with reference to the decision in State of
			<lb />
			Karnakata Vs. L Muniswamy, (1977) 2 SCC 699, that in exercise of
			<lb />
			this &quot;inherent&quot; and &quot;wholesome power&quot;, the touchstone is as to
			<lb />
			whether &quot;the ends of justice so require&quot;, and it was observed thus :
			<lb />
			&quot;10. ... that in a criminal case, the veiled object
			<lb />
			behind a lame prosecution, the very nature of the
			<lb />
			material on which the structure of the prosecution
			<lb />
			rests and the like would justify the High Court in
			<lb />
			quashing the proceeding in the interest of justice and
			<lb />
			that the ends of justice are higher than the ends of
			<lb />
			mere law though justice had got to be administered
			<lb />
			according to laws made by the legislature. ...that the
			<lb />
			compelling necessity for making these observations is
			<lb />
			that without a proper realization of the object and
			<lb />
			purpose of the provision which seeks to save the
			<lb />
			inherent powers of the High Court to do justice
			<lb />
			between the State and its subjects, it would be
			<lb />
			impossible to appreciate the width and contours of
			<lb />
			that salient jurisdiction.&quot;

			<lb />
			The Supreme Court in B.S. Joshi (supra) further noted as
			<lb />
			under :-
			<lb />
			&quot;What would happen to the trial of the case where
			<lb />
			the wife does not support the imputations made in
			<lb />
			the FIR of the type in question. As earlier noticed,
			<lb />
			now she has filed an affidavit that the FIR was
			<lb />
			registered at her instance due to temperamental
			<lb />
			differences and implied imputations. There may be
			<lb />
			many reasons for not supporting the imputations.
			<lb />
			It may be either for the reason that she has
			<lb />
			resolved disputes with her husband and his other
			<lb />
			family members and as a result thereof she has
			<lb />
			again started living with her husband with whom
			<lb />
			she earlier had differences or she has willingly
			<lb />
			parted company and is living happily on her own
			<lb />
			or has married someone else on the earlier
			<lb />
			marriage having been dissolved by divorce on
			<lb />
			consent of parties or fails to support the
			<lb />
			prosecution on some other similar grounds. In
			<lb />
			such eventuality, there would almost be no chance
			<lb />
			of conviction. Would it then be proper to decline to
			<lb />
			exercise power of quashing on the ground that it
			<lb />
			would be permitting the parties to compound non-
			<lb />
			compoundable offences? The answer clearly has to
			<lb />
			be in the &quot;negative&quot;. It would, however, be a
			<lb />
			different matter if the High Court on facts declines
			<lb />
			the prayer for quashing for any valid reasons
			<lb />
			including lack of bona fides.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			8.
			<lb />
			Holding that &quot;special features in ...matrimonial matters are
			<lb />
			evident&quot; and that it is &quot;the duty of the court to encourage genuine
			<lb />
			settlements of matrimonial disputes&quot;, referring to Madhavrao

			Jiwajirao Scindia Vs. Sambhajirao Chandrojiroo Angre, (1988) 1
			<lb />
			SCC 692, it was further observed that :
			<lb />
			&quot;11. ... Where, in the opinion of the court, chances
			<lb />
			of an ultimate conviction are bleak and, therefore,
			<lb />
			no useful purpose is likely to be served by allowing
			<lb />
			a criminal prosecution to continue, the court may,
			<lb />
			while taking into consideration the special facts of
			<lb />
			a case, also quash the proceedings.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			9.
			<lb />
			In Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab and Anr. (2012) 10 SCC 303,
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court contrasted the request for quashing of criminal
			<lb />
			proceedings on the basis of settlement with the possibility of
			<lb />
			compounding of an offence and observed thus :-
			<lb />
			&quot;57. Quashing of offence or criminal proceedings
			<lb />
			on the ground of settlement between an offender
			<lb />
			and victim is not the same thing as compounding of
			<lb />
			offence. They are different and not interchangeable.
			<lb />
			Strictly speaking, the power of compounding of
			<lb />
			offences given to a court under Section 320 is
			<lb />
			materially different from the quashing of criminal
			<lb />
			proceedings by the High Court in exercise of its
			<lb />
			inherent jurisdiction. In compounding of offences,
			<lb />
			power of a criminal court is circumscribed by the
			<lb />
			provisions contained in Section 320 and the court is
			<lb />
			guided solely and squarely thereby while, on the
			<lb />
			other hand, the formation of opinion by the High
			<lb />
			Court for quashing a criminal offence or criminal
			<lb />
			proceeding or criminal complaint is guided by the
			<lb />
			material on record as to whether the ends of justice
			<lb />
			would justify such exercise of power although the
			<lb />
			ultimate consequence may be acquittal or dismissal
			<lb />
			of indictment.&quot;

			<lb />
			10. The above views in the context of matrimonial disputes
			<lb />
			resulting in criminal proceedings have been consistently followed over
			<lb />
			the years, as may be further illustrated by the decision of a bench of
			<lb />
			three Hon&apos;ble Judges of the Supreme Court in Jitendra Raghuvanshi
			<lb />
			and Ors. Vs. Babita Raghuvanshi and Anr., (2013) 4 SCC 58, the
			<lb />
			following observations summarising the philosophy succinctly :-
			<lb />
			&quot;15. In our view, it is the duty of the courts to
			<lb />
			encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial
			<lb />
			disputes, particularly, when the same are on
			<lb />
			considerable increase. Even if the offences are non-
			<lb />
			compoundable, if they relate to matrimonial disputes
			<lb />
			and the Court is satisfied that the parties have settled
			<lb />
			the same amicably and without any pressure, we hold
			<lb />
			that for the purpose of securing ends of justice,
			<lb />
			Section 320 of the Code would not be a bar to the
			<lb />
			exercise of power of quashing of FIR, complaint or
			<lb />
			the subsequent criminal proceedings.
			<lb />
			16. There has been an outburst of matrimonial
			<lb />
			disputes in recent times. The institution of marriage
			<lb />
			occupies an important place and it has an important
			<lb />
			role to play in the society. Therefore, every effort
			<lb />
			should be made in the interest of the individuals in
			<lb />
			order to enable them to settle down in life and live
			<lb />
			peacefully. If the parties ponder over their defaults
			<lb />
			and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual
			<lb />
			agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law,
			<lb />
			in order to do complete justice in the matrimonial
			<lb />
			matters, the courts should be less hesitant in
			<lb />
			exercising their extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite
			<lb />
			to state that the power under Section 482 should be
			<lb />
			exercised sparingly and with circumspection only
			<lb />
			when the Court is convinced, on the basis of material
			<lb />

			on record, that allowing the proceedings to continue
			<lb />
			would be an abuse of process of court or that the ends
			<lb />
			of justice require that the proceedings ought to be
			<lb />
			quashed...&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			11. In a case where criminal proceedings arise essentially out of
			<lb />
			matrimonial dispute and the parties have decided to bury the hatchet,
			<lb />
			the court must examine if there is any likelihood of the criminal
			<lb />
			prosecution resulting in conviction. In fact-situation wherein the
			<lb />
			matrimonial relation has been brought to an end by mutual consent
			<lb />
			and the parties are eager to move on with their respective lives seeking
			<lb />
			closure and if there is nothing to indicate lack of bonafide on the part
			<lb />
			of any side, denial of the prayer for quashing the criminal case would
			<lb />
			restore acrimony rather than bring about peace. Allowing continuance
			<lb />
			of the criminal action would be fruitless and clearly an abuse of
			<lb />
			judicial process.
			<lb />
			12. The case at hand passes the muster of the above-noted tests.
			<lb />
			13. In the above facts and circumstances, the petition is allowed.
			<lb />
			The crime registered by the police vide FIR No.141/2013 under
			<lb />
			Sections 498A, 406, 34 IPC of Police Station Krishna Nagar and the
			<lb />
			proceedings emanating therefrom are hereby quashed.
			<lb />
			14. The petition is disposed of accordingly.
