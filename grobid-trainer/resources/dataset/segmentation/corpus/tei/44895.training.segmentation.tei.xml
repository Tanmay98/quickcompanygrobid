			<lb />
			3. The case of the plaintiff is as follows:
			<lb />
			(a) that he founded a proprietary concern, originally known as Eagle Engineering
			<lb />
			Works and now known as Eagle Osteon Technologies, in the year 1968, in the field of
			<lb />
			Precision Engineering;
			<lb />
			(b) that by tireless efforts and investment for over two decades, the plaintiff
			<lb />
			invented a wide range of Prosthesis for Limb Salvage surgery, for different parts of the
			<lb />
			human anatomy, which have been given the name &quot;Custom Mega Prosthesis&quot;;
			<lb />
			(c) that different types of Custom Mega Prosthesis for different parts of human
			<lb />
			anatomy were developed by the plaintiff to replace bone defects in the anatomical areas
			<lb />
			of the shoulder, hip, elbow, wrist, knee, ankle, pelvic region, etc.;
			<lb />
			(d) that this Custom Mega Prosthesis (hereinafter referred to as &quot;CMP&quot;) is made of
			<lb />
			titanium alloy or medical grade stainless steel;
			<lb />
			(e) that the development and perfection of the technology was achieved by the
			<lb />
			plaintiff through lot of sacrifices and compromises, and was achieved through surgical
			<lb />
			Oncology and Precision Engineering expertise;
			<lb />
			(f) that the plaintiff got Patents and Designs registered for about 15 kinds of CMPs
			<lb />
			invented and developed by him;
			<lb />
			(g) that there are many unique unparalleled and unprecedented features for the
			<lb />
			CMPs invented by him, such as (1) the use of polymer components as journal bearings
			<lb />
			which reduce wear and tear by 90% and give smooth and free articulation of the joints;
			<lb />
			(2) the use of rotating hinge mechanism, which, by allowing a constrained radial freedom
			<lb />
			between the two bones which mate with the prosthesis, reduces to a large extent the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			3
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			stress in the bones and joints due to asymmetrical loading in the normal course of
			<lb />
			functioning; (3) the use of extending mechanism by which the prosthesis can be made to
			<lb />
			expand in-situ after surgery to compensate growth of symmetrical bone in the other
			<lb />
			limb, suitable for young patients and (4) the use of the pivotal hinge and thrust bearing
			<lb />
			pad mechanism which provide friction free articulation;
			<lb />
			(h) that the plaintiff has been manufacturing, marketing and selling various CMPs
			<lb />
			through another proprietary concern by name Arc Bio-Mechanical Engineers;
			<lb />
			(i) that Professor Mayilvahanan Natarajan, who is involved in developing and
			<lb />
			improvising the concept of limb salvage custom Prosthesis, is a Co-Patentee for the CMPs
			<lb />
			and the company Arc Bio-Mechanical Engineers has been supplying CMPs since the year
			<lb />
			1992;
			<lb />
			(j) that Professor Mayilvahanan Natarajan, co-owner of the Patent and Design in
			<lb />
			&quot;Distal Femoral Prosthesis&quot;, has nothing to do with commercial aspects/dealings;
			<lb />
			(k) that the total sales of knee joint CMPs in terms of quantity was 57 in 2001-02,
			<lb />
			81 in 2002-03, 91 in 2003-04, 89 in 2004-05 and 60 in 2005-06;
			<lb />
			(l) that the sales of knee joint CMP in terms of turn over was Rs.21,19,400/-in
			<lb />
			2001-02, Rs.31,99,550/-in 2002-03, Rs.38,02,450/-in 2003-04, Rs.34,16,000/-in

		<body>
			and Rs.33,658/-in 2005-06;
			<lb />
			(p) that the plaintiff is the recipient of several prestigious and meritorious awards
			<lb />
			for his work in the field of CMP;
			<lb />
			(q) that these awards include (i) Technology Day Award 2006, conferred by
			<lb />
			Technology Development Board, Department of Science and Technology, Government of
			<lb />
			India; (ii) National Award of Excellence presented in IOACON 2003; and (iii) L-Ramp
			<lb />
			Award of Excellence 2006 by the IIT, Madras and L-Ramp Foundation, USA;
			<lb />
			(r) that the plaintiff, along with Professor Mayilvahanan Natarajan was assigned
			<lb />
			Patent Nos.196333, 198869 and 198872 respectively dated 05.9.2003, 30.12.2002 and
			<lb />
			02.11.2001;
			<lb />
			(s) that while Patent No.196333 is in respect of &quot;Distal Femoral Prosthesis with
			<lb />
			Thrust Bearing Pad and Rotating Axis Mechanism&quot;, Patent No.198869 is in respect of
			<lb />
			&quot;Proximal Tibial Prosthesis with Weight Bearing Polymer Pad Mechanism&quot; and Patent
			<lb />
			No.198872 is for &quot;Proximal Tibial Prosthesis&quot;;
			<lb />
			(t) that all the above 3 CMPs are different versions of &quot;Knee Joint Prosthesis&quot;,
			<lb />
			since they all pertain to knee joint replacement;
			<lb />
			(u) that Distal Femoral Prosthesis, which is a variant of the Knee Joint Prosthesis,
			<lb />
			is designed to replace that portion of the femoral bone adjoining the knee joint and
			<lb />
			inclusive of the knee joint;
			<lb />
			(w) that the Proximal Tibial Prosthesis, which is another variant of CMP-KJP, is
			<lb />
			designed to replace a section of tibial bone, along with knee joint;
			<lb />
			(x) that these inventions not only mimic the physiological action of the distal part
			<lb />
			of the femoral bone, but also preserve the same;
			<lb />
			(y) that the speciality of CMP-KJP is in its shape, size and configuration, which
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			5
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			match in profile the anatomic region of the distal femur;
			<lb />
			(z) that one of the unique features of CMP-KJP is a Pivotal Hinge Mechanism, with
			<lb />
			a bio-compatible polymer journal bearing, which imparts friction free articulation motion
			<lb />
			of the knee joint;
			<lb />
			(aa) that by the above mechanism, a maximum flexion of about 140Â° to the dorsal
			<lb />
			side of the Prosthesis is achieved;
			<lb />
			(ab) that the durability of the implant is increased by the Thrust Bearing Pad
			<lb />
			Mechanism, which reduce the frictional wear between the metallic surfaces and by
			<lb />
			relocating the load transmitted to the pivot pin and the tibial component on weight
			<lb />
			bearing;
			<lb />
			(ac) that the CMP-KJP have each been registered under the Designs Act, 2000;
			<lb />
			(ad) that the plaintiff and Professor Mayilvahanan Natarajan were jointly assigned
			<lb />
			Design No.191946 dated 24.4.2003 in respect of Distal Femoral Prosthesis, Design
			<lb />
			No.189140 dated 23.5.2002 for Proximal Tibial Prosthesis and Design No.204684 dated
			<lb />
			07.6.2006 for Proximal Tibial Prosthesis with Weight Bearing Polymer Pad Mechanism;
			<lb />
			(ae) that the novelty of the design of CMP-KJP lies in its shape and configuration
			<lb />
			and it is designed in such a way to be a perfect replacement for the bone which is
			<lb />
			removed;
			<lb />
			(af) that the plaintiff and his proprietary concern have been purchasing titanium
			<lb />
			and its alloy mill products from the first defendant since 1992;
			<lb />
			(ag) that the first defendant is the sole producer of titanium and its alloy mill
			<lb />
			products and they enjoy monopoly status and they are fully aware of the product line of
			<lb />
			the plaintiff;
			<lb />
			(ah) that the plaintiff and his proprietary concern have been supplying CMP to the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			6
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			fourth defendant, on indent from them and on the clinical specifications of Mayilvahanan
			<lb />
			Natarajan;
			<lb />
			(ai) that the fourth defendant Institute has also published research articles in
			<lb />
			reputed International and Indian Medical Journals evaluating the plaintiff&apos;s CMP, including
			<lb />
			CMP-KJP;
			<lb />
			(aj) that the plaintiff and his proprietary concern have also been supplying CMP to
			<lb />
			the third defendant through its patients since 1996 and directly to the hospital of the
			<lb />
			third defendant through purchase indents and purchase orders since 2002, on the clinical
			<lb />
			specifications provided by Professor Mayilvahanan Natarajan;
			<lb />
			(ak) that the plaintiff had been the sole supplier of wide range of CMPs to the
			<lb />
			fourth defendant, but the demand started declining slowly over the years and also
			<lb />
			suddenly stopped without any reason;
			<lb />
			(al) that the plaintiff then came across a newspaper article dated 13.02.2004 in the
			<lb />
			Hyderabad Edition of the National Daily &quot;The Hindu&quot;, wherein it was claimed that an
			<lb />
			operation had been performed at the second defendant hospital, removing and replacing
			<lb />
			the cancer infested bone and knee joint of a 18 year old boy with a Prosthesis developed
			<lb />
			by Engineers of the first defendant&apos;s Bio-medical Division;
			<lb />
			(am) that the article claimed that the Prosthesis was developed in India for the
			<lb />
			first time and named as Apollo-Midhani Prosthesis;
			<lb />
			(an) that the plaintiff had no occasion to look into the product, as they are custom
			<lb />
			made;
			<lb />
			(ao) that in such circumstances, a candidate approached the plaintiff in the last
			<lb />
			week of May 2006, seeking employment;
			<lb />
			(ap) that while perusing the credentials of the candidate, it was found that that
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			7
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			candidate did a project titled &quot;Design of Custom Made Hinge Knee Rotational Joint and its
			<lb />
			Study&quot; during 2005-06, when he was a student of Bio-Medical Engineering;
			<lb />
			(aq) that he had done the project under the supervision of one P.Amma Rao,
			<lb />
			Department Head of Bio-Medical Division of the first defendant and had obtained a
			<lb />
			certificate for the project from the Deputy General Manager (Training and Development)
			<lb />
			of the first defendant, by name Mr.C.Sridhar;
			<lb />
			(ar) that upon perusing the project papers, the plaintiff was shocked to find that
			<lb />
			the project was done on a Prosthesis which is an absolute and slavish replica of the DFP
			<lb />
			invented by the plaintiff and over which the plaintiff has valid subsisting Patent and
			<lb />
			Design Registration;
			<lb />
			(as) that immediately, the plaintiff issued a cease and desist notice dated
			<lb />
			01.9.2006 to defendants 1, 2 and 4;
			<lb />
			(at) that the first defendant sent a reply dated 22.9.2006 seeking copies of
			<lb />
			relevant documents, without answering the issues;
			<lb />
			(au) that the other defendants did not respond to the notice;
			<lb />
			(av) that thereafter, the plaintiff made enquiries and found out that the first
			<lb />
			defendant has not obtained registration of any Patent or Design for any Prosthesis; and
			<lb />
			(aw) that therefore, the plaintiff has come up with the above suit.
			<lb />
			4. Before proceeding to look into the written statement, I must bring on record two
			<lb />
			facts. One is that in paragraph 6 of the plaint, the plaintiff has presented in a tabular
			<lb />
			form, the various kinds of Prosthesis, in respect of which, he had obtained the
			<lb />
			registration of Patents and/or Designs. The tabular from contains a list of 15 Prosthesis.
			<lb />
			Out of those 15 Prosthesis, the plaintiff has obtained registration of both Patent as well as
			<lb />
			Design only in respect of 5 Prosthesis. In respect of 10 Prosthesis, he has not obtained
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			8
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			registration of Patent. But, he has obtained registration of Design in respect of all the 15
			<lb />
			Prosthesis.
			<lb />
			5. The second thing to be taken note of before taking up the written statements for
			<lb />
			consideration is the fact that though the plaintiff has patent and design registrations for
			<lb />
			various types of Prosthesis, he has confined the suit only to 3 Patents bearing Nos.
			<lb />
			196333, 198872 and 198869 and 3 Designs bearing Nos.191946, 189140 and 204684.
			<lb />
			6. The reliefs sought by the plaintiff, in brief, are as follows:
			<lb />
			(i) a decree of perpetual injunction to restrain the defendants from in any manner
			<lb />
			infringing Patent Nos.196333, 198872 and 198869 or in any manner using any part of
			<lb />
			the said Patent specifications for making/manufacturing any prosthesis or using the said
			<lb />
			Patents for improvements in relation to the manufacture of any prosthesis;
			<lb />
			(ii) a decree of perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from using any
			<lb />
			process within the range, scope or purview of the three Patents;
			<lb />
			(iii) a decree of perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from making,
			<lb />
			manufacturing, selling or offering for sale any Prosthesis which uses the claims in the
			<lb />
			specifications of the three Patents bearing Nos.196333, 198872 and 198869;
			<lb />
			(iv) delivery of all apparatus relating to the manufacture of any Prosthesis which
			<lb />
			infringes Patent Nos.196333, 198872 and 198869 and Design Nos.191946, 189140 and
			<lb />
			204684;
			<lb />
			(v) a decree of perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from dealing with
			<lb />
			any Prosthesis which uses or utilises the claims and representations of the plaintiff&apos;s
			<lb />
			Design Nos.191946, 189140 and 204684 or which comes within the range, scope and
			<lb />
			purview of the said designs; and
			<lb />
			(vi) directing the defendants to render true, fair and faithful accounts in respect of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			9
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the invention manufactured, used and sold by the defendants, which infringed and
			<lb />
			continue to infringe the Patents of the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			7. The first defendant has filed a written statement contending inter alia -
			<lb />
			(a) that it is a Public Sector Enterprise registered as a Government Company under
			<lb />
			Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956, under the administrative control of the
			<lb />
			Department of Defence Production, Ministry of Defence, for the manufacture of special
			<lb />
			metals and super alloys to meet the requirements of Defence, Aero Space, Atomic
			<lb />
			Energy, electronics and other strategic industries;
			<lb />
			(b) that by a Memorandum of Understanding entered into with the Government of
			<lb />
			India, the first defendant undertook Corporate Social Responsibility to serve the society;
			<lb />
			(c) that as part of CSR initiative, the first defendant developed various Prosthesis
			<lb />
			having higher strength and light weight, using titanium material, with a view to provide
			<lb />
			Prosthesis at affordable costs to cancer patients in India;
			<lb />
			(d) that the said CSR initiative of the first defendant was undertaken at the
			<lb />
			instance of Mr.A.P.J.Abdul Kalam, the then President of India, who was its Scientific
			<lb />
			Advisor before becoming the President of India;
			<lb />
			(e) that since Prosthesis is used as implant in cancer patients, it is a life saving
			<lb />
			drug which is out of the purview of Patents regime;
			<lb />
			(f) that the first defendant has supplied Prosthesis only to cancer patients and to
			<lb />
			no one else;
			<lb />
			(g) that the first defendant is not involved in the manufacture and supply of
			<lb />
			Proximal Tibial Prosthesis covered by Patent No.198872 and Proximal Tibial Prosthesis
			<lb />
			with Weight Bearing Polymer Pad Mechanism covered by Patent No.198869;
			<lb />
			(h) that in response to the cease and desist notice issued by the plaintiff, the first
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			10
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			defendant demanded the production of copies of certain documents, but the plaintiff did
			<lb />
			not supply the same on the ground that they are already in public domain;
			<lb />
			(i) that the Distal Femoral Prosthesis was first developed by Howmedica Inc,
			<lb />
			Rutherford, New Jersy, USA, way back in 1982;
			<lb />
			(j) that the plaintiff did not invent a wide range of Prosthesis;
			<lb />
			(k) that there is no comparison of CMPs referred to by the plaintiff with the Hinged
			<lb />
			Knee Prosthesis manufactured by the first defendant;
			<lb />
			(l) that the Hinged part is like simple knuckle joint mentioned in the text books on
			<lb />
			&quot;Theory of Machines&quot;;
			<lb />
			(m) that the knuckle part has been modified to the condylar shape of the femoral
			<lb />
			bone;
			<lb />
			(n) that femoral and tibial bones are provided with collar to seat the knee
			<lb />
			assembly;
			<lb />
			(o) that the first defendant manufactures femoral and tibial components as an
			<lb />
			integral part equal to the re-sected bone and matching to the anatomy of the patients;
			<lb />
			(p) that there are distinguishing features between the plaintiff&apos;s CMP and the
			<lb />
			Hinged Knee Prosthesis manufactured by the first defendant, in as much as the first
			<lb />
			defendant&apos;s prosthesis does not contain a polymer component, it does not have a
			<lb />
			rotating hinged mechanism or mechanism for femoral piece, its condylar head and
			<lb />
			femoral stem is of monolithic design manufactured as an integral part through a special
			<lb />
			forging process to ensure superior strength and metallurgical reliability, the joint is
			<lb />
			hinged through hinge pin and locking hole provided to facilitate locking of the nail on
			<lb />
			cortex of bone using a locking bolt to prevent rotation in the bone cavity.
			<lb />
			(q) that it is true that the first defendant is supplying titanium and its alloy mill
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			11
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			products to the plaintiff from 1992;
			<lb />
			(r) that the first defendant started its own supplies of titanium implants and
			<lb />
			Prosthesis since 1997, but continued the supply of titanium raw material to the plaintiff
			<lb />
			till 2004;
			<lb />
			(s) that the first defendant developed standard Knee Prosthesis in 1997, based on
			<lb />
			the inputs made available by hospitals and surgeons;
			<lb />
			(t) that the Hinged Knee Prosthesis with titanium metal was developed for a cancer
			<lb />
			patient of the second respondent with the active involvement of the Orthopaedic
			<lb />
			surgeons there and hence, it was named as &quot;Apollo-MIDHANI Prosthesis&quot;;
			<lb />
			(u) that the design of the Prosthesis manufactured by the first defendant is distinct
			<lb />
			from the design of the plaintiff&apos;s product;
			<lb />
			(v) that the distinction in the design can be summarised as follows:
			<lb />
			&quot;Condylar Head and Femoral Stem of the 1 st defendant&apos;s
			<lb />
			prosthesis is of a monolithic design manufactured as an integral part
			<lb />
			through a special forging process, in order to ensure superior
			<lb />
			strength and metallurgical reliability. As against this, the plaintiff
			<lb />
			prosthesis is of a two-piece design, which is easier to fabricate. There
			<lb />
			are, however susceptible to failure under stresses at the mechanical
			<lb />
			joint. This is a major design difference between and two, also being
			<lb />
			reflected in performance&quot;.
			<lb />
			(w) that this defendant developed Knee Prosthesis in several variants much before
			<lb />
			the plaintiff patented the Prosthesis;
			<lb />
			(x) that the first defendant has had technical interactions with Dr.Mayilvahanan
			<lb />
			Natarajan and the surgeons of the fourth respondent Institute, when the first defendant
			<lb />
			was requested to develop special Prosthesis for the surgeries conducted even by
			<lb />
			Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan;
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			12
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			(y) that on two occasions, the first defendant developed a total Femoral Bone
			<lb />
			replacement with titanium Prosthesis and 316 LVM Femoral Head, when Dr.Mayilvahanan
			<lb />
			Natarajan performed surgeries;
			<lb />
			(z) that therefore Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan was well aware of the manufacture
			<lb />
			of the Prosthesis by the first defendant and he did not object to the same, despite being
			<lb />
			the co-owner and Co-Patentee;
			<lb />
			(aa) that Prosthesis is treated as a drug by the Drugs Control Department and
			<lb />
			hence, it would be out of the purview of the Patent regime;
			<lb />
			(ab) that while the plaintiff charges about Rs.1,36,000/-for each Prosthesis
			<lb />
			supplied by him, the first defendant charges only Rs.39,200/-for the Prosthesis supplied
			<lb />
			to the fourth defendant, clearly showing thereby that the first defendant was not
			<lb />
			attempting to enrich themselves unjustly, at the cost of the plaintiff;
			<lb />
			(ac) that while the first defendant&apos;s main line of business is the manufacture and
			<lb />
			supply of strategic materials to defence, space and nuclear sectors, they undertook the
			<lb />
			task of developing titanium implants and Prosthesis only as a CSR initiative, so that, they
			<lb />
			are available to common man at affordable cost;
			<lb />
			(ad) that titanium implants, which were earlier available only to the affluent people
			<lb />
			at Super Speciality Hospitals, have now become available to the common man; and
			<lb />
			(ae) that therefore, the suit deserves to be dismissed.
			<lb />
			8. The defendants 2 and 3 have filed a brief written statement. Apart from denying
			<lb />
			all the allegations contained in the plaint, defendants 2 and 3 have claimed in their
			<lb />
			written statement the following:
			<lb />
			(a) that the suit is bad for non-joinder of the Co-Patentee Dr.Mayilvahanan
			<lb />
			Natarajan;

			(b) that defendants 2 and 3 are not engaged in the manufacture of Prosthesis, but
			<lb />
			allowed Doctors and patients to buy Prosthesis from manufacturers of their choice, since
			<lb />
			Prosthesis is not something which is available over the counter, but it is custom made for
			<lb />
			every patient;
			<lb />
			(c) that the Custom Made Prosthesis are available in several countries for over
			<lb />
			several decades and some of the patients, who come to the hospitals of defendants 2 and
			<lb />
			3, even import the Prosthesis from foreign countries;
			<lb />
			(d) that the choice of the source from which CMP is purchased by the patient or
			<lb />
			the treating Doctor, is made only by them and not by defendants 2 and 3 and hence,
			<lb />
			defendants 2 and 3 cannot be accused of committing infringement;
			<lb />
			(e) that the Prosthesis supplied to Apollo Hospitals has no Polymer Pad and the
			<lb />
			mechanisms and designs are completely different;
			<lb />
			(f) that since Prosthesis is something which is specially made for every patient to
			<lb />
			suit his specific conditions, no two Prosthesis could be compared; and
			<lb />
			(g) that therefore, there is no cause of action for the plaintiff against defendants 2
			<lb />
			and 3.
			<lb />
			9. The fourth defendant has filed a written statement contending inter alia:
			<lb />
			(a) that limb conservation studies have been going on at the fourth defendant
			<lb />
			Institute from the late 1970s;
			<lb />
			(b) that musculoskeletal tumours of the limb occur commonly in children,
			<lb />
			adolescents and in young people;
			<lb />
			(c) that with the advent of modern chemotherapy, combined with
			<lb />
			surgical
			<lb />
			procedures, a revolution in the management and survival rate of patients had gone up to
			<lb />
			60% from a mere 20%;
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			(d) that from 1988, Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan, a Co-patentee of the plaintiff had
			<lb />
			taken charge of Limb Salvation in bone tumours at the fourth defendant&apos;s institute with
			<lb />
			the permission of the Government of Tamil Nadu;
			<lb />
			(e) that Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan had conducted limb conservation studies at
			<lb />
			the Institute, after his return from England, after completing a special study of Limb
			<lb />
			Conservation in Non-metastatic case;
			<lb />
			(f) that in his Books, &quot;Principles of Orthopaedic Oncology&quot; and &quot;Custom Mega
			<lb />
			Prosthesis and Limb Salvage Surgery&quot;, Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan had acknowledged the
			<lb />
			fourth defendant&apos;s contribution to his studies and all items in question are purchased
			<lb />
			pursuant to the clearance and approval based upon the design provided by him;
			<lb />
			(g) that the Prosthesis supplied in the early stages through Dr.Mayilvahanan
			<lb />
			Natarajan, by a local company, was made of stainless steel;
			<lb />
			(h) that however the Defence Research and Development Organisation took up the
			<lb />
			task of providing titanium as a replacement for stainless steel, at the behest and advice
			<lb />
			of the former President of India, Dr.A.P.J.Abdul Kalam;
			<lb />
			(i) that Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan has mentioned in his second book that titanium
			<lb />
			was stronger, but lighter than stainless steel;
			<lb />
			(j) that the Prosthesis made of titanium alloy, not only proved to be life saving, but
			<lb />
			also contributed to the improvement of the quality of the patient&apos;s life;
			<lb />
			(k) that many youngsters who benefited by this treatment pursued higher
			<lb />
			education and took up jobs and started doing well in their avocations.
			<lb />
			(l) that Sri Ratan Tata Trust funded the programme from 1995 to 2004, which
			<lb />
			enabled even poor people get prosthesis;
			<lb />
			(m) that titanium alloy is available only with the first defendant and hence, the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			15
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			plaintiff continued to purchase the same only from them;
			<lb />
			(n) that the prosthesis made out of titanium alloys by the first defendant were
			<lb />
			based on the design supplied by Dr.Mayilvahanan and they were supplied by the first
			<lb />
			defendant at affordable rates;
			<lb />
			(o) that towards the end of 2006, the first defendant informed the fourth
			<lb />
			defendant about the notice issued by the plaintiff and indicated that they would not be
			<lb />
			able to supply prosthesis;
			<lb />
			(p) that when this was brought to the notice of Dr.Mayilvahanan, he provided
			<lb />
			stainless steel prosthesis;
			<lb />
			(q) that when the supply was stopped abruptly in May 2007, Dr.Mayilvahanan
			<lb />
			again made arrangements for alternative source of supply;
			<lb />
			(r) that the fourth defendant never made any profit out of the purchase and supply
			<lb />
			of prosthesis, as it is a philanthropic institution, which received a grant from Ratan Tata
			<lb />
			Trust;
			<lb />
			(s) that the development of hinged femoral component became a popular
			<lb />
			treatment for bone cancer with two types of products, one custom made and another
			<lb />
			modular, coming into the market;
			<lb />
			(t) that the prosthesis used by the fourth defendant are custom made;
			<lb />
			(u) that for a long time, five vendors by name (1) Howmedica, Inc. of Rutherford
			<lb />
			NJ; (2) Zimmer Inc. of Warsaw, (3) Poleco Inc. of Almeda Calilfornia, (4) Biomet Inc.
			<lb />
			and (5) Wright Medical Technologists were supplying limb salvage devices and the main
			<lb />
			aspects claimed by the plaintiff to be unique to his invention, have already been used by
			<lb />
			these vendors;
			<lb />
			(v) that therefore, there is no inventive step or novelty in the invention of the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			16
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			plaintiff and the question whether the modifications brought forth by the plaintiff would
			<lb />
			pass the test of novelty and inventive step has to be decided at the time of trial;
			<lb />
			(w) that the grant of a patent is no guarantee of its validity and public interest
			<lb />
			concerns far outweigh any commercial interests that the plaintiff may have;
			<lb />
			(x) that when the plaintiff claims that he is manufacturing, marketing and selling
			<lb />
			the product in question through a proprietary concern by name Arc biomechanical
			<lb />
			Engineers, he cannot sustain the suit without making them a party;
			<lb />
			(y) that since titanium alloy is available only with Government of India
			<lb />
			undertakings such as the first defendant, the plaintiff could not have had any access to
			<lb />
			the same, to develop a wide range of prosthesis as claimed by him;
			<lb />
			(z) that the process of a metallic implant known as en-prosthesis in the place of
			<lb />
			the tumor bearing bone through devices, has been in existence even from late 1980s and
			<lb />
			1990s and there is no novelty or inventive step;
			<lb />
			(aa) that the concept of a prosthesis has been there for 15 to 17 years and the
			<lb />
			distinguishing features between the plaintiff&apos;s prosthesis and the first defendant&apos;s
			<lb />
			prosthesis are set out in the written statement of the first defendant;
			<lb />
			(ab) that the supply of prosthesis from 1992 to 2007 to the fourth defendant, have
			<lb />
			been made not only from plaintiff but also from other suppliers including the first
			<lb />
			defendant under instructions and guidance of Dr.Mayilvahanan;
			<lb />
			(ac) that therefore, it is clear that Dr.Mayilvahanan had assigned his rights under
			<lb />
			the patent to the first defendant and others, who supplied CMPs to this defendant;
			<lb />
			(ad) that consequently, the fourth defendant would be a &apos;prior user&apos; and hence, no
			<lb />
			injunction can be granted against them;
			<lb />
			(ae) that in any case, the CMPs implanted on patients at the fourth defendant&apos;s
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			17
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			institute are not identical with the prosthesis allegedly developed by the plaintiff;
			<lb />
			(af) that the distant femoral prosthesis and proximal tibial prosthesis have been in
			<lb />
			existence for a long time and the rotating hinge mechanism has also been used widely in
			<lb />
			medical treatment even prior to the grant of patents;
			<lb />
			(ag) that even during the period 2001-2003 when the plaintiff obtained registration
			<lb />
			of patents, the fourth defendant has been using the prosthesis applications manufactured
			<lb />
			by the first defendant, very much to the knowledge of the co-patentee;
			<lb />
			(ah) that therefore, it should be construed that the co-patentee assigned his rights
			<lb />
			under the patent to the first defendant;
			<lb />
			(ai) that there is no novelty in the design nor inventive skill and in any case, the
			<lb />
			product is different;
			<lb />
			(aj) that it is true that CMPs were purchased by the fourth defendant from the
			<lb />
			plaintiff from the year 1992, but after visit by the former President of India Dr.A.P.J.
			<lb />
			Abdul Kalam in the year 2000, the fourth defendant started purchasing CMPs made of
			<lb />
			titanium alloy from the first defendant;
			<lb />
			(ak) that since the CMPs are manufactured to suit the requirements of each
			<lb />
			patient, according to the design provided by the surgeon, there is no infringement of
			<lb />
			registered design;
			<lb />
			(al) that it was the co-patentee of the plaintiff, who conducts surgery in the fourth
			<lb />
			defendant institute and he has been instrumental in arranging for supplies; and
			<lb />
			(am) that therefore, the suit is liable to be dismissed.
			<lb />
			10. On the basis of the above pleadings, a learned Judge of this Court framed the
			<lb />
			following issues on 6.1.2010 for consideration :
			<lb />
			(i) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for a decree and permanent
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			18
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			injunction against the defendants from in any manner infringing patent Nos.
			<lb />
			196333, 198872 and 198869 from using any part or portion of the said
			<lb />
			patent specification for making any prosthesis by using the said portion or
			<lb />
			any part or patent thereof for improvement in relating to manufacture of
			<lb />
			any prosthesis and to infringe the aforesaid patent or parts thereof?
			<lb />
			(ii) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for permanent injunction
			<lb />
			restraining the defendants from claiming in any manner for the use of the
			<lb />
			process within the range, scope and purview of the said patent Nos.196333,
			<lb />
			198872 and 198869?
			<lb />
			(iii) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for permanent injunction
			<lb />
			restraining the defendants from in any manner making, manufacturing,
			<lb />
			using, selling, offering for sale, marketing or advertising any prosthesis as
			<lb />
			specified in patent Nos.196333, 198872 and 198869?
			<lb />
			(iv) Whether the defendants are liable to deliver all apparatus relating
			<lb />
			to the manufacture of any prosthesis by the defendants through the
			<lb />
			infringement of the prosthesis in patent Nos.196333, 198872 and 198869
			<lb />
			and the Design Nos.191946, 189140 and 204684?
			<lb />
			(v) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for permanent injunction
			<lb />
			restraining the defendants in any way making, manufacturing, using, selling,
			<lb />
			offering for sale, marketing or advertising with regard to any prosthesis or
			<lb />
			any variation thereof by using or utilising the plaintiff&apos;s Design Nos.191946,
			<lb />
			189140 and 204684?
			<lb />
			(vi) Whether the defendants 1 to 4 are liable to render true, fair and
			<lb />
			faithful accounts in respect of the invention manufactured, used and sold by
			<lb />
			the said defendants which infringed and continue to infringe patent Nos.
			<lb />
			196333, 198872 and 193869 and a preliminary decree has to be passed for
			<lb />
			taking such account for the loss and damage suffered by the plaintiff?
			<lb />
			(vii) Whether the suit is liable to the dismissed for non-joinder of
			<lb />
			necessary parties?
			<lb />
			(viii) Whether the suit is bad for mis-joinder of the parties, namely
			<lb />
			defendants 2 and 3?
			<lb />
			(ix) Whether the suit filed by the plaintiff is maintainable in law?
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			19
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			(x) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the custom &apos;mega&apos; prosthesis
			<lb />
			invented and manufactured by the plaintiff along with Professor
			<lb />
			Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan under the title &quot;Inventive steps and Novelty?
			<lb />
			(xi) To what relief the plaintiff is entitled to?&quot;
			<lb />
			11. After the framing of the above issues, the plaintiff examined himself as PW1
			<lb />
			and filed 64 documents and one material object. The documents, about which there was
			<lb />
			no controversy, were marked as Exx.P-1 to P-58. The material object was marked as
			<lb />
			M.O.1. Subsequently, five documents were marked as Exx.P-59 to P-63 subject to
			<lb />
			objections. The supporting affidavit filed by the co-patentee Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan
			<lb />
			was marked as Ex.P.64 subject to objections.
			<lb />
			12. Thereafter, one Mr.K.Gurulingam, working as Deputy General Manager in the
			<lb />
			first defendant company, was examined as DW1. He filed a proof affidavit in lieu of chief
			<lb />
			examination. He filed a letter of authorisation given to him as Ex.D.1 and one prosthesis
			<lb />
			manufactured by the first defendant as M.O.2. During cross examination of D.W.1 by the
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the plaintiff, the print outs of the annual reports of the first defendant
			<lb />
			company for the financial years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 were marked as Exx.D2 and
			<lb />
			D3 subject to objections.
			<lb />
			13. During cross examination of D.W.1 by the counsel for the plaintiff, he was
			<lb />
			asked whether he could dismantle M.O.1. D.W.1 claimed that he could. Hence, D.W.1
			<lb />
			was handed over necessary tools in the court hall, to enable him to dismantle M.O.1. He
			<lb />
			dismantled M.O.1 completely and after cross examination, reassembled the same.
			<lb />
			Similarly, he also dismantled M.O.2 into its component parts.
			<lb />
			14. Subsequently, D.W.1 was recalled at the instance of the counsel for the first
			<lb />
			defendant and a fax message received by the first defendant from the fourth defendant
			<lb />
			along with a diagram of the prosthesis, was marked as Ex.D.4. A letter of the Deputy
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			20
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			General Manager (Law and Administration) containing a resolution of the Board of
			<lb />
			Directors authorising D.W.1, was filed as Ex.D.5.
			<lb />
			15. After the completion of the evidence of D.W.1, the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			plaintiff requested me to frame an additional issue. After hearing the parties, I allowed
			<lb />
			the request and framed the following as an additional issue :
			<lb />
			&quot;Whether Mr.R.Thanikachalam who signed and verified the written
			<lb />
			statement in his capacity as Resident Manager-Marketing of the first
			<lb />
			defendant, had due authority to represent the first defendant and whether
			<lb />
			DW1 had necessary authority to depose on behalf of the first defendant and
			<lb />
			if not, whether the written statement and the evidence of the first
			<lb />
			defendant has to be eschewed?&quot;
			<lb />
			16. After the framing of the additional issue, the first defendant examined the
			<lb />
			Deputy General Manager (Marketing) by name R.Thanikachalam as D.W.2. Through him,
			<lb />
			Exx.D6 to D8 were marked, subject to objections. They were marked for the purpose of
			<lb />
			showing the authority of D.W.1 and the authority of the person, who signed and verified
			<lb />
			the pleadings.
			<lb />
			17. The defendants 2 to 4 did not adduce either oral or documentary evidence.
			<lb />
			However, in the course of arguments, the learned counsel on both sides requested me to
			<lb />
			fine tune and/or recast one of the issues earlier framed by my predecessor on 6.1.2010,
			<lb />
			so that the question of infringement is decided. The issue to be recast is issue No.10. It
			<lb />
			originally read as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the custom &apos;mega&apos; prosthesis
			<lb />
			invented and manufactured by the plaintiff along with Professor Dr.
			<lb />
			Mayilvahanan Natarajan under the title &quot;Inventive steps and Novelty?&quot;
			<lb />
			18. The fact that the plaintiff has obtained registration of his patents, is
			<lb />
			undisputed. But, the claim of the defendants is that the inventions claimed by the plaintiff
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			21
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			do not qualify for valid patents in the sense that there was no novelty and that there was
			<lb />
			no inventive step. Therefore, the highlight of issue No.10 should be the very validity of
			<lb />
			the patents. Hence, the tenth issue is recast as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;Whether the patents registered in favour of the plaintiff along with
			<lb />
			Professor Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan, qualify as valid patents, fulfilling the
			<lb />
			requirements of novelty and inventive steps, so as to entitle the plaintiff to
			<lb />
			prevent the defendants from infringing the same?&quot;
			<lb />
			19. Out of the 11 issues originally framed and the issue additionally framed, issue
			<lb />
			Nos.7 to 9 relate to the maintainability of the suit. Therefore, I shall take up these issues
			<lb />
			first. Thereafter, I would take up the tenth issue for a decision, as it would go to the root
			<lb />
			of the matter. The decision on issues 1 to 6 and 11, would simply follow my finding on
			<lb />
			the tenth issue and hence, I would take up these issues in the last part of my order.
			<lb />
			ISSUE NOS.7, 8 AND 9 (NON JOINDER OF NECESSARY PARTIES, MIS-JOINDER OF
			<lb />
			UNNECESSARY PARTIES AND MAINTAINABILITY)
			<lb />
			20. The non joinder of the co-patentee Dr.Prof.Mayilvahanan Natarajan and the
			<lb />
			joinder of defendants 2 and 3 as parties to the suit, are raised as objections to the
			<lb />
			maintainability of the suit. Let me first take up the question of non joinder of the co-
			<lb />
			patentee Dr. Prof.Mayilvahanan Natarajan.
			<lb />
			21. There is no dispute on facts that Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan is a co-patentee
			<lb />
			and that despite being aware of the institution of the suit, he has chosen to keep away.
			<lb />
			He has given a supporting affidavit filed as Ex.P.64. In his supporting affidavit, he has
			<lb />
			stated that he had perused the plaint filed by the plaintiff as well as the affidavits filed by
			<lb />
			the plaintiff in all interlocutory applications. He has claimed that he was a co-patentee
			<lb />
			along with the plaintiff for the CMPs and that these CMPs were registered both under the
			<lb />
			Patents Act and under the Designs Act. While five CMPs are registered both for patent
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			22
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			and for design, ten CMPs are registered for design alone.
			<lb />
			22. In the supporting affidavit, Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan claims that in his
			<lb />
			opinion, there is an infringement and that he supported the case of the plaintiff. He
			<lb />
			further claims that under Section 50 (2) of the Patents Act, 1970, it is enough if the suit
			<lb />
			is filed by one of the co-patentees. Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan has also reserved in his
			<lb />
			affidavit, a right to supply or file additional material in the course of hearing of the suit.
			<lb />
			But, he did not choose to do so.
			<lb />
			23. The marking of the affidavit of Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan was objected to by
			<lb />
			the counsel for the defendants primarily on the ground that he is not a party to the suit.
			<lb />
			But, I allowed it to be marked as Ex.P-64, subject to objections.
			<lb />
			24. Relying upon the decision of this Court in Marneedi Satyam Vs.
			<lb />
			Venkataswami [AIR (36) 1949 Madras 689] and the decision of the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			in Smt.Sudha Devi Vs. M.P.Narayanan and Others [1988 (3) SCC 366], Mr.V.
			<lb />
			Chandrakanthan, learned counsel for the first defendant contended that Ex.P.64 is not
			<lb />
			admissible in evidence.
			<lb />
			25. The question that arose in Marneedi Satyam was as to the validity of the
			<lb />
			evidence recorded in the form of affidavit, in the light of the requirement of Order XVIII
			<lb />
			Rule 4, CPC. But, the said decision was rendered long before the advent of the sweeping
			<lb />
			amendments made in the Code, by the Amendment Acts of 1999 and 2002. Therefore,
			<lb />
			the said decision is of no relevance. In any case, the contents of Ex.P.64 are not intended
			<lb />
			to be a substitute for oral evidence. It is filed for a very limited purpose.
			<lb />
			26. In Smt.Sudha Devi, the Supreme Court relied upon Section 3 of the Evidence
			<lb />
			Act to hold that an affidavit is not evidence, unless the court passed an order under
			<lb />
			Order XIX Rule 1 or 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. But, as I have said earlier, this
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			23
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			decision also arose before the amendment of the Code by Amendment Act 22 of 2002. By
			<lb />
			this Amendment Act, Order XVIII Rule 4 stood amended, permitting chief examination to
			<lb />
			be by affidavit. In any case, the affidavit of Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan is not sought to
			<lb />
			be filed as an examination in chief of a witness. The purpose of filing this affidavit is very
			<lb />
			limited. Therefore, the decisions relied upon by the counsel for the first defendant would
			<lb />
			not clinch the issue.
			<lb />
			27. In this case, the affidavit Ex.P.64 can be taken into account by me for two
			<lb />
			purposes, namely (a) to have confirmation that he continued to have interest in the
			<lb />
			patent and (b) to get it confirmed that he has no conflict of interest with the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			28. But I would not be able to take for its face value, the claim made by
			<lb />
			Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan in his supporting affidavit Ex.P.64, that there is an
			<lb />
			infringement of intellectual property rights. If he wanted to assert such a claim, either as
			<lb />
			a co-patentee or at least as an expert in the field, he is expected to get into the witness
			<lb />
			box, so that the defendants have an opportunity to cross examine him. Since he did not
			<lb />
			choose to do so, I would not accept the contents of Ex.P.64, in so far as they relate to
			<lb />
			the rights of the plaintiff are concerned. But, Ex.P.64 can certainly be taken to be an
			<lb />
			indication that the co-patentees have no conflict of interest between themselves.
			<lb />
			29. Keeping the above in mind, let me now examine the question whether the non
			<lb />
			joinder of the co-patentee is fatal to the claim of the plaintiff or not.
			<lb />
			30. Sub-Section (1) of Section 50 of the Patents Act, 1970 makes it clear that
			<lb />
			where a patent is granted to two or more persons, each of those persons shall, unless an
			<lb />
			agreement to the contrary is in force, be entitled to an equal undivided share in the
			<lb />
			patent. After thus ensuring to all the patentees, an equal and undivided share in the
			<lb />
			patent under Sub-Section (1), the Act also imposed an embargo under Sub-Section (3)
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			24
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			of Section 50 to the effect that a licence under the patent cannot be granted and a share
			<lb />
			in the patent cannot be assigned by one of those persons except with the consent of the
			<lb />
			other person or persons. However, this embargo was made subject to the other
			<lb />
			provisions and subject to Section 51 and to any agreement for the time being in force.
			<lb />
			31. But, in so far as the enforcement of the rights conferred by the Act is
			<lb />
			concerned, Sub-Section (2) of Section 50 enables each of the co-patentees to seek
			<lb />
			redressal, even without accounting to the other persons. Sub-Section (2) of Section 50
			<lb />
			reads as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;Subject to the provisions contained in this section and in Section 51,
			<lb />
			where two or more persons are registered as grantee or proprietor of a
			<lb />
			patent, then, unless an agreement to the contrary is in force, each of those
			<lb />
			persons shall be entitled, by himself or his agents, to the rights conferred
			<lb />
			by Section 48 for his own benefit without accounting to the other person or
			<lb />
			persons.&quot;
			<lb />
			32. The rights conferred by Section 48 of the Act are (i) the exclusive right to
			<lb />
			prevent third parties from the act of making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing
			<lb />
			for those purposes that product which is the subject matter of the patent and (ii) the
			<lb />
			exclusive right to prevent third parties from the act of using that process and from the
			<lb />
			act of using, offering for sale, selling or importing for those purposes the product
			<lb />
			obtained directly by a process which is the subject matter of the patent.
			<lb />
			33. Therefore, it is clear from Sub-Section (2) of Section 50 read with Section 48
			<lb />
			that each of the grantees or proprietors of a patent, is entitled by himself or by his
			<lb />
			agents, to enforce the rights conferred under Section 48, for his own benefit without
			<lb />
			accounting to the other person or persons. Coupled with the fact that under Section
			<lb />
			50(3), a co-patentee cannot even assign or grant a licence in respect of his share,
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			25
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			without the consent of the other persons, the provisions of Section 50(2) makes the suit
			<lb />
			maintainable at the instance of one of the co-patentees.
			<lb />
			34. The learned counsel for the first defendant relied upon the following decisions
			<lb />
			to contend that the non joinder of the co-patentee is fatal to the case :
			<lb />
			(i) Kanakarathanammal Vs. V.S.Loganatha Mudaliar and another [1964 (6) SCR 1];
			<lb />
			(ii) Loonkaran Sethiya Vs Ivan E.John [1977 (1) SCC 379];
			<lb />
			(iii) Shanmugham and Others Vs. Saraswathi and Others [AIR 1997 Madras 226].
			<lb />
			35. The decision in Kanakarathanammal arose out of a suit for recovery of
			<lb />
			possession of the properties inherited by the appellant in terms of the provisions of the
			<lb />
			Mysore Hindu Law Women&apos;s Rights Act, 1933. She did not implead her brothers as
			<lb />
			parties to the suit. The Supreme Court held that under the Act, the appellant would be
			<lb />
			entitled exclusively to the property, if one particular provision of the Act was applied and
			<lb />
			that her brothers would also be entitled to a share if another provision of the Act was
			<lb />
			invoked. Therefore, the non joinder of her brothers, who would have otherwise become
			<lb />
			entitled to a share, was held by the Supreme Court to be fatal to the case of the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			36. In Seth Loonkaran Sethiya, the suit was for recovery of money. But, it was
			<lb />
			filed by a person claiming to be the sole proprietor of a firm. One of the questions that
			<lb />
			fell for consideration was as to whether there was a dissolution of a partnership and
			<lb />
			whether the plaintiff had become the sole proprietor. The Court found that the claim of
			<lb />
			dissolution of partnership was false. Therefore, the Court eventually held the non joinder
			<lb />
			of the other partner as fatal to the case.
			<lb />
			37. In Shanmugham, the suit was for partition and it was found that some of the
			<lb />
			co-sharers were not made parties. Since they were necessary even for the determination
			<lb />
			of the quantum of share to which the plaintiff was entitled, this Court held that the non
			<lb />
			joinder was fatal.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			26
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			38. Therefore, all these three decisions are not applicable to the case on hand. In
			<lb />
			the case on hand, I am concerned about a right statutorily conferred upon the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			This right under Section 48 of the Patents Act, 1970, is conferred upon each of the
			<lb />
			patentees in terms of Section 50(2). The general principles governing mis-joinder and
			<lb />
			non joinder of parties falling in the realm of procedural law under the Code of Civil
			<lb />
			Procedure, cannot supersede or overtake a substantive right conferred by a Special
			<lb />
			Enactment. Therefore, I hold that the non joinder of the co-patentee Dr.Mayilvahanan
			<lb />
			Natarajan to the suit is not fatal to the institution of the suit, so long as he does not have
			<lb />
			a conflict of interest with the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			39. The next objection to the maintainability of the suit is on the ground that the
			<lb />
			defendants 2 and 3 are not necessary and proper parties to the suit. The Apollo
			<lb />
			Hospitals, which is the second and third defendant herein, claimed that they are not
			<lb />
			manufacturing prosthesis. Whenever a patient admitted to their hospital requires a
			<lb />
			prosthesis, the defendants 2 and 3 look up to the market for the supply of prosthesis. In
			<lb />
			other words, the defendants 2 and 3 claim to be no more than the customers of these
			<lb />
			products. The defendants 2 and 3 are neither manufacturers nor suppliers, but only
			<lb />
			consumers. Therefore, the defendants 2 and 3 claim that the suit is bad for mis-joinder
			<lb />
			of unnecessary parties.
			<lb />
			40. The plaintiff has impleaded the defendants 2 and 3 as parties to the suit, in
			<lb />
			view of the fact that there was a newspaper article in the Hyderabad Edition of The Hindu
			<lb />
			dated 13.2.2004 to the effect that cancer infested bone and knee joint of a 18 year old
			<lb />
			boy was removed and replaced at the second defendant hospital with a prosthesis
			<lb />
			developed by the engineers of the first defendant&apos;s biomedical division. The prosthesis
			<lb />
			was also given the name &apos;Apollo Midhani prosthesis&apos;. Therefore, the plaintiff gained an
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			27
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			impression that the common mega prosthesis was developed jointly by the first
			<lb />
			defendant and the defendants 2 and 3.
			<lb />
			41. The plaintiff also filed a copy of the online edition of the newspaper of The
			<lb />
			Hindu dated 13.2.2004 as Ex.P.11. Ex.P.11 contains a reference to the prosthesis named
			<lb />
			as &apos;Apollo Midhani prosthesis&apos;.
			<lb />
			42. While cross examining P.W.1, the learned counsel for the defendants 2 and 3
			<lb />
			pointed out that it was not stated in Ex.P.11 that the product was jointly developed by
			<lb />
			the Apollo Hospitals and the first defendant. Therefore, it was contended by the
			<lb />
			defendants 2 and 3 that in the absence of a clear indication that the defendants 2 and 3
			<lb />
			were associated with the manufacture and supply of the product, they should not have
			<lb />
			been impleaded.
			<lb />
			43. But, I am not able to sustain the objections of the defendants 2 and 3. Order I
			<lb />
			Rule 3 of the Civil Procedure Code gives an indication of the persons, who may be joined
			<lb />
			as defendants. As per Order I Rule 3, all persons may be joined in one suit, where any
			<lb />
			right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same act or transaction is alleged to exist
			<lb />
			against such persons and if separate suits were brought, any common question of law or
			<lb />
			fact would arise. It is not necessary for a plaintiff to succeed against all the defendants.
			<lb />
			Order I Rule 3(a) uses the expression &apos;alleged to exist&apos;. There is an allegation that the
			<lb />
			plaintiff has a right to relief against the defendants 2 and 3. Moreover, Order I Rule 7
			<lb />
			gives a leverage for the plaintiff to join two or more defendants, wherever he is in doubt
			<lb />
			as to the person from whom he is entitled to obtain redress. In any case, no suit can be
			<lb />
			defeated by reason of mis joinder in view of the provisions of Order I Rule 9 of the Code.
			<lb />
			44. Moreover, Section 48(a) of the Patent Act, 1970 entitles the proprietor of a
			<lb />
			patent, to prevent others not merely from making or offering for sale or selling, but also
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			28
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			from using or importing. The defendants 2 and 3 would certainly be persons using or
			<lb />
			importing for the purpose of sale, the product in respect of which, the plaintiff alleges and
			<lb />
			claims patent rights. Therefore, the joinder of the defendants 2 and 3 as parties to the
			<lb />
			suit, cannot be said to be vitiated. At any rate, such joinder would not make the suit
			<lb />
			liable to be dismissed. Similarly, the non joinder of the co-patentee also does not make
			<lb />
			the suit not maintainable.
			<lb />
			45. The learned counsel for the defendants 2 and 3 relies upon the decision of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in Laxmi Raj Shetty Vs. State of Tamilnadu [CDJ 1988 SC 326] in
			<lb />
			support of the contention that a report in a newspaper is only hearsay evidence and that
			<lb />
			it is not one of the documents referred to in Section 78(2) of the Evidence Act, 1872, by
			<lb />
			which, an allegation of fact can be proved. The presumption of genuineness attached
			<lb />
			under Section 78 of the Evidence Act to a newspaper report cannot be treated as proof of
			<lb />
			the facts reported therein.
			<lb />
			46. There can be no quarrel about the above proposition. But, there is a small
			<lb />
			distinction. It may not be open to a Court to treat a newspaper report as having
			<lb />
			conclusively established the infringement of a person&apos;s intellectual property rights. But, it
			<lb />
			will be certainly open to a plaintiff, on the basis of newspaper reports to implead a person
			<lb />
			as a party to a suit. In other words, the contents of the newspaper reports may be
			<lb />
			inadmissible in evidence. But, even without relying upon the newspaper reports, it is
			<lb />
			open to the plaintiff to implead defendants 2 and 3 if he suspected them of committing
			<lb />
			infringement. Ultimately, the success of the plaintiff as against defendants 2 and 3
			<lb />
			depends upon proof of infringement. But the fact that he may not have a chance to
			<lb />
			succeed against defendants 2 and 3 is no ground to conclude that they cannot be made
			<lb />
			parties. Hence, the issue Nos.7, 8 and 9 are answered in favour of the plaintiff and
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>

			<lb />

		<body>
			against the defendants.
			<lb />
			ADDITIONAL ISSUE :
			<lb />
			47. The additional issue hinges upon the question whether the first defendant can
			<lb />
			be said to have defended themselves in the suit in a manner known to law or not. The
			<lb />
			written statement on behalf of the first defendant was signed and verified by one
			<lb />
			R.Thanikachalam, in his capacity as Resident Manager-Marketing. On behalf of the first
			<lb />
			defendant, Mr.K.Gurulingam gave evidence as D.W.1. The plaintiff questions the
			<lb />
			authority of Mr.R.Thanikachalam to sign and verify the pleadings and of Mr.K.Gurulingam
			<lb />
			to depose on behalf of the first defendant. Let me first take up the issue relating to the
			<lb />
			authority of Mr.R.Thanikachalam to sign and verify the written statement on behalf of the
			<lb />
			first defendant.
			<lb />
			48. Section 26(1) of the Civil Procedure Code mandates every suit to be instituted
			<lb />
			by the presentation of a plaint. Order VI Rule 1 of the Code defines the expression
			<lb />
			&apos;pleadings&apos; to mean the plaint as well as the written statement. Rule 15 of Order VI lays
			<lb />
			down the procedure for verification of pleadings. Sub-Rule (1) of Rule 15 of Order VI
			<lb />
			reads as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;Save as otherwise provided by any law for the time being in force,
			<lb />
			every pleading shall be verified at the foot by the party or by one of the
			<lb />
			parties pleading or by some other person proved to the satisfaction of the
			<lb />
			Court to be acquainted with the facts of the case.&quot;
			<lb />
			49. A careful reading of Order VI Rule 15(1) shows that a pleading has to be
			<lb />
			verified either by the party or by one of the parties pleading or by some other person
			<lb />
			proved to the satisfaction of the court to be acquainted with the facts of the case. Mr.R.
			<lb />
			Thanikachalam, who has signed and verified the written statement on behalf of the first
			<lb />
			defendant was examined as D.W.2. Therefore, all that is required by Order VI Rule 15(1)
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			30
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			stands satisfied. Order VI Rule 15 does not give a list of persons, who alone are
			<lb />
			competent to sign and verify the pleadings. Therefore, there is no bar for a person, who
			<lb />
			is acquainted with the facts of the case, to sign and verify the pleadings, unless otherwise
			<lb />
			the plaintiff establishes that a person, who is more competent and more knowledgeable
			<lb />
			about the facts of the case had deliberately failed to sign and verify the pleadings, in
			<lb />
			order to avoid appearance in court.
			<lb />
			50. Order VIII of the Civil Procedure Code, which enlists the rules relating to
			<lb />
			written statement, set off and counter claim, does not anywhere indicate as to who is or
			<lb />
			who alone is competent to sign and verify the pleadings.
			<lb />
			51. Order XXIX, which deals with suits by or against corporations, mandates under
			<lb />
			Rule 1 that in suits by or against a corporation, any pleading may be signed and verified
			<lb />
			on behalf of the corporation, by the Secretary or by any Director or other Principal Officer
			<lb />
			of the corporation, who is able to depose to the facts of the case. Mr.R.Thanikachalam,
			<lb />
			who signed and verified the pleadings and who gave evidence as D.W.2 produced copies
			<lb />
			of the approval granted by the Chairman and Managing Director as Ex.D.6. He also
			<lb />
			produced certified true copy of the extract of the minutes of the 153rd meeting of the
			<lb />
			Board of Directors of the first defendant as Ex.D.8.
			<lb />
			52. The learned counsel for the plaintiff brought out during cross examination of
			<lb />
			D.W.2 that he had not seen any of the 64 exhibits filed by the plaintiff in this case and
			<lb />
			had also not seen the Articles of Association of the first defendant company at any point
			<lb />
			of time. Therefore, the learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that I should treat the
			<lb />
			first defendant as having remained ex parte in the suit. But I think it is too wide a
			<lb />
			proposition to be accepted. While Order VI Rule 15(1), which I have extracted above,
			<lb />
			uses the phrase &apos;every pleading shall be verified&apos;, Order XXIX Rule 1 uses the phrase &apos;any
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			31
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			pleading signed and verified&apos;. In other words, the leverage given to any person, who is
			<lb />
			acquainted with the facts of the case to sign and verify the pleadings under Order VI Rule
			<lb />
			15(1) cannot be said to be taken away by Order XXIX Rule 1, C.P.C. As a matter of fact,
			<lb />
			Order XXIX Rule 3 confers power upon the Court to require the personal appearance of
			<lb />
			any Secretary or Director or other Principal Officer of the corporation, who may be able
			<lb />
			to answer material questions relating to the suit. Therefore, the authority given to a
			<lb />
			person, who is acquainted with the facts, to sign and verify the pleadings, cannot be said
			<lb />
			to be diluted.
			<lb />
			53. In Wali Mohammed Khan Vs. Ishak Ali Khan and Others [AIR 1931
			<lb />
			ALL. 307], a Special Bench of the Allahabad High Court went to the extent of holding
			<lb />
			that the presentation of the plaint even by a person orally authorised to do so would be
			<lb />
			valid and that the omission to comply with Order III Rule 1 would only be a mere
			<lb />
			irregularity and not an absence of jurisdiction.
			<lb />
			54. Similarly, while dealing with a suit instituted by a company incorporated under
			<lb />
			the Companies Act, 1956, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court held in All India
			<lb />
			Reporter Limited Vs Ramchandra [AIR 1961 BOMBAY 292] that the provisions
			<lb />
			contained in Order VI related only to procedure and that the better view would be to
			<lb />
			regard them as mere matters of procedure. In paragraph 20 of its judgment, the Bombay
			<lb />
			High Court held as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;In the case of companies the plaint can be signed by either a
			<lb />
			Secretary or a Director or other Principal Officer under Order 29, Rule 1,
			<lb />
			Civil Procedure Code, or any person duly authorized by the Company under
			<lb />
			Order 6, Rule 14. The words &quot;duly authorized&quot; in Order 6, Rule 14, need not
			<lb />
			be restricted to mean authorized by proper written authority or by power of
			<lb />
			attorney. There is authority for this view in Bengal Jute Mills v. Jewraj
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			32
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Heeralal, AIR 1943 Cal.13, AIR 1948 Mad 369, ILR 1939 Nag 515 : [AIR
			<lb />
			1939 Nag. 242] and AIR 1941 Nag 159. In these cases it was held that a
			<lb />
			plaintiff can orally authorize another person to sign a plaint for him. The
			<lb />
			Managing Director of the plaintiff Company in the instant case, who has
			<lb />
			authority to file suits on behalf of the Company (vide Article 156 of the
			<lb />
			Company&apos;s Articles of Association), can orally authorize another person to
			<lb />
			sign the plaint for him on behalf of the Company. Plaintiff No. 2, who is the
			<lb />
			Managing Director of the Company (Plaintiff No.1) has in his deposition
			<lb />
			deposed that Ghushey signed the plaint under his instructions. &quot;The
			<lb />
			evidence of Ghushey is to the same effect.&quot;
			<lb />
			55. In Union Bank of India Vs Naresh Kumar [1996 (VI) SCC 660], the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court, after referring to the provisions of Order VI Rule 14 and Order XXIX Rule
			<lb />
			1 of the Code, held that even in the absence of a formal letter of authority or power of
			<lb />
			attorney having been executed, a person referred to in Order XXIX Rule 1 can sign and
			<lb />
			verify the pleadings on behalf of the corporation, by virtue of the office he holds. The
			<lb />
			Court further held that since a corporation is a juristic entity, even de hors Order XXIX
			<lb />
			Rule 1, the company can duly authorise any person to sign the plaint or written
			<lb />
			statement. Apart from holding so, the Supreme Court went one step further and held
			<lb />
			that even in the absence of any specific authorisation or resolution by the Board of
			<lb />
			Directors, it is always open to a corporation to ratify the action of one of its officers in
			<lb />
			signing and verifying the pleadings.
			<lb />
			56. In the case on hand, the note put up by the Senior Manager -Law seeking the
			<lb />
			authority of the Chairman and Managing Director to authorise Mr.R.Thanikachalam to
			<lb />
			sign and verify the pleadings, is marked as Ex.D.6. Ex.D.7 is a letter of the Government
			<lb />
			of India authorising the delegation of certain powers of the Board to the Chairman and
			<lb />
			Managing Director, as approved by the Board in its resolution dated 26.3.2004. Ex.D.8 is
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			33
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the copy of the Board resolution. Therefore, it is clear that R.Thanikachalam had
			<lb />
			necessary authority to sign and verify the pleadings. In any case, the Board must be
			<lb />
			deemed to have ratified his action. Therefore, it cannot be said that the person, who
			<lb />
			signed and verified the written statement on behalf of the first defendant did not have
			<lb />
			the authority to do so.
			<lb />
			57. Coming to the evidence of D.W.1, it is needless to point out that it is open to
			<lb />
			the party to a proceeding to examine any one they want, as a witness. The first
			<lb />
			defendant had considered D.W.1 as a person competent to depose. He has demonstrated
			<lb />
			his competence at least to depose, by dismantling and reassembling in open court, the
			<lb />
			material objects M.O. 1 and 2. There is no law, which requires a corporation to examine
			<lb />
			its Managing Director as a witness to a suit. The only impediment that is placed under the
			<lb />
			Code, could be traced to Order XVIII Rule 3. Under the said provision, a party who
			<lb />
			wishes to appear as a witness, should do so before any other witness is examined, unless
			<lb />
			the court permits him to appear at a later stage. Therefore, even the authority of D.W.1
			<lb />
			to depose, cannot be questioned.
			<lb />
			58. In any case, D.W.1 has filed Ex.D.5 -letter of the Deputy General Manager
			<lb />
			(Law and Administration) recording the resolution passed by the Board of Directors.
			<lb />
			Though marking of Ex.D5 was objected to by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, on the
			<lb />
			ground that it is neither original nor certified copy and also on the ground that the
			<lb />
			contents of the same are irrelevant without any reflection of the board resolution, I do
			<lb />
			not think that these objections are well founded. For the limited purpose of finding out
			<lb />
			whether the first defendant company authorised D.W.1 to adduce evidence or not, Ex.D.5
			<lb />
			can certainly be admitted. The last paragraph of Ex.D.5 contains signature and rubber
			<lb />
			stamp of the Chairman and Managing Director of the first defendant, authorising D.W.1
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			34
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			to depose. Therefore, there was nothing wrong in the deposition of D.W.1.
			<lb />
			59. In view of the above, the additional issue is answered against the plaintiff and
			<lb />
			in favour of the first defendant.
			<lb />
			ISSUE NO.10 AS IT IS RECAST :
			<lb />
			60. The tenth issue (after it is recast) is as to whether the patents registered in
			<lb />
			favour of the plaintiff along with Prof.Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan qualify as valid patents
			<lb />
			fulfilling the requirements of novelty and inventive step, so as to entitle the plaintiff to
			<lb />
			prevent the defendants from infringing the same.
			<lb />
			61. As pointed out earlier, the plaintiff is a co-patentee, who has obtained
			<lb />
			registration along with Prof.Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan, of five patents and 15 designs.
			<lb />
			The products, in respect of which he has obtained patent registration, are also products,
			<lb />
			for which, he has obtained registration of the design. In other words, out of 15 products,
			<lb />
			the plaintiff has obtained registration for five under both the Enactments and in respect
			<lb />
			of the remaining 10, under the Designs Act, 2000 alone.
			<lb />
			62. However, the present suit is confined only to three patents and three designs.
			<lb />
			The three patents to which the suit relates are patent Nos.196333, 198872 and 198869.
			<lb />
			The certificates of registration of these patents are filed as Exx.P1 to P6.
			<lb />
			63. The above three patents correlate to the registration of three designs bearing
			<lb />
			Nos.191946, 189140 and 204684. The certificates of registration of these designs are
			<lb />
			filed as Exx.P7 to P9 and Exx.P-7A to 9-A.
			<lb />
			64. The first defendant has made a categorical admission that they are not
			<lb />
			manufacturing the products covered by the patents bearing registration Nos.198872 and
			<lb />
			198869. This is borne out by paragraph 3 of the written statement filed by the first
			<lb />
			defendant.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			35
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			65. Therefore, the area of dispute is now confined only to the patent bearing
			<lb />
			registration No.196333, which corresponds to the design No.191946.
			<lb />
			66. Ex.P.1 is the certificate issued by the Assistant Controller of Patents and
			<lb />
			Designs in favour of Prof.Dr. Mayilvahanan Natarajan and the plaintiff, in respect of the
			<lb />
			invention for &apos;DISTAL FEMORAL PROSTHESIS WITH THRUST BEARING POLYMER PAD
			<lb />
			AND ROTATING AXIS MECHANISM.&apos; The patent bearing No.196333 dated 5.9.2003
			<lb />
			appears to have been granted on 12.7.2006 under Ex.P.1. It is important to note from
			<lb />
			Ex.P.1 that the same was granted subject to the condition that the validity of the patent
			<lb />
			is not guaranteed.
			<lb />
			67. Ex.P.2 is the complete patent specification in respect of patent No.196333. The
			<lb />
			description of the product is found in Ex.P.2 as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;The present patent application No.707/CHE/2003 is a distal femoral
			<lb />
			prosthesis with thrust bearing polymer pad and rotating axis mechanism.
			<lb />
			This invention has a femoral shaft, which comprises femoral anchoring
			<lb />
			component on one end, and the other end evolves, into the cylindrical
			<lb />
			femoral component, which corresponds to the anatomy of the normal bone.
			<lb />
			The lower part of the femoral component mates with the condylar
			<lb />
			component, which is angled by 6 Â° according to the side of the prosthesis. The
			<lb />
			interior portion of this condylar component mates with the median
			<lb />
			component by means of the pivotal pin and collared bushes.&quot;
			<lb />
			68. The claims made by the plaintiff and his co-patentee are also listed in Ex.P.2.
			<lb />
			The claims numbering about 18, are summarised in an abstract in Ex.P.2 as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;The distal femur prosthesis with thrust bearing polymer pad and
			<lb />
			rotating axis mechanism comparing of condylar component, median
			<lb />
			component, femoral shaft, tibial shaft, thrust bearing pad, thrust bearing, 2
			<lb />
			collared bushes, sleeve bearing, pivot pin, screws with spring and washers
			<lb />
			when it assembled. The femoral shaft that anchors to the intramedullary
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			36
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			portion of the bone at one end and that expands as the condylar component
			<lb />
			which mates to the median component. The condylar component is angled
			<lb />
			by 6 degrees at its mid portion. The UHMWPE thrust bearing pad is provided
			<lb />
			between the under portion of the distal femoral condylar component and the
			<lb />
			upper surface of the median component and serves to reduce the friction
			<lb />
			between the metallic surfaces by relocating the load transmitted to tibial
			<lb />
			component and pivot pin. The rotating hinge is assembled around the
			<lb />
			median component and is present in the tibial component and provides 3
			<lb />
			degrees of radial rotation between the femoral and tibial components.&quot;
			<lb />
			69. Ex.P.2 also contains six drawing sheets providing a cross sectional view of the
			<lb />
			product and its component parts. The fact that the plaintiff has obtained registration of
			<lb />
			patent for a product described as above is not disputed by the defendants. But in brief,
			<lb />
			the defence taken by the defendants is two fold namely (a) that at the outset, the patent
			<lb />
			is invalid, as there is no novelty and no inventive step; and (b) that in any case, the
			<lb />
			product of the defendants is not similar to the product of the plaintiff, so as to
			<lb />
			tantamount to an infringement.
			<lb />
			70. In other words, the first defence of the defendants is with regard to the very
			<lb />
			validity of the patent. The second defence is that there is no infringement. Under Section
			<lb />
			107 (1) of the Patents Act, 1970, every ground on which a patent may be revoked under
			<lb />
			Section 64 is available as a ground for defence in any suit for infringement of a patent.
			<lb />
			Section 107(1) reads as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;In any suit for infringement of a patent, every ground on which it
			<lb />
			may be revoked under Section 64 shall be available as a ground for
			<lb />
			defence.&quot;
			<lb />
			71. Section 64(1) of the Act enables the revocation of a registered patent. Section
			<lb />
			64(1) is so comprehensive that it indicates (i) the persons, at whose instance, a patent
			<lb />
			can be revoked; (ii) the Authorities competent to revoke the patent; and (iii) the grounds
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			37
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			on which a patent could be revoked. The persons, at whose instance a patent could be
			<lb />
			revoked, are (a) any person interested; and (b) the Central Government. The Authorities
			<lb />
			competent to revoke the patent are (i) the Appellate Board; and (ii) the High Court on a
			<lb />
			counter claim in a suit for infringement. The grounds on which a patent can be revoked
			<lb />
			are provided in Clauses (a) to (q) of Section 64(1). It would be useful to extract Section
			<lb />
			64(1) and hence, it is extracted as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;64. Revocation of patents
			<lb />
			(1) Subject to the provisions contained in this Act, a patent, whether
			<lb />
			granted before or after the commencement of this Act, may be revoked on a
			<lb />
			petition of any person interested or of the Central Government by the
			<lb />
			Appellate Board or on a counter claim in a suit for infringement of the patent
			<lb />
			by the High Court on any of the following grounds, that is to say-
			<lb />
			(a) that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete
			<lb />
			specification, was claimed in a valid claim of earlier priority date contained in
			<lb />
			the complete specification of another patent granted in India;
			<lb />
			(b) that the patent was granted on the application of a person not
			<lb />
			entitled under the provisions of this Act to apply therefor;
			<lb />
			(c) that the patent was obtained wrongfully in contravention of the
			<lb />
			rights of the petitioner or any person under or through whom he claims;
			<lb />
			(d) that the subject of any claim of the complete specification is not
			<lb />
			an invention within the meaning of this Act;
			<lb />
			(e) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete
			<lb />
			specification is not new, having regard to what was publicly known or
			<lb />
			publicly used in India before the priority date of the claim or to what was
			<lb />
			published in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in
			<lb />
			section 13 ;
			<lb />
			(f) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete
			<lb />
			specification is obvious or does not involve any inventive step, having regard
			<lb />
			to what was publicly known or publicly used in India or what was published
			<lb />
			in India or elsewhere before the priority date of the claim;
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			38
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			(g) that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete
			<lb />
			specification, is not useful;
			<lb />
			(h) that the complete specification does not sufficiently and fairly
			<lb />
			describe the invention and the method by which it is to be performed, that is
			<lb />
			to say, that the description of the method or the instructions for the working
			<lb />
			of the invention as contained in the complete specification are not by
			<lb />
			themselves sufficient to enable a person in India possessing average skill in,
			<lb />
			and average knowledge of, the art to which the invention relates, to work
			<lb />
			the invention, or that it does not disclose the best method of performing it
			<lb />
			which was known to the applicant for the patent and for which he was
			<lb />
			entitled to claim protection;
			<lb />
			(i) that the scope of any claim of the complete specification is not
			<lb />
			sufficiently and clearly defined or that any claim of the complete
			<lb />
			specification is not fairly based on the matter disclosed in the specification;
			<lb />
			(j) that the patent was obtained on a false suggestion or
			<lb />
			representation;
			<lb />
			(k) that the subject of any claim of the complete specification is not
			<lb />
			patentable under this Act;
			<lb />
			(l) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete
			<lb />
			specification was secretly used in India, otherwise than as mentioned in
			<lb />
			Sub-Section (3), before the priority date of the claim;
			<lb />
			(m) that the applicant for the patent has failed to disclose to the
			<lb />
			Controller the information required by Section 8 or has furnished information
			<lb />
			which in any material particular was false to his knowledge;
			<lb />
			(n) that the applicant contravened any direction for secrecy passed
			<lb />
			under section 35 or made or caused to be made an application for the grant
			<lb />
			of a patent outside India in contravention of section 39;
			<lb />
			(o) that leave to amend the complete specification under Section 57
			<lb />
			or Section 58 was obtained by fraud.
			<lb />
			(p) that the complete specification does not disclose or wrongly
			<lb />
			mentions the source or geographical origin of biological material used for the
			<lb />
			invention;
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			39
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			(q) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete
			<lb />
			specification was anticipated having regard to the knowledge, oral or
			<lb />
			otherwise, available within any local or indigenous community in India or
			<lb />
			elsewhere.&quot;
			<lb />
			72. As pointed out in the preceding paragraph, the Authorities competent to
			<lb />
			revoke the patent are (i) the Appellate Board; and (ii) the High Court. But, Section 64(1)
			<lb />
			uses the phrase &apos;on a counter claim in a suit for infringement of the patent by the
			<lb />
			High Court&apos;.
			<lb />
			73. Therefore, it is contended by Mr.M.Sundar, learned counsel for the plaintiff that
			<lb />
			so long as there is no counter claim on the part of the defendants, the defendants are
			<lb />
			not entitled to challenge the validity of the patent in a suit for infringement.
			<lb />
			74. But, I do not think so. Section 64 is primarily concerned with the revocation of
			<lb />
			patents. For revoking a patent, there must certainly be an application either by a person
			<lb />
			interested or by the Central Government, either before the Appellate Board or in a
			<lb />
			counter claim in a suit for infringement before the High Court. Therefore, if the
			<lb />
			defendants are actually seeking the revocation of patent No.196333, they could do so
			<lb />
			only by filing a counter claim.
			<lb />
			75. But, what the defendants are now doing is only to set up a defence in terms of
			<lb />
			Section 107(1). Therefore, it is unnecessary for the defendants to file a counter claim.
			<lb />
			76. In other words, there is a distinction between the area of operation of Section
			<lb />
			64(1) and the area of operation of Section 107(1). If a defendant wants the plaintiff&apos;s
			<lb />
			patent to be revoked, he must file a counter claim in a suit for infringement. If he is not
			<lb />
			interested in the revocation of the patent, but is interested only in defending himself
			<lb />
			against an action for infringement, it is not necessary for him to file a counter claim.
			<lb />
			Section 107(1) is an enabling provision. This is why it uses the expression &apos;defence&apos;. A
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			40
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			petition for revocation of patent in the form of a counter claim is an offensive action and
			<lb />
			not a defensive action. Therefore, to take recourse to Section 107(1), it is not necessary
			<lb />
			for the defendants to file a counter claim. Consequently, I am entitled to see if any one of
			<lb />
			the Clauses from (a) to (q) of Section 64(1) would go to the aid of the defendants, by
			<lb />
			way of defence to the claim for infringement.
			<lb />
			REQUIREMENTS OF A VALID PATENT :
			<lb />
			Historical Perspective:
			<lb />
			77. Seldom have inventors been law makers or vice versa. But Thomas Jefferson
			<lb />
			had the privilege of being both and it was perhaps he, who signalled the arrival of a
			<lb />
			patent regime, exactly about 221 years ago in 1793, despite being opposed personally to
			<lb />
			monopoly rights. Therefore, the U.S. Supreme court virtually paid a tribute to him while
			<lb />
			tracing the history of the development of patent law since 1790, in its historic decision in
			<lb />
			Graham vs. John Deere Co. [383 US 1 (1966)] in the following manner:
			<lb />
			&quot;Thomas Jefferson, who as Secretary of State was a member of the
			<lb />
			group, was its moving spirit, and might well be called the &apos;first administrator
			<lb />
			of our patent system.&apos; See Federico, Operation of the Patent Act, 1790, 18
			<lb />
			J.Pat.Off.Soc. 237, 238 (1936). He was not only an administrator of the
			<lb />
			patent system under the 1790 Act, but was also the author of the 1793
			<lb />
			Patent Act. In addition, Jefferson was himself an inventor of great note. His
			<lb />
			unpatented improvements on plows, to mention but one line of his
			<lb />
			inventions, won acclaim and recognition on both sides of the Atlantic.
			<lb />
			Because of his active interest and influence in the early development of the
			<lb />
			patent system, Jefferson&apos;s views on the general nature of the limited patent
			<lb />
			monopoly under the Constitution, as well as his conclusions as to conditions
			<lb />
			for patentability under the statutory scheme, are worthy of note.
			<lb />
			Jefferson, like other Americans, had an instinctive aversion to
			<lb />
			monopolies. It was a monopoly on tea that sparked the Revolution, and
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			41
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Jefferson certainly did not favor an equivalent form of monopoly under the
			<lb />
			new government. His abhorrence of monopoly extended initially to patents
			<lb />
			as well. From France, he wrote to Madison (July, 1788) urging a Bill of Rights
			<lb />
			provision restricting monopoly, and as against the argument that limited
			<lb />
			monopoly might serve to incite &apos;ingenuity&apos;, he argued forcefully that &apos;the
			<lb />
			benefit even of limited monopolies is too doubtful to be opposed to that of
			<lb />
			their general suppression,&apos; V Writings of Thomas Jefferson at 47 (Ford. ed.
			<lb />
			1895).
			<lb />
			His views ripened, however, and, in another letter to Madison (Aug.
			<lb />
			1789) after the drafting of the Bill of Rights, Jefferson stated that he would
			<lb />
			have been pleased by an express provision in this form :
			<lb />
			&apos;Art.9. Monopolies may be allowed to persons for their own productions
			<lb />
			in literature, &amp; their own inventions in the arts, for a term not exceeding ___
			<lb />
			years, but for no longer term &amp; no other purpose.&apos;
			<lb />
			Id. at 113. And he later wrote :
			<lb />
			&apos;Certainly an inventor ought to be allowed a right to the benefit of his
			<lb />
			invention for some certain time.....Nobody wishes more than I do that
			<lb />
			ingenuity should receive a liberal encouragement.&apos;
			<lb />
			Letter to Oliver Evans (May, 1807), V Writings of Thomas Jefferson at
			<lb />
			75-76 (Washington ed.).
			<lb />
			Jefferson&apos;s philosophy on the nature and purpose of the patent
			<lb />
			monopoly is expressed in a letter to Isaac McPherson (Aug., 1813), a portion
			<lb />
			of which we set out in the margin. [Footnote 2] He rejected a natural rights
			<lb />
			theory in intellectual property rights and clearly recognised the social and
			<lb />
			economic rationale of the patent system. The patent monopoly was not
			<lb />
			designed to secure to the inventor his natural right in his discoveries. Rather,
			<lb />
			it was a reward, an inducement, to bring forth new knowledge. The grant of
			<lb />
			an exclusive right to an invention was the creation of the society --at odds
			<lb />
			with the inherent free nature of disclosed ideas--and was not to be freely
			<lb />
			given. Only inventions and discoveries which furthered human knowledge,
			<lb />
			and were new and useful, justified the special inducement of a limited
			<lb />
			private monopoly. Jefferson did not believe in granting patents for small
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			42
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			details, obvious improvements, or frivolous devices. His writings evidence his
			<lb />
			insistence upon a high level of patentability.
			<lb />
			As a member of the patent board for several years, Jefferson saw
			<lb />
			clearly the difficulty in &apos;drawing a line between the things which are worth to
			<lb />
			the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those which are
			<lb />
			not.&apos; The board on which he served sought to draw such a line and
			<lb />
			formulated several rules which are preserved in Jefferson&apos;s correspondence.
			<lb />
			[Footnote 3] Despite the board&apos;s efforts, Jefferson saw &apos;with what slow
			<lb />
			progress a system of general rules could be matured.&apos; Because of the
			<lb />
			&apos;abundance&apos; of cases and the fact that the investigations occupied &apos;more time
			<lb />
			of the members of the board than they could spare from higher duties, the
			<lb />
			whole was turned over to the judiciary, to be matured into a system under
			<lb />
			which every one might know when his actions were safe and lawful.&apos;
			<lb />
			Letter to McPherson, supra at 181, 182. Apparently agreed with
			<lb />
			Jefferson and the board that the courts should develop additional conditions
			<lb />
			for patentability. Although the Patent Act was amended, revised or codified
			<lb />
			some 50 times between 1790 and 1950, Congress steered clear of a
			<lb />
			statutory set of requirements other than the bare novelty and utility tests
			<lb />
			reformulated in Jefferson&apos;s draft of the 1793 Patent Act.&quot;
			<lb />
			78. Keeping in mind the above historic perspective, let us now move over to the
			<lb />
			question of validity of the patent of the plaintiff. The expression &apos;patent&apos; is defined under
			<lb />
			Section 2(1)(m) to mean a patent for any &quot;invention&quot; granted under the Act. The
			<lb />
			expression &apos;invention&apos; is defined under Section 2(1)(j) to mean &quot;a new product or
			<lb />
			process involving an inventive step and capable of industrial application&quot;. The expression
			<lb />
			&apos;inventive step&apos; is defined under Section 2(1)(ja) to mean &quot;a feature of an invention that
			<lb />
			involves technical advance as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic
			<lb />
			significance or both and that makes invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art&quot;.
			<lb />
			79. Interestingly, the Patents Act, 1970 defines the expression &apos;new invention&apos;
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			43
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			separately under Section 2(1)(l) to mean &quot;any invention or technology, which has not
			<lb />
			been anticipated by publication in any document or used in the country or elsewhere in
			<lb />
			the world before the date of filing of patent application with complete specification&quot;. The
			<lb />
			subject matter should not have fallen in public domain or should not form part of the
			<lb />
			state of the art. Therefore, fundamentally, the patented product or process should be
			<lb />
			shown to be an invention, involving an inventive step and capable of industrial
			<lb />
			application, to be qualified as a valid patent. Consequently, three things become
			<lb />
			important to see if a patent is valid or not. They are (i) the existence of a new product or
			<lb />
			process; (ii) an inventive step that was involved in the development of the new product
			<lb />
			or process; and (iii) its industrial application.
			<lb />
			80. The above three requirements are also addressed by different expressions
			<lb />
			such as (i) novelty in the product or process; (ii) an inventive step that is marked by
			<lb />
			non obviousness to the person skilled in the art due to involvement of a technical
			<lb />
			advance or having economic significance; and (iii) usefulness. If a new product or
			<lb />
			process involving an inventive step and capable of industrial application, is also claimed
			<lb />
			to be a new invention, the claimant should also prove (i) that there was no anticipation;
			<lb />
			and (ii) that it did not form part of the state of the art or had not fallen in public domain.
			<lb />
			81. Before proceeding further, we must also take note of the distinction between
			<lb />
			an invention and discovery, at least for the purpose of understanding certain elementary
			<lb />
			principles. This can be better done by referring to the opinion of the Court of Appeal in
			<lb />
			Lane Fox Vs. Kensington and Knightsbridge Electric Lighting Company (Limited) [Vol.IX
			<lb />
			(37) Reports of Patent, Design and Trade Mark Cases 411]. The Court of Appeal pointed
			<lb />
			out therein that when Volta discovered the effect of an electric current from the
			<lb />
			battery on a frog&apos;s leg, he made a great discovery, but no patentable invention.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			44
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Again, a man, who discovered that a known machine can produce effects, which no one
			<lb />
			knew could be produced by it before, may make a great and useful discovery, but if he
			<lb />
			does no more, his discovery is not a patentable invention. This is due to the fact that he
			<lb />
			would not have added anything but knowledge to what previously existed. A patentee
			<lb />
			should do something more. He must make some addition not only to knowledge but to
			<lb />
			previously known inventions and must use his knowledge and ingenuity so as produce
			<lb />
			either a new and useful thing or result or a new method of producing an old thing or
			<lb />
			result. The Court of Appeal further pointed out that it is often extremely difficult to
			<lb />
			draw the line between patentable inventions and non patentable discoveries.
			<lb />
			Interestingly, the above decision was rendered way back in 1892. The difficulty that was
			<lb />
			encountered by the Court at that time has since been removed by incorporating a
			<lb />
			provision in the statute itself as to the inventions that do not qualify for being recognised
			<lb />
			as inventions, within the meaning of the Act.
			<lb />
			82. Section 3 of the Act lists out inventions, which do not qualify for being
			<lb />
			recognised as inventions within the meaning of the Act. In simple terms, the following are
			<lb />
			not inventions within the meaning of the Act :
			<lb />
			(i) an invention, which is either frivolous or which claims anything obviously
			<lb />
			contrary to well established natural laws;
			<lb />
			(ii) an invention, whose use or exploitation, would be contrary to public order or
			<lb />
			morality or an invention which causes serious prejudice to human, animal or plant life or
			<lb />
			health or to the environment;
			<lb />
			(iii) the mere discovery of a scientific principle or the discovery of something
			<lb />
			occurring in nature;
			<lb />
			(iv) the mere discovery of a new form of known substance that does not enhance
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			45
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the known efficacy of the substance;
			<lb />
			(v) a substance obtained by a mere admixture resulting only in the aggregation of
			<lb />
			the properties of the components;
			<lb />
			(vi) the mere arrangement or rearrangement of known devices each functioning
			<lb />
			independently of one another in a known way;
			<lb />
			(vii) the method of agriculture or horticulture;
			<lb />
			(viii) any process for the treatment of human beings or animals to render them
			<lb />
			free of diseases or to increase their economic value;
			<lb />
			(ix) plants and animals other than micro organisms, but including seeds, varieties
			<lb />
			and species;
			<lb />
			(x) a mathematical or business method or a computer programme per se or
			<lb />
			algorithms;
			<lb />
			(xi) a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work or any other aesthetic creation
			<lb />
			including cinematographic works and television productions;
			<lb />
			(xii) a mere scheme or rule or method of performing mental act or method of
			<lb />
			playing game;
			<lb />
			(xiii) a presentation of information;
			<lb />
			(xii) topography of integrated circuits; and
			<lb />
			(xiv) an invention, which is, in effect, traditional knowledge.
			<lb />
			83. Clause (i) of Section 3 may be of relevance and hence, it is extracted as
			<lb />
			follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;Any process for the medical, surgical, curative, prophylactic
			<lb />
			(diagnostic, therapeutic) or other treatment of human beings or any
			<lb />
			process for a similar treatment of animals to render them free of diseases
			<lb />
			or to increase their economic value or that of their products.&quot;
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			46
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			84. Therefore, it is admitted on both sides, at least on principle, that if the patent,
			<lb />
			of which infringement is alleged, does not satisfy the triple tests of novelty, inventive
			<lb />
			step and usefulness or if it is an invention, which falls within any of the Clauses of Section
			<lb />
			3, the claimant is not entitled to any remedy. In the case on hand, the primary
			<lb />
			contention of the defendants is that there is no invention in the patent of the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			According to the first defendant, distal femoral prosthesis was first developed and
			<lb />
			manufactured by Howmedica Inc., Rutherford, NJ, USA and that the same products are
			<lb />
			available worldwide from various companies. According to the fourth defendant, there are
			<lb />
			two types of prosthesis namely custom made and modular and that for a long time, five
			<lb />
			vendors have been offering limb salvage devices to the fourth defendant. They are (i)
			<lb />
			Howmedica, Inc. of Rutherford, NJ; (ii) Zimmer Inc. of Warsaw; (iii) Poleco Inc. of
			<lb />
			Almeda California; (iv) Biomet Inc.; and (v) Wright Medical Technologies.
			<lb />
			85. In the light of the defence taken by the defendants, it is contended by Mr.M.
			<lb />
			Sundar, learned counsel for the plaintiff that whenever an action for infringement is
			<lb />
			initiated by the registered holder of a patent, the onus of establishing that the patent was
			<lb />
			not a valid patent would shift to the defendant, who challenges the validity of the patent
			<lb />
			by taking recourse to Section 107(1) read with Section 64. In the case on hand, the
			<lb />
			claim of the plaintiff is based upon the certificates of registration issued by the Registrar
			<lb />
			of Patents. The plaintiff also went into the witness box and contended that he had been
			<lb />
			constantly developing, improvising and perfecting the technology relating to limb salvage
			<lb />
			devices by spending his time and money for over two decades. He has claimed in his
			<lb />
			deposition as PW1 that due to unrelenting and persistent research and experimentation
			<lb />
			in the field and by combining surgical oncology and precision engineering expertise, he
			<lb />
			was able to develop about 15 types of prosthesis. According to the plaintiff, the CMP
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			47
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			developed by him has the following unique, unparalleled and unprecedented features :
			<lb />
			(i) the use of polymer components as journal bearings, which reduce wear and
			<lb />
			tear by more than 90% and which give smooth and free articulation of the joints;
			<lb />
			(ii) the use of rotating hinge mechanism, which allows constrained radial freedom
			<lb />
			between two bones (which mate with prosthesis) and thereby reduces stress in the bone
			<lb />
			and the joints due to asymmetrical loading in the normal course of functioning;
			<lb />
			(iii) the use of extending mechanism, by which, the prosthesis can be made to
			<lb />
			expand in-situ, after surgery, to compensate the growth of the symmetrical bone in the
			<lb />
			other limb for younger patients; and
			<lb />
			(iv) the use of pivotal hinge and the thrust bearing body mechanisms, which
			<lb />
			provide friction free articulation.
			<lb />
			86. In order to prove the above claims, the plaintiff has not only marked as
			<lb />
			exhibits the registration certificates along with the Specifications and Claims, but has also
			<lb />
			filed several other documents. Ex.P.10 series are the certificates and awards given to him
			<lb />
			for the successful development of the CMP. These certificates were issued by the Ministry
			<lb />
			of Science and Technology of the Government of India, the Technology Development
			<lb />
			Board of the Government of India and the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. The
			<lb />
			plaintiff has also filed as Ex.P.57, an extract from the book titled Custom Mega Prosthesis
			<lb />
			and Limb Salvage Surgery. In the preface to the book, its author Dr.Mayilvahanan
			<lb />
			Natarajan has acknowledged the contribution made by the plaintiff for developing the
			<lb />
			prosthesis, manufacturing it and keeping its costs to the minimum. He had also
			<lb />
			acknowledged the magnanimity of the plaintiff in providing free prosthesis for the
			<lb />
			patients at the Government General Hospital. In the preface written by the Cancer
			<lb />
			Institute itself (fourth defendant) to the said book Ex.P.56, the fourth defendant had also

			acknowledged the fact that the co-patentee Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan joined their team
			<lb />
			in 1988 with a proposal for limb conservation in primary malignant tumours of bones and
			<lb />
			limbs and that he had also persuaded an orthopaedic company to fabricate stainless steel
			<lb />
			endo-prosthesis.
			<lb />
			87. Therefore, on the basis of the pleadings and the evidence of PW1 read with the
			<lb />
			documents filed by him, Mr.M.Sundar, learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that the
			<lb />
			plaintiff has discharged the initial burden cast upon him to show that he had a valid
			<lb />
			patent. Once this is established, the onus of proving that the patent was invalid, shifted
			<lb />
			on the defendants. But, the defendants, according to the plaintiff, did not discharge the
			<lb />
			onus that fell upon them, after the evidence of PW1.
			<lb />
			88. In support of his above contention, learned counsel for the plaintiff also invited
			<lb />
			my attention to the cross examination of PW1 as well as the evidence let in by the
			<lb />
			defendants. The only question that was put to PW1 by the learned counsel for the first
			<lb />
			defendant during cross examination was that the CMP was already in use in other
			<lb />
			countries like U.K. and U.S.A. But, PW1 asserted in response to the said question that
			<lb />
			different persons make different designs and that there is difference between the CMP
			<lb />
			made in other countries and the CMP made by the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			89. In the light of the evidence on record, the learned counsel for the plaintiff
			<lb />
			contended that the onus that shifted to the side of the defendants for showing that the
			<lb />
			patent registered in favour of the plaintiff was an invalid one, was not discharged by
			<lb />
			them either during cross examination of PW1 or by way of other evidence in the form of
			<lb />
			independent witnesses. What is worse, according to the plaintiff, is that the first
			<lb />
			defendant made an abortive attempt to get a similar patent registered in their favour.
			<lb />
			Ex.P.42 is an application made by the first defendant for patenting a knee joint assembly
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			49
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			for body implant. But, the application was admittedly abandoned by the first defendant.
			<lb />
			The application Ex.P.42 contains Specifications, Claims and an Abstract apart from a
			<lb />
			drawing of the proposed knee joint assembly. Therefore, the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			plaintiff contended that the defendants miserably failed to discharge the onus upon them
			<lb />
			to prove that the patent registered in favour of the plaintiff was not a valid one.
			<lb />
			90. In support of the above contention, the learned counsel for the plaintiff relied
			<lb />
			upon the decision in Anchor Building Products Limited Vs Redland Roof Tiles Ltd.
			<lb />
			(1990 RPC (11) 283). In that case, which arose out of an action for infringement of
			<lb />
			patent, the defendants claimed that the plaintiff was actually guilty of infringement of one
			<lb />
			of its own patents. By a 2:1 majority, the Court of Appeals held that it was for the party
			<lb />
			alleging infringement to put before court some evidence, on which the court could fairly
			<lb />
			conclude that he had an arguable case of infringement, once the alleged infringer had put
			<lb />
			before the court the evidence, which on its face, showed there had been no infringement.
			<lb />
			91. I have carefully considered the above submissions. It is true that the plaintiff
			<lb />
			has come up with a suit for infringement of a registered patent. He has filed the patent
			<lb />
			registration certificate as one of the exhibits. He has also gone to the witness box to
			<lb />
			testify to the contents relating to the Specifications, Claims and Teachings, which form
			<lb />
			part of the certificate of registration of patent. Therefore, it is necessary to see whether
			<lb />
			he has discharged the initial burden cast upon him and as to whether the onus now lies
			<lb />
			upon the defendants to show that the patent was an invalid one, for the reasons stated
			<lb />
			by them.
			<lb />
			92. Section 101 of the Evidence Act, 1872 states that whoever desires any court to
			<lb />
			give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts, which
			<lb />
			he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. Section 101 also states that when a person
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			50
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that
			<lb />
			person.
			<lb />
			93. On the question as to the person on whom the burden of proof lies, Section
			<lb />
			102 of the Evidence Act states that the burden of proof lies on that person, who would
			<lb />
			fail, if no evidence at all were given on either side. On the question as to where the
			<lb />
			burden of proof relating to the existence of a particular fact would lie, Section 103 gives
			<lb />
			an indication. It says that the burden of proof as to the existence of any particular fact
			<lb />
			lies on that person, who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless law fixes
			<lb />
			responsibility upon some other person to prove that fact. Section 106 makes it clear that
			<lb />
			when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving
			<lb />
			that fact is upon him.
			<lb />
			94. Sections 101 to 110 of the Evidence Act lay down general propositions that
			<lb />
			would govern the question of burden of proof. Of them, Section 106 may be of particular
			<lb />
			relevance, since it deals with the question of burden of proving any fact &apos;which is
			<lb />
			especially within the knowledge of any person&apos;. But, there is a distinction between burden
			<lb />
			of proof and onus of proof. The distinction is brought out well by the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Anil Rishi Vs. Gurbaksh Singh [2006 (5) SCC 588]. The Supreme Court held therein
			<lb />
			that &apos;the right to begin follows onus probandi and that it assumes importance in
			<lb />
			the early stage of a case&apos;. The question of onus of proof has greater force where the
			<lb />
			question is which party is to begin. But, the burden of proof is used in three ways,
			<lb />
			namely (a) to indicate the duty of bringing forward evidence in support of a proposition
			<lb />
			at the beginning or later; (ii) to make that of establishing a proposition as against all
			<lb />
			counter evidence; and (iii) an indiscriminate use, in which, it may mean either or both of
			<lb />
			the others.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			51
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			95. One of the earliest cases where the distinction between onus of proof and
			<lb />
			burden of proof was brought out was the one in A.Ragavamma Vs. A.Chenchamma
			<lb />
			(AIR 1964 SC 136). The Supreme Court pointed out therein that &apos;burden of proof
			<lb />
			lies upon the person, who has to prove a fact and that it never shifts, while, on
			<lb />
			the contrary, the onus of proof shifts.&apos;
			<lb />
			96. However, it was pointed out by the Supreme Court in Kalwa Devadattan Vs.
			<lb />
			Union of India (AIR 1964 SC 880) that the question of onus probandi is important in
			<lb />
			the early stages of a case and in cases where no evidence at all is led. But where
			<lb />
			evidence has been led by the contesting parties, on the question in issue, it was
			<lb />
			pointed by the Supreme Court that the abstract considerations of onus are out
			<lb />
			of place and that truth or otherwise of the case must always be adjudged on
			<lb />
			the evidence led by the parties.
			<lb />
			97. In Narayan Govind Gavate Vs. State of Maharashtra [1977 (1) SCC
			<lb />
			133], the Supreme Court highlighted the fact that a question relating to burden of proof
			<lb />
			is not always free from difficulty and that &apos;apparent simplicity of a question relating
			<lb />
			to presumptions and burden of proof is often deceptive.&apos; Over simplification of
			<lb />
			questions relating to presumptions and burden of proof, according to the Supreme Court,
			<lb />
			leads to erroneous statements and misapplications of law. After extracting an interesting
			<lb />
			passage from Phipson on evidence, where the phrase &apos;burden of proof&apos; was often used in
			<lb />
			two distinct and frequently confused meanings, the Supreme Court pointed out in
			<lb />
			paragraph 19 of the report that &apos;the effect of evidence has to be distinguished from
			<lb />
			the duty or burden of showing to the court, what conclusions it should reach&apos;.
			<lb />
			This duty, which is termed as onus probandi is placed upon one of the parties in
			<lb />
			accordance with the provisions of law applicable to various situations. But, the effect of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			52
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			evidence is a matter of inference and it is determined at the end of the proceeding not
			<lb />
			merely by considering the general duties imposed by Sections 101 and 102, but also the
			<lb />
			special and particular onus imposed by other provisions such as Sections 103 and 106 of
			<lb />
			the Evidence Act. In the same case, the Supreme Court pointed out further that in
			<lb />
			judging whether a general or particular or special onus had been discharged, the court
			<lb />
			will not only consider the direct effect of the oral and documentary evidence, but also
			<lb />
			what may be indirectly inferred because of certain facts having been proved or not
			<lb />
			proved.
			<lb />
			98. In so far as the patent rights are concerned, the facts pleaded are specially
			<lb />
			within the knowledge of the person staking a claim. Though the Controller of Patents
			<lb />
			examines the patentability of a product or process, with reference to the
			<lb />
			Teachings, Claims and Specifications and also makes an investigation about
			<lb />
			anticipation by previous publication, he does not guarantee the validity of the
			<lb />
			patent. This is due to the fact that a patent specification is actually a unilateral
			<lb />
			statement made by the patentee in words of his own choosing. This principle
			<lb />
			referred as the &apos;doctrine of pith and marrow of the claim&apos;, was summarised by Lord
			<lb />
			Diplock in Catnic Components Ltd &amp; another Vs. Hill &amp; Smith Ltd. (1982 RPC
			<lb />
			183) as follows :
			<lb />
			&apos;...a patent specification is a unilateral statement by the patentee, in
			<lb />
			words of his own choosing, addressed to those likely to have a practical
			<lb />
			interest in the subject matter of his invention (i.e &apos;skilled in the art&apos;), by
			<lb />
			which he informs them what he claims to be the essential features of the
			<lb />
			new product or process for which the letters patent grant him a monopoly.
			<lb />
			It is those novel features only that he claims to be essential that constitute
			<lb />
			the so called &apos;pith and marrow&apos; of the claim. A patent specification should be
			<lb />
			given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			53
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			applying to it the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too
			<lb />
			often tempted by their training to indulge. The question in each case is :
			<lb />
			whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of
			<lb />
			work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand that
			<lb />
			strict compliance with a particular descriptive word or phrase appearing in a
			<lb />
			claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the
			<lb />
			invention so that any variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed, even
			<lb />
			though it could have no material effect upon the way the invention
			<lb />
			worked....The question, of course, does not arise where the variant would in
			<lb />
			fact have a material effect upon the way the invention worked. Nor does it
			<lb />
			arise unless at the date of publication of the specification it would be
			<lb />
			obvious to the informed reader that this was so. Where it is not obvious, in
			<lb />
			the light of the then existing knowledge, the reader is entitled to assume
			<lb />
			that the patentee thought at the time of the specification that he had good
			<lb />
			reason for limiting his monopoly so strictly and had intended to do so, even
			<lb />
			though subsequent work by him or others in the field of the invention might
			<lb />
			show the limitation to have been unnecessary. It is to be answered in the
			<lb />
			negative only when it would be apparent to any reader skilled in the art that
			<lb />
			a particular descriptive word or phrase used in a claim cannot have been
			<lb />
			intended by a patentee, who was also skilled in the art, to exclude minor
			<lb />
			variants which, to the knowledge of both him and the readers to whom the
			<lb />
			patent was addressed, could have no material effect upon the way in which
			<lb />
			the invention worked.&apos;
			<lb />
			99. Echoing the same sentiments in Glaverbel SA vs. British Coal Corporation
			<lb />
			{1994 (13) R.P.C. 443}, the Patent Court of U.K., elicited the following principles on
			<lb />
			the question of construction of the patent. The principles laid down are (i) the complete
			<lb />
			specification, a unilateral document, must be read as a whole in the light of the
			<lb />
			surrounding circumstances, as at the date of the publication of the specification and with
			<lb />
			regard to the alleged subsequent infringement; (ii) in reading the specification as a whole
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			54
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the different functions of the claim and the rest of the specification should be observed,
			<lb />
			although the claims are construed in the context of a specification as a whole, it is not
			<lb />
			permissible to restrict, expand or amend the clear language of a claim by reference to a
			<lb />
			limitation or gloss in the language used in the earlier part of the specification; (iii) the
			<lb />
			Court should read and construe the specification objectively through the eyes of the
			<lb />
			person to whom it is addressed and to whom common general knowledge is imputed;
			<lb />
			(iv) the specification should be given a purposive construction and not a purely literal
			<lb />
			one; (v) it is for the Court and not for any witness, however expert to decide the
			<lb />
			question of construction in accordance with the meaning of the language used.
			<lb />
			100. It appears that in U.S., there is a statutory presumption of validity under 35
			<lb />
			U.S.C. $ 282. But even then the courts in U.S. appear to have exercised caution as seen
			<lb />
			from the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Pfizer Inc., Vs.
			<lb />
			Apotex, Inc.,(decided on March 22, 2007). When Apotex filed a new drug application
			<lb />
			seeking the approval of the Food and Drug Administration to commercially sell
			<lb />
			Amlodipine besylate tablets (a generic version of Pfizer&apos;s drug Norvasc)) before the
			<lb />
			expiry of Pfizer&apos;s Patent, Pfizer filed a suit. Apotex not only denied infringement but also
			<lb />
			counterclaimed that the patents are invalid for anticipation and obviousness. The District
			<lb />
			Court rejected the counter claim and found infringement. When Apotex appealed, the
			<lb />
			Circuit court pointed out that a court is never bound by an examiner&apos;s finding in an
			<lb />
			exparte patent application proceeding. The Circuit Court also pointed out that in
			<lb />
			view of the presumption of validity of a patent in the United States, the patent challenger
			<lb />
			bears the burden of proving the factual elements of invalidity by clear and convincing
			<lb />
			evidence. After pointing out that the presumption of validity remains intact and that the
			<lb />
			burden of proof remains on the challenger through out the litigation, the Court also held
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			55
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			in Pfizer, that once a challenger has presented a prima facie case of invalidity, the
			<lb />
			patentee has the burden of going forward with the rebuttal evidence. After listing out the
			<lb />
			Graham factors, the Court also held that there is a subsidiary requirement subsumed
			<lb />
			within the Graham factors to the effect that where all claim limitations are found in a
			<lb />
			number of prior art references, the burden falls on the challenger of the patent to show
			<lb />
			by clear and convincing evidence that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to
			<lb />
			combine the teachings of the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention and
			<lb />
			that the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so.
			<lb />
			101. But, in so far as India is concerned, even the certificate of registration
			<lb />
			contains a stipulation that the validity of the patent is not guaranteed. Therefore, it is
			<lb />
			clear that it is not enough for the plaintiff in a suit for infringement of patent, just to
			<lb />
			produce the certificate of registration and pray for the grant of remedy. As I have earlier
			<lb />
			pointed out, the certificate of registration itself (Ex.P.1) contains a stipulation that the
			<lb />
			validity of the patent is not guaranteed by the certificate. This is why the plaintiff has let
			<lb />
			in evidence. But, the question to be considered is as to whether the evidence let in by the
			<lb />
			plaintiff is sufficient to prove the three fundamental requirements namely (i) novelty; (ii)
			<lb />
			non obviousness; and (iii) usefulness.
			<lb />
			102. In Mariappan Vs. A.R.Safiullah [2008 (5) CTC 97], a Division Bench of
			<lb />
			this Court held that after its amendment with effect from 20.5.2003, Section 48 of the
			<lb />
			Patents Act, 1970 conferred a right upon the patentee to have some weight on the basis
			<lb />
			of registration. But, it does not mean that a presumption as to the validity of the patent
			<lb />
			was created. The Division Bench made it clear that there is no presumption of validity of
			<lb />
			patent, even after the amendment of Section 48. Therefore, let me see if the plaintiff&apos;s
			<lb />
			patent passes the triple tests of novelty, no-obviousness and usefulness.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			56
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			NOVELTY :
			<lb />
			103. The first ingredient for invention is novelty, whether it be a product or
			<lb />
			process. As observed by Cotton,L.J. in Blakey &amp; Co. Vs. Lathem &amp; Co., [1889 (6)
			<lb />
			RPC 184 (CA)], &quot;to be new in the patent sense, the novelty must be shown in the
			<lb />
			invention&quot;. It is not enough that the purpose is new or that there is novelty in the
			<lb />
			application, so that the article produced is in that sense new. There must be novelty in
			<lb />
			the mode of application.
			<lb />
			104. When an application for registration of a patent is filed, the Controller of
			<lb />
			Patents examines the application on the basis of (i) teachings; (ii) specifications; and (iii)
			<lb />
			claims with reference to certain parameters including anticipation. The expressions
			<lb />
			&quot;teachings&quot;, &quot;claims&quot; and &quot;specifications&quot; are not defined in the Act. But, under Section
			<lb />
			7(4) of the Act, every application for the grant of a patent should be accompanied by a
			<lb />
			provisional or a complete specification. The procedure for filing such specifications is
			<lb />
			prescribed in Section 9. Section 10, which lists out the contents of specifications, requires
			<lb />
			under Sub-Section (4) that every complete specification should (i) describe the invention,
			<lb />
			its operation/use and the method by which it is to be performed; (ii) disclose the best
			<lb />
			method of performing the invention; (iii) end up with a claim or claims defining the scope
			<lb />
			of invention, for which, protection is claimed; and (iv) be accompanied by an abstract to
			<lb />
			provide technical information on the invention. The requirements of Sections 7(4) read
			<lb />
			with 10(4) are what are known in simple terms as (i) teachings; (ii) specifications; and
			<lb />
			(iii) claims.
			<lb />
			105. Rule 13 of the Patent Rules, 2003 requires every application for the grant of a
			<lb />
			patent submitted in Form-1 to be accompanied by a provisional/complete specification in
			<lb />
			Form-2. As part of Form-2, the applicant should submit his &quot;claims&quot; regarding the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			57
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			invention. Once an application for the grant of a patent, containing complete
			<lb />
			specifications incorporating the claims and technical information is submitted and it is
			<lb />
			found to be complete in all respects, the application is examined by the Examiner in
			<lb />
			terms of Section 13, for finding out whether the invention, as claimed in the claim of the
			<lb />
			complete specification has been anticipated by publication. Though Section 13(1)
			<lb />
			statutorily obliges the Examiner to make an investigation into the question of anticipation
			<lb />
			by publication, Sub-Section (4) makes it clear that the examination and investigation will
			<lb />
			not be deemed in any way to warrant the validity of any patent.
			<lb />
			106. Though Section 13(1) refers repeatedly to &quot;anticipation&quot;, the expression
			<lb />
			&quot;anticipation&quot; is not defined in the Act. But, Chapter VI containing Sections 29 to 32 deals
			<lb />
			with anticipation by previous publication. Here again, there is an element of confusion.
			<lb />
			Sections 29 to 32 do not stipulate as to what constitutes anticipation by publication.
			<lb />
			Rather, these Sections merely point out as to what would not constitute anticipation.
			<lb />
			While Section 29 indicates what is not anticipation by previous publication, Section 30
			<lb />
			indicates that a mere communication of the invention to the Government may not
			<lb />
			constitute anticipation. Similarly, Section 31 indicates as to when a public display would
			<lb />
			not constitute anticipation and Section 32 indicates when the public working of a patent
			<lb />
			would not constitute anticipation.
			<lb />
			107. But, there is a clue in the definition of the expression &quot;new invention&quot; found in
			<lb />
			Section 2(1)(l) as to how one could understand the term &quot;anticipation&quot;. The definition of
			<lb />
			the expression &quot;new invention&quot; under Section 2(1)(l) is as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot; &apos;New Invention&apos; means any invention or technology which has not
			<lb />
			been anticipated by publication in any document or used in the country or
			<lb />
			elsewhere in the world before the date of filing of patent application with
			<lb />
			complete specification, i.e. the subject matter has not fallen in public
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			58
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			domain or that it does not form part of the state of the art.&quot;
			<lb />
			108. Therefore, one has to understand anticipation by publication to mean that the
			<lb />
			subject matter had either fallen in the public domain or had become part of the state of
			<lb />
			the art. But, what we understand by anticipation by publication in view of what is stated
			<lb />
			in Section 2(1)(l) is further fine-tuned or circumscribed by the exclusions indicated in
			<lb />
			Sections 29 to 32.
			<lb />
			109. Keeping the above in mind, let me now see the tests developed by judicial
			<lb />
			precedents over the years as to how one could judge the novelty.
			<lb />
			110. In one of the earliest cases that came up before the U.S. Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Magowan vs. New York Belting and Packing Co. {141 US 332 (1891)}, it was
			<lb />
			indicated that to be an inventive step, the claimant should have supplied what was
			<lb />
			obviously wanting and not simply the display of the expected skill of the calling. It should
			<lb />
			exhibit the creative work of inventive faculty and not simply the exercise of the ordinary
			<lb />
			faculties of reasoning upon the materials supplied by a special knowledge and the facility
			<lb />
			of manipulation which results from its habitual and intelligent practice.
			<lb />
			111. In McClain vs. Ortmayer {141 US 419 (1891)}, the U.S. Supreme Court
			<lb />
			was concerned with a patent claim for a pad for horse collars. The Court held that if the
			<lb />
			patentee chooses to describe and claim only a part, he is presumed to have abandoned
			<lb />
			the residue to the public and that the object of the patent law in requiring the
			<lb />
			patentee to particularly point out his claim, is not merely to secure to him all
			<lb />
			that he is entitled, but to appraise the public of what is still open to them. The
			<lb />
			claim is the measure of his right to relief. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court held in
			<lb />
			that case that the curved hook of the defendant is not an infringement of the double
			<lb />
			spring described in the plaintiff&apos;s specification and claim. An interesting passage in the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			59
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			said judgment reads as follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;What shall be construed as invention within the meaning
			<lb />
			of the patent laws has been made the subject of a great
			<lb />
			amount of discussion in the authorities, and a large number of
			<lb />
			cases, particularly in the more recent volumes of reports, turn
			<lb />
			solely upon the question of novelty. By some, &quot;invention&quot; is
			<lb />
			described as the contriving or constructing of that which had
			<lb />
			not before existed, and by another, giving a construction to the
			<lb />
			patent law, as &quot;the finding out, contriving, devising, or creating
			<lb />
			something new and useful, which did not exist before, by an
			<lb />
			operation of the intellect.&quot; To say that the act of invention
			<lb />
			is the production of something new and useful does not
			<lb />
			solve the difficulty of giving an accurate definition, since
			<lb />
			the question of what is new, as distinguished from that
			<lb />
			which is a colorable variation of what is old, is usually
			<lb />
			the very question in issue. To say that it involves an
			<lb />
			operation of the intellect, is a product of intuition, or of
			<lb />
			something akin to genius, as distinguished from mere
			<lb />
			mechanical skill, draws one somewhat nearer to an
			<lb />
			appreciation of the true distinction, but it does not adequately
			<lb />
			express the idea. The truth is, the word cannot be defined in
			<lb />
			such manner as to afford any substantial aid in determining
			<lb />
			whether a particular device involves an exercise of the
			<lb />
			inventive faculty or not. In a given case, we may be able to say
			<lb />
			that there is present invention of a very high order. In another,
			<lb />
			we can see that there is lacking that impalpable something
			<lb />
			which distinguishes invention from simple mechanical skill.
			<lb />
			Courts, adopting fixed principles as a guide, have by a process
			<lb />
			of exclusion determined that certain variations in old devices do
			<lb />
			or do not involve invention, but whether the variation relied
			<lb />
			upon in a particular case is anything more than ordinary
			<lb />

		<body>
			mechanical skill is a question which cannot be answered by
			<lb />
			applying the test of any general definition.&quot;
			<lb />
			112. In C &amp; A Potts &amp; Co. Vs. Creager et al (155 US 597), that came up before
			<lb />
			the U.S.Supreme court, the products in question were a clay disintegrator and an
			<lb />
			improvement over the same. Stating that the often-recurring question, which had taxed
			<lb />
			the ingenuity of courts ever since the passage of Patents Act is as to what an invention
			<lb />
			really is, the Court pointed out that a patentee is entitled to every use which his invention
			<lb />
			is susceptible, whether such use be known or unknown to him. But, when a person who
			<lb />
			has taken this device makes improvements thereon and adapts it to a different industry,
			<lb />
			he may also draw to himself, the quality of the inventor. Listing out instances of this
			<lb />
			nature, the Court pointed out as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;If, for instance, a person were to take a coffee mill and patent it as a
			<lb />
			mill for grinding spices, the double use would be too manifest for serious
			<lb />
			argument. So, too, this Court has denied invention to one who applied the
			<lb />
			principle of an ice-cream freezer to the preservation of fish (Brown v. Piper,
			<lb />
			91 U.S. 37); to another who changed the proportions of a refrigerator in
			<lb />
			such manner as to utilise the descending instead of the ascending current of
			<lb />
			cold air (Roberts v. Ryer, 91 U.S.150); to another who employed an old and
			<lb />
			well-known method of attaching car trucks to the forward truck of a
			<lb />
			locomotive engine (Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Locomotive Engine Safety Truck
			<lb />
			Co., 110 U.S.490, 4 Sup. Ct.220); and to still another who placed a dredging
			<lb />
			screw at the stem instead of the stern of a steamboat (Atlantic Works v.
			<lb />
			Brady, 107 U.S.192, 2 Sup. Ct. 225). In Trucker v. Spalding, 13 Wall.453,
			<lb />
			the patent covered the use of movable teeth in saws and saw plates. A prior
			<lb />
			patent exhibited cutters of the same general form as the saw teeth of the
			<lb />
			other patent, attachable to a circular disk, and removable as in the other, for
			<lb />
			the purpose of which patent was for the cutting of tongues and grooves,
			<lb />
			mortises, etc. The court held that if what it actually did was in its nature the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			61
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			same as sawing, and its structure and action suggested to the mind of an
			<lb />
			ordinarily skillful mechanic this double use, to which it could be adapted
			<lb />
			without material change, then such adaptation to a new use was not new
			<lb />
			invention, and was not patentable.
			<lb />
			Upon the other hand, we have recently upheld a patent to one who
			<lb />
			took a torsional spring, such as had been previously used in clocks, doors,
			<lb />
			and other articles of domestic furniture, and applied it to telegraph
			<lb />
			instruments, the application being shown to be wholly new. Electric Co. v. La
			<lb />
			Rue, 139 U.S. 601, 11 Sup. Ct. 670. So, also, in Crane v. Price, Webster,
			<lb />
			Pat. Cas. 409, the use of anthracite coal in smelting iron ore was held to be a
			<lb />
			good invention, in as much as it produced a better article of iron at a less
			<lb />
			expense, although bituminous coal had been previously used for the same
			<lb />
			purpose. See, also, Steiner v. Heald, 6 Exch. 607.
			<lb />
			Indeed, it often requires as acute a perception of the relations
			<lb />
			between cause and effect, and as much of the peculiar intuitive genius which
			<lb />
			is a characteristic of great inventors, to grasp the idea that a device used in
			<lb />
			one art may be made available in another, as would be necessary to create
			<lb />
			the device de novo. And this is not the less true if, after the thing has been
			<lb />
			done, it appears to the ordinary mind so simple as to excite wonder that it
			<lb />
			was not thought of before. The apparent simplicity of a new device often
			<lb />
			leads an inexperienced person to think that it would have occurred to any
			<lb />
			one familiar with the subject; but the decisive answer is that, with dozens
			<lb />
			and perhaps hundreds of others laboring in the same field, it had never
			<lb />
			occurred to any one before. The practiced eye of an ordinary mechanic may
			<lb />
			be safely trusted to see what ought to be apparent to every one. As was said
			<lb />
			by Mr.Justice Bradely in Loom Co. V. Higgins, 105 U.S. 580, 591 : &apos;Now that
			<lb />
			it has succeeded, it may seem very plain to any one that he could have done
			<lb />
			it as well. This is often the case with inventions of the greatest merit. It may
			<lb />
			be laid down as a general rule, though perhaps not an invariable one, that if
			<lb />
			a new combination an arrangement of known elements produce a new and
			<lb />
			beneficial result, never attained before, it is evidence of invention&apos;.&quot;
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			62
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court summarised the position to the effect that &quot;If the
			<lb />
			new use be so nearly analogous to the former one that the applicability of the device to
			<lb />
			its new use would occur to a person of ordinary mechanical skill, it is only a case of
			<lb />
			double use.&quot;
			<lb />
			113. In Diamond Rubber Co. Vs. Consolidated Tyre Co. [220 US 428
			<lb />
			(1911)], the United States Supreme Court held that where a device possesses such
			<lb />
			amount of change from the prior art, as to receive approval of the patent office, it is
			<lb />
			entitled to the presumption of invention. It was held therein that &quot;law regards a
			<lb />
			change as a novelty and the acceptance and utility of the change as further
			<lb />
			evidence, even as a demonstration of novelty&quot;. An invention may even be the
			<lb />
			successor of all that went before and a step only in the march of improvement. The
			<lb />
			Court indicated that many things seem obvious after they have been done and
			<lb />
			that in the light of an accomplished result, it is often a matter of wonder, how
			<lb />
			they so long eluded the search of the discoverer and set at defiance, the
			<lb />
			speculations of inventive genius. Summarising the opinion of the Court, Justice Mc
			<lb />
			Kenna pointed out that &quot;knowledge after the event is always easy and that
			<lb />
			problems once solved present no difficulties.&quot; After the problems are resolved, they
			<lb />
			may even give a signal as though such problems never existed. Therefore, in so far as
			<lb />
			the case on hand is concerned, the fact that prosthesis was already known in prior art,
			<lb />
			does not by itself disentitle the plaintiff to claim novelty. In other words, it may not be
			<lb />
			open to the defendants to contend that the product of the plaintiff was merely a
			<lb />
			successor of all that was already available in prior art and that therefore, he is not
			<lb />
			entitled to establish novelty.
			<lb />
			114. In Concrete Appliances Co. Vs. Gomery [269 US 177 (1925)], the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			63
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			validity of a claim for patent in respect of a combination of apparatus designed for
			<lb />
			transferring wet concrete or other plastic materials from a source of supply to working
			<lb />
			points on a building or other structure in course of construction, came up for
			<lb />
			consideration. The Supreme Court of the United States applied the test &quot;progressive
			<lb />
			adaptation&quot; developed in Hollister Vs Benedict Manufacturing Co. [113 US 59] and
			<lb />
			held that progressive adaptation of well known devices to new but similar uses is nothing
			<lb />
			but the display of expected skill of the calling and involves only the exercise of ordinary
			<lb />
			faculties of reasoning upon the materials supplied by a special knowledge and the facility
			<lb />
			of manipulation, which results from its habitual and intelligent practice. Therefore, if what
			<lb />
			the plaintiff claims in this case is only a progressive adaptation of the existing devices,
			<lb />
			the same would not qualify as a new invention, in view of the fact that the ultimate
			<lb />
			product is nothing but the display of the expected skill of the calling.
			<lb />
			115. In Pope Appliance Corporation vs. Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills
			<lb />
			Ltd {AIR 1929 Privy Council 38}, the House of Lords indicated the test to determine
			<lb />
			infringement. A simple test is whether anticipation solved the problem solved by the
			<lb />
			patent attacked. As to what constitutes an invention, the Privy Council said as follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;After all, what is invention? It is finding out something
			<lb />
			which has not been found out by other people. This Pope in the
			<lb />
			present patent did. He found out that the paper would so stick,
			<lb />
			and the practical problem was solved. The learned Judges
			<lb />
			below say that all this might have been done by anyone who
			<lb />
			experimented with &quot;doctors&quot; and air blasts already know. That
			<lb />
			is that someone else might have hit upon the invention. There
			<lb />
			are many instances in various branches of science of
			<lb />
			independent investigators making the same discovery. That
			<lb />
			does not prevent the one who first applies and gets a patent
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			64
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			from having a good patent, for a patent represents a quid pro
			<lb />
			quo. The quid to the patentee is the monopoly; the quo is that
			<lb />
			he presents to the public the knowledge which they have not
			<lb />
			got. That knowledge the other inventor has kept sealed in his
			<lb />
			own breast, and he therefore cannot complain that his rival got
			<lb />
			the patent. And if this is the case when a person can show that
			<lb />
			he actually made the discovery, surely that is a much stronger
			<lb />
			case than the present, when the objector does not say that he
			<lb />
			did discover, but only that if he had experimented he would
			<lb />
			have discovered. The real invention often may be and is just
			<lb />
			the last element of the combination. In his address last
			<lb />
			September to the British Association, Sir William Bragg
			<lb />
			described how the location of the German guns was
			<lb />
			discovered. The problem was to find out the exact moment at
			<lb />
			which the wind puff caused by the explosion arrived at the
			<lb />
			British lines. It was known that a wire electrically heated would
			<lb />
			if even slightly cooled show a changed resistance. Would a gun
			<lb />
			puff cool it? To an officer listening to the whistling noise which
			<lb />
			the gun puffs made in the fissures of his tent it occurred that it
			<lb />
			might. It was tried and it did, on which Sir William says:
			<lb />
			&quot;It may be the last little adjustment that turns the scale,
			<lb />
			and the last step is the one that counts&quot;.&quot;
			<lb />
			116. In Cuno Engineering Corp. Vs. Automatic Devices Corp. [314 US 84
			<lb />
			(1941)], claims for improvements in lighters (commonly used in automobiles) for cigars,
			<lb />
			cigarettes and pipes were held invalid for want of invention on the ground that a mere
			<lb />
			addition to the wireless or cordless lighter of a thermostatic control, was not invention,
			<lb />
			but a mere exercise of the skill of the calling and an advance plainly indicated by the prior
			<lb />
			art. The Court held that the new device, even if it performs a new and useful function,
			<lb />
			must reveal the flash of creative genius, not merely the skill of the calling. Even if
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			65
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			ingenuity was required to effect the adaptation, it cannot become an invention if it was
			<lb />
			no more than that to be expected of a mechanic skilled in the art. Cautioning that the
			<lb />
			heavy hand of tribute be not laid on each slight technological advance in an art, the Court
			<lb />
			quoted the opinion of Mr.Justice Bradley in Atlantic Works Vs. Brady (107 US 192), on
			<lb />
			the consequences of the alternative course, as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;Such an indiscriminate creation of exclusive privileges tends rather to
			<lb />
			obstruct than to stimulate invention. It creates a class of speculative
			<lb />
			schemers who make it their business to watch the advancing wave of
			<lb />
			improvement and gather its firm in the form of patented monopolies, which
			<lb />
			enable them to lay a heavy tax upon the industry of the country without
			<lb />
			contributing anything to the real advancement of the art. It embarrasses the
			<lb />
			honest pursuit of business with fears and apprehensions of concealed liens
			<lb />
			and unknown liabilities to law suits and vexatious accountings for profits
			<lb />
			made in good faith.&quot;
			<lb />
			Before 1952, invention or an exercise of the inventive faculty was long regarded, as an
			<lb />
			absolute pre-requisite to patentability, by judicial test. But, in the interest of uniformity
			<lb />
			and definiteness, the Congress articulated the requirement in a statute, by incorporating
			<lb />
			Section 103 in the Patent Act, 1952. This requirement was termed as non obviousness
			<lb />
			and the scope of Section 103 was considered in detail in Graham Vs. John Deere Co.
			<lb />
			[383 US. 1 (1966)]. In other words, the test of &quot;flash of genius&quot; was replaced by the test
			<lb />
			of non obviousness, about which, I shall deal with later.
			<lb />
			117. In A. &amp; P. Tea Co. Vs. Supermarket Corp. [340 US 147] decided way
			<lb />
			back in 1950 by the U.S. Supreme Court, a device known as cashier&apos;s counter equipped
			<lb />
			with a three sided frame or rack, with no top or bottom, which when pushed or pulled,
			<lb />
			will move groceries deposited within it by a customer, to the checking clerk and leave
			<lb />
			them there when it is pushed back to repeat the operation, was the subject matter of an
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			66
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			invention, on which patent claims were made. The District Court and the Court of Appeals
			<lb />
			sustained the validity of the patent claims. Interestingly, the District Court found each
			<lb />
			element in the device to be known to prior art, but yet it held that the conception of a
			<lb />
			counter with an extension to receive a bottomless self loading tray, was decidedly a novel
			<lb />
			feature and hence constituted a new and useful combination. For considering the
			<lb />
			correctness of the decisions of both the courts below, the U.S. Supreme Court framed an
			<lb />
			important question for consideration namely as to what indicia of invention should the
			<lb />
			courts seek in a case where nothing tangible is new and invention, if it existed at all, is
			<lb />
			only in bringing old elements together ? While answering this question, the U.S. Supreme
			<lb />
			Court pointed out the following :
			<lb />
			(i) the key to patentability of a mechanical device that brings old factors into
			<lb />
			cooperation, is the presence or lack of invention;
			<lb />
			(ii) in course of time, the profession came to employ the term &quot;combination&quot; to
			<lb />
			imply its presence and the term &quot;aggregation&quot; to signify its absence, thus making
			<lb />
			antonyms in legal art of words, which in ordinary speech are more nearly synonyms.
			<lb />
			(iii) the concept of invention is inherently elusive when applied to a combination of
			<lb />
			old elements.
			<lb />
			(iv) the mere aggregation of a number of old parts or elements, which in the
			<lb />
			aggregation, perform or produce no new or different function or operation than that
			<lb />
			theretofore performed or produced by them is not patentable invention.
			<lb />
			(v) the conjunction or concert of known elements must contribute something; only
			<lb />
			when the whole in some way exceeds the sum of its parts, is the accumulation of old
			<lb />
			devices patentable.
			<lb />
			(vi) though in chemistry or electronics, elements take on some new quality or
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			67
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			function, when brought into concert, it is not the case with mechanics.
			<lb />
			(vii) Courts should scrutinise combination of patent claims with a care proportioned
			<lb />
			to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old patents. The
			<lb />
			function of a patent is to add to the sum of useful knowledge. Patents cannot be
			<lb />
			sustained, when on the contrary, their effect is to subtract from former resources freely
			<lb />
			available to skilled artisans.
			<lb />
			(viii) a patent for a combination, which only unites old elements with no change in
			<lb />
			their respective functions, obviously withdraws what is already known into the field of its
			<lb />
			monopoly and diminishes the resources available to skillful men.
			<lb />
			(ix) a patentee, who has added nothing to the total stock of knowledge, but has
			<lb />
			merely brought together, segments of prior art and claims them in congregation as a
			<lb />
			monopoly, cannot sustain his claim.
			<lb />
			On the above principles, the Supreme Court reversed the decisions of both the courts
			<lb />
			below.
			<lb />
			118. In Anderson&apos;s Black Rock Inc. Vs. Pavement Co. [369 US 57 (1969)],
			<lb />
			the Court was concerned with a case where an action for infringement of a patent for
			<lb />
			&quot;Means for Treating Bituminous Pavement&quot; was brought before court. The patent sought
			<lb />
			to solve the problem of a cold joint on blacktop paving by combining known elements, a
			<lb />
			radiant-heat burner, a spreader and a tamper and screed, on one chassis. The Court of
			<lb />
			first instance held the patent invalid on the ground that the inventor had merely
			<lb />
			constructed known elements in the prior art on a single chassis. But, the Court of Appeals
			<lb />
			reversed and the matter was taken to the Supreme Court. Two things were agreed on
			<lb />
			facts namely (a) that the patentee had combined four elements which were known in the
			<lb />
			prior art and (b) that the presence of a radiant heat burner was a distinctive feature of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			68
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the patent. Though the Court found that the combination of putting the burner together
			<lb />
			with the other elements in one machine, was a matter of great convenience, the Court
			<lb />
			refused to accept that it produced a new or different function. Ultimately, the Court held
			<lb />
			that though the combination of old elements performed a useful function, it added
			<lb />
			nothing to the nature and quality of the radiant heat burner already patented and that
			<lb />
			something more than mere commercial success was needed for holding it to be an
			<lb />
			invention. The Court pointed out that even if a combination of elements results in an
			<lb />
			effect greater than the sum of the several effects taken separately, a synergistic result
			<lb />
			ought to have been produced, to make it patentable. The Court also held that even if the
			<lb />
			combination filled a long felt need and enjoyed commercial success, it will not make it
			<lb />
			patentable, unless there was an invention. Quoting from Graham, the U.S. Supreme
			<lb />
			Court indicated that Congress may not authorise the issuance of patents, whose effects
			<lb />
			are to remove existence knowledge from the public domain or to restrict free access to
			<lb />
			materials already available.
			<lb />
			119. In Raj Parkash vs. Mangat Ram Choudhary {AIR 1978 Delhi 1}, a
			<lb />
			Division Bench of the Delhi High Court pointed out that a new invention may consist of a
			<lb />
			new combination of all integers so as to produce a new or important result or may consist
			<lb />
			of altogether new integers and the claim for anticipation by the defendant had to be
			<lb />
			either by prior user or by prior publication.
			<lb />
			120. In Monsanto Vs. Merck &amp; Co. Inc. [2000 RPC 709], the English Patents
			<lb />
			Court was concerned with an infringement action brought forth by the manufacturer of a
			<lb />
			new class of non steroidal anti inflammatory drug that could also have low gastric
			<lb />
			irritancy. The defendant denied infringement and also challenged the validity on grounds
			<lb />
			of anticipation, obviousness, insufficiency and added matter. Following the decision in
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			69
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Vs. Firestone Tyre &amp; Rubber Co. [1972 RPC 457], the
			<lb />
			Patents Court held that for a claim to be anticipated, the prior disclosure must contain a
			<lb />
			clear description of something or clear and unambiguous directions to do or make
			<lb />
			something that would infringe the claim, if carried out after the grant of the patents. The
			<lb />
			Court pointed out &quot;a sign post, however clear, upon the road to the patentee&apos;s
			<lb />
			invention will not suffice. The prior inventor must be clearly shown to have
			<lb />
			planted his flag at the precise destination before the patentee.&quot;
			<lb />
			121. In Dhanpat Seth Vs. Nil Kumar Plastic Creates Limited [2008 (36) PTC
			<lb />
			123 (HP)(DB)], the right to patent in respect of a device developed for manual hauling
			<lb />
			of agricultural produce came up for consideration. It was found that the patented device
			<lb />
			was an improvement over a local product known as Kilta made of bamboos by the hill
			<lb />
			tribes. Therefore, the Court held that it was already known to the trade.
			<lb />
			122. In Asian Electronics Limited vs. Havells India Limited {2010 (6) R.A.J.
			<lb />
			589 (Delhi)}, the plaintiff was granted patent in respect of a conversion kit to change
			<lb />
			the fluorescent lighting units inductive operation into electronics operation. Pending suit
			<lb />
			for a permanent injunction and for damages, the plaintiff sought an interim injunction.
			<lb />
			While dismissing the application for temporary injunction, the Delhi High Court took note
			<lb />
			of Section 3(d) of the Act and held that in the absence of an explanation as to how the
			<lb />
			new product had any significant improvement in function or efficiency, it had to be held
			<lb />
			that the patent was hit by anticipation. The Delhi High Court further indicated, following
			<lb />
			the decision in British Celanese Ltd vs. Courtaultds {1935 (52) R.P.C. 171}, that a mere
			<lb />
			placing of old integers side by side, so that each performs its own proper
			<lb />
			function independently of any of the others is not a patentable combination.
			<lb />
			123. In TVS Motor Company Limited vs. Bajaj Auto Limited {2009 (6)
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			70
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			R.A.J. 184 (Mad.)}, a Division Bench of this Court held that there can be no
			<lb />
			infringement if the opponent has proved the same result by a different combination of
			<lb />
			different elements. The Court also pointed out that the patent specification should be
			<lb />
			read by a person skilled in the relevant art, but their construction is for the Court. In
			<lb />
			construing an allegation of infringement, what is to be seen is whether the alleged
			<lb />
			infringement has taken the substance of the invention ignoring the fact as to omission of
			<lb />
			certain parts or addition of certain parts.
			<lb />
			124. From an analysis of the various principles evolved by courts over a period of
			<lb />
			time, it can be safely concluded that sometimes a mere addition of various factors was
			<lb />
			considered by courts to have no novelty. But, sometimes, a combination of existing
			<lb />
			factors, as distinct and different from a mere aggregation of several things, was looked at
			<lb />
			with favour. Keeping these principles in mind, if we have a look at the case on hand, it
			<lb />
			could be seen that though a Custom Mega Prosthesis cannot be said to be a completely
			<lb />
			new product, it represented the next stage in the development of the device as a
			<lb />
			sophisticated one. But, the rotating hinge mechanism and the thrust bearing pad, which
			<lb />
			form essential components of the plaintiff&apos;s product are claimed to be unique, novel and
			<lb />
			an inventive step. Though the defendants have claimed
			<lb />
			that the rotating hinge
			<lb />
			mechanism was already in existence, the defendants do not speak about the thrust
			<lb />
			bearing pad or even a combination of rotating hinge mechanism and thrust bearing pad.
			<lb />
			The combination of these two, are not mere additions, which produce no result, such as
			<lb />
			addition of bicycles and cars. The plaintiff has claimed that the combination (not
			<lb />
			aggregation) of rotating hinge mechanism and thrust bearing pad has resulted in (i) bio-
			<lb />
			compatibility; (ii) flexibility; and (iii) comfort. In other words, a patient, into whose body,
			<lb />
			the plaintiff&apos;s device is planted, is said to have the flexibility of the limb as merely as
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			71
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			possible to its original nature. This aspect is not questioned or challenged by the
			<lb />
			defendants. Therefore, I am of the view that the plaintiff&apos;s product certainly has novelty.
			<lb />
			Hence, let me now move over to the next test namely that of non obviousness.
			<lb />
			NON OBVIOUSNESS :
			<lb />
			125. As pointed out by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
			<lb />
			DyStar, obviousness is a complicated subject requiring sophisticated analysis and no
			<lb />
			single case lays down all facets of the legal test. There is danger inherent in focussing on
			<lb />
			isolated dicta rather than gleaning the law of a particular area from careful reading of the
			<lb />
			full text of a group of related precedents, for all they say that is dispositive and for what
			<lb />
			they hold. When parties do not engage in such careful, candid and complete legal
			<lb />
			analysis, much confusion about the law arises and through time can be compounded.
			<lb />
			126. If we have a careful look at the history of the development of the law of
			<lb />
			patents, it could be seen that until the advent of Section 103 of the Patent Act of 1952
			<lb />
			(USA), there were only two statutory requirements namely that of novelty and utility
			<lb />
			under the 1790 Act as well as 1836 Act. But, Earle Vs. Sawyer [8 F.CAS.254 (1825)],
			<lb />
			was perhaps the first reported patent case where the U.S. Supreme Court used the word
			<lb />
			&quot;obvious&quot;. The Circuit Judge Story denied a motion for a new trial, after the Jury found
			<lb />
			the plaintiff&apos;s patent valid and infringed, rejecting the defendant&apos;s contention that the
			<lb />
			substitution of a circular saw for a perpendicular saw was &quot;so obvious to mechanics&quot;.
			<lb />
			After rejecting the contention that the 1793 Act required the Court to undertake a mode
			<lb />
			of reasoning upon the metaphysical nature or the abstract definition of an invention, the
			<lb />
			Court pointed out that &quot;if it is new, if it is useful, if it has not been known or used before,
			<lb />
			it constitutes an invention&quot;. But, this approach was rejected in Hotchkiss Vs
			<lb />
			Greenwood [52 US 248 (1850)] where the Supreme Court introduced an additional
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			72
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			requirement namely that the invention should also be non obvious. This decision in
			<lb />
			Hotchkiss actually sowed the seeds for the standard of non obviousness. Scholars
			<lb />
			consider Hotchkiss to be an important milestone for three reasons namely (a) that it was
			<lb />
			only in Hotchkiss that the Supreme Court formally disagreed with the notion that novelty
			<lb />
			and utility are sufficient; (b) that it was Hotchkiss which spoke about the subjectivity
			<lb />
			inherent in evaluating an invention popularly known as hindsight; and (c) that it was this
			<lb />
			case that demonstrated the underlying reason, which affects the decision whether a
			<lb />
			particular invention is patentable or not. It was held in Hotchkiss that &quot;[U]nless more
			<lb />
			ingenuity and skill . . . were required . . . than were possessed by an ordinary mechanic
			<lb />
			acquainted with the business, there was an absence of that degree of skill and ingenuity
			<lb />
			which constitute essential elements of every invention. In other words, the improvement
			<lb />
			is the work of the skillful mechanic, not that of the inventor.&quot;
			<lb />
			127. After the introduction of the standard of non obviousness in Hotchkiss, the
			<lb />
			Court introduced the test of &quot;inventive genius&quot; to determine non obviousness, in
			<lb />
			Reckendorfer Vs. Faber [92 US 347 (1875)]. Then came the decision in C &amp; A Potts
			<lb />
			&amp; Co. Vs. Creager [155 US 597 (1895)], which highlighted the importance of
			<lb />
			secondary factors such as commercial success in determining non obviousness. But, from
			<lb />
			1930 to 1952, the trend of invalidating a lot of patents, surfaced in the U.S. Supreme
			<lb />
			Court. It was during this period that the Court developed the test of &quot;flash of creative
			<lb />
			genius&quot; in the year 1941 in Cuno Engineering Corp. Vs. Automatic, by holding that a
			<lb />
			&quot;flash of creative genius&quot; should be present in the device.
			<lb />
			128. After Cuno Engineering Corp. came the decision in Good Year Tyre and
			<lb />
			Rubber Co. Inc. Vs. Ray-O-Vac [321 US 275 (1944)]. In the said case, the Court
			<lb />
			was concerned with the validity and infringement of a patent claim for a leak proof dry
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			73
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			cell for a flash light battery. Admittedly, the claim was in respect of a patent, which was a
			<lb />
			very narrow one in a crowded art, as dry cells had been in use in flash lights for many
			<lb />
			years. While affirming the concurrent findings of the Courts below, holding the patent to
			<lb />
			be valid and infringed, the Supreme Court pointed out that the means adopted by the
			<lb />
			patentee may appear simple, when viewed after the event (after the invention). Post
			<lb />
			event, they may appear obvious to those who worked in the field, but it was not enough
			<lb />
			to negative the invention. But, the Court came to this conclusion in view of the fact that
			<lb />
			for over half a century, the use of flash light batteries increased enormously, despite
			<lb />
			which no manufacturer devised a method of curing the defects that were felt for a long
			<lb />
			time.
			<lb />
			129. Articulating what the Court would expect in such cases, the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			observed in Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. Vs. Supermarket Equipment Corp.
			<lb />
			340 U.S. 147 (1950) that &quot;the invention must serve the ends of science .... to push
			<lb />
			back the frontiers of chemistry, physics and the like; to make a distinctive contribution to
			<lb />
			scientific knowledge&quot;. In this case, the Supreme Court struck down a patent for an
			<lb />
			invention that was a combination of a rack type device for collecting and moving
			<lb />
			groceries at the counter of a supermarket.
			<lb />
			130. Since non obviousness was developed by Courts as an additional requirement
			<lb />
			not traceable to the statute, there was no uniform standard. This gave rise to lot of
			<lb />
			anomalies and hence, the Congress thought fit to codify the requirement of non
			<lb />
			obviousness in the statute, while bringing the new enactment in 1952.
			<lb />
			131. After the new enactment in 1952, came an important decision. It was in
			<lb />
			Graham Vs. John Deere Co., 383 US 1, 13-14 (1966). The factual inquiries
			<lb />
			underlying the question of obviousness, were developed in Graham. In Graham, the U.S.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			74
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Supreme Court was concerned with the patentability of a device designed to absorb
			<lb />
			shock from plow shanks in rocky soil to prevent damage to the plow. The device was only
			<lb />
			a combination of old mechanical devices. In 1955, the Fifth Circuit held the patent valid,
			<lb />
			on the ground that the combination produced an old result in a cheaper and otherwise
			<lb />
			more advantageous way. But, in 1964, the Eighth Circuit held the patent to be invalid on
			<lb />
			the ground that there was no new result in the patented combination. There were also
			<lb />
			two companion cases before the Supreme Court (Calmar Inc. Vs. Cook Chemical Co.
			<lb />
			and Colgate Palmolive Co. Vs Cook Chemical Co.), which concerned the validity of
			<lb />
			patent claims in respect of finger operated sprayers with a &quot;hold-down&quot; cap of the type
			<lb />
			commonly seen on grocers&apos; shelves inserted in bottles of insecticides and other liquids
			<lb />
			prior to shipment. These cases were the first of their kind that came up before the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court after the advent of the Patent Act of 1952. Therefore, the Supreme Court
			<lb />
			pointed out that by Section 103 of the Patent Act of 1952, a third statutory dimension
			<lb />
			namely that of obviousness was added to the two requirements of novelty and utility that
			<lb />
			had been the sole statutory tests ever since the old Patent Act of 1793. After pointing out
			<lb />
			that the federal patent power stems from a specific Constitutional provision that
			<lb />
			authorises the Congress to promote the progress of useful arts, the Court held that
			<lb />
			&quot;innovation, advancement and things which add to the sum of useful knowledge
			<lb />
			are inherent requisites in a patent system for promoting the progress of useful
			<lb />
			arts.&quot; But, the Court warned that one must be guarded against hindsight and that the
			<lb />
			&quot;motivation-suggesting-teaching&quot; requirement protects against the entry of hindsight into
			<lb />
			the obviousness analysis. In other words, the court should resist the temptation to read
			<lb />
			into the prior art, the teachings of the invention in issue. The court defined &quot;motivation-
			<lb />
			suggesting-teaching&quot; test as one in which the court should ask &quot;whether a person of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			75
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			ordinary skill in the art, possessed with the understanding and knowledge reflected in the
			<lb />
			prior art and motivated by the general problem facing the inventor, would have been led
			<lb />
			to make the combination recited in the claims.
			<lb />
			132. In Graham, the Court outlined a four-factor test for determining
			<lb />
			obviousness. They are (i) the Court must determine the scope and content of the prior
			<lb />
			art; (ii) the Court must ascertain the differences between the prior art and the claims at
			<lb />
			issue; (iii) the Court must resolve the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art; and (iv)
			<lb />
			the Court must evaluate the evidence of secondary considerations, which should include
			<lb />
			commercial success, a long felt but unmet need for a device and the failure of others to
			<lb />
			solve the particular problem addressed by the invention in question.
			<lb />
			133. In Dann vs. Johnston {425 US 219 (1976)}, the U.S. Supreme Court was
			<lb />
			concerned with the patentability of a machine system for automatic record keeping of
			<lb />
			bank cheques and deposits under which cheques and deposits are customer labelled with
			<lb />
			code categories which are &quot;read&quot; and then processed by a data processor, such as a
			<lb />
			programmable electronic digital computer, having data storage, files and a control
			<lb />
			system. The patent examiner rejected the claims of the applicant on the ground that they
			<lb />
			were anticipated by the prior art. The Patent and Trademark Office Board of Appeals
			<lb />
			confirmed the said decision on various grounds including obviousness. The applicant went
			<lb />
			before CCPA, which reversed the decision of the Board in a 3:2 ruling and held the
			<lb />
			invention to be patentable. While reversing the decision of Court of Customs and Patents
			<lb />
			Appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court pointed out that &quot;as a judicial test, invention, that is
			<lb />
			the exercise of the inventive faculty, has long been regarded as an absolute
			<lb />
			pre-requisite to patentability and that it was only in 1952 that the Congress, in
			<lb />
			the interest of uniformity and definiteness articulated the requirement in a
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			76
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			statute, framing it as the requirement of non-obviousness in Section 103&quot;. The
			<lb />
			Court further pointed out that as per the decision in Graham, Section 103 (of the U.S. Act
			<lb />
			of 1952), was not intended to change the general level of patentable invention, but was
			<lb />
			meant merely as a codification of judicial precedents. The Court also held that the
			<lb />
			criterion of obviousness is measured not in terms of what would be obvious to
			<lb />
			a lay man, but rather what would be obvious to one reasonably skilled in the
			<lb />
			art.
			<lb />
			134. Another test for determining non obviousness, which had held the field for
			<lb />
			several decades is the &quot;teaching-suggestion-motivation&quot; test. After the advent of
			<lb />
			the 1952 Patent Act, the Courts initially developed only the suggestions test. But, In
			<lb />
			Rinehart, Re., the test of teachings was indicated. The &quot;motivation&quot; part of the test was
			<lb />
			later developed In Helin, Re. In A.C.S.Hospital Systems, Inc. Vs Montefiore
			<lb />
			Hospital [732 F.2d 1572 (Fed.Cir. 1984)], the Court combined all the three and held
			<lb />
			that &quot;obviousness cannot be established by combining the teachings of the prior
			<lb />
			art to produce the claimed invention, absent some teaching or suggestion
			<lb />
			supporting the combination&quot;. The Court was convinced that without applying the TSM
			<lb />
			test, Courts would fall victim to the insidious effect of a hindsight syndrome
			<lb />
			wherein that which only the inventor taught is used against its teacher. The
			<lb />
			Court felt that TSM test is the best test to avoid hindsight bias.
			<lb />
			135. In Alza Corporation Vs Mylan Laboratories, Inc. {464 F. 3d. 1286
			<lb />
			(Fed.Circuit 2006)}, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, was
			<lb />
			concerned with the validity of a claim made by the appellant in respect of a drug which
			<lb />
			they were already marketing and the question of infringement of the same, by the
			<lb />
			respondent, who filed new drug applications for a generic version of the once a day
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			77
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			extended release formulation of the anti incontinence drug by name oxybutynin. While
			<lb />
			holding the claim to be invalid, the Court of Appeals pointed out that &quot;a claimed invention
			<lb />
			is unpatentable, if the differences between it and the prior art are such that the subject
			<lb />
			matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a
			<lb />
			person having ordinary skill in the art&quot;. The Court of Appeals further enlisted the
			<lb />
			following underlying factual inquiries, that would enable the court to answer the question
			<lb />
			of &quot;obviousness&quot; :
			<lb />
			(i) the scope and content of the prior art;
			<lb />
			(ii) the level of ordinary skill in the prior art;
			<lb />
			(iii) the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art;
			<lb />
			(iv) objective evidence of non obviousness.
			<lb />
			136. Though scholars believe that the decision in Graham did not directly support
			<lb />
			the TSM test, the Federal Courts continued to apply TSM test for more than two decades
			<lb />
			until K.S.R. International Co. case arrived. But before the arrival of K.S.R., the United
			<lb />
			States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit indicated in Pfizer, Inc. vs. Apotex,
			<lb />
			Inc., decided on 22.3.2007, the development of two principles namely (i) reasonable
			<lb />
			expectation of success for a skilled artisan and (ii) obvious-to-try. On the first principle,
			<lb />
			the Court held that obviousness cannot be avoided simply by showing some degree of
			<lb />
			unpredictability in the art, so long as there was a reasonable predictability of success.
			<lb />
			The Court indicated that a rule of law equating unpredictability to patentability is not a
			<lb />
			proper standard. On the second principle, the Court held that to be sure, to have a
			<lb />
			reasonable expectation of success, one must be motivated to do more than merely to
			<lb />
			vary all parameters or try each of numerous possible choices until one possibly arrived at
			<lb />
			a successful result where the prior art gave either no indication of which parameters were
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			78
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			critical or no direction as to which of many possible choices is likely to be successful. In
			<lb />
			fact, the Court pointed out that it is difficult to strike a balance between the seemingly
			<lb />
			conflicting truisms between the fact that obvious to try is not the proper standard by
			<lb />
			which to evaluate obviousness and that absolute predictability of success is not required.
			<lb />
			137. The courts were clear that good science and useful contributions do not
			<lb />
			necessarily result in patentability. Courts also developed secondary considerations for
			<lb />
			determining obviousness. They are (i) commercial success (ii) long felt but unsolved
			<lb />
			needs (iii) failure of others etc.
			<lb />
			138. In K.S.R. Vs. Teleflex [550 US 398 (2007)], K.S.R. patented an
			<lb />
			adjustable accelerator pedal system for automobiles with cable-actuated throttles. Two
			<lb />
			years later, Teleflex Inc. obtained exclusive licence to a product, which was described as
			<lb />
			an adjustable accelerator pedal system for automobiles with electronically actuated
			<lb />
			throttles that also included an electronic sensor fixed to the pivot of the pedal. When
			<lb />
			K.S.R. was selected by General Motors to supply adjustable pedal systems and they
			<lb />
			submitted a design, Teleflex put K.S.R. on notice that its proposal may infringe their
			<lb />
			patent. It was followed by an infringement case filed by Teleflex. K.S.R. filed a motion for
			<lb />
			summary judgment of invalidity of the patent of Teleflex on the ground that its design
			<lb />
			was obvious in the light of prior art in existence. For invalidating the patent, the company
			<lb />
			applied Graham Framework and TSM test. Accepting them, the District Court granted
			<lb />
			summary judgment of invalidity of the patent of Teleflex. The Federal Circuit reversed the
			<lb />
			decision of the District Court, by mainly relying on the TSM test. When the matter was
			<lb />
			taken to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of U.S. granted certiorari on the
			<lb />
			question as to whether a patent could be held obvious without proven teaching,
			<lb />
			suggestion or motivation. While reversing the decision of the Federal Court and upholding
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			79
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the decision of the District Court, the U.S. Supreme Court pointed out that one of the
			<lb />
			ways in which a patent&apos;s subject matter could be proved obvious, was by noting that
			<lb />
			there existed, at the time of invention a known problem, for which, there was an obvious
			<lb />
			solution. The Court also pointed out that granting patent protection to advances that
			<lb />
			would occur in the ordinary course without any real innovation would hinder progress and
			<lb />
			might deprive prior inventions of their value and utility. More importantly, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court held that there was no inconsistency between the idea underlying the TSM test and
			<lb />
			the Graham analysis. But, the Court cautioned that the general principles cannot be
			<lb />
			transformed into a rigid rule that limited any enquiry dealing with obviousness. In other
			<lb />
			words, the TSM test is not meant to supplant a fulsome obviousness analysis.
			<lb />
			139. Having seen the development of law in the U.S., from Earle Vs. Sawyer of the
			<lb />
			year 1825, which underwent a drastic change in Graham in the year 1966 and which took
			<lb />
			a leap in K.S.R International in 2007, let me now look at the developments that had
			<lb />
			taken place in England.
			<lb />
			140. In Bristol-Myers Company (Johnson&apos;s) Application [1975 RPC 127],
			<lb />
			the House of Lords was concerned with a patent application that was rejected on the
			<lb />
			ground of prior use. By a majority decision (3:2), the House of Lords drew a distinction
			<lb />
			between &quot;an accidental prior use&quot; and &quot;a habitual prior use&quot;. The majority held
			<lb />
			that prior use, which defeats a patent need not be habitual -one single instance is
			<lb />
			enough; nor need it be for the purposes of trade, if it is use from which the user derives
			<lb />
			a practical benefit. The House of Lords pointed out that intention to do something is a
			<lb />
			&quot;chameleon-like concept&quot;, which takes its colour from the nature of what it is
			<lb />
			that is to be done. Therefore, before considering the question of prior art, the Court
			<lb />
			should keep in mind that the prior use need not be habitual to defeat a patent.

			141. In Windsurfing International Inc. Vs. Tabur Marine, Great Britain
			<lb />
			Limited [1985 RPC 59], the plaintiffs claimed patent in a wind propelled vehicle having
			<lb />
			an unstayed spar connected through a universal joint and a sail attached along one edge
			<lb />
			to the spar. The defendants resisted the action on the ground that it was obvious in view
			<lb />
			either of the prior user or of a printed publication. The Patents Court found the claims to
			<lb />
			be invalid as anticipated by the prior user and obvious in view of a printed publication.
			<lb />
			But, the Patents Court did not make any findings of obviousness based on prior user. The
			<lb />
			plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals and the defendants lodged a notice on the
			<lb />
			question of obviousness over the prior user. The Court of Appeals upheld the claim of
			<lb />
			obviousness over prior user and held as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;(1) The philosophy behind obviousness must take into account the
			<lb />
			same concept as anticipation, namely that it would be wrong to prevent a
			<lb />
			man from doing something which was merely an obvious extension of what
			<lb />
			he had been doing or what was known in the art before the priority date...
			<lb />
			(3) The question of obviousness was not to be answered by looking
			<lb />
			with the benefit of hindsight at what was now known and what had been
			<lb />
			known at the priority date and asking whether the former flowed naturally
			<lb />
			and obviously from the latter, but by hypothesising what would have been
			<lb />
			obvious at the priority date to a person skilled in the art who had access to
			<lb />
			what was known in the art at that date....
			<lb />
			(5) The man skilled in the art must be assumed to be sufficiently
			<lb />
			interested to address his mind to the subject and to consider the practical
			<lb />
			application of the information which he was deemed to have.
			<lb />
			(6) Answering the question on obviousness required four steps to be
			<lb />
			taken :
			<lb />
			(i) identifying the inventive concept embodied in the patent;
			<lb />
			(ii) imputing to a normally skilled but unimaginative addressee what
			<lb />
			was common general knowledge in the art at the priority date;
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			81
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			(iii) identifying the differences if any between the matter cited and
			<lb />
			the alleged invention; and
			<lb />
			(iv) deciding whether those differences, viewed without any
			<lb />
			knowledge of the alleged invention, constituted steps which would have
			<lb />
			been obvious to the skilled man or whether they required any degree of
			<lb />
			invention.&quot;
			<lb />
			142. In Sabaf SpA vs. MFI Furniture Centres {2005 R.P.C. 10}, the House of
			<lb />
			Lords pointed out that two inventions do not become one invention because they are
			<lb />
			included in the same hardware. The House of Lords gave it the term &quot;Law of
			<lb />
			Collocations&quot;, where a claimed step might involve the combination of two inventions.
			<lb />
			143. The test for obviousness laid down by the Court of Appal in Windsurfing,
			<lb />
			which was decided under the 1949 U.K. Act, was adopted to the language of the 1977
			<lb />
			Act. Though several cases were decided after Windsurfing, one of them is of significance
			<lb />
			and that was by the Court of Appeal in Pozzoli Spa Vs. Bdmo SA and Moulage
			<lb />
			Industriel De Perseigne SA [2007 EWCA Civ.558]. In this case, the Court of Appeal
			<lb />
			stated the principles as follows :
			<lb />
			(i) identify the notional person skilled in the art and identify the relevant common
			<lb />
			knowledge of that person;
			<lb />
			(ii) identify the inventive concept of the claim in question or if that could not be
			<lb />
			readily done, construe it;
			<lb />
			(iii) identify what, if any, differences existed between the matter cited as forming
			<lb />
			part of the state of the art and the inventive concept of the claim;
			<lb />
			(iv) viewed without any knowledge of the alleged invention as claimed, did those
			<lb />
			differences constitute steps that would have been obvious to the person skilled in the art
			<lb />
			or did they require any degree of invention.

			144. Coming to the Indian scenario, the Indian Supreme Court had an occasion to
			<lb />
			consider what would constitute an invention or an inventive step in Bishwanath Prasad
			<lb />
			Vs. Hindustan Metal Industries [1979 (2) SCC 511]. This case was decided under
			<lb />
			the Patents and Designs Act of 1911, under which, there were only two requirements
			<lb />
			namely novelty and utility to constitute an invention. After pointing out that in order to
			<lb />
			be patentable, an improvement on something, which is already known, should be
			<lb />
			something more than a mere workshop improvement, the Court pointed out that it must
			<lb />
			independently satisfy the test of invention or an inventive step. It must produce a new
			<lb />
			result or a new article or a better and cheaper article than before. Mere collocation of
			<lb />
			more than one integers or things not involving the exercise of any inventive
			<lb />
			faculty, would not qualify for the grant of a patent.
			<lb />
			145. If we carefully look at the tests adopted by the Supreme Court Bishwanath
			<lb />
			Prasad, we may see that the said case arose under the 1911 Act, which was replaced by
			<lb />
			the later 1970 Act. The 1970 Act itself had undergone significant changes, under the
			<lb />
			Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005, with a view to meet India&apos;s obligations under TRIPS.
			<lb />
			Therefore, it is essential to take a wholesome approach, in view of the developments
			<lb />
			upto 2005.
			<lb />
			146. Keeping the above principles in mind, if we look at the case on hand, it is
			<lb />
			seen that Distal Femoral prosthesis is a device, which is already in existence. There is no
			<lb />
			doubt that the contribution of the plaintiff is certainly an improvement over the existing
			<lb />
			device. Therefore, what is required to be considered is whether or not the improvement
			<lb />
			made by the plaintiff is only a workshop improvement that is so obvious to a person
			<lb />
			skilled in the art. I must also remember that while attempting to find an answer to this
			<lb />
			question, I must cautiously remove the hindsight bias, if any, in the sense that today, the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			83
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			improvement made by the plaintiff may be so obvious to any one that it could have been
			<lb />
			obvious even at the time of adoption of such a step by the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			147. According to the plaintiff, the unique features of his product are (i) use of
			<lb />
			polymer components as journal bearings, which tend to reduce the normal wear and tear
			<lb />
			by more than 90% and give smooth and free articulation of the joints; (ii) use of rotating
			<lb />
			hinge mechanism, which allows a constrained radical freedom between two bones and
			<lb />
			reduces to a large extent, the stress in the bones and joints due to asymmetric loading in
			<lb />
			the normal course of functioning; (iii) the use of extending mechanism that enables the
			<lb />
			prosthesis to expand in-situ after surgery to compensate the growth of symmetric bone
			<lb />
			in the other limb; (iv) the use of pivotal hinge and thrust bearing pad mechanisms, which
			<lb />
			provide friction free articulation.
			<lb />
			148. Though the defendants contend (i) that the use of polymer component is not
			<lb />
			an invention, but what is recommended for surgical application is only Ultra High
			<lb />
			Molecular Weight Poly Ethylene; (ii) that the rotating hinge mechanism was originally
			<lb />
			developed in 1980s by M/s.Howmedica, USA; and (iii) that the use of pivotal hinge is a
			<lb />
			standard concept, the defendants have not produced any evidence to establish these.
			<lb />
			149. What is worse is that DW1 contradicted himself seriously on the first aspect.
			<lb />
			In paragraph 7(i) of the proof affidavit of PW1, he claimed that his product contained
			<lb />
			several unique features, one of which was the use of polymer components as journal
			<lb />
			bearings. In paragraph 20 of his proof affidavit, DW1 claimed that the use of polymer
			<lb />
			component is not an invention and that what was recommended was UHMWPE, which
			<lb />
			was a time tested bio material. But, during cross examination, DW1 stated that the non
			<lb />
			metallic white portion in the middle of MO1 was made up of UHMWPE and that it was a
			<lb />
			polymer. Therefore, it is clear that DW1 did not even know whether what was used in
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			84
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			MO1 was actually a polymer or UHMWPE.
			<lb />
			150. Therefore, it is clear that the defendants did not know the nature of the
			<lb />
			improvements made by the plaintiff to the existing stock of knowledge. The defendants
			<lb />
			did not also establish that the improvements claimed to have been made by the plaintiff
			<lb />
			were anticipated by prior art or at least that they represented what was so obvious to a
			<lb />
			person skilled in the art. Not a scrap of paper was produced to show that any other
			<lb />
			company has already used such distinctive features as claimed by the plaintiff. Therefore,
			<lb />
			I am of the view that the plaintiff&apos;s product would also pass the test of non obviousness.
			<lb />
			UTILITY/INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION :
			<lb />
			151. Now, let me move on to the third test namely that of utility.
			<lb />
			152. Utility/industrial application has always been one of the requirements for
			<lb />
			patentability of a product. This was recognised by the Supreme Court in Bishwanath
			<lb />
			Prasad. The usefulness of an invention is to be judged with reference to the state of
			<lb />
			things at the date of filing of the patent application. If the invention was useful at that
			<lb />
			time, the fact that subsequent improvements made it obsolete would not be of any
			<lb />
			concern.
			<lb />
			153. Keeping the above principles in mind, if we have a look at the plaint, it can be
			<lb />
			seen that according to the plaintiff, the pivotal hinge mechanism with a bio-compatible
			<lb />
			polymer journal bearing, imparts friction free articulating motion of the new joint.
			<lb />
			Consequently, a maximum flexion of about 140 degree to the dorsal side of the
			<lb />
			prosthesis is achieved. The plaintiff has claimed that the durability of the implant is
			<lb />
			increased by the thrust bearing pad mechanism which reduces the frictional wear
			<lb />
			between the metallic surfaces and by relocating the load transmitted to the pivot pin and
			<lb />
			the tibial component on weight bearing. He also claims that the rotating axis mechanism
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			85
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			decreases the stress at the bone implant junction.
			<lb />
			154. In other words, the plaintiff has listed out various functional uses and the
			<lb />
			usefulness of his invention in graphic details in the plaint. These claims made in
			<lb />
			paragraph 12 of the plaint are not denied by the first defendant in their written
			<lb />
			statement. In paragraph 9 of their written statement, the first defendant has simply
			<lb />
			stated that they have no knowledge as to the correctness of the claims so made by the
			<lb />
			plaintiff in paragraph 12 of the plaint. Therefore, I have to conclude that the claim of the
			<lb />
			plaintiff with regard to utility/usefulness of his invention, has gone unchallenged. Even
			<lb />
			the written statement of defendants 2 and 3 do not contain a challenge to these claims of
			<lb />
			the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			155. However, the fourth defendant, in paragraph 19 of their written statement,
			<lb />
			has dealt with the claims of the plaintiff in paragraph 12 of the plaint. But, they have not
			<lb />
			denied the usefulness/utility of the invention of the plaintiff. All that the fourth defendant
			<lb />
			has stated in paragraph 19 of their written statement is that the distal femoral prosthesis
			<lb />
			and the proximal tibial prosthesis have been in existence for a longtime. Therefore, it is
			<lb />
			clear that the usefulness of the plaintiff&apos;s product is not challenged by the defendants. On
			<lb />
			the contrary, the utility value of the product is established by the information provided in
			<lb />
			the book published by the co-patentee, who is himself an Orthopaedic-Surgeon of repute.
			<lb />
			Hence, the product of the plaintiff also passes the third test, namely that of
			<lb />
			utility/industrial application.
			<lb />
			156. In view of the above, I hold on issue No.10 that the patents registered in
			<lb />
			favour of the plaintiff along with his co-patentee, qualify as valid patents, fulfilling the
			<lb />
			requirements of novelty, non obviousness and usefulness.
			<lb />
			ISSUE Nos.1 to 3:
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			86
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			157. Issue Nos.1 to 3 deal with the entitlement of the plaintiff to a decree for
			<lb />
			permanent injunction restraining the defendants from infringing patent Nos.196333,
			<lb />
			198872 and 198869. But as I have pointed out in paragraph 65, the area of dispute is
			<lb />
			now confined only to the product, whose patent number is 196333, which correspondents
			<lb />
			to design No.191946. Therefore, the answer to these 3 issues viz., whether the plaintiff is
			<lb />
			entitled to a decree of permanent injunction in respect of 3 patents, has to be considered
			<lb />
			in two parts. The first would relate to patent Nos.198872 and 198869. The second would
			<lb />
			relate to patent No.196333.
			<lb />
			158. In so far as patent Nos.198872 and 198869 are concerned, the admission
			<lb />
			made by the first defendant in paragraph 3 of their written statement is recorded and I
			<lb />
			hold that it is sufficient to record on issue Nos.1 to 3 that the first defendant is not
			<lb />
			engaged in manufacturing products covered by patent Nos.198872 and 198869.
			<lb />
			159. Coming to patent No.196333, the question of infringement has to be decided
			<lb />
			primarily with respect to two questions viz., (i) whether the first defendant is engaged in
			<lb />
			the manufacturing, making or use of a prosthesis that is identical to the registered patent
			<lb />
			of the plaintiff and (ii) whether the same tantamounts to an infringement.
			<lb />
			160. In paragraph 8 of the written statement, the first defendant has given a chart
			<lb />
			indicating the special features of the plaintiff&apos;s product and the features of the first
			<lb />
			defendant&apos;s prosthesis. The tabular column can be usefully extracted as follows:-

			<lb />
			Locking hole provided to facilitate locking of the

			<lb />
			161. The distinguishing features that the first defendant has pleaded in its written
			<lb />
			statement, have not been challenged by the plaintiff by filing any reply to the written
			<lb />
			statement.
			<lb />
			162. In the course of evidence, PW-1 has stated, in paragraph 20 of the proof
			<lb />
			affidavit, that he only reliably learnt that the defendants 1 to 4 were making, using,
			<lb />
			exercising, selling and distributing the patented CMP, thus infringing the monopoly rights.
			<lb />
			In other words, the entire claim of the plaintiff is based upon what he &quot;reliably learnt&quot;
			<lb />
			and not what he actually saw. In fact, after stating in paragraph 20 that it had reliably
			<lb />
			come to his knowledge that the defendants were infringing his patent rights, the plaintiff,
			<lb />
			as PW-1, has spoken about the cease and desist notice in paragraph 21 of the proof
			<lb />
			affidavit. In paragraph 22, he has spoken about the reply given by the first defendant,
			<lb />
			calling for information and the rejoinder issued by the plaintiff. In paragraph 23 of the
			<lb />
			proof affidavit, the plaintiff speaks about the fact that the first defendant had not
			<lb />
			obtained any registration with regard to any prosthesis under any patent. After stating
			<lb />
			so, the plaintiff, as PW-1, has jumped to a conclusion, in paragraph 24, that there was
			<lb />
			infringement. The relevant portion of paragraph 24 of the proof affidavit of PW01 is as
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			88
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;From all that has been stated supra, it will be evident that all
			<lb />
			the essential features of the patented knee joint prosthesis, in
			<lb />
			particular &quot;DFP&quot;, have been used in the infringing apparatus and the
			<lb />
			infringing apparatus is the absolute replica of the patented
			<lb />
			prosthesis.&quot;
			<lb />
			163. From paragraphs 1 to 23, of the proof affidavit, there is no reference to the
			<lb />
			actual physical examination of the prosthesis manufactured by the first defendant and a
			<lb />
			comparison of the features between the products of both.
			<lb />
			164. During the cross-examination of the counsel for the second and third
			<lb />
			defendants, one question was put to PW-1 namely as to whether he had seen the
			<lb />
			product used by defendants 2 and 3, as referred to in Ex.P-11. PW-1 stated that he had
			<lb />
			not seen the product. It is only from the report and the sketches that the plaintiff came
			<lb />
			to the conclusion that the second and third defendants were also infringing his patents.
			<lb />
			165. The Officer of the first defendant, who was examined as DW-1, produced a
			<lb />
			prosthesis manufactured by the first defendant as MO-2. He is a Mechanical Engineer by
			<lb />
			qualification and he stated that he is acquainted with the manufacture of Bio-Medical
			<lb />
			products like prosthesis. He claimed that the prosthesis manufactured by the plaintiff and
			<lb />
			the prosthesis manufactured by the first defendant, do not have one-to-one similarity.
			<lb />
			166. DW-1 was extensively cross-examined by the counsel for the plaintiff. During
			<lb />
			cross-examination, DW-1 admitted that MO-2 is also a distal femoral prosthesis and that
			<lb />
			it is manufactured of Titanium Alloy.
			<lb />
			167. During cross-examination, DW-1 dismantled MO-1 manufactured by the
			<lb />
			plaintiff. After dismantling, the counsel for the plaintiff asked DW-1 whether the
			<lb />
			dismantled parts of MO-1 tallied with Figure-3 in Ex.P-2, which contained the exploded
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			89
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			view of MO-1. But DW-1 replied that there were some differences. The differences
			<lb />
			pointed out by DW-1 between the dismantled parts of MO-1 and the parts shown in
			<lb />
			Figure-3 of Ex.P-2, are as follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;In Figure-3 of Ex.P-2, there is a component identified as
			<lb />
			No.14. It is not found in MO-1. The component indicated as
			<lb />
			item No.5 in Figure 3 of Ex.P-2 is shown to be a single piece.
			<lb />
			But in MO-1, it consists of two pieces, one metallic and one
			<lb />
			polymer. All the other components in Figure 3 of Ex.P-2 are
			<lb />
			found in MO-1. Item No.13 in Figure 3 of Ex.P-2 comprises of
			<lb />
			two screws. Item No.14 which I earlier said to be not there, are
			<lb />
			only two washers for Item No.13, which are two screws.
			<lb />
			Component No.5 comprises of two parts in MO-1, while it is
			<lb />
			shown in Figure 3 of Ex.P-2 as one single part.&quot;
			<lb />
			168. Thereafter, the counsel for the plaintiff asked DW-1 to dismantle MO-2.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, it was dismantled by DW-1. Thereafter the learned counsel for the plaintiff
			<lb />
			cross-examined DW-1 on the nature of the component parts of MO-2. The upper portion
			<lb />
			of MO-2 after dismantling was identified by DW-1 as distal femoral piece, though the
			<lb />
			counsel for the plaintiff claimed it as condylar component and femoral shaft. Similarly, he
			<lb />
			identified the distal femoral piece in MO-1, but stated that in MO-1, it is a combination of
			<lb />
			six parts together with washers rather than a single part and that they are given serial
			<lb />
			Nos.1, 3, 3A, 13 and 14 in Figure-3 of Ex.P-2. But in MO-2, it is a straight piece. MO-1
			<lb />
			has a valgus angle piece for left limb and a grooved collar near the stem, which is not
			<lb />
			there in MO-2. He also pointed out that in MO-1, there are 3 longitudinal grooves in the
			<lb />
			stem which are not there in MO-2. Similarly, DW-1 pointed out that the contour of the
			<lb />
			gaps between the two condyles is different in MO-1 and MO-2.
			<lb />
			169. When the lower part of MO-2 was shown by the counsel for the plaintiff to
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			90
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			DW-1, he agreed that it was a tibial component. After identifying the tibial component in
			<lb />
			MO-1, which was shown at No.4 in Figure-3 of Ex.P-2, the witness stated that there are
			<lb />
			differences between the tibial components of MO-1 and MO-2 and that in MO-1, the tibial
			<lb />
			stem is straight whereas in MO-2 it is tilted at an angle. Similarly, in MO-1, there are
			<lb />
			longitudinal grooves on the stem for the purpose of locking. But in MO-2, the grooves are
			<lb />
			not there. However, a hole is provided for locking with a stem.
			<lb />
			170. The learned counsel for the plaintiff then proceeded to cross-examine DW-1
			<lb />
			on one component which acted as the connecting link between the tibial component and
			<lb />
			the distal femoral piece in MO-1 and MO-2. After identifying the said component, DW-1
			<lb />
			again pointed out the difference between them. While in MO-1, the oval shape plate with
			<lb />
			a grooved portion was in the middle with protrusions on both sides to hold what is slid in
			<lb />
			between, there were no such protrusions in MO-2. Similarly, the locking holes on both
			<lb />
			MO-1 and MO-2 were different. There was also a difference in the cylindrical projecting
			<lb />
			pin. In fact, DW-1 admitted that MO-1 contained a better feature in so far as the polymer
			<lb />
			pad is concerned.
			<lb />
			171. The learned counsel for the plaintiff then focussed attention on the UHMWPE
			<lb />
			in MO-1 and MO-2 and questioned DW-1 as to whether there were any functional
			<lb />
			differences. DW-1 pointed out that in MO-1, the horse shoe shaped polymer pad is slid
			<lb />
			into the grooves of the link component and held tightly by the clip shaped protrusions.
			<lb />
			But in MO-2, the pad is thrust from the top without anything to hold it tightly. Therefore,
			<lb />
			the movement in MO-2 is from the top to the bottom. Here again, DW-1 conceded that
			<lb />
			the pad in MO-1 is superior to the one used in MO-2.
			<lb />
			172. The focus then shifted to the hinge pin in both MO-1 and MO-2. DW-1 replied
			<lb />
			that the hinge pin in MO-1 is different from the hinge pin in MO-2. While the hinge pin in
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			91
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			MO-2 is a solid one which had two slots on both ends, the hinge pin in MO-1 is a hollow
			<lb />
			one. PW-1 also agreed that the function of the hinge pin in MO-1 is to bear the load.
			<lb />
			173. When questioned, DW-1 agreed that MO-2 was manufactured for a specific
			<lb />
			patient in 2006 at the instance of the fourth defendant and it was not supplied in view of
			<lb />
			the notice received from the plaintiff. He also conceded that the supply was stopped since
			<lb />
			it was found that there were some similarities between both products, both functionally
			<lb />
			and by shape.
			<lb />
			174. More importantly, DW-1 stated two things which are of great significance viz.,
			<lb />
			(i) that though the first defendant is a Defence Organisation not engaged in the business
			<lb />
			of manufacturing prosthesis, they undertook this as corporate social responsibility in view
			<lb />
			of the fact that most of the applications handled by the first defendant are used only for
			<lb />
			destructive purposes; and (ii) that the first defendant manufactured a total of only 4
			<lb />
			prosthesis of the type MO-2, out of which 3 had already been supplied to patients. The
			<lb />
			first defendant is not actually manufacturing a stereo type of prosthesis, but are
			<lb />
			manufacturing different types. After having said this, DW-1 denied the suggestion made
			<lb />
			by the counsel for the plaintiff that they manufactured MO-2 after dismantling MO-1 and
			<lb />
			by adopting a process of reverse engineering.
			<lb />
			175. Therefore, on a careful consideration of the evidence let in by the plaintiff and
			<lb />
			the evidence let in by the first defendant, the following inferences become inevitable:-
			<lb />
			(i) that apart from producing a project report of a student/Research Assistant at
			<lb />
			the Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology (Ex.P-13) and providing a
			<lb />
			comparative chart with sketches as Ex.P-62, the plaintiff could not produce any evidence
			<lb />
			to show actual infringement by the first defendant or by any other defendants;
			<lb />
			(ii) that on the contrary, the first defendant adopted a very fair and reasonable
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			92
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			approach by producing the prosthesis manufactured by them as MO-2 and by dismantling
			<lb />
			through DW-1 both MO-1 and MO-2 and demonstrating the distinguishing features of
			<lb />
			both. Therefore, all that the plaintiff has been able to establish is only his suspicion that
			<lb />
			the first defendant might be infringing is patent. But the air of suspicion is cleared by
			<lb />
			DW-1 by producing their own prosthesis, dismantling the same, pointing out the
			<lb />
			differences and by showing that they were not competitors in the industry to the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			The first defendant is admittedly a Defence Organisation involved in completely different
			<lb />
			type of business. They are not competitors to the plaintiff in the business of manufacture
			<lb />
			of prosthesis. The claim of the first defendant that they charge patients on cost-to-cost
			<lb />
			basis and that they manufacture this as part of corporate social responsibility, is not
			<lb />
			challenged by the plaintiff. Therefore, I am of the view that the factum of infringement of
			<lb />
			patent has not been established clearly by the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			176. In Rodi and Wienenberger AG vs. Henry Snowell Ltd {1969 (12) RPC
			<lb />
			367}, the House of Lords indicated that there could be two types of infringement viz., (i)
			<lb />
			direct infringement which is otherwise known as textual infringement; and (ii) indirect
			<lb />
			infringement which is otherwise understood as infringement in substance. In the case on
			<lb />
			hand, there is no textual infringement, in view of the dissimilarities pointed out by DW-1
			<lb />
			during cross-examination. Therefore, all that the plaintiff can claim is that there was an
			<lb />
			infringement in substance. But what constitutes an infringement in substance was
			<lb />
			articulated in Birmingham Sound Reproducers Ltd v Collaro Ltd {(1956) RPC 232
			<lb />
			(CA)}, as follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;The question therefore appears to be whether the
			<lb />
			allegedly infringing apparatus consists of substantially the same
			<lb />
			parts acting upon each other in substantially the same way as
			<lb />
			the apparatus claimed as constituting the invention. It is not
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			93
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			enough to find that the parts comprised in the defendants&apos;
			<lb />
			apparatus individually or collectively perform substantially
			<lb />
			similar functions to those performed individually or collectively
			<lb />
			by the parts comprised in the apparatus claimed as the
			<lb />
			plaintiffs&apos; invention, or that the defendants&apos; apparatus produces
			<lb />
			the same result as the plaintiffs&apos; apparatus. It must be shown
			<lb />
			that the defendants&apos; selection and arrangement of parts is
			<lb />
			substantially the same as the plaintiffs&apos; selection and
			<lb />
			arrangements of parts, for it is in such selection and
			<lb />
			arrangement that the plaintiffs&apos; invention resides.&quot;
			<lb />
			177. Section 271(c) of the U.S. Patent {Patent Act 35 U.S.C.} speaks of
			<lb />
			contributory infringement. Under the said provision, whoever offers for sale or sells a
			<lb />
			component of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or composition or a
			<lb />
			material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process constituting a material part
			<lb />
			of the invention, shall be liable as a contributory infringer. In fact, prior to the 1952
			<lb />
			Patent Act (U.S.), the statute did not define contributory infringement. Therefore, it was
			<lb />
			only by judicial precedents that infringement was divided into two categories viz., (i)
			<lb />
			direct infringement and (ii) contributory infringement. But the 1952 Act, divided the
			<lb />
			judicially created category of contributory infringement into two statutory sub-sections
			<lb />
			viz., Section 271(b) dealing with inducement of infringement and Section 271(c)
			<lb />
			speaking of contributory infringement.
			<lb />
			178. But in the case on hand, even the test of indirect infringement as articulated
			<lb />
			in Birmingham and reaffirmed in Rodi, cannot be applied for one simple reason. It is
			<lb />
			admitted by the plaintiff that distal femoral prosthesis itself is not his invention. The
			<lb />
			plaintiff also admits that there are various types of prosthesis available in the market for
			<lb />
			the past more than five decades. The fact that there are various types of prosthesis
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			94
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			available in the market and the fact that there has been a stage-by-stage improvement
			<lb />
			of different types of prosthesis, is a knowledge that is actually in public domain and
			<lb />
			hence, I can take note of the developments that have taken place in this field for the past
			<lb />
			five decades.
			<lb />
			179. If we look at the history of development of prosthesis it can be seen that till
			<lb />
			the year 1952, every patient with a primary malignant tumour of musculo skeletal
			<lb />
			system, had to undergo only an amputation and they had no surgical treatment. The
			<lb />
			conventional treatment for bone tumours was just surgical removal of the affected part of
			<lb />
			the body. With the advancement of medical science, the technique of removing only the
			<lb />
			tumour and saving the limb, which came to be known as Limb Salvage, was developed
			<lb />
			over the years. The early methods of reconstruction after Limb Salvage, used patient&apos;s
			<lb />
			own bone from another part of the body. But, nothing could be done about the knee
			<lb />
			motion. (refer the article &quot;Distal Femoral Replacement by Custom Made Prosthesis&quot; by
			<lb />
			C.R.Bradish and others from the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore)
			<lb />
			180. However, it appears that the replacement of the distal femur and knee joint
			<lb />
			was first performed at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in 1952 on a 24 year old
			<lb />
			man suffering from hydatid disease. It appears that clinical aspects of the design and
			<lb />
			use of CMP were discussed by Scales and others way back in 1965 and then in 1973,
			<lb />
			1982 and 1984. Jackson Burrows Wilson and Scales also came up with their own
			<lb />
			suggestions in 1975 and Sim and Chao did so in 1979 and 1983. Watts made his own
			<lb />
			contribution in 1983. As a matter of fact, an International Symposium was held, way
			<lb />
			back on 1985 on Limb Salvage in Musculo Skeletal Oncology. It appears that the first
			<lb />
			three prosthesis, inserted in 1952, 1954 and 1957 were fixed by extra medullary plates.
			<lb />
			181. The first of them was made of acrylic dental polymer, but it failed due to a
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			95
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			combination of medial skin necrosis. Since the prosthesis was too wide, a seizure of the
			<lb />
			joint was caused by swelling of the nylon axle. Consequently, the limb was amputated.
			<lb />
			The second prosthesis, according to the paper, was made of cobalt-chromium-
			<lb />
			molybdenum alloy with fixation by integrally cast slotted plates. It was used for a woman
			<lb />
			with a giant cell tumour. This prosthesis functioned satisfactorily for 21 years, until
			<lb />
			fracture of one of the femoral plates necessitated its removal and replacement. The
			<lb />
			replacement was with intermedullary stemmed prosthesis. The third prosthesis was used
			<lb />
			for a woman with rheumatoid arthritis. But, the design that was in use at that time
			<lb />
			necessitated removal of 58 mm of distal femur and proximal tibia. It appears that
			<lb />
			thereafter, the surgeons started using standard Stanmore knees modified by the addition
			<lb />
			of an extension femoral shaft and stem. The femoral stem is either bolted or heat shrunk
			<lb />
			into the shaft. It is D-shaped in cross section. Interestingly, the above paper presented
			<lb />
			by Bradish and others shows that all prosthesis are custom made, with dimensions being
			<lb />
			determined by measurement from the patient&apos;s radiographs. One paragraph from the
			<lb />
			said paper is of interest and hence, it is reproduced as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;The standard Stanmore knee replacement is made from a cobalt-
			<lb />
			chromium-molybdenum alloy whilst extension shaft and stem were at first
			<lb />
			made from T5 (commercially pure titanium), but following two stem
			<lb />
			fractures and the realisation that this material was mechanically inadequate,
			<lb />
			all subsequent stems were made from TA1 (a titanium alloy containing 6%
			<lb />
			aluminium and 4% vanadium). Patients have routine patch testing, and any
			<lb />
			who were found to be sensitive to the constituents of Co-Cr-Mo alloy were
			<lb />
			given prosthesis manufactured entirely from titanium alloy&quot;.
			<lb />
			182. The paper also shows that several design modifications were made during the
			<lb />
			period 1970-78. In 1970, a metal/high density polyethylene hinge was introduced. In
			<lb />
			1978, a ceramic coated axle for the titanium alloy prosthesis was introduced. Though I
			<lb />
		</body>

		<body>
			have collected these details from the article referred to above, their authenticity is not in
			<lb />
			doubt. This is in view of the fact that the above facts are corroborated even by the
			<lb />
			contents of the book titled &quot;Custom Mega Prosthesis &amp; Limb Salvage Surgery&quot; authored
			<lb />
			by Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan. This book is marked as Ex.P56 by PW1 himself. In the
			<lb />
			introductory chapter, Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan has traced the history of the dawn of
			<lb />
			chemotherapy and prosthesis. In Chapter II of Ex.P56, under the title &quot;Review of
			<lb />
			Literature&quot;, Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan has referred to Burrows, Wilson and Scales
			<lb />
			(1975) and to Bradish, Kemp et al (1987) as well as to Ross and Wilson (1987) and
			<lb />
			Khong, Chao, Sim (1987). This is why I have also chosen to refer to those pioneers in the
			<lb />
			field.
			<lb />
			183. In order to understand the above developments, the pictorial representations
			<lb />
			of the distal femoral prosthesis, developed stage-by-stage from 1951 onwards, are
			<lb />
			presented in pictorial form as follows:-

			184. A careful look at the pictures would show that every advancement made to
			<lb />
			the existing knowledge, was actually slender. I do not know whether these small
			<lb />
			adjustments and alterations, which offered better flexion and movement to patients,
			<lb />
			were patented and if patented, whether their validity was tested. But, one thing is clear,
			<lb />
			namely that every advancement or development, was aimed at making the prosthesis
			<lb />
			sync with human anatomy, so that it becomes a perfect replacement for the natural bone
			<lb />
			and knee joint. This is why the defendants set up the plea of obviousness on the ground
			<lb />
			that these developments were known or at least expected in prior art, for persons skilled
			<lb />
			in the art. But I rejected that argument with a view to give the benefit of some
			<lb />
			innovation to the plaintiff. Therefore, as a corollary, the defendants are also entitled to
			<lb />
			the benefit of the dissimilarities that exist between their prosthesis and the plaintiff&apos;s
			<lb />
			prosthesis.
			<lb />
			185. The plaintiff claims that his patent has to be seen with specific reference to
			<lb />
			the teachings, claims and specifications, which constitute an inventive step or in other
			<lb />
			words, an advance of technology. Therefore, unless the plaintiff establishes that the
			<lb />
			distinguishing features of the first defendant&apos;s product are so trivial or merely cosmetic,
			<lb />
			the plaintiff cannot make out a case of infringement. Just as the plaintiff is entitled to
			<lb />
			every substantial advancement of an existing product and claim that there was an
			<lb />
			inventive step involved, other people are also entitled to make similar claims.
			<lb />
			186. But there is one fundamental difference. The claims as the teachings and
			<lb />
			specifications that a patentee makes, stand on a different footing than the claims made
			<lb />
			by another competitor in defence to an action for infringement. While the test for finding
			<lb />
			out whether there was an inventive step in the product of a patentee, is very rigid, the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			100
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			test for determining whether there was an infringement of such a right, is not so rigid.
			<lb />
			To put it differently, the distinguishing features of the product of the first
			<lb />
			defendant as seen from MO-2 may not qualify their product for a valid patent
			<lb />
			registration. But they will certainly provide a shield for a defendant against an
			<lb />
			action in infringement. In other words, every change made by a defendant in an
			<lb />
			action for infringement need not necessarily pass the test of inventive step, even to
			<lb />
			escape liability of infringement.
			<lb />
			187. There is one more reason as to why I would accept the distinguishing features
			<lb />
			pointed out by the first defendant between MO-1 and MO-2, to hold that there was no
			<lb />
			infringement. Though the superficial appearance of MO-1 and MO-2 is misleading, as can
			<lb />
			be seen from pictures 4 and 5 in paragraph 183 above, I am obliged to see whether the
			<lb />
			individual components or the integers that constitute the whole product, also have
			<lb />
			similarities. This is what the plaintiff himself demands. Therefore, DW1 dismantled both
			<lb />
			MO-1 and MO-2 and showed, to my naked eye, though not considered to be skilled in the
			<lb />
			art in question, that these distinguishing features do exist.
			<lb />
			188. Actually, the plaintiff had a better chance to convince me that these
			<lb />
			distinguishing features are very trivial and that there was an &quot;infringement in
			<lb />
			substance&quot;. The plaintiff was only one of the two patentees, the other being a very
			<lb />
			reputed orthopaedic surgeon by name Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan. The co-patentee did
			<lb />
			not show any interest either in joining the plaintiff and seeking reliefs against the
			<lb />
			defendants, or in coming forward at least to give evidence as a person actually in the
			<lb />
			field.
			<lb />
			189. What is more interesting is that the co-patentee Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan
			<lb />
			has been performing surgeries both for his own patients as well as for the patients of the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			101
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			defendants 2 to 4 hospitals. The first defendant has stated clearly in their written
			<lb />
			statement that they had interactions with the co-patentee Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan
			<lb />
			and developed two prosthesis, for the surgeries conducted by the very patients of the co-
			<lb />
			patentee.
			<lb />
			190. If the co-patentee Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan himself allowed the first
			<lb />
			defendant to manufacture prosthesis for the surgeries conducted by him, despite the
			<lb />
			plaintiff having his own factory for the manufacture of the product, there are two
			<lb />
			inferences possible. They are: (i) either the co-patentee acquiesced in the infringement
			<lb />
			of his patent rights by the first defendant, or (ii) the co-patentee who actually had the
			<lb />
			benefit of seeing the prosthesis manufactured by the first defendant with his own eyes
			<lb />
			and with his own expertise, was convinced that there were distinguishing features, that
			<lb />
			kept the case out of the mischief of infringement.
			<lb />
			191. The plaintiff filed the affidavit of the co-patentee Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan
			<lb />
			as Ex.P64. I have already indicated in paragraphs 21 to 28, the extent to which this
			<lb />
			affidavit could be relied upon. The co-patentee&apos;s assertion in Ex.P64 that there was
			<lb />
			infringement, cannot be accepted as he did not offer to be a witness. If he had come to
			<lb />
			the witness box, I would have had the benefit of his cross examination by the
			<lb />
			defendants, to see whether there were such striking similarities between the two
			<lb />
			products, as to constitute infringement. This is why I indicated in paragraph 28 that his
			<lb />
			affidavit Ex.P64 can be accepted only for the limited purpose of showing that he had no
			<lb />
			conflict of interest with the co-patentee, namely the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			192. Once it is clear that every prosthesis, the oldest of which came into existence
			<lb />
			in 1951-1952, was only an advancement, stage-by-stage, the first defendant is entitled
			<lb />
			to the same benefit as the plaintiff has had. As a matter of fact, the first defendant is not
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			102
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			seeking the very same benefit as the plaintiff has sought. This is seen from the following
			<lb />
			3 factors:
			<lb />
			(i) The modifications made by the plaintiff to the then existing prosthesis, is
			<lb />
			patented by the plaintiff. The first defendant is not even seeking a patent right, but
			<lb />
			merely pointing out that they were also entitled to make modifications on the basic
			<lb />
			features of a product in existence for five decades.
			<lb />
			(ii) While the very business of the plaintiff is to manufacture and sell prosthesis,
			<lb />
			the business of the first defendant is completely different. There is no serious dispute
			<lb />
			about the fact that the manufacture and supply of distal femoral prosthesis by the first
			<lb />
			defendant, is on a cost-to-cost basis, undertaken as part of their Corporate Social
			<lb />
			Responsibility. This is why the plaintiff&apos;s product is priced at Rs.1,36,000/-, while the first
			<lb />
			defendant&apos;s product is priced at Rs.39,200/-.
			<lb />
			(iii) At least in two aspects, DW1 conceded that MO-1 manufactured by the plaintiff
			<lb />
			had better features. Despite this knowledge, the first defendant did not make a slavish
			<lb />
			re-production of the patented product. Therefore, it is clear that there was neither an
			<lb />
			intention nor a desire on the part of the first defendant to commit infringement of the
			<lb />
			registered patent of the plaintiff. The first defendant does not stand to benefit out of such
			<lb />
			infringement, as they are not in this business.
			<lb />
			193. I will be failing in my duty if I do not point out one important aspect about the
			<lb />
			conduct of the first defendant. I have already noted that the plaintiff could not produce
			<lb />
			any evidence to prove actual infringement, but produced some material only to show
			<lb />
			suspicion of a possible infringement. The defendants did not take advantage of this. The
			<lb />
			first defendant produced MO-2 and established the distinguishing features, despite not
			<lb />
			being called upon through any notice to produce the same.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			103
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			194. In view of the above, I hold on Issue Nos.1 to 3 that the plaintiff has failed to
			<lb />
			establish infringement of their patent No.196333. The distinguishing features pointed out
			<lb />
			by the first defendant in their written statement as well as in evidence and also
			<lb />
			demonstrated before me by dismantling MO-1 and MO-2, convince me that there is no
			<lb />
			infringement. Hence, Issue Nos.1 to 3 are to be answered against the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			195. One argument advanced by Mr.N.L.Rajah, learned counsel appearing for the
			<lb />
			fourth defendant is that the prosthesis, in respect of which, the plaintiff is claiming patent
			<lb />
			protection, is actually a drug and that therefore, the principles behind the provisions of
			<lb />
			Section 83(d) and (g) of the Patents Act, 1970 are to be taken note of. In support of his
			<lb />
			contention that the prosthesis in question is a drug, the learned counsel relies upon a
			<lb />
			decision of the Supreme Court in Chimanlal Jagjivandas Sheth Vs. State of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra [AIR 1963 SC 665].
			<lb />
			196. Since I have recorded a finding that the plaintiff has not established
			<lb />
			infringement, it may not be necessary for me to consider whether the prosthesis in
			<lb />
			question is a drug or not. However, I shall proceed to test the said argument, in view of
			<lb />
			the fact that it is a legal issue.
			<lb />
			197. As I have indicated elsewhere, the Patents Act, 1970, is divided into 23
			<lb />
			Chapters. Chapter XVI containing Sections 82 to 98, deal with the &quot;working of patents,
			<lb />
			compulsory licences and revocation&quot;. Section 83, which is found in Chapter XVI states
			<lb />
			that while exercising powers under Chapter XVI, due regard should be had to certain
			<lb />
			general considerations, which are listed out in Clauses (a) to (g) therein. Section 83(d)
			<lb />
			and (g) read as follows :
			<lb />
			&quot;83. General Principles applicable to working of patented inventions :-
			<lb />
			Without prejudice to the other provisions contained in this Act, in
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			104
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			exercising the powers conferred by this Chapter, regard shall be had to the
			<lb />
			following general considerations, namely:-
			<lb />
			.....
			<lb />
			(d) that patents granted do not impede protection of public health
			<lb />
			and nutrition and should act as instrument to promote public interest
			<lb />
			specifically in sectors of vital importance for socio-economic and
			<lb />
			technological development of India;
			<lb />
			......
			<lb />
			(g) that patents are granted to make the benefit of the patented
			<lb />
			invention available at reasonably affordable prices to the public.&quot;
			<lb />
			198. In Chimanlal Jagjivandas Sheth, the Supreme Court took note of the
			<lb />
			definition of the word &quot;drug&quot; appearing in Section 3(b) of the Drugs Act, 1940 and held
			<lb />
			that the definition is comprehensive enough to take in, not only medicines, but also
			<lb />
			substances intended to be used for or in the treatment of diseases of human beings or
			<lb />
			animals. The Court held that the artificial definition introduced a distinction between
			<lb />
			medicines and substances, which are not medicines strictly so called. Therefore, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court came to the conclusion in the said case that absorbent cotton wool, roller
			<lb />
			bandages, gauze and other things, used during surgery would fall within the definition of
			<lb />
			drug.
			<lb />
			199. But, as rightly contended by Mr.M.Sundar, learned counsel for the plaintiff,
			<lb />
			even if prosthesis happens to be a drug, the prescriptions contained in Clauses (d) and
			<lb />
			(g) of Section 83 are intended to be applied only while exercising the powers under
			<lb />
			Chapter XVI for compulsory licences. Today, no one has applied under Section 84(1) to
			<lb />
			the Controller for the grant of compulsory licences for the prosthesis, for which, the
			<lb />
			plaintiff has obtained a patent. The question of application of the provisions of
			<lb />
			Section 83 would come only when any person interested had filed an
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			105
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			application for compulsory licensing under Section 84(1). Section 83 is very
			<lb />
			specific to the effect that the general considerations indicated in Clauses (a) to
			<lb />
			(g) therein are to be applied only while exercising the powers conferred by
			<lb />
			Chapter XVI. The case on hand falls under Chapter XVIII, to which, those
			<lb />
			considerations do not apply. Therefore, the argument that the patent in question is a
			<lb />
			drug and that therefore, public health considerations should play a vital role, while
			<lb />
			adjudicating the dispute, is of no relevance.
			<lb />
			200. On the same issue, Mr.V.Chandrakanthan, learned counsel for the first
			<lb />
			defendant relied upon the decision of a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in
			<lb />
			F.Hoffmann LA Roche Limited Vs. Cipla Limited [2009 (40) PTC 125 (Del.)(DB)].
			<lb />
			From paragraphs 76 to 83 of the said decision, a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court
			<lb />
			considered the effect of Section 83(g) and also considered the question of public interest
			<lb />
			in low cost general drugs. According to the defendants, the prosthesis manufactured by
			<lb />
			the first defendant, as part of Corporate Social Responsibility, is priced at nearly one third
			<lb />
			(1/3rd) of the price charged by the plaintiff. It appears that the price of the prosthesis
			<lb />
			sold by the plaintiff is about Rs.1,36,000/-, while the price charged by the first defendant
			<lb />
			is about Rs.39,200/-. Therefore, it is contended that this Court should take note of public
			<lb />
			interest before adjudicating upon the questions raised.
			<lb />
			201. In Bayer Corporation vs. Union of India {2010 (6) R.A.J. 103 (Delhi)},
			<lb />
			a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court quoted from an article written by Sean A.Pager
			<lb />
			on the title &quot;Patent on a Shoestring:making patent protection work for developing
			<lb />
			countries&quot;, about the complexity of factors that should be taken into account. The article
			<lb />
			quoted by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court highlighted that top 10
			<lb />
			industrialised countries accounted for 94% of patents granted worldwide and hence the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			106
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			benefits of patent protection are heavily skewed.
			<lb />
			202. However, I am unable to sustain the objection raised by the learned counsel
			<lb />
			for the first defendant. The decision of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court arose
			<lb />
			out of the rejection of an application for interim injunction pending suit. Therefore, the
			<lb />
			question of public interest as propounded in Section 83(g) was taken into account as part
			<lb />
			of the &quot;balance of convenience consideration&quot;. But, now, I am dealing with a suit after
			<lb />
			trial. Even if I hold that the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of declaration and injunction as
			<lb />
			prayed for, it would not preclude any of the defendants as &quot;persons interested&quot; to
			<lb />
			approach the Controller under Section 84(1) for the grant of compulsory licence. In fact,
			<lb />
			the defendants could have done this even during the pendency of this suit. The Division
			<lb />
			Bench of the Delhi High Court did not take into account the fact that the general
			<lb />
			considerations indicated in Section 83 are applicable only for the exercise of the powers
			<lb />
			conferred by Chapter XVI.
			<lb />
			203. Therefore, I hold on Issue Nos.1 to 3 that the plaintiff has failed to establish
			<lb />
			infringement of their patent No.196333. Insofar as the other two patents are concerned,
			<lb />
			the defendants have made an assertion that they are not manufacturing the same and
			<lb />
			hence, the question of adjudication of Issues 1 to 3 does not arise, in respect of the other
			<lb />
			two patents.
			<lb />
			ISSUE No.5:
			<lb />
			204. The fifth issue is as to whether the plaintiff is entitled for permanent
			<lb />
			injunction restraining the defendants from in any way making, manufacturing, using,
			<lb />
			selling, offering for sale, marketing or advertising with regard to any prosthesis or any
			<lb />
			variation thereof by using or utilising the plaintiff&apos;s design Nos.191946, 189140 and
			<lb />
			204684.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			107
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			205. The plaintiff has filed as Exx.P-7, P-8 and P-9, the Certificates of Registration
			<lb />
			of Designs Nos.191946, 189140 and 204684. The Certificate of Registration of Design
			<lb />
			No.191946 dated 24.4.2003 shows that it was in respect of the application of the design
			<lb />
			to custom prosthesis. The Certificate of Registration pertaining to Design No.189140 is in
			<lb />
			respect of the application of design to prosthetic articles. The third certificate relating to
			<lb />
			design No.204684 is in respect of the application of design to prosthetic article proximal
			<lb />
			tibial prosthesis.
			<lb />
			206. All the 3 Certificates of Registration have been issued jointly in the names of
			<lb />
			Professor Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan and M.C.Jayasingh. All the 3 Certificates indicate
			<lb />
			that the product in respect of which the designs were registered, fall under Class 24-03.
			<lb />
			207. Under Section 6(1) of the Designs Act, 2000, a design may be registered in
			<lb />
			respect of any or all of the articles comprised in a prescribed class of articles. Rule 10 of
			<lb />
			Designs Rules 2001 stipulates that for the purpose of registration of designs, articles shall
			<lb />
			be classified as specified in The Third Schedule. The Third Schedule under the Designs
			<lb />
			Rules 2001, contains the list of classes and sub-classes with Explanatory Notes. Class 24
			<lb />
			deals with &quot;medical and laboratory equipment&quot;. This Class 24 contains 5 sub-classes, one
			<lb />
			of which is 24-03, which relates to prosthetic articles.
			<lb />
			208. Exx.P-7, P-8 and P-9 contain as annexures, the Representation of the
			<lb />
			prosthesis manufactured by the plaintiff, with their shape and configuration being
			<lb />
			projected from the front view, back view, right side view and left side view. The shape
			<lb />
			and configuration of the designs relating to each of the Certificates filed as ExX.P-7, P-8
			<lb />
			and P-9 have been marked respectively as Exx.P-7A, P-8A and P-9A.
			<lb />
			209. A careful look at Exx.P-7A, P-8A and P-9A would show that the plaintiff claims
			<lb />
			novelty in the &quot;shape and configuration&quot; of the product. This is also reiterated by the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			108
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			plaintiff in paragraph 13 of the plaint, wherein he has claimed that the novelty of the
			<lb />
			design lies in their shape and configuration.
			<lb />
			210. In so far as the averment of the plaintiff in paragraph 13 of his plaint with
			<lb />
			respect to the design and its novelty is concerned, the first defendant has stated in
			<lb />
			paragraph 9 of their written statement that they have no knowledge about the
			<lb />
			correctness of the details. The defendants 2 and 3 in their written statement have simply
			<lb />
			said that they are not concerned with the allegations in paragraph 13 of the plaint. In so
			<lb />
			far as the fourth defendant is concerned, they have simply stated in paragraph 21 of
			<lb />
			their written statement that the plaintiff is put to strict proof of the averments in
			<lb />
			paragraph 13. Therefore, it is clear that the validity of the 3 registered designs of the
			<lb />
			plaintiff are not challenged by the defendants in their written statement.
			<lb />
			211. In a suit for injunction, damages and the like, for the infringement of a
			<lb />
			registered design, the defendants are at liberty, by virtue of section 22 (3), to raise every
			<lb />
			ground on which the registration of a design may be cancelled under Section 19, as a
			<lb />
			ground of defence. Therefore, it is contended by Mr.M.Sundar, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			plaintiff that inasmuch as the defendants have not taken advantage of the gateway
			<lb />
			available under Section 22(3), the defendants are not entitled to question the validity of
			<lb />
			the design.
			<lb />
			212. Before considering the said contention, it is necessary to have a look at the
			<lb />
			scheme of the Designs Act, 2000. The Patents and Designs Act, 1911 was a composite
			<lb />
			enactment that took care of both patents and designs. Immediately after India attained
			<lb />
			independence, a Patents Enquiry Committee was constituted to review the working of the
			<lb />
			Patent Law in India. The Committee submitted its report in 1950. Thereafter, the Patents
			<lb />
			Bill 1953, based largely upon the U.K. Patents Act, 1949 was introduced in the Lok Sabha
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			109
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			in December 1953. But the Bill lapsed on the dissolution of the first Lok Sabha.
			<lb />
			213. Thereafter, a second Committee was constituted in 1957 which submitted a
			<lb />
			report in September 1959. On the basis of those recommendations, the Patents Bill 1965
			<lb />
			was introduced in the Lok Sabha in September 1965. It was referred to a Joint
			<lb />
			Committee. The Joint Committee submitted a report suggesting lot of amendments. The
			<lb />
			Bill was again re-presented to the Lok Sabha, but it lapsed for a second time, with the
			<lb />
			dissolution of the third Lok Sabha in March 1967.
			<lb />
			214. Eventually, the Patents Bill 1970 was moved and the same came into effect in
			<lb />
			April 1972. By Section 162(1) of the Patents Act, 1970, the Indian Patents and Designs
			<lb />
			Act, 1911 was repealed only in so far as it related to patents. Consequently, the 1911 Act
			<lb />
			continued to govern the law relating to designs for a period of nearly 89 years, until the
			<lb />
			advent of the Designs Act, 2000.
			<lb />
			215. Therefore, if we have a look at the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it is
			<lb />
			seen that the object of the Designs Act, 2000 was to ensure effective protection of
			<lb />
			registered designs and at the same time to promote the design activity in order to
			<lb />
			promote the design element in an article of production. It is stated in the Objects and
			<lb />
			Reasons that the Designs Act, was essentially aimed to balance both the interests
			<lb />
			and to ensure that the law did not unnecessarily extend the protection beyond
			<lb />
			what is necessary to create the required incentive for design activity while
			<lb />
			removing the impediments to the free use of the available designs.
			<lb />
			216. Interestingly, what is actually conferred by the The Designs Act, is a copyright
			<lb />
			in the registered design. The Act defines both a copyright and a design. Copyright is
			<lb />
			defined in Section 2(c) to mean &quot;the exclusive right to apply a design to any article in any
			<lb />
			class in which the design is registered&quot;. The expression design is defined under Section
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			110
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			2(d) as follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;(d) &apos;design&apos; means only the features of shape,
			<lb />
			configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or
			<lb />
			colours applied to any article whether in two dimensional
			<lb />
			or three dimensional or in both forms, by any industrial
			<lb />
			process or means, whether manual, mechanical or
			<lb />
			chemical, separate or combined, which in the finished
			<lb />
			article appeal to and are judged solely by the eye; but
			<lb />
			does not include any mode or principle of construction or
			<lb />
			anything which is in substance a mere mechanical device,
			<lb />
			and does not include any trade mark as defined in clause
			<lb />
			(v) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Trade and
			<lb />
			Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (43 of 1958) {now see the
			<lb />
			Trade Marks Act, 1999 (47 of 1999)} or property mark as
			<lb />
			defined in Section 479 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of
			<lb />
			1860) or any artistic mark as defined in clause (c) of
			<lb />
			Section 2 of the Copyright Act, 1957 (14 of 1957).&quot;
			<lb />
			217. Since the definitions of both the expressions &quot;copyright&quot; and &quot;design&quot; speak
			<lb />
			about the application of certain features to an &quot;article&quot;, we must also take note of the
			<lb />
			definition of the expression &quot;article&quot;, appearing in Section 2(a) as follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;(a) &apos;article&apos; means any article of manufacture and any
			<lb />
			substance, artificial, or partly artificial and partly natural; and
			<lb />
			includes any part of an article capable of being made and sold
			<lb />
			separately.&quot;
			<lb />
			218. Therefore, it is clear from Section 2(d) that to constitute a design, it
			<lb />
			should have the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or
			<lb />
			composition of lines or colours. Those features could be applied to any article in
			<lb />
			two dimensional or three dimensional or in both forms by any industrial
			<lb />
			process or means, whether manual, mechanical or chemical. But eventually,
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			111
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			these features applied to any finished article, should appeal to and be judged
			<lb />
			solely by the eye.
			<lb />
			219. Section 2(d) specifically excludes two things from the definition of the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;design&quot;. They are (i) any mode or principle of construction or anything which
			<lb />
			is in substance a mere mechanical device and (ii) any trade mark or property mark or
			<lb />
			any artistic work. In other words, the right conferred by the Designs Act is as to the
			<lb />
			application of the features such as shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or
			<lb />
			composition of lines or colours to any article, which is not a mere mechanical device or a
			<lb />
			trade mark in an artistic work. This is why, what exists in a design is actually a copyright
			<lb />
			in that design. This is made clear by Section 22(1) of the Designs Act, 2000.
			<lb />
			220. Section 22(1) of the Designs Act, 2000, reads as follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;22. Piracy of registered design.---(1) During the
			<lb />
			existence of copyright in any design it shall not be lawful for
			<lb />
			any person--
			<lb />
			(a) for the purpose of sale to apply or cause to be
			<lb />
			applied to any article in any class of articles in which the design
			<lb />
			is registered, the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation
			<lb />
			thereof, except with the licence or written consent of the
			<lb />
			registered proprietor, or to do anything with a view to enable
			<lb />
			the design to be so applied; or
			<lb />
			(b) to import for the purposes of sale, without the
			<lb />
			consent of the registered proprietor, any article belonging to
			<lb />
			the class in which the design has been registered, and having
			<lb />
			applied to it the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation
			<lb />
			thereof; or
			<lb />
			(c) knowing that the design or any fraudulent or obvious
			<lb />
			imitation thereof has been applied to any article in any class of
			<lb />
			articles in which the design is registered without the consent of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			112
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the registered proprietor, to publish or expose or cause to be
			<lb />
			published or exposed for sale that article.&quot;
			<lb />
			221. According to the plaintiff, the first defendant is guilty of applying to the
			<lb />
			prosthesis manufactured by them, the registered design of the plaintiff, for the purpose
			<lb />
			of sale. Therefore, the plaintiff claims that the first defendant is doing something unlawful
			<lb />
			as per Section 22(1)(a). Similarly, it is the plaintiff&apos;s contention that the other defendants
			<lb />
			are exposing for sale, the prosthesis manufactured by the first defendant, thereby
			<lb />
			committing what is declared as unlawful under Section 22(1)(c).
			<lb />
			222. Section 4 of the Designs Act, 2000, prohibits the registration of a design, (i) if
			<lb />
			it is not new or original (ii) if it had been disclosed to the public by publication in tangible
			<lb />
			form or by use in any way prior to the filing date (iii) if it is not significantly
			<lb />
			distinguishable from known designs or combination of known designs and (iv) if it
			<lb />
			comprises or contains scandalous or obscene matter. Once a design is registered, Section
			<lb />
			11(1) confers a copyright in the design, for a period of 10 years from the date of
			<lb />
			registration. But the period can be extended by 5 years under Section 11(2) if an
			<lb />
			application for extension is made before the expiry of 10 years.
			<lb />
			223. The registration of a design can be cancelled at any time, at the instance of
			<lb />
			any person interested, on any of the following grounds viz.,:-
			<lb />
			(i) that the design has been previously registered in India;
			<lb />
			(ii) that it has been published in India or in any other country prior to the date of
			<lb />
			registration;
			<lb />
			(iii) that the design is not a new or original design;
			<lb />
			(iv) that the design is not registerable under the Act; and
			<lb />
			(v) that it is not a design as defined in Section 2(d).
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			113
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			224. A comparison of Sections 4 and 19 would disclose that at least two grounds
			<lb />
			are common to both of them. They are (i) novelty and originality and (ii) disclosure in
			<lb />
			prior art. Therefore, it is clear that these two requirements are very fundamental to the
			<lb />
			existence of a copyright in the registered design. It may be of interest to note that while
			<lb />
			the Patents Act, 1970, gives a clear indication under Section 48, of the rights conferred
			<lb />
			upon the patentee, the Designs Act, 2000, does not contain a similar prescription,
			<lb />
			indicating the rights conferred upon the registered proprietor of a design. Section 11(1)
			<lb />
			of the Designs Act, merely indicates that the registered proprietor of a design, shall have
			<lb />
			copyright in the design, subject to the provisions of the Act. Section 2(c) defines
			<lb />
			copyright as &quot;the exclusive right to apply a design to any article in any class in which the
			<lb />
			design is registered&quot;. But by virtue of Section 11(1), the copyright so conferred, is
			<lb />
			subject to the provisions of the Act.
			<lb />
			225. Interestingly, Section 11(1) of the Act, confers a copyright in the registered
			<lb />
			design, upon the &quot;registered proprietor of the design&quot;. Though the expression
			<lb />
			&quot;design&quot; is already defined in Section 2(d), the statute also defines the phrase &quot;proprietor
			<lb />
			of a new or original design&quot;, in Section 2(j). Section 2(j) of the Designs Act, 2000, reads
			<lb />
			as follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;(j) &apos;proprietor of a new or original design&apos;,---
			<lb />
			(i) where the author of the design, for good
			<lb />
			consideration, executes the work for some other person,
			<lb />
			means the person for whom the design is so executed;
			<lb />
			(ii) where any person acquires the design or the right to
			<lb />
			apply the design to any article, either exclusively of any other
			<lb />
			person or otherwise, means, in respect and to the extent in
			<lb />
			and to which the design or right has been so acquired, the
			<lb />
			person by whom the design or right is so acquired; and
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			114
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			(iii) in any other case, means the author of the design;
			<lb />
			and where the property in or the right to apply, the design has
			<lb />
			devolved from the original proprietor upon any other person,
			<lb />
			includes that other person.&quot;
			<lb />
			Since the registration of a design which is not new or original is prohibited by virtue of
			<lb />
			Section 4, I do not know why the phrase &quot;proprietor of a new or original design&quot; should
			<lb />
			be defined at all, in Section 2(j), especially when Section 11 also talks only about
			<lb />
			&quot;registered proprietor of the design&quot; and not about the &quot;registered proprietor of a new or
			<lb />
			original design&quot;.
			<lb />
			226. One of the important provisions of the Act that should be taken note of,
			<lb />
			before we proceed further, is sub-section (2) of Section 22, which reads as follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;(2) If any person acts in contravention of this section,
			<lb />
			he shall be liable for every contravention---
			<lb />
			(a) to pay to the registered proprietor of the design a
			<lb />
			sum not exceeding twenty-five thousand rupees recoverable as
			<lb />
			a contract debt, or
			<lb />
			(b) if the proprietor elects to bring a suit for the recovery
			<lb />
			of damages for any such contravention, and for an injunction
			<lb />
			against the repetition thereof, to pay such damages as may be
			<lb />
			awarded and to be restrained by injunction accordingly:
			<lb />
			Provided that the total sum recoverable in respect of any
			<lb />
			one design under clause (a) shall not exceed fifty thousand
			<lb />
			rupees:
			<lb />
			Provided further that no suit or any other proceeding for
			<lb />
			relief under this sub-section shall be instituted in any Court
			<lb />
			below the Court of District Judge.&quot;
			<lb />
			227. Another comparison between the Patents Act, 1970 and the Designs Act,
			<lb />
			2000, may also be seen. The Patents Act, 1970, lists out (i) the rights of patentees under
			<lb />
			Section 48; (ii) the power of Court to make a declaration as to non-infringement under
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			115
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Section 105; (iii) the power of Court to grant relief in cases of groundless threats of
			<lb />
			infringement proceedings under Section 106; (iv) defences in suits for infringement
			<lb />
			under Section 107; (v) acts which do not constitute infringement under Section 107-A;
			<lb />
			(vi) reliefs in suits for infringement under Section 108; and (vii) restriction on power of
			<lb />
			Court to grant damages or accounts of profit for infringement. Thus, the Patents Act,
			<lb />
			1970, is very exhaustive, inasmuch as it covers all areas such as the rights of the
			<lb />
			proprietor, the remedies available to him, the defence available to the opposite party and
			<lb />
			the parameters on which a Court can grant or refuse relief.
			<lb />
			228. But unfortunately, the Designs Act, 2000, is very hollow. It merely confers a
			<lb />
			copyright on the registered proprietor of a design, to have the exclusive right to apply it
			<lb />
			to any article, subject to the other provisions of the Act. The remedies available to the
			<lb />
			registered proprietor, in the case of piracy, the defence available to the opposite party in
			<lb />
			such cases and the nature of the reliefs that could be granted by the Court, are all
			<lb />
			indicated in a confusing manner in one provision viz., Section 22. More particularly, the
			<lb />
			area of coverage in sub-section (2) of Section 22 is much less than the area of confusion.
			<lb />
			229. As a matter of fact, I had an occasion to consider the effect of Section 22 (2)
			<lb />
			in Greaves Cotton vs. Autus Motors Private Limited (A.Nos.3097 to 3099 of 2007
			<lb />
			in O.A.No.293 of 2007 in C.S 216 of 2007 dated 7.11.2007). In the said case, it
			<lb />
			was argued that under Section 22(2), the maximum that a Court could do, is to award
			<lb />
			compensation in a sum not exceeding Rs.25,000/-for every contravention subject to a
			<lb />
			maximum of Rs.50,000/-for one design. While rejecting the said contention, I held as
			<lb />
			follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;Section 22(2)(a) and the proviso contained thereunder,
			<lb />
			is not to be construed as a license for contravening the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			116
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			provisions of the Act, prescribing a License Fee of Rs.50,000/-
			<lb />
			for getting away with the contravention. If such an
			<lb />
			interpretation is accepted, it would lead to absurd
			<lb />
			consequences. A person, who deliberately contravenes Section
			<lb />
			22(1), will be emboldened to continue merrily with such
			<lb />
			contravention, if such an interpretation is accepted, since the
			<lb />
			only consequence that would befall upon him for all the
			<lb />
			contraventions put together in respect of one design, is to pay
			<lb />
			a total sum of Rs.50,000/-. Instead of discouraging
			<lb />
			infringement, the interpretation advanced by defendants 1 and
			<lb />
			4 would encourage infringement.
			<lb />
			28. Be that as it may, it is seen that the language
			<lb />
			employed in clause (a) and clause (b) as well as the proviso
			<lb />
			under Section 22(2), by itself, contains an answer to the
			<lb />
			contention of the defendants 1 and 4. Section 22(2)(a) merely
			<lb />
			prescribes the liability of a person acting in contravention of
			<lb />
			Section 22(1), to pay to the registered proprietor of a design, a
			<lb />
			sum not exceeding Rs.25,000/-, recoverable as a &quot;contract
			<lb />
			debt&quot;. In contrast, Section 22(2)(b) entitles the proprietor of a
			<lb />
			design, to two kinds of reliefs viz., (i) an injunction against
			<lb />
			repetition of the contravention and (ii) for recovery of
			<lb />
			damages. Thus, Section 22(2)(b) uses the word &quot;damages&quot;. In
			<lb />
			order to avoid any confusion with regard to the scope and
			<lb />
			ambit of clauses (a) and (b), the first proviso makes it clear
			<lb />
			that the total sum recoverable in respect of any one design
			<lb />
			under clause (a) shall not exceed Rs.50,000/-. In other words,
			<lb />
			the restriction under the proviso, is only in respect of the
			<lb />
			money recoverable as a &quot;contract debt&quot; under clause (a). The
			<lb />
			proviso does not restrict the quantum of damages that can be
			<lb />
			awarded under clause (b).
			<lb />
			29. Therefore, if a person comes to Court seeking relief
			<lb />
			under Section 22(2)(a), for recovery of money prescribed
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			117
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			therein, the quantum of money that could be awarded to him,
			<lb />
			is restricted to Rs.50,000/-under the proviso. But if a person
			<lb />
			seeks damages, it is covered by Section 22(2)(b) and the
			<lb />
			quantum of damages that could be awarded to him, is not
			<lb />
			restricted by the proviso.&quot;
			<lb />
			230. In Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd vs. Golf Ball Developments Ltd {1931 RPC
			<lb />
			(Vol. XLVIII No.7) 268}, Farwell, J., of the High Court of Justice -Chancery Division
			<lb />
			summarised the law as follows:-
			<lb />
			(a) Design means only the feature of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament
			<lb />
			applied to any article by any industrial process or means, whether manual, mechanical or
			<lb />
			chemical, separate or combined, which in the finished article appeal to and are judged
			<lb />
			solely by the eye;
			<lb />
			(b) Therefore, there are two things viz., (i) it is the finished article which is the
			<lb />
			thing to be looked at in order to see how the design appeals to the eye; and (ii) the test
			<lb />
			of the design is the eye and eye alone;
			<lb />
			(c) The phrase, &quot;eye&quot; in the Statute means eye of the Court because the Court has
			<lb />
			ultimately to determine these questions. However, the Court is entitled to be assisted
			<lb />
			and instructed by evidence, so that when it applies its eye to the test, it may have a mind
			<lb />
			to direct its eye which is instructed by the proper evidence;
			<lb />
			(d) Such instructions may certainly be given by persons who are competent to do
			<lb />
			it with regard to the prior art;
			<lb />
			(e) The Court is not entitled to listen to evidence of gentlemen, however they may
			<lb />
			be in the game.
			<lb />
			231. In the aforesaid case, the learned Judge agreed with the counsel for the
			<lb />
			plaintiffs that the registered design as well as the alleged infringing design were similar.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			118
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			But the learned Judge found that the outstanding salient features of both were not one
			<lb />
			and the same. Therefore, the learned Judge held that if a design has in it a striking
			<lb />
			feature which catches and holds the eyes and which is the one thing that strikes the eye
			<lb />
			when one looks at the design, a design which otherwise may be like a registered design,
			<lb />
			but it eliminates the striking feature or alters it so that it is not recognisable, in such a
			<lb />
			case, it is impossible to say that one is an imitation of the other.
			<lb />
			232. In that case, the Court also drew a distinction between a fraudulent imitation
			<lb />
			and an obvious imitation. An obvious imitation is one which, when looked at, struck one
			<lb />
			at once as being so like the original design, the registered design as to be almost
			<lb />
			unmistakable. An obvious imitation is something very close to the original, with the
			<lb />
			resemblance being immediately apparent to the eye looking at the two. In contrast, the
			<lb />
			word &quot;fraudulent&quot; presupposes a knowledge of the registered design. Therefore, a
			<lb />
			fraudulent imitation is an imitation based upon and deliberately based upon the
			<lb />
			registered design. Such an imitation may be less apparent than the obvious imitation,
			<lb />
			with a subtle distinction from the original. Therefore, the Court held in that case that
			<lb />
			though fraudulent imitation may be different in some respects from the original and may
			<lb />
			render it not obviously an imitation, may yet be an imitation, perceptable when the two
			<lb />
			designs are closely scanned. Therefore, Mr.M.Sundar, learned counsel for the plaintiff
			<lb />
			contended that the product manufactured by the first defendant and used by the other
			<lb />
			defendants, was a fraudulent imitation of the registered design.
			<lb />
			233. In Microfibres Inc. vs. Girdhar &amp; Co. {2009 (6) R.A.J. 106 (Delhi)}, a
			<lb />
			Division Bench of the Delhi High Court pointed out, quoting from Interlego A.G. vs. Tyco
			<lb />
			Industries Inc.,{(1988) R.P.C. 343}, that the primary concern in a case of infringement
			<lb />
			of design is what the finished article is to look like and not with what it does. The
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			119
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			emphasis is upon the visual image conveyed by the manufactured article.
			<lb />
			234. In Veeplast Houseware Private Ltd vs. M/s.Bonjour International
			<lb />
			{CS(OS) No.1181 of 2011 decided on 2.6.2011}, the Delhi High Court pointed out
			<lb />
			that to ascertain whether the impugned design infringes another design, the two
			<lb />
			products need not be placed side by side and that the matter has to be examined from
			<lb />
			the point of view of a customer with average knowledge and imperfect recollection. The
			<lb />
			Court pointed out that a person coming across the impugned product may not have on
			<lb />
			hand, the product of the plaintiff, at the time when he goes to the market. Therefore,
			<lb />
			infringement is not to be found out by comparing similarities and dissimilarities. To find
			<lb />
			out whether two designs are identical, the main consideration is whether the broad
			<lb />
			features of shape, configuration, pattern etc., are similar to each other or not.
			<lb />
			235. But I do not think that I should strictly follow the ratio laid down by the Delhi
			<lb />
			High Court in Veeplast. The said decision arose out of an action for infringement of design
			<lb />
			of a consumer product. But in the case on hand, the product is a prosthesis, which is
			<lb />
			actually custom made. It is not a product which is available across the counter. It cannot
			<lb />
			even be compared to ordinary drugs. Therefore, I would keep aside the test applied by
			<lb />
			the Delhi High Court in Veeplast.
			<lb />
			236. But the above decision actually followed an earlier decision of the same High
			<lb />
			Court in Alert India vs. Naveen Plastics {1997 PTC (17) 15 (Delhi)}. In the said
			<lb />
			case, the product in question was the sole of footwear. One of the two questions that
			<lb />
			arose for consideration was whether the design of the product manufactured by the
			<lb />
			defendant was same or similar to the product of the plaintiff. While dealing with the said
			<lb />
			question, the Delhi High Court indicated that one of the practical tests to find out the
			<lb />
			identity or sameness of the design, is to find out whether there are substantial
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			120
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			differences. These differences cannot be based on purely subjective or utilitarian or
			<lb />
			aesthetic considerations. The differences must be objective in essential features. A
			<lb />
			general view of the features of both the designs should be looked into to find out whether
			<lb />
			one design is as good as the other and the conclusion is to be arrived at by visual
			<lb />
			examination of the two products.
			<lb />
			237. More importantly it was pointed out in the said case that similarity of device
			<lb />
			in external appearance may be a relevant factor in considering the substantial differences
			<lb />
			between the two, but it is certainly not a determining factor. The main consideration to
			<lb />
			be applied is whether the broad features of shape, configuration, pattern etc., are the
			<lb />
			same or nearly the same. If they are substantially the same, then it is a case of imitation.
			<lb />
			238. In Castrol India Ltd vs. Tide Water Oil Co. (I) Ltd {1996 PTC (16)
			<lb />
			Calcutta 202}, the Calcutta High Court pointed out that under Section 2(5) of the 1911
			<lb />
			Act, the operative words are shape, configuration, pattern or ornament and that they are
			<lb />
			not protected in the abstract, but protected when applied to an article. Therefore, after
			<lb />
			comparing the containers of the plaintiff and the defendant, the Calcutta High Court came
			<lb />
			to the conclusion that the defendant&apos;s container bore a family resemblance to the
			<lb />
			petitioner&apos;s design. Therefore, the Court held that the sequence to the obligation of the
			<lb />
			Court in considering an application for infringement is first to consider whether protection
			<lb />
			is claimed in respect of a design or the mode of manufacture. The Court is then to
			<lb />
			consider whether the design is, in fact, novel and if so to what extent. But all novel
			<lb />
			designs are not protected. Citing a decision in In Re : Lamson Industries Ltd., {(1978)
			<lb />
			RPC 1} case, the Court held that novel designs which are purely functional, cannot be the
			<lb />
			basis for an action for infringement. The Court also held that it is not every resemblance
			<lb />
			in respect of the same article which would be actionable. The copy must be a fraudulent
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			121
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			or obvious imitation. Again imitation does not mean duplication. Following the decision in
			<lb />
			Best Products Ltd., {(1964) IX RPC 215}, the Court held that it was necessary to break
			<lb />
			the article down into integers for descriptive purposes, but in the ultimate result it is the
			<lb />
			article as a totality that must be compared and contrasted with the features of a shape
			<lb />
			and configuration.
			<lb />
			239. In The Pilot Pen Co. (India) Private Ltd vs. The Gujarat Industries
			<lb />
			Private Ltd {AIR 1967 Madras 215}, this Court was concerned with the alleged
			<lb />
			infringement of a design, relating to the clips of fountain pens. Though no evidence was
			<lb />
			let in by the plaintiff to show that apart from novelty claimed for the design, he had any
			<lb />
			proprietary right in the design, the Court held that the registered proprietor has a
			<lb />
			copyright in the design. Eventually, the Court held in paragraph 22 as follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;(22) A registration cannot be deemed effective unless
			<lb />
			the design or configuration, sought to be protected, is new and
			<lb />
			original and not of a pre-existing common type. Where the
			<lb />
			evidence indicated that the designs in question were in use
			<lb />
			from long before the date, when the registration of the patent
			<lb />
			was applied for by the plaintiff, it is not possible to say that the
			<lb />
			designs were new or original and that the plaintiff was entitled
			<lb />
			to protection which he sought : Vide Ram Sahai v. Angnoo, AIR
			<lb />
			1922 All 496.&quot;
			<lb />
			240. From paragraph 22 extracted above, it is clear that a registration cannot be
			<lb />
			deemed effective unless the configuration or shape sought to be protected is new and
			<lb />
			original and not of a pre-existing common type. Therefore, it appears that registration,
			<lb />
			per se, does not entitle the plaintiff automatically to a decree of injunction.
			<lb />
			241. Therefore, taking clue from the legal position defined in The Pilot Pen Co., the
			<lb />
			defendants contend that the plaintiff is bound to prove that the configuration and shape,
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			122
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			which form the basis for his claim, are new and original. The defendants also contend
			<lb />
			that the prosthesis manufactured by the plaintiff does not even qualify as a design within
			<lb />
			the meaning of Section 2(d). According to the defendants, the prosthesis manufactured
			<lb />
			by the plaintiff is in substance, a mere mechanical device. Therefore, according to the
			<lb />
			defendants, it is not a design within the meaning of the Act, so as to entitle the plaintiff
			<lb />
			to be protected.
			<lb />
			242. Similarly in Indiana Gratings Private Limited vs. Anand Udyog
			<lb />
			Fabricators Private Limited {2009 (4) R.A.J. 281 (Bom.)}, the Delhi High Court
			<lb />
			pointed out that if the plaintiff&apos;s drawings do not qualify as design under the Designs Act,
			<lb />
			they are not registerable as such and that consequently, the copyright in registered
			<lb />
			designs, which is available to the designs of the final product under Section 11 could not
			<lb />
			be available to the plaintiffs. The Bombay High Court drew a distinction in that case
			<lb />
			between the drawing of an industrial product which would qualify only as a copyright in
			<lb />
			an artistic work and a design that would qualify under the Designs Act. The Court held
			<lb />
			that if the drawing of an industrial product is not a design and not registered as such, it
			<lb />
			would not enjoy the monopoly that is conferred under the Act, but only the right to
			<lb />
			prevent its infringement conferred under the Copyright Act. Consequently, the Court also
			<lb />
			pointed out that the design would be embodied in a sketch illustrative of a model which
			<lb />
			would be multiplied or the model itself that is the finished article. If that is not so, it
			<lb />
			would not be required to be registered as a design. If the plaintiff&apos;s drawings are not of a
			<lb />
			final product, capable of being manufactured again and again, that would not qualify as
			<lb />
			design.
			<lb />
			243. More importantly, the Bombay High Court in Indiana Gratings, relied upon a
			<lb />
			decision of the House of Lords in AMP Incorporated vs. Utilux Proprietary Limited
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			123
		<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			{1971 FSR 572}, where the plaintiffs claimed infringement of two registered designs in
			<lb />
			electric terminals, consisting of a receptacle, a transition portion and a connecting
			<lb />
			channel specifically manufactured for use in washing machines of a certain customer. In
			<lb />
			that case, the House of Lords found that the function of the terminals was the sole cause
			<lb />
			for the choice of their shape and not the eye appeal. The shape was chosen only to make
			<lb />
			the article work. Neither the purpose nor the result of the product was to appeal to the
			<lb />
			eye, but to do the job. The design had no shape, feature or configuration that appealed
			<lb />
			to the eye. The shape was applied by an industrial process to make the end product more
			<lb />
			useful. Therefore, relying upon the observation of Lord Porter in the case of Stenor
			<lb />
			Limited vs. Whitesides {1948 A.C. 107}, the House of Lords held that the primary
			<lb />
			object of the Act is to protect shape and not function and not to protect functional shape.
			<lb />
			Therefore, it is the contention of the defendants in this case that the prosthesis
			<lb />
			manufactured by the plaintiff is a mere mechanical device whose shape was solely
			<lb />
			intended to perform a function. Hence, according to Mr.N.L.Rajah, learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			fourth defendant, the plaintiff cannot seek any relief in respect of the design.
			<lb />
			244. In Bharath Glass Tubes Vs. Gopal Glass Works Limited [CDJ 2008 SC
			<lb />
			810], which arose out of an application for cancellation of registration under Section 19
			<lb />
			of the Act, the Supreme Court pointed out that the burden was on the complainant to
			<lb />
			show that the design was not original or new. The Court also pointed out in that case,
			<lb />
			what the concept of a design is. A design capable of registration is that which is
			<lb />
			conceived as an idea of a shape or a configuration or ornament or pattern in the mind of
			<lb />
			the originator and which is applied to any article physically. Quoting from Buckley,J in
			<lb />
			Dover Limited Vs. Nurnberger Celluloid Waren Fabrik [(1910) 27 RPC 498], the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court pointed out that the object of the Designs Act was intended to protect
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			124
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			designs, which really have some merit by way of novelty or originality and not to give
			<lb />
			colour to such paltry and trivial claims. In fact, in the decision of Buckley,J relied upon by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court, the learned Judge rejected the claim of infringement on the ground
			<lb />
			that the project in question had nine panels as against six panels in the registered design
			<lb />
			and also on the ground that the grooves in the defendant&apos;s product were more shallow
			<lb />
			than the plaintiff&apos;s grooves.
			<lb />
			245. I have carefully considered the rival submissions.
			<lb />
			246. From the rival submissions, I think two issues arise. The first is as to whether
			<lb />
			I can be called upon to record a finding on the validity of the design, especially when the
			<lb />
			defendants have not raised any substantial pleadings. The second is as to whether there
			<lb />
			was any infringement, even assuming that the plaintiff had a design which is valid.
			<lb />
			247. On the first question, as I have already pointed out, the defendants have not
			<lb />
			chosen to challenge the validity of the registered design of the plaintiff, despite the fact
			<lb />
			that Section 22(3) enables the defendants to raise, as a defence, any of the grounds
			<lb />
			available under Section 19. Therefore, I have to take it that the validity of the plaintiff&apos;s
			<lb />
			design is not under challenge.
			<lb />
			248. The defendants also have one more disadvantage. Under Section 13(4) of the
			<lb />
			Patents Act, there is no warranty of validity of the patent, merely because the Examiner
			<lb />
			of Patents conducts an examination and investigation for anticipation by previous
			<lb />
			publication and by prior claim. This is why the certificates of registration of patent (Ex.P1
			<lb />
			etc.) also contain a disclaimer to the effect that the validity of the patent is not
			<lb />
			guaranteed. Therefore, onus probandi is on the plaintiff, who claims to be the registered
			<lb />
			proprietor of the patent, to establish before court, novelty, non obviousness and
			<lb />
			usefulness, before seeking a decree of declaration and injunction.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			125
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			249. But, the Designs Act, 2000 stands in contrast to the Patents Act, 1970. First
			<lb />
			of all, there is no provision in the Designs Act, 2000, which is analogous to Section 13(4)
			<lb />
			of the Patents Act, 1970. Similarly, the certificates of registration of design Ex.P7, Ex.P8,
			<lb />
			Ex.P9 and Ex.P.7A, Ex.P.8A and Ex.P.9A also do not contain any disclaimer as is found in
			<lb />
			the certificates of registration of patents (Ex.P1, Ex.P2 Ex.P3, etc).
			<lb />
			250. Therefore, it is clear that the strict rigours contained in the Patents Act, 1970
			<lb />
			with regard to the validity of a patent, are not to be found in the Designs Act, 2000. In
			<lb />
			the background of this legal position, in the absence of any averment in the written
			<lb />
			statement of the defendants challenging the validity of the registered design of the
			<lb />
			plaintiff, it is not possible for me to call upon the plaintiff to establish that the registered
			<lb />
			design in his favour is also valid.
			<lb />
			251. I must also take note of the fact that every application for registration of a
			<lb />
			design is scrutinised by an Examiner, under the proviso to Section 5(1) of the Act, to see
			<lb />
			whether such design is capable of being registered under the Act and the Rules made
			<lb />
			thereunder. Section 5 of the Designs Act, 2000 does not contain a provision, which is
			<lb />
			analogous or similar to Section 13(4) of the Patents Act.
			<lb />
			252. Therefore, on the first question, I have no option but to conclude that the
			<lb />
			registered design of the plaintiff is valid. This is despite the fact that in paragraph 22 of
			<lb />
			its decision, this Court held in The Pilot Pen Co., that registration cannot be deemed
			<lb />
			effective unless the design or configuration sought to be protected is new and original
			<lb />
			and not of the pre-existing common type. The decision in The Pilot Pen Co. arose under
			<lb />
			the 1911 Act that was common for both patents and designs. The law has travelled a
			<lb />
			long way from the said decision and hence, I hold on the first issue that the design of the
			<lb />
			plaintiff is valid. Therefore, I shall move on to the next question namely as to whether
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			126
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			there was infringement.
			<lb />
			253. To prove that there was infringement, the plaintiff should establish (i) that
			<lb />
			the shape and/or configuration of the prosthesis manufactured by the first defendant is
			<lb />
			similar to the shape and/or configuration of the registered design of the plaintiff&apos;s
			<lb />
			product; and (ii) that the similarities between the features of both products in terms of
			<lb />
			shape and configuration strike the eye of the observer. This is in view of the fact that
			<lb />
			though a registered design can be in respect of an application to an article, of various
			<lb />
			features such as shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation or composition of lines,
			<lb />
			the plaintiff&apos;s claim of novelty is restricted only to shape and configuration and not to
			<lb />
			others. This is seen from Ex.P.7A, Ex.P.8A and Ex.P.9A, all of which contained a pictorial
			<lb />
			representation of the prosthesis. While Ex.P.7A contains front, back, right side and left
			<lb />
			side view of the custom prosthesis, Ex.P.8A contains similar pictorial representation of
			<lb />
			the prosthetic articles and Ex.P.9A contains pictorial representations of proximal tibial
			<lb />
			prosthesis.
			<lb />
			254. In order to show that the shape and configuration of the prosthesis
			<lb />
			manufactured and used by the defendants bear similar features of shape and
			<lb />
			configuration, the plaintiff filed in chief examination, Ex.P.46, Ex.P.50, Ex.P.51 and
			<lb />
			Ex.P.52. Ex.P.46 is the surgical photograph of the prosthesis manufactured by the first
			<lb />
			defendant and allegedly applied to a patient by name P.V.Sadiya at the Cancer Institute,
			<lb />
			which is the fourth defendant. Ex.P.50 is also a similar surgical photograph of the
			<lb />
			prosthesis manufactured by the first defendant and applied to a patient Shah Naway
			<lb />
			through the fourth defendant. Ex.P.51 is also a similar photograph of a prosthesis applied
			<lb />
			to a patient by name Master M.Naresh. Ex.P.52 is a diagram allegedly prepared by a
			<lb />
			doctor for a patient.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			127
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			255. But, the marking of Ex.P.46, Ex.P.50 and Ex.P.51 were objected to, by the
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the defendants on the ground that these photographs were not
			<lb />
			accompanied by the negative. The marking of Ex.P.52 was objected on the ground that it
			<lb />
			was not at all legible. Therefore, while recording evidence on 9.2.2010 (in my presence),
			<lb />
			I passed an order that these documents were marked subject to objections. Hence, it is
			<lb />
			my duty to consider the admissibility of those four documents at present.
			<lb />
			256. In so far as Ex.P.46, Ex.P.50 and Ex.P.51 are concerned, they are surgical
			<lb />
			photographs allegedly taken at the time of surgeries conducted on 26.5.2005, 3.3.2006
			<lb />
			and 31.3.2006 respectively at the Adyar Cancer Institute, which is the fourth defendant.
			<lb />
			At the outset, there is no explanation as to how the plaintiff came into possession of
			<lb />
			these surgical photographs. The plaintiff could have obtained these photographs either
			<lb />
			from the patients themselves or from the fourth defendant or from the surgeons, who
			<lb />
			operated upon the patients. The plaintiff has not given any indication as to how he
			<lb />
			obtained these photographs. The fourth defendant could not have parted with these
			<lb />
			photographs, since the plaintiff had issued a cease and desist notice on 1.9.2006 itself.
			<lb />
			The only possibility is that Dr.Mayilvahanan Natarajan, who was also associated with the
			<lb />
			fourth defendant and who happens to be a co-patentee, could have handed over these
			<lb />
			photographs to the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			257. In any case, there is no authentication that these photographs relate to the
			<lb />
			prosthesis manufactured by the first defendant and used on patients at the fourth
			<lb />
			defendant institute. These photographs are not even accompanied by the negatives.
			<lb />
			Therefore, I cannot take these exhibits namely Ex.P.46, Ex.P.50 and Ex.P.51 as
			<lb />
			conclusive evidence of the fact that the first defendant manufactured prosthesis
			<lb />
			containing the same or similar features of shape and configuration as that of the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			128
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			plaintiff&apos;s product and that they were also used on patients by the fourth defendant.
			<lb />
			Coming to Ex.P.52, I cannot accept it as a piece of evidence worth any consideration.
			<lb />
			Apart from the fact that the drawings contained therein are incapable of being
			<lb />
			deciphered, it is so illegible that a finding of infringement on the basis of Ex.P.52 would
			<lb />
			be disastrous.
			<lb />
			258. Keeping the above in mind, if we look at the pleadings and evidence let in by
			<lb />
			the plaintiff, it is clear that there is no evidence on record to show that the shape and
			<lb />
			configuration adopted by the plaintiff in his designs, have been copied by the defendants.
			<lb />
			As a matter of fact, the proximal tibial prosthesis or distal femur prosthesis, are supposed
			<lb />
			to be a replacement for the cancer affected bones that are connected by the knee joint.
			<lb />
			Therefore, every prosthesis takes its shape and configuration only from the human
			<lb />
			anatomy. There is no other shape that a distal femoral prosthesis could actually take, if it
			<lb />
			is intended to replace the bone affected by the tumour. If different types of prosthesis, as
			<lb />
			seen from the pictorial representations given in paragraph 183, take the shape and
			<lb />
			configuration of the bones and the knee joint, the plaintiff cannot successfully establish
			<lb />
			infringement, merely by showing broad and over all similarities.
			<lb />
			259. As I have pointed out earlier, the plaintiff had never seen the product of the
			<lb />
			first defendant physically. He claims to have seen only the photographs and the sketches.
			<lb />
			It was only DW-1 who produced MO-2. But he maintained that the first defendant
			<lb />
			manufactured different types of prosthesis, of which MO-2 was one. Therefore, I did not
			<lb />
			have the benefit of seeing the prosthesis manufactured on regular basis by the first
			<lb />
			defendant (except MO-2) to see whether the shape and configuration of both looked alike
			<lb />
			to my eye.
			<lb />
			260. From paragraphs 166 to 174 above, I have extracted in detail the evidence of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			129
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			DW-1 indicating the differences between the products, both in terms of specifications and
			<lb />
			in terms of shape and configuration. Therefore, (i) when the plaintiff himself has not seen
			<lb />
			the product of the first defendant; (ii) when the plaintiff could not produce the infringing
			<lb />
			material before me; and (iii) when the first defendant produced only one stray item and
			<lb />
			indicated the differences, it is not possible for me to conclude that the first defendant is
			<lb />
			actually manufacturing prosthesis of the same or similar shape and configuration as the
			<lb />
			prosthesis manufactured by the plaintiff. Hence, I hold that the plaintiff has failed to
			<lb />
			prove infringement.
			<lb />
			261. In view of the above, I hold on issue No.5 that the plaintiff has failed to
			<lb />
			establish infringement and that therefore, he is not entitled to a permanent injunction
			<lb />
			restraining the defendants in any way making, manufacturing, using, selling, offering for
			<lb />
			sale, marketing or advertising with regard to any prosthesis or any variation thereof by
			<lb />
			using or utilising the plaintiff&apos;s Design Nos.191946, 189140 and 204684.
			<lb />
			ISSUE Nos.4 and 6:
			<lb />
			262. The fourth issue is as to whether the defendants are liable to deliver all
			<lb />
			apparatus relating to the manufacture of any prosthesis by the defendants through the
			<lb />
			infringement of the prosthesis in patent Nos.196333, 198872 and 198869 and the design
			<lb />
			Nos.191946, 189140 and 204684. The sixth issue is as to whether the defendants 1 to 4
			<lb />
			are liable to render true, fair and faithful accounts in respect of the invention
			<lb />
			manufactured, used and sold by the defendants which infringed and continue to infringe
			<lb />
			patent Nos.196333, 198872 and 193869 and whether a preliminary decree has to be
			<lb />
			passed for taking such account for the loss and damage suffered by the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			263. These two issues are actually consequential to issue Nos.1 to 3 and 5. I have
			<lb />
			already recorded a finding on issue Nos.1 to 3 and 5 that the plaintiff has not established
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			130
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			an infringement of patent No.196333 and design No.191946. Consequently, I rejected
			<lb />
			the prayers for decrees of permanent injunction under issue Nos.1 to 3 and 5.
			<lb />
			264. Therefore, as a corollary to the findings on issue Nos.1 to 3 and 5, issue
			<lb />
			Nos.4 and 6 have also to be found against the plaintiff. Once it is found that there was no
			<lb />
			infringement and once it is found that the plaintiff is not entitled to decrees of permanent
			<lb />
			injunction, it follows as a corollary that the defendants are not liable to deliver all
			<lb />
			apparatus relating to the manufacture of any prosthesis through the infringement of the
			<lb />
			registered patents and designs of the plaintiff. Similarly, defendants are also not liable to
			<lb />
			render true, fair and faithful accounts. Accordingly, issue Nos.4 and 6 are answered
			<lb />
			against the plaintiff.
			<lb />
			265. Therefore, in the result, the suit is dismissed. However, there will be no order
			<lb />
			as to costs.
