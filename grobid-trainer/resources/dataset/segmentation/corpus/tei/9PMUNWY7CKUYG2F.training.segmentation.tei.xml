			agreed quantity of seeds from the petitioner.
			<lb />
			4.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, disputes arose between the parties and the
			<lb />
			petitioner invoked the Arbitration Clause.
			<lb />
			5.
			<lb />
			The relevant Arbitration Clause, as agreed to between the
			<lb />
			parties, reads as under:-
			<lb />
			&quot;35). Settlement of disputes:
			<lb />
			All disputes in relation to the E.O.I., the contract or the
			<lb />
			interpretation of any of their terms or implementation
			<lb />
			there-of or arising out of or concerned directly or
			<lb />
			indirectly with the contract/E.O.I. shall be referred to the
			<lb />
			Sole arbitrator to be appointed by the Chairman-cum-
			<lb />
			Managing Director of the Corporation/ organizer and in
			<lb />
			the absence of CMD, the highest Executive Officer of the
			<lb />
			Corporation shall make such appointment. The venue of

			<lb />
			The petitioner invoked arbitration by notice dated 24.04.2017
			<lb />
			with a reminder dated 30.05.2017 to the Chairman-cum-Managing
			<lb />
			Director to appoint an Arbitrator within thirty days of the receipt of
			<lb />
			the notice.
			<lb />
			7.
			<lb />
			On the failure of the Chairman-cum-Managing Director to
			<lb />

			<lb />
			petition on 01.08.2017 after furnishing an advance copy to the

			respondent.
			<lb />
			8.
			<lb />
			Notice was directed to be issued on 08.08.2017.
			<lb />
			9.
			<lb />
			In the reply, respondents have contended that in terms of Clause
			<lb />
			35, Arbitrator has been appointed by the highest Executive Officer of
			<lb />
			the Corporation as the Chairman-cum-Managing Director was not in
			<lb />
			Office, however, the said appointment was subsequently ratified by
			<lb />
			the Chairman-cum-Managing Director on 22.08.2017.
			<lb />
			10. Learned counsel for the petitioner relies on the decision of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in DATAR SWITCHGEARS LIMITED VERSUS TATA
			<lb />
			FINANCE LIMITED, 2000(8) SCC 151, wherein the Supreme Court has
			<lb />
			held that in cases arising under Section 11(6), if the respondent has
			<lb />
			not made an appointment within thirty days of the demand, the right
			<lb />
			to make an appointment is not automatically forfeited but continues,
			<lb />
			however, such right has to be exercised prior to the petitioner filing
			<lb />
			the application under Section 11 seeking appointment of an Arbitrator.
			<lb />
			It is contended that on filing of the Section 11 application, right to
			<lb />
			appoint an Arbitrator, in terms of the Arbitration Clause, ceases.
			<lb />
			11.
			<lb />
			Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that since the
			<lb />
			appointment was made by the respondent, after the petitioner had filed
			<lb />
			the petition under section 11 of the Act and advance copy of the same
			<lb />
			was delivered to the respondent, respondent has forfeited the right to
			<lb />
			appoint an Arbitrator.

			12. In view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in DATAR
			<lb />
			SWITCHGEARS LIMITED (supra), without raising any aspersions on the
			<lb />
			Arbitrator appointed by the respondent, it is held that the right of the
			<lb />
			respondent to appoint an Arbitrator, as conferred by Clause 35 of the
			<lb />
			Agreement between the parties, ceased with the petitioner filing this
			<lb />
			petition and the appointment made post the same is non-est.
			<lb />
			13. Thus, arbitrator is required to be appointed by Court.
			<lb />
			14. Accordingly, it is directed that the Arbitrator be appointed
			<lb />
			under the Rules of the Delhi International Arbitration Centre.
			<lb />
			15. The parties shall appear before the Coordinator, Delhi
			<lb />
			International Arbitration Centre on 12 th October, 2017 at 11 AM.
			<lb />
			16. The Arbitration shall be conducted under the aegis of Delhi
			<lb />
			International Arbitration Centre in accordance with law.
			<lb />
			17. The petition is allowed in the above terms.
			<lb />
			18. Dasti under signatures of the Court Master.
