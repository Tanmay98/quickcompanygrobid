			with regard to call money transaction dated 25. 3. 1992.
			<lb />
			.
			<lb />
			\
			<lb />
			It this was really a call money transaction. the entry
			<lb />
			would
			<lb />
			have appeared in the deal dump dated

			25.3. 1992
			<lb />

			interest.
			<lb />
			date
			<lb />
			of

			<lb />
			However, in the deal

			dump
			<lb />
			lExhibit -156) there is no entry in respect
			<lb />
			ot
			<lb />
			these
			<lb />
			transactions.
			<lb />
			Therefore,
			<lb />
			he
			<lb />
			clarified
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			there
			<lb />
			was no transaction of borrowing Rs. 15 crores by
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Grindlays
			<lb />
			Sank
			<lb />
			from NHB on 25.3.1992.
			<lb />
			He
			<lb />
			was

			cross
			<lb />
			examined on behalf of accused No. 1 but
			<lb />
			nothing
			<lb />
			material is elicited in the cross examination so as to
			<lb />
			doubt the testimony ot this witness.

			<lb />
			What
			<lb />
			is,
			<lb />
			however , submitted on behalf
			<lb />
			of

			the
			<lb />
			accused No. l is that the ofticers wor king in the Funds

			is true that no dealer wor king in

			<lb />
			However, that

			<lb />
			What is mater ial to be
			<lb />
			noted
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			it is not the case made out either on behalf

			ot

			accused
			<lb />
			No . 1

			<lb />
			The evidence of Kh�mbadkone [PW1 5J, therefore,

			proves

			the

			that there wa s

			in

			fact
			<lb />
			no transaction ot purchase of securities
			<lb />
			by

			NHB from Grindlays Bank is that the Grindlays Bank had

			such transactions as also the responsibility
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			reverse
			<lb />
			them, in the correspondence

			that
			<lb />
			ensued
			<lb />
			between
			<lb />
			two
			<lb />
			Banks atter the same came to
			<lb />
			to

			<lb />
			That is borne out by evidence ot Hosangadi CPW 29 ) and
			<lb />
			cor respondence
			<lb />
			at
			<lb />
			Exh.251
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			255.
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			stand
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Grindlays
			<lb />
			Bank was that it had no tran saction of sale
			<lb />
			of securities to NHB.
			<lb />
			This evidence, therefore. makes
			<lb />
			it
			<lb />
			clear that securities shown to have been purchased
			<lb />
			were
			<lb />
			never received by NHB and thus could not be with
			<lb />
			NHB.
			<lb />
			All the transactions were fake transactions.
			<lb />
			33.
			<lb />
			In addition to this, there is evidence of Rakshit
			<lb />
			(PWl J
			<lb />
			and Hosangadi lPW29J which. shows that these two
			<lb />
			officers
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />

			<lb />
			along with others had carried out inspection
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />

			<lb />
			had
			<lb />
			found
			<lb />
			that

			the
			<lb />
			securities
			<lb />
			concerning
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			at oresaid
			<lb />

			transactions

			taken

			?.0. 4.1992, 23. 3. 1 992 and 24 . 3.1992 were not found with

			If,

			in tact, such transaction of

			of

			securities

			by

			NHB from the Gr1 ndlays Bank had

			This

			<lb />
			With
			<lb />

			<lb />
			shall
			<lb />
			deal
			<lb />
			latert but suffice it to say at, this
			<lb />

			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			there
			<lb />
			is involvement of accused Nos.

			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			Jambukeshwaran
			<lb />
			lPW23 J and not by accused No . 1.
			<lb />
			34.
			<lb />
			On behalf of accused No .l it was pointed out that
			<lb />
			there
			<lb />
			no primary evidence either documentary or
			<lb />
			oral
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			show
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			secur ities
			<lb />
			were
			<lb />
			not
			<lb />
			avai lable.
			<lb />
			Howeve r9
			<lb />
			I do not tind any mer it in this
			<lb />
			submission.
			<lb />
			It
			<lb />
			has to be noted that dur ing inspection carried out
			<lb />
			by Rakshit LPWl J and Hosangadi lPWZ9 ) the accused No. 1
			<lb />
			was
			<lb />
			called back from leave and he had also helped the
			<lb />
			investigating
			<lb />
			team carrying out the investigation
			<lb />
			i�
			<lb />
			this
			<lb />
			respect.
			<lb />
			At that time accused
			<lb />
			No. 1
			<lb />
			indicated
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			there were se cur ities, however, he did not
			<lb />
			know
			<lb />
			about
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			same.
			<lb />
			Therefore accused
			<lb />
			No .2
			<lb />
			�as
			<lb />
			a lso
			<lb />
			called

			back trom the leave and it is with the help of

			<lb />
			The inventory

			<lb />
			were made by Sambamurthy [PW34 J and

			been
			<lb />
			mentioned
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			these
			<lb />
			inventoties.
			<lb />
			From
			<lb />
			this
			<lb />
			evidence,
			<lb />
			it
			<lb />
			is clear that the secur ities that
			<lb />
			were
			<lb />
			tound,
			<lb />
			which were shown to have been purchased by the
			<lb />
			aforesaid
			<lb />
			purchase transactions were not there.
			<lb />
			Here
			<lb />
			again
			<lb />
			it
			<lb />
			has to be noted that it is not the case
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			accused
			<lb />
			No.
			<lb />
			or accused No.
			<lb />
			2 that the
			<lb />
			securities
			<lb />
			were,
			<lb />
			in fact, received and they wer� kept some where
			<lb />
			and no
			<lb />
			entries
			<lb />
			with regard thereto were
			<lb />
			ever
			<lb />
			made.
			<lb />
			Much is also made about admitted fact that no register
			<lb />
			f o r
			<lb />
			holding of sec urities was maintained in FMG.
			<lb />
			To
			<lb />
			maintain
			<lb />
			such register was also the responsibi Jjty o t
			<lb />
			accused Nos.
			<lb />
			1 and 2.
			<lb />
			Therefore, non-maintenance of
			<lb />
			this
			<lb />
			register would go against the accused No. 1 and 2
			<lb />
			themselves.
			<lb />
			Apart from this, as discussed above,
			<lb />
			it
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			not
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			case
			<lb />
			of accused No. 1
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			2
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			secur ities
			<lb />
			or
			<lb />
			BRs
			<lb />
			were, in fact received
			<lb />
			from
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Grindlays
			<lb />
			Bank
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			respect
			<lb />
			ot
			<lb />
			aforesaid
			<lb />
			purchase
			<lb />
			transactions.
			<lb />
			There
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			positive
			<lb />
			ev idence
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Khambadkone LPW1 5] to show that no such transaction ot
			<lb />
			purchase
			<lb />
			of securities by NHB from the Grindlays Bank
			<lb />
			had
			<lb />
			ever taken place.
			<lb />
			Therefore, non mai ntenance
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			such register would be of no help to the accused.

			<lb />
			used to come to him 1&apos;or

			pos t

			He fur ther clarifies that since he was

			<lb />
			This also shows that accused No. 1 alone was

			<lb />
			It is pertinent

			There

			handed

			over the cheQues in case of purchase of securities and

			to

			whom

			un fortunately

			this evidence could not be collected and broupht torth

			betore

			the Court.
			<lb />
			He, however, submits that the tact
			<lb />
			remains
			<lb />
			that the cheQues were drawn on RBI in
			<lb />
			favour
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			ANZ Grin dlays Bank and thus, cheoues had, in fact,
			<lb />
			reached
			<lb />
			Grindlays
			<lb />
			Bank
			<lb />
			and on the
			<lb />
			basis
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			those
			<lb />
			cheques,
			<lb />
			the amounts have been debited to the account
			<lb />
			ot

			<lb />
			with the RB! and credited to the
			<lb />
			account
			<lb />
			ot
			<lb />
			Grindlays
			<lb />
			Bank with the RBI .As could be seen from the
			<lb />
			evidence
			<lb />
			of Sivaraman LPW24], he clearly states
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			cheques
			<lb />
			used
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			be
			<lb />
			handed

			the

			securlty

			a

			transaction
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			purchase
			<lb />
			of

			securities by NH S . This is
			<lb />
			obviously

			no

			<lb />
			no

			<lb />
			that matter.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Much was also made about evidence that is brouQht

			forth
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			the deposition of Raksh it CPWlJ and
			<lb />
			others
			<lb />
			that accused No .1 had signed first.
			<lb />
			A submission that
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			advanced
			<lb />
			on behalf of accused No .1 is that
			<lb />
			there
			<lb />
			are
			<lb />
			no written Rules or Regulat ions prescribing as to
			<lb />
			who
			<lb />
			should sign the cheque first and as to what
			<lb />
			were
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			du ties of first and second signatories.
			<lb />
			However,
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			this
			<lb />
			regard ,
			<lb />
			Raksh it CPWlJ has
			<lb />
			stated
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			an
			<lb />
			officer
			<lb />
			working
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			the department
			<lb />
			from
			<lb />
			which
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			cheque
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			issued ,
			<lb />
			is required to
			<lb />
			sign
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			cheque
			<lb />
			first .
			<lb />
			Even othe rw ise , there could be no doubt
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			second
			<lb />
			signatory
			<lb />
			would
			<lb />
			require
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			person
			<lb />
			responsible
			<lb />
			for entering into the transac tion to sign
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			cheque first and then alone the second
			<lb />
			signatory
			<lb />
			1.&gt;1ou ld
			<lb />
			put
			<lb />
			his signature.
			<lb />
			It is true that by
			<lb />
			simply
			<lb />
			o \..4-•
			<lb />
			at the cheque , it can not be made as to wh ich
			<lb />
			&quot;
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			two signatories had put Mis signature
			<lb />
			f i rs t.
			<lb />
			Desp ite
			<lb />
			this, as discussed above, it �as the
			<lb />
			accused
			<lb />
			No. l,
			<lb />
			who
			<lb />
			was i n-charg e of FMG, the
			<lb />
			transac tion
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			purchase
			<lb />
			of securities or sale of securities for that
			<lb />
			mat ter
			<lb />
			were conc ern ing FMG, therefore , there could be
			<lb />
			no
			<lb />
			manner of doubt that the accused No .l had sign the

			cheque
			<lb />

			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			then
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />

			statement
			<lb />
			in

			this statement however, t ak e s the case of defenc� no

			1&gt;1here .
			<lb />
			fhis is so because, as stated above, so f.3.r as
			<lb />
			purchase
			<lb />
			transactions of securities are concerned ,
			<lb />
			�
			<lb />
			they are concern ing 1� the FMG and accused No .1 was
			<lb />
			in-charge
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			FMG and , therefore , it was for him to
			<lb />
			sign the cheque first as it is he who had entered into
			<lb />
			the transaction of purchase of secur ities.
			<lb />
			38.
			<lb />
			Th is di�cuss ion estab l ishes the fact that all the

			<lb />
			account
			<lb />
			with RB I and debited to NHB &apos;s account with

			<lb />
			The question then would be as to who had done

			<lb />
			It is und isputed that Harshad Mehta
			<lb />
			[deceased
			<lb />
			accused]
			<lb />
			was
			<lb />
			an
			<lb />
			i mpo rt ant
			<lb />
			customer
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			Grindlays
			<lb />
			9ank .
			<lb />
			On second occasion he had
			<lb />
			gone
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			Harshad
			<lb />
			Mehta [deceased accused] with accused No .6 in
			<lb />
			his
			<lb />
			off ice to discuss some services he requ ired
			<lb />
			frcm
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			bank.
			<lb />
			He
			<lb />
			confirms that the accus e d No .6 was
			<lb />
			concerned
			<lb />
			with
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			account
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Cdeceas�d
			<lb />
			accused] in her c ap ac ity as Asstt.
			<lb />
			Manag er
			<lb />
			[Customer Re lations] .
			<lb />
			It was, therefore , ob vious that
			<lb />
			accused
			<lb />
			No .6 would be giving instructions with regard
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			the cheques brought to her en behalf of H arsh ad S.
			<lb />
			Meh ta
			<lb />
			[deceased accused ].
			<lb />
			So far as accused No.7
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			concerned , it is undisputed that at the relevant time,
			<lb />
			she
			<lb />
			was
			<lb />
			working
			<lb />
			un d e r
			<lb />
			accused No .6
			<lb />
			as
			<lb />
			a
			<lb />
			Trainee
			<lb />
			Officer.
			<lb />
			It is, there fore , ob Yious that even if
			<lb />
			she
			<lb />
			had
			<lb />
			given
			<lb />
			any instructions , as Al lwyn
			<lb />
			Roche
			<lb />
			CPW&apos;.25J
			<lb />
			\&amp;J ants
			<lb />
			to state , though not definitely, they would

			be

			<lb />
			in charge of Custome� Re lation&apos;s and was looking after
			<lb />
			Harshad

			<lb />
			Moreov er, there is positive

			against

			<lb />
			There
			<lb />
			is no question of any prejudice having been caused to

			the defence on account of destroyin9 the pencil notes

			are already on record at �xhibit -303.

			It is further

			subm itted on behalf of accused No.6 that on ly on the

			<lb />
			There is no dispute about

			However, in this case ,

			there
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			ev idence
			<lb />
			by Roche CPW25l and other witnesses to state
			<lb />
			that accused N0 .6 was working as the Asstt.
			<lb />
			Manager
			<lb />
			CCustomer Re lations] and looking after the account of
			<lb />
			Harshad Mehta (deceased accused].
			<lb />
			He has
			<lb />
			also
			<lb />
			spec ifically stated that credit of the cheques issued

			by NHB was given to the account of Harshad Mehta
			<lb />
			[deceased accused] as per the oral

			instrLtct ions of
			<lb />
			Accused No .6 and I or ac:c:used No .7. So far as accused

			No.7
			<lb />
			is concerned, she was only a Trainee Officer and
			<lb />
			could not have taken any dec ision on her own unl �s9
			<lb />
			she was guided and
			<lb />
			instructed by accused No .6.
			<lb />
			Therefore ,
			<lb />
			there should be no doub t that the credit

			vouchers
			<lb />
			for the purpose of gi ving credit to the
			<lb />
			account of Harshad S.
			<lb />
			Mehta (deceased accused] were

			The

			<lb />
			Much ,

			Ho111eve r,
			<lb />
			it
			<lb />
			is
			<lb />
			of

			no

			<lb />
			the Operat ions Department acts

			only
			<lb />
			on the basis of the voucher . No other docum en t

			comes to the Operat ions D�partment, not even a cheque.
			<lb />
			Therefore ,

			unless the credit voucher goes to the

			It is turther submitted that it is admitted

			<lb />
			could be issued

			expectation of receipt ot secur ities.
			<lb />
			He
			<lb />
			turther
			<lb />
			pointed
			<lb />
			out
			<lb />
			that in the present case when
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			BRs.
			<lb />
			were
			<lb />
			issued
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			sale
			<lb />
			transactions,
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			physical
			<lb />

			<lb />
			be
			<lb />
			received
			<lb />
			from
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			Grindlays
			<lb />
			Sank
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			purchase
			<lb />
			transactions.
			<lb />
			I
			<lb />
			do
			<lb />
			not
			<lb />
			find
			<lb />
			any
			<lb />
			me rit
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			this
			<lb />
			submission also. It was olear that no BRwas received in
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			purchase transaction nor the physical
			<lb />
			secur ities
			<lb />
			were
			<lb />
			received
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			purchase
			<lb />
			transact ions.
			<lb />
			Theretore, in the first place, the BRs.
			<lb />
			issued in the
			<lb />
			sale
			<lb />
			transaction were neither backed by the
			<lb />
			physical
			<lb />
			secur ities
			<lb />
			nor
			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			BRs.
			<lb />
			in lieu
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			physical
			<lb />
			securities.
			<lb />
			Even, it it is taken that the tirst sale
			<lb />
			transaction
			<lb />
			had
			<lb />
			taken
			<lb />
			place and then
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			purcnase
			<lb />
			transaction.
			<lb />
			Even
			<lb />
			then. it was to the knowledge
			<lb />
			ot
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			accused No. 1 and 2 that no physicals or BRs.
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			lieu
			<lb />
			thereof were received in purcnase transaction on
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			day, as all the purchase transactions were
			<lb />
			tat&lt;e
			<lb />
			transactions.
			<lb />
			Theretore, it is immaterial whether the
			<lb />
			purchase
			<lb />
			transaction
			<lb />
			took place first and then
			<lb />
			sale
			<lb />
			transaction
			<lb />
			or sale transaction took place f i rst
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			then
			<lb />
			the purchase transaction.
			<lb />
			The fact remains that
			<lb />
			in neither of the transactions. there was existence ot
			<lb />
			physical securities or the BRs in lieu of the physical
			<lb />
			se curities.
			<lb />
			It
			<lb />
			is fallacious to say that
			<lb />
			t he
			<lb />
			BRs.
			<lb />
