			<body> Judgment <lb/>Date of Pronouncement : 14/02/2020 <lb/>Date of Reserve <lb/>: 07/02/2020 <lb/>BY THE COURT : (PER HON&apos;BLE VIJAY BISHNOI, J) <lb/>All these special appeals are filed by State of Rajasthan <lb/>being aggrieved with the judgment dated 14.08.2018 passed by <lb/>the learned Single Judge in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.16256/2017 <lb/>(Ram Gopal Jaga Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors.) and eight <lb/>connected matters, whereby the writ petitions were allowed. The <lb/>operative portion of the impugned judgment is reproduced <lb/>hereunder: <lb/>&quot;20. Consequently, these writ petitions are allowed in <lb/>terms of judgment of Neeraj Saxena (supra). The <lb/>respondents are directed to consider case of petitioners <lb/>for appointment to the post of Primary School Teacher <lb/>in pursuance of advertisements published in the year <lb/>1999 in pursuance of the circular dated 10.6.1998. The <lb/>petitioners case shall be treated at par with that of <lb/>Neeraj Saxena for all purposes, however, the petitioners <lb/>shall not be given any actual pecuniary benefits for the <lb/>period during which the petitioners had actually not <lb/>worked and only notional benefits shall be considered <lb/>by the respondents. It is made clear that the <lb/>petitioners&apos; who had approached this Hon&apos;ble Court first <lb/>time by filing writ petition before Neeraj Saxena i.e. in <lb/>the year 2006 shall only be given benefit of this <lb/>judgment. Necessary consideration is required to be <lb/>made within a period of three months from today. No <lb/>order as to costs.&quot; <lb/>The respondents, herein, were the respective petitioners in <lb/>the four writ petitions decided by the impugned judgment. <lb/></body>

			<body>Brief facts, necessary for adjudication of these special <lb/>appeals, are that in the year 1998, Rural Development and <lb/>Panchayati Raj Department, Government of Rajasthan issued a <lb/>circular dated 10.06.1998, prescribing the procedure to be <lb/>followed for appointment to the vacant posts of Teachers by way <lb/>of direct recruitment. The Chief Executive Officers-Cum-<lb/>Secretaries of Zila Parishads were directed to issue advertisement <lb/>pursuant to the above referred circular, which provided bonus <lb/>marks for the domiciles of Rajasthan. <lb/>Pursuant to the said <lb/>circular, concerned Zila Parishads issued advertisement in June <lb/>1998 itself, wherein provision for granting bonus marks to the <lb/>domiciles of Rajasthan was incorporated. Some of the candidates <lb/>belonging to different districts or towns, who were not eligible for <lb/>bonus marks filed writ petitions before this Court questioning the <lb/>validity of the circular dated 10.06.1998 prescribing the bonus <lb/>marks to the domiciles of State of Rajasthan. <lb/>A Full Bench of this Court vide judgment dated 18.11.1999 <lb/>in Kailash Chand Sharma Vs. State of Rajasthan [W.P.(C) <lb/>No.3928/1998] decided on 18.11.1999, allowed these writ <lb/>petitions holding the action of the State Government in providing <lb/>bonus marks to the domiciles of Rajasthan to be unconstitutional. <lb/>The matter went up to the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court and the Hon&apos;ble <lb/>Supreme Court in Kailash Chand Sharma Vs. State of <lb/>Rajasthan &amp; Ors. reported in (2002) 6 SCC 562 while <lb/>upholding the decision of the Full Bench of this Court in Kailash <lb/>Chand Sharma Vs. State of Rajasthan gave following directions :-<lb/></body>

			<body>&quot;46. Having due regard to the rival contentions <lb/>adverted to above and keeping in view the factual scenario <lb/>and the need to balance the competing claims it the light of <lb/>acceptance of prospective overruling in principle, we <lb/>consider it just and proper to confine the relief only to the <lb/>petitioners who moved the High Court and to make <lb/>appointments made on or after 18.11.1999 in any of the <lb/>districts subject to the claims of the petitioners. Accordingly, <lb/>we direct: <lb/>1. The claims of the writ petitioners should be <lb/>considered afresh in the light of this judgment vis a vis <lb/>the candidates appointed on or after 18.11.99 or those <lb/>in the select list who are yet to be appointed. On such <lb/>consideration, if those writ petitioners are found to have <lb/>superior merit in case the bonus marks of 10% and/or <lb/>5% are excluded, they should be offered appointments, <lb/>if necessary, by displacing the candidates appointed on <lb/>or after 18.11.1999. <lb/>2. The appointments made upto 17.11.1999 need not <lb/>be reopened and reconsidered in the light of the law laid <lb/>down in this judgment. <lb/>3. Writ Petition No. 542/2000 filed in this Court under <lb/>Article 32 is hereby dismissed as it was filed nearly one <lb/>year after the judgment of the High Court and no <lb/>explanation has been tendered for not approaching the <lb/>High Court under Article 226 at an earlier point of time.&quot; <lb/>From the above directions of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court, it <lb/>is clear that the candidates, who had approached the High Court <lb/>after 18.11.1999 i.e. the date on which the Full Bench of this <lb/>Court passed the judgment in Kailash Chand Sharma&apos;s case <lb/>seeking relief for appointment pursuant to the advertisement <lb/>issued by the various Zila Parishads in the year 1998 were <lb/>declared as disentitled to get any relief. <lb/>However, the controversy did not rest there and several writ <lb/>petitions were filed before this Court seeking appointments and <lb/>conflicting orders were passed by different Benches, whereby <lb/>some of the writ petitioners were granted relief, whereas claims of <lb/></body>
			
			<page>(6 of 20) <lb/></page>
			
			<note place='headnote'>[SAW-99/2019] <lb/></note>
			
			<body> some of the petitioners were rejected. In one of such cases i.e. <lb/>Neeraj Saxena Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. (S.B. Civil <lb/>Writ Petition No.6829/2006) decided on 23.01.2009 by Jaipur <lb/>Bench of this Court, learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition <lb/>and directed the respondents to consider the petitioner for <lb/>appointment to the post of Primary School Teacher pursuant to the <lb/>advertisement dated 13.06.1998 issued by the Zila Parishad, <lb/>Chittorgarh. Later on, one aspirant again approached the Hon&apos;ble <lb/>Supreme Court and after hearing the parties at great length in the <lb/>case of Manmohan Sharma Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. <lb/>reported in (2014) 5 SCC 782 Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court has <lb/>reiterated that the candidates, who had approached the High <lb/>Court on or before 17.11.1999, were the only ones entitled to get <lb/>relief in terms of the judgment passed by it in Kailash Chand <lb/>Sharma&apos;s case (supra). The relevant portion of the judgment <lb/>passed in Manmohan Sharma&apos;s case (supra) is reproduced <lb/>hereunder :-<lb/>&quot;11. We have heard learned Counsel for the parties at <lb/>considerable length who were at pains to take us through <lb/>the judgment of this Court in Kailash Chand Sharma case <lb/>over and over again. That was so because the entitlement <lb/>of the appellants to any relief in these proceedings depends <lb/>entirely upon whether the same is permissible in terms of <lb/>the directions issued by this Court in Kailash Chand Sharma <lb/>case. As noticed earlier in Kailash Chand Sharma case this <lb/>Court invoked the doctrine of prospective overruling <lb/>primarily for two reasons. Firstly, this Court observed that <lb/>for nearly one decade selections had been made by <lb/>awarding bonus marks to residents of the districts <lb/>concerned and the rural areas falling therein which method <lb/>was upheld by the High Court in several decisions. Till the <lb/></body>

			<page>(7 of 20) <lb/></page>
			
			<note place='headnote'>[SAW-99/2019] <lb/></note>

			<body>time the selection process in the present case was initiated <lb/>and completed these decisions were holding the field. The <lb/>correctness of those decisions was, however, doubted when <lb/>writ petitions filed by Kailash Chand Sharma and Ors. came <lb/>up for hearing before a learned Single Judge with the result <lb/>that the matters were referred to a larger Bench. By the <lb/>time the judgment in those writ petitions came to be <lb/>delivered, the selection list of candidates had been <lb/>published in many districts. The law was thus in a state of <lb/>flux which justified invocation of the doctrine of prospective <lb/>overruling. This Court said: <lb/>&quot;42. … In the present case, the legality of the <lb/>selection process with the addition of bonus marks could <lb/>not have been seriously doubted either by the <lb/>appointing authorities or by the candidates in view of <lb/>the judicial precedents. A cloud was cast on the said <lb/>decisions only after the selection process was completed <lb/>and the results were declared or about to be declared. It <lb/>is, therefore, a fit case to apply the judgment of the Full <lb/>Bench <lb/>rendered <lb/>subsequent <lb/>to <lb/>the <lb/>selection <lb/>prospectively.&quot; <lb/>12. The second reason which this Court gave for <lb/>invoking the doctrine of prospective overruling was that all <lb/>those selected and appointed and selected for appointment <lb/>on the basis of the impugned selection process had not <lb/>been impleaded as parties to the writ proceedings. This <lb/>Court observed: <lb/>&quot;42. … One more aspect which is to be taken into <lb/>account is that in almost all the writ petitions the <lb/>candidates appointed, not to speak of the candidates <lb/>selected, were not made parties before the High Court. <lb/>Maybe, the laborious and long-drawn exercise of serving <lb/>notices on each and every party likely to be affected <lb/>need not have been gone through. At least, a general <lb/>notice by newspaper publication could have been sought <lb/>for or in the alternative, at least a few of the last <lb/>candidates selected/appointed could have been put on <lb/>notice; but, that was not done in almost all the cases. <lb/>That is the added reason why the judgment treading a <lb/>new path should not as far as possible result in <lb/>detriment to the candidates already appointed. We are <lb/>not so much on the question whether the writ Petitioners <lb/>were legally bound to implead all the candidates <lb/>selected/appointed during the pendency of the petitions <lb/>having regard to the fact that they were challenging the <lb/></body>

			<page>(8 of 20) <lb/>[SAW-99/2019] <lb/></page>

			<body>notification or the policy decision of general application; <lb/>but, we are taking this fact into consideration to lean <lb/>towards the view of the High Court that its judgment <lb/>ought to be applied prospectively, even if the non-<lb/>impleadment is not a fatal flaw.&quot; <lb/>13. This Court next examined the extent of <lb/>prospectively that could be given to the declaration of law <lb/>vis-à-vis the selection and appointment process under <lb/>challenge. A threefold argument was noticed by this Court <lb/>in that regard. Firstly, the Court noted the contention that <lb/>those selected and/or appointed should remain unaffected <lb/>of the law declared in Kailash Chand Sharma case for it <lb/>would be more rational and logical to apply the judgment to <lb/>future selections. The fortuitous circumstance of not being <lb/>in a position to securing appointment orders for a variety of <lb/>administrative reasons could not stand in the way of <lb/>candidates already appointed or to be appointed after the <lb/>date of the judgment. The rival contention urged on behalf <lb/>of the Respondents that there was no legal or moral <lb/>justification for making further appointments after <lb/>18-11-1999 when Kailash Chand Sharma case was decided <lb/>was also noticed by this Court. Reference was also made to <lb/>the decision of this Court in Madan Lal v. State of J &amp; K and <lb/>other cases relied upon by the selected candidates in <lb/>support of the contention that writ-petitioners having taken <lb/>a chance and participated in the selection process could not <lb/>turn around and question the said process upon their failure <lb/>to secure an appointment. It was in the backdrop of all <lb/>these submissions that this Court moulded the relief <lb/>suitably and issued directions. This Court, it is evident, <lb/>considered it just and proper to confine the relief only to <lb/>such of the candidates as were writ-petitioners before the <lb/>High Court with a direction that appointments made on or <lb/>after 18-11-1999 in any of the districts shall remain subject <lb/>to the claims of such appellants. <lb/>14. Para 46 of the judgment of this Court in Kailash <lb/>Chand Sharma case which holds the key to several <lb/>questions raised before us may, at this stage, be extracted: <lb/></body>

			<page>(9 of 20) <lb/></page>
			
			<note place='headnote'>[SAW-99/2019] <lb/></note>

			<body>&quot;46. Having due regard to the rival contentions <lb/>adverted to above and keeping in view the factual <lb/>scenario and the need to balance the competing claims <lb/>in the light of acceptance of prospective overruling in <lb/>principle, we consider it just and proper to confine the <lb/>relief only to the Petitioners who moved the High Court <lb/>and to make appointments made on or after 18-11-1999 <lb/>in any of the districts subject to the claims of the <lb/>petitioners. Accordingly, we direct: <lb/>1. The claims of the writ petitioners should be <lb/>considered afresh in the light of this judgment <lb/>vis-à-vis the candidates appointed on or after <lb/>18-11-1999 or those in the select list who are yet to <lb/>be appointed. On such consideration, if those writ <lb/>petitioners are found to have superior merit in case <lb/>the bonus marks of 10% and/or 5% are excluded, <lb/>they should be offered appointments, if necessary, <lb/>by displacing the candidates appointed on or after <lb/>18-11-999. <lb/>2. The appointments made up to 17-11-1999 <lb/>need not be reopened and reconsidered in the light <lb/>of the law laid down in this judgment. <lb/>3. Writ Petition No. 542 of 2000 filed in this <lb/>Court under Article 32 is hereby dismissed as it was <lb/>filed nearly one year after the judgment of the High <lb/>Court and no explanation has been tendered for not <lb/>approaching the High Court under Article 226 at an <lb/>earlier point of time.&quot; <lb/>A careful reading of the above leaves no manner of doubt <lb/>that: <lb/>(a) this Court invoked the doctrine of prospective <lb/>overruling which implies that the law declared by this Court <lb/>would apply only to future selections and appointments; <lb/>(b) that although prospective overruling left the <lb/>appointments made before 18-11-1999 untouched, the writ-<lb/>petitioners who had moved the High Court had to be <lb/>considered afresh vis-à-vis candidates appointed on or after <lb/>18-11-1999 or those in the select list without giving to such <lb/>appointed/selected candidates the benefit of bonus marks <lb/>under the circular; and <lb/>(c) that upon such consideration of the writ petitioners if <lb/>they are found to be superior in merit than those appointed <lb/>after 18-11-1999 they shall be offered appointments, if <lb/>necessary, by removing the latter. <lb/>15. It was strenuously contended by learned Counsel <lb/>for the appellants that the expression &quot;the appellants who <lb/>moved the High Court&quot; appearing in para 46 was wide <lb/>enough and actually covered not only such of the writ-<lb/></body>

			<page>(10 of 20) <lb/></page>
			
			<note place='headnote'>[SAW-99/2019] <lb/></note>

			<body>petitioners as had approached the High Court in the two <lb/>batch of cases decided by this Court in Kailash Chand <lb/>Sharma case but also all such candidates as may have filed <lb/>writ petitions at any time after 18-11-1999 including those <lb/>who filed such petition after 30-7-2002 when this Court <lb/>decided the appeals in Kailash Chand Sharma case and <lb/>connected matters. <lb/>16. We find it difficult to accept that contention. There <lb/>is nothing in the judgment of this Court in Kailash Chand <lb/>Sharma case or the directions that were issued in para 46 <lb/>thereof to suggest that this Court was either conscious of or <lb/>informed of pendency of any writ petition filed before the <lb/>High Court after 18-11-1999. There is also nothing to <lb/>suggest that this Court intended the benefit granted in <lb/>terms of Direction (1) under para 46 to extend not only to <lb/>the writ petitioners who had moved the High Court in <lb/>Kailash Chand Sharma case and in the writ petition filed by <lb/>Naval Kishore and others but the same has intended to <lb/>benefit all those who had or may have moved the High <lb/>Court at any point of time. On the contrary there is positive <lb/>indication of the fact that the Court did not intend to extend <lb/>the benefit to any Appellant who had challenged the award <lb/>of bonus marks and the selection process on the basis <lb/>thereof at any stage after 18-11-1999. This is evident from <lb/>the fact that Writ Petition No. 542 of 2000 filed in this Court <lb/>under Article 32 of the Constitution of India was dismissed <lb/>by this Court in terms of Direction (3) under para 46 on the <lb/>ground that the same had been filed nearly one year after <lb/>the judgment of the High Court. The expression &quot;as it has <lb/>been filed after the judgment of the High Court&quot; appearing <lb/>in Direction (3) under Para 46 clearly suggest that for the <lb/>grant of relief this Court had only petitions filed before the <lb/>judgment in Kailash Chand Sharma case in mind and not <lb/>those filed after 18-11-1999 when the said judgment was <lb/>pronounced. The observation of this Court that the writ-<lb/>petitioners had offered no explanation for not approaching <lb/>the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution at an <lb/>earlier point of time too has two distinct facets, namely, (1) <lb/>that the writ-petitioners in Writ Petition No. 542 of 2000 <lb/></body>

			<page>(11 of 20) <lb/></page>
			
			<note place='headnote'>[SAW-99/2019] <lb/></note>

			<body>should have ordinarily approached the High Court and (2) <lb/>They should have done so at an earlier point of time. The <lb/>latter of these reasons again emphasized the importance <lb/>this Court attached to the delay in the filing of the petitions <lb/>in the matter of grant of relief for those who did not <lb/>challenge the selection process in good time were not <lb/>granted any relief. <lb/>17. Judged in the above backdrop the present appeals <lb/>can be classified into two categories, namely, Category I <lb/>comprising writ petitions that were filed after 18-11-1999 <lb/>and before 30-7-2002 as was the position in Writ Petition <lb/>No. 542 of 2000 filed under Article 32 and dismissed by this <lb/>Court and Category II comprising writ petitions that were <lb/>filed after 30-7-2002. While there is nothing that could be <lb/>logically argued in regard to Category II cases for extending <lb/>the benefit of the judgment in Kailash Chand Sharma case <lb/>to those cases, even in regard to Category I cases the <lb/>judgment of this Court holds no hope for the appellants. All <lb/>that was contended by learned Counsel for the appellants in <lb/>Category I cases was that writ petition in Naval Kishore <lb/>Sharma&apos;s batch was filed after the pronouncement of the <lb/>Full Bench judgment of the High Court in Kailash Chand <lb/>Sharma case. Grant of benefit to appellants in Naval Kishore <lb/>Sharma&apos;s batch of writ petitions and refusal of a similar <lb/>treatment to the writ-petitioners who had similarly filed <lb/>their petitions no matter later in point of time would be <lb/>unfair and inequitable. They contended that the relief given <lb/>by this Court to Naval Kishore Sharma and Others ought to <lb/>be extended even to other similarly situated writ-petitioners <lb/>by construing the directions of this Court in Kailash Chand <lb/>Sharma case liberally. <lb/>18. There is, in our opinion, no merit in that <lb/>contention either. In Category I cases none of the writ <lb/>petitions were filed earlier than the date on which writ <lb/>petition in Naval Kishore Sharma&apos;s case was filed. At any <lb/>rate, the argument that some writ petitions had been filed <lb/>around the same time when Naval Kishore Sharma&apos;s case <lb/>was decided may be no reason for us to enlarge the scope <lb/></body>

			<page>(12 of 20) <lb/></page>
			
			<note place='headnote'>[SAW-99/2019] <lb/></note>

			<body>of the direction issued in Kailash Chand Sharma case which <lb/>is on true and proper construction limited to the writ-<lb/>petitioners who had moved the High Court in those cases. <lb/>We need to remind ourselves that we are not hearing a <lb/>review petition in Kailash Chand Sharma case nor can we <lb/>modify the order passed in that case. What cannot be done <lb/>directly by us, cannot also be done indirectly by placing <lb/>what is described as a liberal interpretation by learned <lb/>Counsel for the appellants. <lb/>19. Mr. Bali, learned Counsel appearing for some of <lb/>the appellants in Category II strenuously argued that <lb/>although the appellants in those cases were not writ <lb/>petitioners at any point of time before the pronouncement <lb/>of the judgment of this Court in Kailash Chand Sharma case <lb/>some of the appellants could and were indeed appointed as <lb/>teachers upon consideration of their inter se merit vis-à-vis <lb/>candidates who had been appointed after 18-11-1999. It <lb/>was submitted that the right of such candidates to make a <lb/>grievance against appointment of persons lower in merit <lb/>with bonus marks awarded to them was not and could not <lb/>be taken away by the judgment of this Court in Kailash <lb/>Chand Sharma case. This would imply that even <lb/>independent of the said judgment if the writ-petitioners <lb/>were higher in merit than those appointed at any time after <lb/>18-11-1999, the appellants could make a grievance and <lb/>seek redress from the Government. Inasmuch as such <lb/>appointments have been made in a few cases falling under <lb/>Category II, the same could not be faulted only because the <lb/>writ petitions were filed after the judgment in the Kailash <lb/>Chand Sharma case was pronounced. <lb/>20. On behalf of the Respondents Mr. Shiv Mangal <lb/>Sharma, Additional Advocate General for the State of <lb/>Rajasthan submitted that the appointment of Category II <lb/>cases was clearly illegal and impermissible in the light of the <lb/>judgment of this Court in Kailash Chand Sharma case. The <lb/>contention that some of the appellants in Category II were <lb/>better in merit even without deletion of bonus marks was <lb/>wholly unsustainable and without any basis whatsoever. No <lb/></body>

			<note place='headnote'>[SAW-99/2019] <lb/></note>

			<body>such case has been made out by the appellants in their <lb/>respective writ petitions. An affidavit filed by the State has, <lb/>in that regard, clarified the position that candidates falling in <lb/>Category II not yet appointed are lower in merit with bonus <lb/>marks loaded to their merit than the last candidate <lb/>appointed under the open general category to which the <lb/>appellants also belonged. <lb/>21. There is considerable merit in the contention <lb/>urged by Mr. Sharma. The case sought to be argued at the <lb/>Bar was never set up in the writ petitions filed by the <lb/>appellants before the High Court. It was not even remotely <lb/>suggested that the appellants were appointed on account of <lb/>their superior merit without deletion of the bonus marks. <lb/>Indeed if anyone with lesser merit had been appointed writ-<lb/>petitions challenging such appointment should have been <lb/>filed quickly thereafter and not belatedly as was the position <lb/>in the instant case. That apart, the affidavit filed by the <lb/>Respondents satisfactorily refutes the contention urged at <lb/>the Bar by Mr. Bali. The merit position without deletion of <lb/>bonus marks did not justify the appointment of anyone <lb/>falling under Category II as they were all lesser in merit <lb/>than the last candidate appointed in the open general <lb/>category. We have, therefore, no hesitation in rejecting the <lb/>contention that the appointments of those falling under <lb/>Category II were justifiable on any ground independent of <lb/>the directions issued by this Court in Kailash Chand Sharma <lb/>case. It is noteworthy that some of those appointed had <lb/>even filed affidavits stating that they were parties before <lb/>this Court which in fact was not the true position.&quot; <lb/>Recently, the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in the case of State of <lb/>Rajasthan Vs. Nemi Chand Mahela &amp; Ors. reported in <lb/>2019(2) WLC (SC) Civil 299 has again emphasised that the <lb/>candidates who had not filed writ petitions on or before <lb/>17.11.1999 would not be entitled to appointment upon <lb/>recalculation of marks by exclusion of bonus marks from the <lb/>marks of the selected candidates. In the above decision, the <lb/></body>

			<body>Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court has also taken into consideration the <lb/>judgment dated 23.01.2009 passed by the Jaipur Bench of this <lb/>Court in Neeraj Saxena&apos;s case (supra) and held that the decision <lb/>in that case does not lay down any ratio in the form of precedent <lb/>and also issued a direction that all the pending writ petitions and <lb/>appeals, before the High Court, would be disposed of and decided <lb/>on the basis of decision in Kailash Chand Sharma&apos;s and <lb/>Manmohan Sharma&apos;s cases (supra). The relevant portion of the <lb/>above judgment is quoted hereunder :-<lb/>&quot;12. Our attention was also drawn to the case of Neeraj <lb/>Saxena in whose case the writ appeal filed by the <lb/>State Government against the order of the Single <lb/>Judge was dismissed on the ground of delay and <lb/>inaction. The Special Leave Petition against the <lb/>decision of the Division Bench was also dismissed on <lb/>the ground of delay. This decision of the Division <lb/>Bench in Neeraj Saxena and the dismissal of the <lb/>Special Leave Petition on the ground of delay does not <lb/>lay down any ratio in the form of precedent. At best, <lb/>the decision of the Single Judge in the case of Neeraj <lb/>Saxena as in the case of Danveer Singh would apply <lb/>to the specific candidates in whose case the decision <lb/>would operate as res judicata. This, however, would <lb/>not be a ground to negate and nullify the ratio and <lb/>direction invoking doctrine of prospective overruling, <lb/>applied in Kailash Chand Sharma&apos;s case (supra), <lb/>which was thereafter affirmed and elucidated by this <lb/>Court in Manmohan Singh&apos;s case (supra). <lb/>13. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold that the <lb/>candidates who had not filed writ petitions on or <lb/>before November 17, 1999 would not be entitled to <lb/>appointment upon recalculation of marks by exclusion <lb/>of bonus marks from the marks of the selected <lb/>candidates. The aforesaid direction would not apply to <lb/></body>

			<body>individual cases where the principle of res judicata <lb/>would apply, i.e. wherein the decision of the Single <lb/>Judge or the Division Bench has become final since it <lb/>was not challenged before the Division Bench or <lb/>before this Court. All other pending writ petitions and <lb/>appeals, before the High Court, would be disposed of <lb/>and decided on the basis of decisions in Kailash <lb/>Chandra Sharma&apos;s, Manmohan Sharma&apos;s cases <lb/>(supra) and the present matter, subject to <lb/>condonation of delay, when justified and satisfactorily <lb/>explained&quot; <lb/>(emphasis supplied) <lb/>It is noticed that the writ petitions filed by the respondents <lb/>were allowed by the learned Single Judge in terms of the decision <lb/>rendered in Neeraj Saxena&apos;s case (supra), however, in the case <lb/>of State of Rajasthan Vs. Nemi Chand Mahela &amp; Ors. (supra) <lb/>the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court has categorically held that the decision <lb/>passed in the case of Neeraj Saxena (supra) does not lay down <lb/>any ratio in the form of precedent and only on this ground the <lb/>impugned judgment is liable to be set aside. <lb/>The private respondents in the special appeals were also not <lb/>entitled to get any relief in the writ petitions filed by them as <lb/>admittedly they did not approach this Court on or before <lb/>17.11.1999 as they filed writ petitions in the year 2002 onwards <lb/>whereas the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in the cases of Kailash <lb/>Chand Sharma and Manmohan Sharma (supra) has <lb/>categorically held that the candidates, who have approached the <lb/>High Court after 18.11.1999, are not entitled to get any relief in <lb/>terms of Kailash Chand Sharma&apos;s case (supra). <lb/></body>

			<body>In view of the above discussions, we are of the view that the <lb/>impugned judgment passed by the learned Single Judge is liable <lb/>to be set aside and the writ petitions filed by the private <lb/>respondents are deserves to be dismissed. <lb/>Resultantly, these special appeal writs are allowed, the <lb/>impugned judgment dated 14.08.2018 passed by learned Single <lb/>Judge is set aside and the writ petitions filed by the private <lb/>respondents are dismissed. <lb/>Before parting, we would like to elaborate upon some glaring <lb/>facts, which reflect that how a litigant can abuse the process of <lb/>the Court by filing successive writ petitions while concealing the <lb/>adverse orders passed against him/her previously. <lb/>Respondent -Ram Gopal Jaga filed first writ petition being <lb/>S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.9799/2002 (Ram Gopal Jaga Vs. <lb/>State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors.) in the year 2002 at Jaipur Bench of <lb/>this Court seeking relief that he may be provided appointment on <lb/>the post of Teacher Grade III in terms of the judgment passed by <lb/>the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in Kailash Chand Sharma&apos;s case <lb/>(supra). The said writ petition was disposed of vide order dated <lb/>21.12.2002 with a direction to Ram Gopal Jaga along with several <lb/>other writ petitioners to submit a representation before the <lb/>Director, Panchayat Raj Department and the concerned authority <lb/>was directed to decide the said representation within 30 days <lb/>thereafter by providing opportunity of hearing to the petitioners. <lb/>The representations filed by Ram Gopal Jaga came to be dismissed <lb/>by the State Government on 07.01.2004. <lb/></body>

			<body> In the year 2009, again Ram Gopal Jaga filed another writ <lb/>petition being S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.9034/2009 (Veer <lb/>Singh Jatav &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors.) before this <lb/>Court and the said writ petition was disposed of by this Court vide <lb/>order dated 04.05.2011 in terms of the judgment rendered in S.B. <lb/>Civil Writ Petition No.4555/2004 (Dattesh Mehta &amp; Ors. Vs. State <lb/>of Rajasthan &amp; Ors.) decided on 20.01.2011. <lb/>Again in the year 2014, Ram Gopal Jaga filed S.B. Civil Writ <lb/>Petition No.5115/2014 (Ram Gopal Jaga Vs. State of <lb/>Rajasthan &amp; Ors.) before this Court, which was dismissed vide <lb/>order dated 29.09.2014. <lb/>Again in the year 2015, Ram Gopal Jaga preferred S.B. Civil <lb/>Writ Petition No.1780/2015 (Ram Gopal Jaga Vs. State of <lb/>Rajasthan &amp; Ors.) before this Court, however, the same came to <lb/>be dismissed in limine by this Court vide order dated 25.02.2015 <lb/>while passing the following order :-<lb/>&quot;The prayer in the present petition is for a direction to <lb/>the respondents to appoint the petitioner on the post of <lb/>Primary Teacher in pursuance to the advertisement dated <lb/>13.06.1998. It is not disputed that the petitioner had earlier <lb/>filed S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 9034/2009 titled as &quot;Veer <lb/>Singh Jatav &amp; Ors. Vs. State &amp; Ors.&quot;, which was disposed of <lb/>by this Court vide order dated 04.05.2011 in terms of the <lb/>judgment rendered in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 4555/2004 <lb/>(Dattesh Mehta &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Raj. &amp; Ors.), decided on <lb/>20.01.2011 directing the respondents to proceed against <lb/>the candidates against whom enquiry has been initiated by <lb/>the department and thereafter, in case, any vacancy was <lb/>still vacant, their cases be considered accordingly. When <lb/>nothing was done by the respondents, the petitioner again <lb/></body>

			<body>filed S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 5115/2014 titled as <lb/>&quot;Ramgopal Jaga Vs. State &amp; Ors.&quot; after a gap of almost <lb/>three years, which further came to be dismissed by this <lb/>Court vide Order dated 29.09.2014. The learned Single <lb/>Judge did not deem it proper to interfere in the selection <lb/>made in the year 1998 by observing as under :-<lb/>&quot;In this writ petition, the petitioner is claiming <lb/>appointment on the post of Teacher Grade-III against <lb/>the vacancies advertised in the year 1998, therefore, it <lb/>is not proper to interfere in the selection made against <lb/>the vacancies of the year 1998. Hence, this writ petition <lb/>filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is <lb/>hereby dismissed.&quot; <lb/>The Apex Court in the case of EX. Captain Harish <lb/>Uppal Vs. Union of India &amp; ors. reported in 1994 (Supp <lb/>(2)SCC 195 upheld the decision of the High Court <lb/>dismissing the writ petition on the ground of delay and <lb/>laches stating that the delay was equally applicable even if <lb/>any subsequent order passed by the Government in <lb/>compliance of the Supreme Court&apos;s orders that the <lb/>representation, if not already decided, should be disposed of <lb/>at an early date, as the same would not have the effect of <lb/>curing the defect. <lb/>Even otherwise, the Apex Court in the case of Bhoop <lb/>Singh Vs. Union of India &amp; ors. reported in AIR 1992 <lb/>SC1414 held that in case, where termination of services was <lb/>not challenged for a long period, the challenge could not be <lb/>allowed merely because others whose services were <lb/>similarly terminated, had been reinstated. Now, the second <lb/>writ petition has been filed once again for the same relief on <lb/>the ground that S. B. Civil Writ Petition No. 6829/2006 filed <lb/>by similarly situated one Neeraj Saxena was allowed on <lb/>23.01.2009 and the appeal against the same was also <lb/>dismissed on 29.04.2014 and that the said Neeraj Saxena <lb/>has now joined on 10.09.2014 in pursuance to the <lb/>appointment order dated 08.09.2014. It is evident from the <lb/>above that all the above facts were in existence at the time <lb/>when the Writ Petition No. 5115/2014 filed by the petitioner <lb/>was dismissed on 29.09.2014. The order dated 29.09.2014 <lb/></body>

			<body>passed by this Court has attained finality. The same has not <lb/>been challenged by the petitioner. Thus, any subsequent <lb/>change in law ipso facto does not permit the reopening of <lb/>the case, which otherwise stands settled inter-se the <lb/>parties. In view of the above, the writ petition is dismissed.&quot; <lb/>Strangely, Ram Gopal Jaga than again filed S.B. Civil Writ <lb/>Petition No.5123/2015 (Ram Gopal Jaga Vs. State of <lb/>Rajasthan &amp; Ors.) before this Court and it seems that on the <lb/>first hearing it was prayed before the Court that the controversy <lb/>involved in the writ petition is squarely covered by the judgment <lb/>dated 29.04.2014 passed by the Division Bench of this Court in <lb/>State of Rajathan &amp; Ors. Vs. Neeraj Saxena (D.B. Civil <lb/>Special Appeal (Writ) No. 539/2013) and this Court vide <lb/>order dated 18.05.2015 considering the prayer of counsel for Ram <lb/>Gopal Jaga permitted him to submit a representation to the <lb/>appropriate authority in the light of the above referred judgment <lb/>and it was observed that the concerned authority shall consider <lb/>and decide such representation as per law. <lb/>It is evident that while arguing in S.B. Civil Writ Petition <lb/>No.5123/2015 (Ram Gopal Jaga Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; <lb/>Ors.) decided on 18.05.2015, learned counsel for Ram Gopal Jaga <lb/>did not explicitly disclose this fact in the Court that earlier two writ <lb/>petitions being S.B. Civil Writ Petition Nos.5115/2014 and <lb/>1780/2015, claiming same relief in terms of Neeraj Saxena&apos;s <lb/>case (supra), &quot;had been dismissed&quot; by this Court vide orders <lb/>dated 29.09.2014 and 25.02.2015 respectively. <lb/>Ram Gopal Jaga filed S.B. Civil Writ Petition <lb/>No.16256/2017 (Ram Gopal Jaga Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; <lb/></body>

			<body>Ors.) before this Court in the year 2017 claiming that his <lb/>representation was illegally rejected by the respondents, which <lb/>was made in terms of the directions issued by this Court in S.B. <lb/>Civil Writ Petition No.5123/2015 (Ram Gopal Jaga Vs. State of <lb/>Rajasthan &amp; Ors.) decided on 18.05.2015. <lb/>It is indeed an unfortunate state of affairs that the same <lb/>counsel had filed all the above mentioned writ petitions on behalf <lb/>of Ram Gopal Jaga in the years 2009, 2014, 2015 and 2017 but <lb/>he deliberately concealed these material facts and orders while <lb/>arguing the cases before the Court. Such conduct of a counsel, <lb/>having good years of practice, is condemnable and fit to be <lb/>deprecated. <lb/>Taking into consideration the above facts and circumstances <lb/>of the case, we deem it appropriate to impose cost of Rs.50,000/-<lb/>upon respondent -Ram Gopal Jaga. He shall deposit the same <lb/>before the Rajasthan State Legal Services Authorities, Jodhpur <lb/>within a period of one month. If the said cost is not deposited by <lb/>Ram Gopal Jaga, the Rajasthan State Legal Services Authorities, <lb/>Jodhpur is directed to inform this Court immediately after expiry <lb/>of the prescribed period of depositing the cost. <lb/>Ordered accordingly. <lb/>A copy of this order be sent to the Rajasthan State Legal <lb/>Services Authorities, Jodhpur. <lb/>(VIJAY BISHNOI),J <lb/>(SANDEEP MEHTA),J <lb/>Abhishek Kumar <lb/>S.Nos.84 to 87 </body>
