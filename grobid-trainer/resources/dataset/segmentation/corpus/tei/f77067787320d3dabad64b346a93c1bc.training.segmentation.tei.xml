			<lb />
			Petitioners-the Excise Licensees contend that
			<lb />
			steps taken by the State to compensate them for loss of
			<lb />
			revenue due to COVID-19 pandemic are not adequate and
			<lb />
			therefore, pray for allowing them to deposit the license fees
			<lb />
			for the months of June, July, August and September, 2020
			<lb />
			on pro-rata basis. Whereas State opposes the prayer
			<lb />
			questioning the maintainability of writ petitions against
			<lb />
			policy decisions and on the strength of &apos;concluded excise
			<lb />
			contracts&apos; executed between the parties permitting no
			<lb />
			variation besides emphasizing that orders already passed
			<lb />
			by the State from time to time have adequately redressed all
			<lb />
			the genuine grievances of the excise licensees.

			vends located in District Kullu was heard on 06.07.2020
			<lb />
			and the following interim order was passed, whereunder
			<lb />
			pending decision on representations of the petitioners,
			<lb />
			respondents were directed to levy license fee on pro-rata
			<lb />
			basis subject to petitioners&apos; opening their liquor vends:-
			<lb />
			&quot;Heard for some time. The representations made by
			<lb />
			the petitioners are yet to be considered and taken to their
			<lb />
			logical end by the respondents. Yet, we fail to understand why
			<lb />
			in the current time, especially, when the representations of the
			<lb />
			petitioners are pending, the respondents should insist on the
			<lb />
			enforcement of the provisions relating to Minimum Guaranteed
			<lb />
			Quota (MGQ) as also Minimum Vend Value (MVV) based on
			<lb />
			MGQ for the year 2020-21.
			<lb />
			Therefore, in the integrum, we direct that respondents
			<lb />
			shall not insist upon provisions relating to MGQ, subject to the
			<lb />
			conditions that petitioners shall also open the liquor vends.
			<lb />
			As regards the representations of the petitioners, we
			<lb />
			direct the State to take a decision before the next date of
			<lb />
			hearing. Till then, the licence fee would be deposited by the
			<lb />
			petitioners on pro-rata basis as per Annexure P-7. Ordered

			<lb />
			During hearing of the case on 20.07.2020,
			<lb />

			before the Court, informing that issue of MGQ will be
			<lb />
			considered by the Council of Ministers on 20.07.2020:-
			<lb />
			&quot;The above cited Civil Writ Petitions were listed before
			<lb />
			the Hon&apos;ble Court on 06-07-2020 and Hon&apos;ble court was
			<lb />
			pleased to direct the respondents to decide the representations
			<lb />
			of petitioners by the next date of hearing i.e. 20-07-2020.
			<lb />
			It is submitted that the petitioners in the
			<lb />
			representations have mainly requested to reduce the Minimum
			<lb />
			Guaranteed Quota (MGQ) and license fee to 25% to 30% or
			<lb />
			allow to pay the license fee on the actual quantity of lifting of
			<lb />
			liquor. It may be submitted that the fixation of MGQ is a policy
			<lb />
			matter and has to be decided by the Council of Ministers,
			<lb />

			the matter and forward the same to the Meeting of Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers. It is further submitted that the Meeting of Council of
			<lb />
			Ministers is scheduled to be held on 20-07-2020 and the issue
			<lb />
			regarding MGQ will also be taken up. Therefore, the
			<lb />
			respondents require some more time to comply with the order
			<lb />
			passed by the Hon&apos;ble Court…………..&quot;
			<lb />
			3(iv).
			<lb />
			On 01.09.2020, the Court was apprised of
			<lb />
			passing of an order dated 31.08.2020 by the Principal
			<lb />
			Secretary (E&amp;T), deciding the representations of the Retail
			<lb />
			Excise Licensees/Petitioners. It will be appropriate at this
			<lb />
			stage to reproduce some relevant extracts from this order,
			<lb />
			which was later on brought on record of the case:-
			<lb />
			&quot;All the above stated observations suggest that
			<lb />
			Government has sympathetically considered the situation
			<lb />
			arising out of COVID-19 Pandemic &amp; already granted following
			<lb />
			reliefs:
			<lb />
			(i) Allowed lifting of Country Liquor &amp; IMFL on actual
			<lb />
			basis instead of enforcing Minimum Guaranteed Quota.
			<lb />
			(ii) Shifted the Financial Year for the purpose of Excise
			<lb />
			Policy w.e.f. 01/06/2020 to 31/05/2020.
			<lb />
			Further, this is also a fact that the things are moving in
			<lb />
			the direction of normalization of all other activities in the State
			<lb />
			as we are already in the Unlock-4 stage. The data from various
			<lb />
			districts regarding lifting has also shown much improvement.
			<lb />
			However, there have been some losses during the first quarter
			<lb />
			of 2020-21 i.e. June, July &amp; August, so the government after
			<lb />
			due consideration of their claims decided to grant a further
			<lb />
			relief on the Minimum Guaranteed Quota for the first quarter
			<lb />
			ending 31 st August. Therefore, in order to provide relief to the
			<lb />
			licensees, the Government of Himachal Pradesh in the meeting
			<lb />
			of Council of Ministers has decided
			<lb />
			a) That the Minimum Guaranteed Quota of Country
			<lb />
			Liquor &amp; IMFL for the first three months of the
			<lb />
			year 2020-21 i.e. June, July &amp; August shall be
			<lb />
			reduced by 5% &amp; 10% respectively for all L-2 &amp; L-
			<lb />
			14 Licensees. The MGQ for the next three
			<lb />
			quarters shall remain the same.
			<lb />
			b) The loss of Excise revenue amounting to 23 crores
			<lb />
			(approx.) will be recovered by enhancing the License
			<lb />
			Fee proportionately which will also lead to the nominal
			<lb />
			increase in MRP and the margin of the licensees.

			c)
			<lb />
			The BIO (Bottled in origin) Brands will now be the part
			<lb />
			of the MGQ which were previously excluded from its
			<lb />
			purview which will again help the licensees in this
			<lb />
			quota lifting obligations.
			<lb />
			Loss of revenue especially in tourist destinations
			<lb />
			like Shimla, Kullu &amp; Dharamshala will be compensated
			<lb />
			during the next tourist season which starts in the month
			<lb />
			of April &amp; May as due to extension of excise year the
			<lb />
			benefit of April &amp; May will accrue to licensees.
			<lb />
			Thus, to conclude there are six distinct forms in which
			<lb />
			the State Government is providing relief across the board to
			<lb />
			which the petitioner is beneficiary. These include:
			<lb />
			1. Relaxation in MGQ requirements for one quarter as
			<lb />
			stated in para (a) above
			<lb />
			2. Increase in License fee and a subsequent increase in
			<lb />
			Margins as stated in para (b) above.
			<lb />
			3. Adjustment of BIO brands within the quota of the
			<lb />
			licensee as per para (c) above
			<lb />
			4. Shifting of Financial year
			<lb />
			5. Actual lifting based license fee for the April and May
			<lb />
			6. Loss due to less tourist inflow during the 1 st Quarter
			<lb />
			will be compensated in the next year in the month of
			<lb />
			April &amp; May.
			<lb />
			Such an array of benefits have not been given in any
			<lb />
			state till date. The petitioner despite his errant track record
			<lb />
			during this period will also get these benefits. There is no need
			<lb />
			or justification for any exceptional or further relief to the
			<lb />
			applicant.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			The petitioner thereafter was permitted to
			<lb />
			amend and accordingly filed an amended writ petition,
			<lb />
			inter-alia, challenging the above-extracted order dated
			<lb />
			31.08.2020. Petitioner till date is operating the liquor vend
			<lb />
			on the basis of interim directions.

			<lb />
			Contentions:-

			<lb />
			year 2020-21 considering all prevalent facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances arising due to COVID-19 pandemic and its
			<lb />
			actual impact on their business. The prime factual
			<lb />
			argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners is that they
			<lb />
			had applied for renewal of excise licenses when the
			<lb />
			lockdown and curfew had not been imposed. They had
			<lb />
			applied unmindful of the extent of COVID-19 spread in
			<lb />
			future and its adverse affect on their business. All liquor
			<lb />
			vends remained closed on 22.03.2020 to observe Janta
			<lb />
			curfew. Lockdown was imposed in the respondent-State on
			<lb />
			23.03.2020 followed by curfew. Liquor vends continued to
			<lb />
			remain closed. Lockdown was extended. Taking note of
			<lb />
			prevailing situation, on 30.03.2020, State Government
			<lb />
			ordered extension of Excise Policy 2019-20 upto
			<lb />
			31.05.2020 and permitted operation of Excise Policy
			<lb />
			2020-21 w.e.f. 01.06.2020 to 31.05.2021. Gradually, liquor
			<lb />
			vends were allowed to function with restrictive operative
			<lb />
			hours. Lockdown was gradually eased, but social
			<lb />
			restrictions remained in force. Threat of virus never actually
			<lb />
			went away. Kullu, being a tourist place, remained worst
			<lb />
			affected due to cessation of all tourism related activities and

			businesses. Petitioners though operated the vends under
			<lb />
			the interim orders of the Court, but could not lift the MGQ
			<lb />
			for the relevant period fixed in the Excise Announcements
			<lb />
			for the year 2020-21. Actual sales have remained very low.
			<lb />
			Therefore, MGQ fixed for the year 2020-21 for District Kullu
			<lb />
			should be reduced by 30% or alternatively the excise fees
			<lb />
			should be made proportional to actual lifting of the quantity
			<lb />
			of the liquor. Petitioners have also laid emphasis upon their
			<lb />
			various representations preferred in this regard to the
			<lb />
			respondents prior to 01.06.2020 and even thereafter.
			<lb />
			During hearing of the case, learned Senior Counsel
			<lb />
			appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that
			<lb />
			though their liquor vends have still not been able to lift the
			<lb />
			MGQ fixed in the Excise Announcements 2020-21,
			<lb />
			however, due to some leeway in resumption of tourism
			<lb />
			activities in District Kullu, the petitioners would be willing
			<lb />
			to abide by excise fee payments/MGQ/MVV of Excise Policy
			<lb />
			2020-21 w.e.f. 01.10.2020 onwards. However, the excise
			<lb />
			levies for the period 01.06.2020 to 30.09.2020 be realized
			<lb />
			from them only on pro-rata basis and not on the basis of

			reduction in MGQ by 5 and 10% for L-2 and L-14 licenses,
			<lb />
			respectively, for first quarter of excise year 2020-21 does
			<lb />
			not recompense business strains of the petitioners.
			<lb />
			4(ii).
			<lb />
			Learned Advocate General vehemently opposed
			<lb />
			the petitions. On facts, it was put forth that COVID-19 had
			<lb />
			already spread its tentacles by the time the petitioners
			<lb />
			applied for renewal of their excise licenses. A simile was
			<lb />
			given that the petitioners though would never share their
			<lb />
			advantage with State in case of boost in their sale, which
			<lb />
			may occasion for any reason, say for example likely spurt of
			<lb />
			tourism in the area on account of recent opening of Atal
			<lb />
			Tunnel in Rohtang, Lahaul &amp; Spiti, but will crib over their
			<lb />
			alleged losses or inability to lift the fixed MGQ due to
			<lb />
			COVID-19 spread and wish State to come to their rescue.
			<lb />
			He further submitted that the State Government has
			<lb />
			already taken into consideration the losses during first
			<lb />
			quarter of excise year 2020-21 and various decisions have
			<lb />
			appropriately been taken for the benefit of liquor licensees
			<lb />
			of the State. No special treatment can be given to liquor

			licensees of District Kullu.

			Peter and others, learned Advocate General submitted
			<lb />
			that the petitioners have entered into excise contract with
			<lb />
			the State. The terms and conditions of the same are binding
			<lb />
			upon the government and the licensees. Neither of them
			<lb />
			can depart from the same. He pressed following para 14 of
			<lb />
			the judgment in furtherance of his submissions:-
			<lb />
			&quot;14. The contract between the parties is governed by statutory
			<lb />
			provisions, i.e., provisions of the Act, the rules, the conditions
			<lb />
			of licence and the counterpart agreement. They constitute the
			<lb />
			terms and conditions of the contract. They are binding both
			<lb />
			upon the Government and the licensee. Neither of them can
			<lb />
			depart from them. It is not open to any officer of the
			<lb />
			Government to either modify, amend or alter the said terms
			<lb />
			and conditions, not even to the Minister for Excise…………..&quot;
			<lb />
			Learned Advocate General further relied upon
			<lb />
			following extract of the above judgment to highlight the
			<lb />
			point that executory contracts always carry in them an
			<lb />
			element of risk. Even then the licensees cannot wriggle out
			<lb />
			of their contractual obligations. When licensees cannot be
			<lb />
			compelled to share their advantage with the State in a
			<lb />
			converse situation, then they cannot ask the State to share
			<lb />
			their alleged losses due to COVID-19 pandemic:-
			<lb />
			&quot;16. ……………………………….. Even otherwise, having regard to
			<lb />
			the context and the object underlying, there is no warrant for
			<lb />
			holding that the words &quot;may permit&quot; in Rule 8(1) should be
			<lb />
			read as &quot;shall permit&quot;. The fallacy in the contention advanced
			<lb />
			by the licensees can be demonstrated by taking a converse
			<lb />
			case. Suppose in a given year, the production of arrack is
			<lb />
			abundant. The Government has huge stocks of arrack, and
			<lb />
			they are piling up. Can the Government force and compel the
			<lb />
			licensees to lift additional quantities to clear its own stocks?
			<lb />
			Would not the licensees say in such a case that they cannot be

			forced to lift quantities which they are not able to sell? If they
			<lb />
			cannot be so forced, on what parity of reasoning is it claimed
			<lb />
			that even if there are no supplies with the Government, it must
			<lb />
			somehow supply the additional quantities demanded and if it
			<lb />
			cannot so supply, it is not entitled to demand the monies as
			<lb />
			per the contract? All this demonstrates amply that there is no
			<lb />
			right in the licensees to compel the Government to supply what
			<lb />
			all they demand nor has the State the right to compel the
			<lb />
			licensees to purchase all that it proposes to sell to them. We
			<lb />
			see no unreasonableness in this statement. We are of the
			<lb />
			opinion that in the absence of a statutory right in the licensees
			<lb />
			to get additional supplies demanded by him, there is no basis
			<lb />
			in law for the claim of remission or rebate. As stated by this
			<lb />
			Court in Panna Lal v. State of Rajasthan, (1975) 2 SCC 633,
			<lb />
			the onerous nature of the terms is no ground for the licensees
			<lb />
			to resile from the express obligations undertaken by them. The
			<lb />
			Court observed: (SCC p. 638, para 21)
			<lb />
			&quot;The licences in the present case are contracts
			<lb />
			between the parties. The licensees voluntarily accepted
			<lb />
			the contracts. They fully exploited to their advantage the
			<lb />
			contracts to the exclusion of others. The High Court
			<lb />
			rightly said that it was not open to the appellants to
			<lb />
			resile from the contracts on the ground that the terms of
			<lb />
			payment were onerous. The reasons given by the High
			<lb />
			Court were that the licensees accepted the licence by
			<lb />
			excluding their competitors and it would not be open to
			<lb />
			the licensees to challenge the terms either on the ground
			<lb />
			of inconvenient consequence of terms or of harshness of
			<lb />
			terms.&quot;
			<lb />
			23.
			<lb />
			Maybe these are cases where the licensees took a calculated
			<lb />
			risk. Maybe they were not wise in offering their bids. But in
			<lb />
			law there is no basis upon which they can be relieved of the
			<lb />
			obligations undertaken by them under the contract. It is well
			<lb />
			known that in such contracts-which may be called executory
			<lb />
			contracts-there is always an element of risk. Many an
			<lb />
			unexpected development may occur which may either cause
			<lb />
			loss to the contractor or result in large profit. Take the very
			<lb />
			case of arrack contractors. In one year, there may be
			<lb />
			abundance of supplies accompanied by good crops induced by
			<lb />
			favourable weather conditions; the contractor will make
			<lb />
			substantial profits during the year. In another year, the
			<lb />
			conditions may be unfavourable and supplies scarce. He may
			<lb />
			incur loss. Such contracts do not imply a warranty-or a
			<lb />
			guarantee-of profit to the contractor. It is a business for him-
			<lb />
			profit and loss being normal incidents of a business. There is
			<lb />
			no room for invoking the doctrine of unjust enrichment in such
			<lb />
			a situation. The said doctrine has never been invoked in such
			<lb />
			business transactions. The remedy provided by Article 226, or
			<lb />
			that matter, suits, cannot be resorted to wriggle out of the
			<lb />
			contractual obligations entered into by the licensees.&quot;

			Learned Advocate General also contended that
			<lb />
			there is no warrant for invoking the rule of legitimate
			<lb />
			expectation, which the licensees may have entertained and
			<lb />
			referred following para from the above cited judgment:-
			<lb />
			&quot;25. Learned counsel for the respondents also sought to rely upon
			<lb />
			the rule of legitimate expectation which the licensees
			<lb />
			entertained in view of the practice during previous years.
			<lb />
			Firstly, the rule cannot be invoked to modify or vary the
			<lb />
			express terms of the contract, more so when they are statutory
			<lb />
			in nature. No decision has been brought to our notice
			<lb />
			supporting the said proposition. Secondly, in view of the
			<lb />
			scarcity that had developed during the last two months of the
			<lb />
			previous excise year (i.e., during February and March, 1981),
			<lb />
			the plea of legitimate expectation sounds quite weak. That the
			<lb />
			bidders were apprehensive and highly sceptical of alleged
			<lb />
			official assurances is proved by the repeated adjournment of
			<lb />
			auction and the fact pleaded by the licensees themselves that
			<lb />
			during the said excise year (1981-82) half the shops in the
			<lb />
			State remained unsold. It is inconceivable that the licensees
			<lb />
			yet expected legitimately that additional supplies equal to the
			<lb />
			previous year&apos;s additional supplies would be supplied during
			<lb />
			this year. The plea is unacceptable.&quot;
			<lb />
			Regarding
			<lb />
			Doctrine
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			fairness
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			reasonableness, relying upon the following para of the
			<lb />
			judgment in Issac Peter&apos;s case, supra, learned Advocate
			<lb />
			General contended that the doctrine of fairness is developed
			<lb />
			in the administrative law field to ensure the rule of law and
			<lb />
			to prevent failure of justice where the action is
			<lb />
			administrative in nature. It cannot be invoked to amend,
			<lb />
			alter or vary the express terms of contract executed
			<lb />
			between the parties. Para 26 of the judgment reads as
			<lb />
			under:-
			<lb />

		<body>
			&quot;26. Learned counsel for respondents then submitted that doctrine
			<lb />
			of fairness and reasonableness must be read into contracts to
			<lb />
			which State is a party. It is submitted that the State cannot act
			<lb />
			unreasonably or unfairly even while acting under a contract
			<lb />
			involving State power. Now, let us see, what is the purpose for
			<lb />
			which this argument is addressed and what is the
			<lb />
			implication? The purpose, as we can see, is that though the
			<lb />
			contract says that supply of additional quota is discretionary,
			<lb />
			it must be read as obligatory-at least to the extent of previous
			<lb />
			year&apos;s supplies-by applying the said doctrine. It is submitted
			<lb />
			that if this is not done, the licensees would suffer monetarily.
			<lb />
			The other purpose is to say that if the State is not able to so
			<lb />
			supply, it would be unreasonable on its part to demand the
			<lb />
			full amount due to it under the contract. In short, the duty to
			<lb />
			act fairly is sought to be imported into the contract to modify
			<lb />
			and alter its terms and to create an obligation upon the State
			<lb />
			which is not there in the contract. We must confess, we are not
			<lb />
			aware of any such doctrine of fairness or reasonableness. Nor
			<lb />
			could the learned counsel bring to our notice any decision
			<lb />
			laying down such a proposition. Doctrine of fairness or the
			<lb />
			duty to act fairly and reasonably is a doctrine developed in the
			<lb />
			administrative law field to ensure the rule of law and to
			<lb />
			prevent failure of justice where the action is administrative in
			<lb />
			nature. Just as principles of natural justice ensure fair
			<lb />
			decision where the function is quasi-judicial, the doctrine of
			<lb />
			fairness is evolved to ensure fair action where the function is
			<lb />
			administrative. But it can certainly not be invoked to amend,
			<lb />
			alter or vary the express terms of the contract between the
			<lb />
			parties. This is so, even if the contract is governed by statutory
			<lb />
			provisions, i.e., where it is a statutory contract-or rather more
			<lb />
			so. It is one thing to say that a contract-every contract-must
			<lb />
			be construed reasonably having regard to its language. But
			<lb />
			this is not what the licensees say. They seek to create an
			<lb />
			obligation on the other party to the contract, just because it
			<lb />
			happens to be the State. They are not prepared to apply the
			<lb />
			very same rule in converse case, i.e., where the State has
			<lb />
			abundant supplies and wants the licensees to lift all the
			<lb />
			stocks. The licensees will undertake no obligation to lift all
			<lb />
			those stocks even if the State suffers loss. This one-sided
			<lb />
			obligation, in modification of express terms of the contract, in
			<lb />
			the name of duty to act fairly, is what we are unable to
			<lb />
			appreciate. The decisions cited by the learned counsel for the
			<lb />
			licensees do not support their proposition. In Dwarkadas
			<lb />
			Marfatia v. Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay it was
			<lb />
			held that where a public authority is exempted from the
			<lb />
			operation of a statute like Rent Control Act, it must be
			<lb />
			presumed that such exemption from the statute is coupled
			<lb />
			with the duty to act fairly and reasonably. The decision does
			<lb />
			not say that the terms and conditions of contract can be
			<lb />
			varied, added or altered by importing the said doctrine. It may

			be noted that though the said principle was affirmed, no relief
			<lb />
			was given to the appellant in that case. Shrilekha Vidyarthi v.
			<lb />
			State of U.P. was a case of mass termination of District
			<lb />
			Government Counsel in the State of U.P. It was a case of
			<lb />
			termination from a post involving public element. It was a case
			<lb />
			of non-government servant holding a public office, on account
			<lb />
			of which it was held to be a matter within the public law field.
			<lb />
			This decision too does not affirm the principle now canvassed
			<lb />
			by the learned counsel. We are, therefore, of the opinion that
			<lb />
			in case of contracts freely entered into with the State, like the
			<lb />
			present ones, there is no room for invoking the doctrine of
			<lb />
			fairness and reasonableness against one party to the contract
			<lb />
			(State), for the purpose of altering or adding to the terms and
			<lb />
			conditions of the contract, merely because it happens to be the
			<lb />
			State. In such cases, the mutual rights and liabilities of the
			<lb />
			parties are governed by the terms of the contracts (which may
			<lb />
			be statutory in some cases) and the laws relating to contracts.
			<lb />
			It must be remembered that these contracts are entered into
			<lb />
			pursuant to public auction, floating of tenders or by
			<lb />
			negotiation. There is no compulsion on anyone to enter into
			<lb />
			these contracts. It is voluntary on both sides. There can be no
			<lb />
			question of the State power being involved in such contracts. It
			<lb />
			bears repetition to say that the State does not guarantee profit
			<lb />
			to the licensees in such contracts. There is no warranty
			<lb />
			against incurring losses. It is a business for the licensees.
			<lb />
			Whether they make profit or incur loss is no concern of the
			<lb />
			State. In law, it is entitled to its money under the contract. It is
			<lb />
			not as if the licensees are going to pay more to the State in
			<lb />
			case they make substantial profits. We reiterate that what we
			<lb />
			have said hereinabove is in the context of contracts entered
			<lb />
			into between the State and its citizens pursuant to public
			<lb />
			auction, floating of tenders or by negotiation. It is not
			<lb />
			necessary to say more than this for the purpose of these
			<lb />
			cases. What would be the position in the case of contracts
			<lb />
			entered into otherwise than by public auction, floating of
			<lb />
			tenders or negotiation, we need not express any opinion
			<lb />
			herein.&quot;

			bidder in an auction governed by the Kerala Abkari Shops
			<lb />
			(Disposal in Auction) Rules, 1974, conducted for sale of
			<lb />
			privilege to vend arrack in Kalady Range for a period of one
			<lb />
			year. She deposited 30% of the bid amount and executed a
			<lb />
			temporary agreement in terms of the rules. However, in
			<lb />
			view of physical resistance from general public against the
			<lb />
			opening of Abkari shops in the birth place of Adi
			<lb />
			Shankaracharya, the law enforcing agencies could not
			<lb />
			ensure smooth conduct of appellant&apos;s business. Hence, the
			<lb />
			appellant requested the authorities not to confirm the sale
			<lb />
			citing impossibility to execute the privilege for the reasons
			<lb />
			beyond her control. She requested for rescinding the
			<lb />
			proposed contract and for refunding the security amount.
			<lb />
			The question before the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court was as to
			<lb />
			whether the appellant could invoke the doctrine of
			<lb />
			frustration or whether she would be bound by the terms of
			<lb />
			the statutory contract. It was held as under by the Hon&apos;ble
			<lb />
			Supreme Court vide paras 16 to 18 of the judgment:-
			<lb />
			&quot;16. It is not the case of the State that appellant has purposely, or
			<lb />
			for any oblique motive, or as a device to avoid any loss,
			<lb />
			refused to execute the agreement. It appears to us that the
			<lb />
			State was helpless because of the public upsurge against the
			<lb />
			sale of arrack at Kaladi, the birth place of Adi
			<lb />
			Shankaracharya as, in their opinion, the same will render the
			<lb />
			soil unholy. Consequently, the State also found it impossible
			<lb />
			to resell or redispose of the arrack shops.

			reason of some event which the promissory could not prevent
			<lb />
			becomes impossible, is rendered void. Hence, the forfeiture of
			<lb />
			the security amount may be illegal. But what would be the
			<lb />
			position in a case in which the consequence for non-
			<lb />
			performance of contract is provided in the statutory contract
			<lb />
			itself? The case in hand is one of such cases.
			<lb />
			18. The doctrine of frustration excludes ordinarily further
			<lb />
			performance where the contract is silent as to the position of
			<lb />
			the parties in the event of performance becoming literally
			<lb />
			impossible. However, in our opinion, a statutory contract in
			<lb />
			which party takes absolute responsibility cannot escape
			<lb />
			liability whatever may be the reason. In such a situation,
			<lb />
			events will not discharge the party from the consequence of
			<lb />
			non-performance of a contractual obligation. Further, in a
			<lb />
			case in which the consequences of non-performance of
			<lb />
			contract is provided in the statutory contract itself, the parties
			<lb />
			shall be bound by that and cannot take shelter
			<lb />
			behind Section 56 of the Contract Act. Rule 5(15) in no
			<lb />
			uncertain terms provides that &quot;on the failure of the auction
			<lb />
			purchaser to make such deposit referred to in sub-rule 10&quot; or
			<lb />
			&quot;execute such agreement temporary or permanent&quot; &quot;the
			<lb />
			deposit already made by him towards earnest money and
			<lb />
			security shall be forfeited to Government&quot;. When we apply the
			<lb />
			aforesaid principle we find that the appellant had not carried
			<lb />
			out several obligations as provided in sub-rule (10) of Rule 5
			<lb />
			and consequently, by reason of sub-rule (15), the State was
			<lb />
			entitled to forfeit the security money.&quot;
			<lb />
			Relying upon Issac Peter&apos;s case, it was held that
			<lb />
			the doctrine of reasonableness or fairness cannot be
			<lb />
			invoked to amend, alter or vary express terms of the
			<lb />
			contract. A contract of employment cannot be equated with
			<lb />
			a contract to vend arrack. The appellant was not relieved of
			<lb />
			her obligations under the contract. (1996) 5 SCC 740,
			<lb />
			State of Orissa and others Vs. Narain Prasad and
			<lb />
			others, was also pressed in service in support of contention

			the contractual terms by invoking extraordinary jurisdiction
			<lb />
			of High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
			<lb />
			The gist of submissions advanced by the learned
			<lb />
			Advocate General is that Excise Announcements are policy
			<lb />
			decisions. Writ petitions questioning the policy decisions
			<lb />
			are not maintainable. By way of grant of license to run the
			<lb />
			liquor business, governed by H.P. Excise Act, 2011 and
			<lb />
			Rules framed thereunder, State has parted its privilege.
			<lb />
			Relationship between the parties is statutory in nature. The
			<lb />
			petitioners have entered into statutory/excise contracts
			<lb />
			with the respondents and they cannot be permitted to back
			<lb />
			out from the same. Order dated 31.08.2020, deciding the
			<lb />
			representations of the petitioners, was passed on the
			<lb />
			directions of the Court, whereunder by way of policy
			<lb />
			decision, certain benefits by reducing the MGQ have been
			<lb />
			provided to the excise licensees. The genuine grievances of
			<lb />
			the petitioners and other licensees have already been taken
			<lb />
			care of by granting them many concessions under various
			<lb />
			orders passed from time to time including the order dated
			<lb />
			31.08.2020. He, therefore, prayed for dismissal of the writ
			<lb />
			petitions.

			<lb />
			Observations:-
			<lb />
			Following
			<lb />
			two
			<lb />
			main
			<lb />
			points
			<lb />
			arise
			<lb />
			for
			<lb />
			consideration:-
			<lb />
			A. Whether the excise contracts executed between
			<lb />
			the parties, in the peculiar facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the case, are to be considered
			<lb />
			as concluded contracts admitting no change
			<lb />
			whatsoever. And whether writ petitions, in
			<lb />
			essence seeking reduction of MGQ fixed in
			<lb />
			Excise Announcements for the year 2020-21,
			<lb />
			are maintainable or not.
			<lb />
			B. Whether order dated 31.08.2020 is open to
			<lb />
			challenge and whether it adequately redresses
			<lb />
			the grievances projected by the petitioners and
			<lb />
			whether the grievances raised by the petitioners
			<lb />
			are genuine or not.
			<lb />
			5(i).
			<lb />
			Excise Policy for the year 2020-21 was
			<lb />
			announced in February, 2020. It was formulated
			<lb />
			considering continuance of prevailing normal situation.
			<lb />
			Petitioner, who was already holding Retail Excise License
			<lb />
			L-2 and L-14 for 2019-20 in District Kullu, applied for
			<lb />
			renewal of license on 13.03.2020. COVID-19 had already
			<lb />
			erupted, declared as pandemic by World Health
			<lb />
			Organization on 11.03.2020 and had started spreading
			<lb />
			world-wide by this time, though extent of its proliferation,
			<lb />
			its continuity, duration of its life cycle, its affect on all
			<lb />
			social activities, on public life, on normal life, on economy
			<lb />
			was perhaps not fathomed by ordinary mortal at that time.

			A time came when due to its devastating impact on every
			<lb />
			walk of life, practically all activities ceased. Liquor vends
			<lb />
			also remained completely shut from 22.03.2020 to
			<lb />
			03.05.2020. From 04.05.2020 to 18.05.2020, the liquor
			<lb />
			vends were allowed to open with restrictive sale hours from
			<lb />
			10:00 am to 3:00 pm. With effect from 19.05.2020 to
			<lb />
			30.05.2020, the operational hours of liquor vends were 9:00
			<lb />
			am to 5:00 pm. From 01.06.2020, relaxation was given to
			<lb />
			keep the vends open till 8:00 pm. However, all this time,
			<lb />
			apart from lockdown, curfew also remained imposed in the
			<lb />
			State. Complete cessation of normal life activities for long
			<lb />
			duration followed by restrictive functioning adversely
			<lb />
			impacted sale of liquor vends. It is only recently that
			<lb />
			despite COVID-19 still looming large out there without any
			<lb />
			approved and recognized vaccine, various long imposed
			<lb />
			restrictions on social activities/gatherings are being
			<lb />
			gradually lifted in different phases of lockdown.
			<lb />
			5(ii).
			<lb />
			The impact of emerging COVID-19 crisis on sale
			<lb />
			of liquor vends, their inability to lift MGQ fixed in Excise
			<lb />
			Policy 2020-21 formulated during normalcy and to pay
			<lb />
			correspondingly fixed license fee was realized by the

			respondent-Excise &amp; Taxation Department. It is for this

			reason that the Excise Policy 2019-20, which as per the
			<lb />
			executed contract would have otherwise ended on
			<lb />
			31.03.2020, was extended by the State till 31.05.2020.
			<lb />
			State unilaterally altered the terms of the contract. License
			<lb />
			fees for the months of April and May, 2020 were ordered to
			<lb />
			be levied on pro-rata basis as per MGQ determined for the
			<lb />
			year 2019-20. MGQ for these two months was ordered to be
			<lb />
			calculated on actual lifting. State thus unilaterally changed
			<lb />
			the terms of contract executed by it with the licensees.
			<lb />
			Financial year for the purpose of Excise Policy 2020-21 was
			<lb />
			changed by the State from 01.04.2020-31.03.2021 to
			<lb />
			01.06.2020-31.05.2021. This again was a unilateral change
			<lb />
			of contractual terms by the State. Excise Units which had
			<lb />
			not been renewed for the year 2020-21 were allowed to
			<lb />
			exercise option for operating the units till 31.05.2020.
			<lb />
			These units were to be put to allotment for the year
			<lb />
			2020-21 before 31.05.2020. State altered the conditions of
			<lb />
			contract. Visualizing that business carried out by the liquor
			<lb />
			vends would be virtually dismal as compared to the MGQ
			<lb />
			fixed in the Excise Announcements for the year 2019-20,
			<lb />
			operation of which was extended till 31.05.2020, the State
			<lb />
			ordered that there shall be no MGQ of country liquor and

			IMFS for the months of April and May, 2020. The license fee
			<lb />
			during these two months was ordered to be deposited by
			<lb />
			the retailers on actual lifting of liquor. This again conveys
			<lb />
			that the contract executed by the State with the licensees
			<lb />
			was not treated by it as concluded. The State had been
			<lb />
			altering the terms &amp; conditions of the contract to meet out
			<lb />
			the exigencies from time to time. Therefore, the argument
			<lb />
			advanced on behalf of the State that the petitioner having
			<lb />
			executed an excise contract, which is sacrosanct, concluded
			<lb />
			forever, permitting no alteration whatsoever, cannot be
			<lb />
			accepted. Documents on record of the case demonstrate
			<lb />
			that the State had been varying the contractual terms &amp;
			<lb />
			conditions/excise policy on its own from time to time taking
			<lb />
			stock of the situation emerging due to COVID-19 crisis. The
			<lb />
			judgments relied on behalf of the respondent-State with
			<lb />
			respect to the concluded contract and policy decisions,
			<lb />
			therefore, will not be applicable to the fact situation of the
			<lb />
			present case, where in an unprecedented scenario
			<lb />
			witnessed by the nation, the respondent-State was itself
			<lb />
			compelled to keep on varying the terms of contract executed
			<lb />
			with the retail excise licensees.

			5(iii).
			<lb />
			The next related facet which arises for
			<lb />
			consideration at this stage is whether the decisions taken/
			<lb />
			the orders passed by the State are sufficient, do they meet
			<lb />
			the situation and redress the grievances projected by the
			<lb />
			petitioners/retail licensees, whether grievances of the
			<lb />
			petitioners are genuine.
			<lb />
			Excise Policy 2020-21 was formulated while
			<lb />
			normal conditions prevailed. District-wise Minimum
			<lb />
			Guaranteed Quota of liquor was allocated in the policy and
			<lb />
			license fee on various kinds of liquor was fixed. Clause 5.3
			<lb />
			of Chapter V of policy required a licensee to lift 100% of
			<lb />
			MGQ for the allotted vends. Respondents are empowered
			<lb />
			under the policy to take coercive actions for non-
			<lb />
			compliance of conditions. Some of the relevant clauses of
			<lb />
			the policy are:-
			<lb />
			&quot;2.35 The license fee shall be divided into twelve instalment as per
			<lb />
			condition No.5.3, into so that the entire license fee is cleared by
			<lb />
			15 th February of the financial year. The license fee payable for
			<lb />
			a particular month shall be deposited into the government
			<lb />
			treasury by the 15 th day of the subsequent month failing which
			<lb />
			the vends of the unit shall be sealed on 16 th day and no further
			<lb />
			time shall be given to the defaulter to deposit the dues, the
			<lb />
			license shall be cancelled the same day and the unit shall be
			<lb />
			put up for re-allotment. Any advance amounts or instalments
			<lb />
			deposited by the defaulting licensee shall be forfeited. The 50
			<lb />
			percent of 8 percent advance fixed license fee payment shall be
			<lb />
			adjusted each in the month of April and May, 2020.
			<lb />
			3.26 The MGQ allotted to a unit shall further be divided into twelve
			<lb />
			parts as per the condition No.5.3 to be lifted compulsorily on
			<lb />
			monthly basis on the payment of the License Fee there on.
			<lb />
			However, if the licensee fails to lift the minimum guaranteed
			<lb />
			quota for the month, he shall be required to deposit the license

			fee for the said month and if he fails to lift the prescribed quota
			<lb />
			he shall be liable for action as per condition No.5.3 of this

			<lb />
			The licensee shall be required to lift 100% of the Minimum

			day of the concerned quarter. If during a quarter, lifting fall
			<lb />
			short of 80 percent of the MGQ in respect of the vends/units
			<lb />
			allotted to him, he shall be liable to pay penalty @ Rs.370 per
			<lb />
			proof liter on IMFS and Rs.320 per proof liter on Country Liquor
			<lb />
			on such unlifted quota falling short of 80%. The concerned

			end of the quarter and for the 4 th quarter by 10 th of March.&quot;

			Liquor vends are located in tourist as well as in
			<lb />
			non-tourist areas of the respondent-State. Writ Petition

			Nos.1967, 1961 and 1969 of 2020 were instituted on

			<lb />
			petitions are located in District Kullu. It was not till
			<lb />
			October, 2020 that the State allowed resumption of some

			retail excise licensees, there was no respite for the excise
			<lb />
			year 2020-21. The time period of excise year 2020-21
			<lb />
			remains the same despite its extension by two months. The
			<lb />
			retail licensees of the year 2019-20 were allowed to operate
			<lb />
			the vends during April and May, 2020, but the fact remains
			<lb />
			that for the most part of these two months, the liquor vends
			<lb />
			either remained closed or carried out very dismal business.
			<lb />
			It is not even the case of the respondent-State that
			<lb />
			immediately on commencement of excise year 2020-21,
			<lb />
			normalcy had returned or the retail liquor sale figures had
			<lb />
			jumped. Even the impugned order dated 31.08.2020
			<lb />
			acknowledges this fact. Following figures in respect of lifting
			<lb />
			of liquor reflect the tale of liquor vends&apos; business in the
			<lb />
			State of Himachal Pradesh and we focus on District Kullu
			<lb />
			as an example:-

			2020, the lifting of Country Liquor and IMFS in District
			<lb />
			Kullu was short by 66% and 71%, respectively, whereas for
			<lb />
			the month of July, 2020, it was short by 74% and 82%,
			<lb />
			respectively, when compared to data of same period of
			<lb />
			excise year 2019-20.
			<lb />
			Since the liquor sale had been low, therefore,
			<lb />
			the Government of Himachal Pradesh in the order dated
			<lb />
			31.08.2020 decided to reduce MGQ of country liquor and
			<lb />
			IMFL for first three months of excise year 2020-21, i.e.
			<lb />
			June, July and August, 2020, by 5% and 10%, respectively,
			<lb />
			for all L-2 and L-14 licenses. The reduction in MGQ gives
			<lb />
			credence to the grievances of the petitioners regarding loss
			<lb />
			of their business or else these decisions would not have
			<lb />
			been taken. Reduction of MGQ by 5% and 10% also adds to
			<lb />
			the argument that in the given unprecedented scenario
			<lb />
			emerging from COVID-19, the terms &amp; conditions of the
			<lb />
			excise contract executed between the parties were not
			<lb />
			treated as concluded by the State.
			<lb />
			5(iv).
			<lb />
			The above leads to next aspect as to whether
			<lb />
			reduction by 5% and 10% in the MGQ for all L-2 and L-14
			<lb />
			licenses during June, July and August, 2020 as allowed in
			<lb />
			order dated 31.08.2020 meets the ends of justice or not.

			Learned Advocate General would contend that
			<lb />
			considering overall position, excise licensees have already
			<lb />
			been provided various reliefs including the following major
			<lb />
			respites, therefore, no other concession needs to be granted
			<lb />
			to them:-
			<lb />
			(a).
			<lb />
			Petitioners/Retail Excise Licensees for 2019-20
			<lb />
			were allowed to run the vends during April and May, 2020
			<lb />
			by extending Excise Policy 2019-20 to 31.05.2020. License
			<lb />
			fee during these months was levied only on pro-rata basis.
			<lb />
			But the fact remains that for most of the period
			<lb />
			during these two months, either no business was
			<lb />
			transacted by liquor vends or it remained on very low side.
			<lb />
			Also no additional quota during extended Excise Policy
			<lb />
			2019-20 was allowed to be lifted by the licensee.
			<lb />
			(b).
			<lb />
			Excise Policy 2020-21 has already been
			<lb />
			extended till 31.05.2021. Therefore, loss of revenue
			<lb />
			especially in tourist destinations like Shimla, Kullu and
			<lb />
			Dharamshala will be compensated during next tourist
			<lb />
			season, which starts in April/May.
			<lb />
			What future holds cannot be guessed at this
			<lb />
			stage. Fact alive today is that pandemic still predominates
			<lb />
			everything without any known cure or solution. In any case,

			time period of excise year 2020-21 does not get enlarged by
			<lb />
			extension of Excise Policy 2020-21. The period remains the
			<lb />
			same.
			<lb />
			(c).
			<lb />
			Order dated 31.08.2020 has reduced MGQ by
			<lb />
			5% and 10% for all L-2 and L-14 licensees for the months of
			<lb />
			June-August, 2020. The figures reproduced above are an
			<lb />
			indication that liquor business especially in tourist areas
			<lb />
			like Kullu has suffered a lot. In the impugned order dated
			<lb />
			31.08.2020, respondent-State has acknowledged loss of
			<lb />
			business in tourist destinations in following words:-&quot;Loss
			<lb />
			of revenue especially in tourist destinations like Shimla,
			<lb />
			Kullu &amp; Dharamshala will be compensated during the next
			<lb />
			tourist season which starts in the month of April &amp; May as
			<lb />
			due to extension of excise year the benefit of April &amp; May will
			<lb />
			accrue to licensees.&quot; The petitioners on account of easing of
			<lb />
			restrictions and recent commencement of tourism related
			<lb />
			activities have expressed willingness to pay license fees for
			<lb />
			the months of October, 2020 onwards as per MGQ fixed in
			<lb />
			Excise Announcements 2020-21. For the months of June,
			<lb />
			July, August and September, 2020, prayer has been made
			<lb />
			to reduce MGQ fixed in Excise Policy, 2020-21 by 25 to

			30% or to levy license fees on pro-rata basis on actual
			<lb />
			lifting of liquor.
			<lb />
			From time to time, respondent-State has been
			<lb />
			altering the conditions of excise contracts executed with
			<lb />
			retail excise licensees due to situations emerging from
			<lb />
			COVID-19 crisis. For Bar Licensees, the license fee and
			<lb />
			MGQ for the entire year 2020-21 has been permitted to be
			<lb />
			calculated and levied on pro-rata basis. The same
			<lb />
			treatment, however, has not been given to the retail
			<lb />
			licensees. In the excise policy, MGQ is fixed district-wise.
			<lb />
			Under the impugned order dated 31.08.2020, MGQ of retail
			<lb />
			licensees has been reduced by 5% and 10% uniformally for
			<lb />
			all L-2 and L-14 licensees of the State respectively, for the
			<lb />
			months of June, July and August, 2020. On what basis,
			<lb />
			this reduction and that too at uniform basis has been
			<lb />
			arrived at in the impugned order is not forthcoming. The
			<lb />
			order itself alongwith its annexures reflect that lifting of
			<lb />
			liquor in District Kullu has remained as low as -74%
			<lb />
			(Country Liquor) and -82% (IMFL) during June and July,
			<lb />
			2020, which is the lowest as compared to lifting in the other
			<lb />
			districts. No data is available to justify the reduction of
