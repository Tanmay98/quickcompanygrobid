A copy of the <lb/>1994 Licenses, along with a table setting out the pre-<lb/>determined Licence Fee as prescribed by DoT in the <lb/>Tender, is annexed hereto as Annexure I (Colly). <lb/>WHEREAS in December 1995, 34 CMTS Licenses <lb/>were granted based onauction for 18 <lb/>telecommunication circles for a period of 10 years (the <lb/>&quot;1995 Licenses&quot;). The 1995 Licenses mentioned that <lb/>a cumulative maximum of up to 4.4 MHz in the 900 MHz <lb/>bands shall be permitted to the licensees, based on <lb/>appropriate justification. There was no separate upfront <lb/>charge for allocation of spectrum to the licensees who <lb/>were also required to pay annual spectrum usage <lb/>charges, which under the terms of the license bore the <lb/>nomenclature &quot;licence fee and royalty&quot; which will be <lb/>subject to revision from time to time. A copy of the <lb/>1995 Licenses, along with a table setting out the fees <lb/>payable by the highest bidder, is annexed hereto as <lb/>Annexure II (Colly). <lb/>WHEREAS in 1995, bids were also invited for basic <lb/>telephone service licenses (&quot;BTS Licenses&quot;) with the <lb/>license fee payable for a 15 year period. Under the <lb/>terms of the BTS Licenses, a licensee could provide <lb/>fixed line basic telephone services as well as wireless <lb/>basic telephone services. Six licenses were granted in <lb/>the year 1997-98 by way of auction through tender for <lb/>providing basic telecom services (the &quot;1997 BTS <lb/>Licenses&quot;). The license terms, inter-alia, provided that <lb/>based on the availability of the equipment for Wireless <lb/>in Local Loop (WLL), in the world market, the spectrum <lb/>in bands specified therein would be considered for <lb/>allocation subject to the conditions mentioned therein. <lb/>There was no separate upfront charge for allocation of <lb/>spectrum and the licensees offering the basic wireless <lb/>telephone service were required to pay annual <lb/>Spectrum usage charges, which under the terms of the <lb/>license bore the nomenclature &quot;licence fee and royalty&quot;. <lb/></body>

			<body>A sample copy of the 1997 BTS Licenses containing the <lb/>table setting out the license fees paid by the highest <lb/>bidder is annexed hereto as Annexure III (Colly). <lb/>WHEREAS in 1997, the Telecom Regulatory <lb/>Authority of India Act, 1997 was enacted and the <lb/>Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (the &quot;TRAI&quot;) was <lb/>established. <lb/>WHEREAS on 1 st April, 1999, the New Telecom <lb/>Policy 1999 (&quot;NTP 1999&quot;) was brought into effect on <lb/>the recommendation of a Group on Telecom (&quot;GoT&quot;) <lb/>which had been constituted by GoI. A copy of NTP 1999 <lb/>is annexed hereto as Annexure IV. NTP 1999 provided <lb/>that Cellular Mobile Service Providers (&quot;CMSP&quot;) would <lb/>be granted a license for a period of 20 years on the <lb/>payment of a one-time entry fee and licence fee in the <lb/>form of revenue share. NTP 1999 also provided that <lb/>BTS (Fixed Service Provider or FSP) Licenses for <lb/>providing both fixed and wireless (WLL) services would <lb/>also be issued for a period of 20 years on payment of a <lb/>one-time entry fee and licence fee in the form of <lb/>revenue share and prescribed charges for spectrum <lb/>usage, appropriate level of which was to be <lb/>recommended by TRAI. The licensees both cellular and <lb/>basic were also required to pay annual Spectrum usage <lb/>charges. <lb/>WHEREAS based on NTP 1999, a migration package <lb/>for migration from fixed license fee to one time entry <lb/>fee and licence fee based on revenue share regime was <lb/>offered to all the existing licenses on 22 nd July, 1999. <lb/>This came into effect on 1 st August 1999. Under the <lb/>migration package, the licence period for all the CMTS <lb/>and FSP licensees was extended to 20 years from the <lb/>date of issuance of the Licenses. <lb/>WHEREAS in 1997 and 2000, CMTS Licenses were <lb/>also granted in 2 and 21 Circles to Mahanagar <lb/>Telephone Nigam Limited (&quot;MTNL&quot;) and Bharat Sanchar <lb/>Nigam Limited (&quot;BSNL&quot;) respectively (the &quot;PSU <lb/>Licenses&quot;). However, no entry fee was charged for the <lb/>PSU Licenses. The CMTS Licenses issued to BSNL and <lb/></body>

			<body>MTNL mentioned that they would be granted GSM <lb/>Spectrum of 4.4 + 4.4 MHz in the 900 MHz band. The <lb/>PSU Licensees were also required to pay annual <lb/>spectrum usage charges. A copy of the PSU Licenses is <lb/>annexed hereto as Annexure V (Colly). <lb/>WHEREAS in January 2001, based on TRAI&apos;s <lb/>recommendation, DoT issued guidelines for issuing <lb/>CMTS Licenses for the 4 th Cellular Operator based on <lb/>tendering process structured as &quot;Multistage Informed <lb/>Ascending Bidding Process&quot;. Based on a tender, 17 new <lb/>CMTS Licenses were issued for a period of 20 years in <lb/>the 4 Metro cities and 13 Telecom Circles (the &quot;2001 <lb/>Cellular Licenses&quot;). The 2001 Licenses required that <lb/>the licensees pay a one-time non refundable entry fee <lb/>as determined through auction as above and also <lb/>annual license fee and annual spectrum usage charges <lb/>and there was no separate upfront charge for allocation <lb/>of spectrum. In accordance with the terms of tender <lb/>document, the license terms, inter-alia, provided that a <lb/>cumulative maximum of upto 4.4 MHz + 4.4 MHz will be <lb/>permitted and further based on usage, justification and <lb/>availability, additional spectrum upto 1.8 MHz + 1.8 MHz <lb/>making a total of 6.2 MHz + 6.2 MHz, may be <lb/>considered for assignment, on case by case basis, on <lb/>payment of additional Licence fee. The bandwidth upto <lb/>maximum as indicated i.e. 4.4 MHz &amp; 6.2 MHz as the <lb/>case may be, will be allocated based on the Technology <lb/>requirements (e.g. CDMA @ 1.25 MHz, GSM @ 200 KHz <lb/>etc.). The frequencies assigned may not be contiguous <lb/>and may not be same in all cases, while efforts would be <lb/>made to make available larger chunks to the extent <lb/>feasible. A copy of the 2001 Cellular Licenses, along <lb/>with a table setting out the fees payable by the highest <lb/>bidder, is annexed hereto as Annexure VI. <lb/>WHEREAS in 2001, BTS Licenses were also issued <lb/>for providing both fixed line and wireless basic <lb/>telephone services on a continual basis (2001 Basic <lb/>Telephone Licenses). Service area wise one time Entry <lb/>Fee and annual license fee as a percentage of Adjusted <lb/>Gross Revenue (AGR) was prescribed for grant of BTS <lb/>Licenses. The licence terms, inter-alia, provided that for <lb/></body>

			<body>Wireless Access System in local area, not more than 5 + <lb/>5 MHz in 824-844 MHz paired with 869-889 MHz band <lb/>shall be allocated to any basic service operator <lb/>including existing ones on FCFS basis. A detailed <lb/>procedure for allocation of spectrum on FCFS basis was <lb/>given in Annexure-IX of the 2001 BTS license. There <lb/>was no separate upfront charge for allocation of <lb/>spectrum and the Licensees were required to pay <lb/>revenue share of 2% of the AGR earned from wireless in <lb/>local loop subscribers as spectrum charges in addition <lb/>to the one time entry fee and annual license fee. A <lb/>sample copy of the 2001 Basic Telephone License along <lb/>with a table setting out the entry fees is annexed hereto <lb/>as Annexure VII. <lb/>WHEREAS on 27 th October, 2003, TRAI <lb/>recommended a Unified Access Services Licence <lb/>(&quot;UASL&quot;) Regime. A copy of TRAI&apos;s recommendation is <lb/>annexed hereto as Annexure VIII. <lb/>WHEREAS on 11.11.2003, Guidelines were issued, <lb/>specifying procedure for migration of existing operators <lb/>to the new UASL regime. As per the Guidelines, all <lb/>applications for new Access Services License shall be in <lb/>the category of Unified Access Services Licence. Later, <lb/>based on TRAI clarification dated 14.11.2003, the entry <lb/>fee for new Unified Licensee was fixed same as the <lb/>entry fee of the 4 th cellular operator. Based on further <lb/>recommendations of TRAI dated 19.11.2003, spectrum <lb/>to the new licensees was to be given as per the existing <lb/>terms and conditions relating to spectrum in the <lb/>respective license agreements. A copy of the Guidelines <lb/>dated 11.11.2003 is annexed hereto as Annexure IX. <lb/>WHEREAS consequent to enhancement of FDI limit <lb/>in telecom sector from 49% to 74%, revised Guidelines <lb/>for grant of UAS Licenses were issued on 14.12.2005. <lb/>These Guidelines, inter-alia stipulate that Licenses shall <lb/>be issued without any restriction on the number of <lb/>entrants for provision of Unified Access Services in a <lb/>Service Area and the applicant will be required to pay <lb/>one time non-refundable Entry, annual License fee as a <lb/>percentage of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) and <lb/></body>

			<body>spectrum charges on revenue share basis. No separate <lb/>upfront charge for allocation of spectrum was <lb/>prescribed. Initial Spectrum was allotted as per UAS <lb/>License conditions to the service providers in different <lb/>frequency bands, subject to availability. <lb/>Initially <lb/>allocation of a cumulative maximum up to 4.4 MHz + <lb/>4.4 MHz for TDMA based systems or 2.5 MHz + 2.5 MHz <lb/>for CDMA based systems subject to availability was to <lb/>be made. Spectrum not more than 5 MHz + 5 MHz in <lb/>respect of CDMA system or 6.2 MHz + 6.2 MHz in <lb/>respect of TDMA based system was to be allocated to <lb/>any new UAS licensee. A copy of the UASL Guidelines <lb/>dated 14.12.2005 is annexed hereto as Annexure X. <lb/>WHEREAS after the introduction of the UASL in 2003 <lb/>and until March 2007, 51 new UASL Licenses were <lb/>issued based on policy of First Come-First Served, on <lb/>payment of the same entry fee as was paid for the 2001 <lb/>Cellular Licenses (the &quot;2003-2007 Licenses&quot;) and the <lb/>spectrum was also allocated based on FCFS under a <lb/>separate wireless operating license on case by case <lb/>basis and subject to availability. Licensees had to pay <lb/>annual spectrum usage charges as a percentage of <lb/>AGR, there being a no upfront charge for allocation of <lb/>spectrum. A copy of the 2003-2007 License, along with <lb/>a table setting out the fees payable, is annexed hereto <lb/>as Annexure XI (Colly). <lb/>WHEREAS on 28 th August 2007, TRAI revisited the <lb/>issue of new licenses, allocation of Spectrum, Spectrum <lb/>charges, entry fees and issued its recommendations, a <lb/>copy of which is annexed hereto as Annexure XII. TRAI <lb/>made further recommendations dated 16.07.2008 which <lb/>is annexed hereto as Annexure XIII. <lb/>WHEREAS in 2007 and 2008, GoI issued Dual <lb/>Technology Licences, where under the terms of the <lb/>existing licenses were amended to allow licensees to <lb/>hold a license as well as Spectrum for providing services <lb/>through both GSM and CDMA network. <lb/>First amendment was issued in December, 2007. All <lb/>licensees who opted for Dual Technology Licences paid <lb/>the same entry fee, which was an amount equal to the <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 6<lb/></note>

			<page> 7 <lb/></page>

			<body>amount prescribed as entry fee for getting a new UAS <lb/>licence in the same service area. The amendment to <lb/>the license inter-alia mentioned that initially a <lb/>cumulative maximum of upto 4.4 MHz + 4.4 MHz was to <lb/>be allocated in the case of TDMA based systems (@ 200 <lb/>KHz per carrier or 30 KHz per carrier) and a maximum of <lb/>2.5 MHz + 2.5 MHz was to be allocated in the case of <lb/>CDMA based systems (@ 1.25 MHz per carrier), on case <lb/>by case basis subject to availability. It was also, inter-<lb/>alia, mentioned that additional spectrum beyond the <lb/>above stipulation may also be considered for allocation <lb/>after ensuring optimal and efficient utilization of the <lb/>already allocated spectrum taking into account all types <lb/>of traffic and guidelines/criteria prescribed from time to <lb/>time. However, spectrum not more than 5 + 5 MHz in <lb/>respect of CDMS system and 6.2 + 6.2 MHz in respect of <lb/>TDMA based system was to be allocated to the licensee. <lb/>There was no separate upfront charge for allocation of <lb/>Spectrum. However, Dual Technology licensees were <lb/>required to pay Spectrum usage charges in addition to <lb/>the license fee on revenue share basis as a percentage <lb/>of AGR. Spectrum to these licensees was allocated <lb/>10.01.2008 onwards. <lb/>WHEREAS Subscriber based criteria for CMTS was <lb/>prescribed in the year 2002 for allocation of additional <lb/>spectrum of 1.8 + 1.8 MHz beyond 6.2 + 6.2 MHz with a <lb/>levy of additional spectrum usage charge of 1% of AGR. <lb/>The allocation criteria was revised from time to time. A <lb/>copy of the DoT letter dated 01.02.2002 in this regard is <lb/>annexed hereto as Annexure XIV. <lb/>WHEREAS for the spectrum allotted beyond 6.2 <lb/>MHz, in the frequency allocation letters issued by DoT <lb/>May 2008 onwards, it was mentioned inter-alia that <lb/>allotment of spectrum is subject to pricing as <lb/>determined in future by the GoI for spectrum beyond <lb/>6.2 MHz + 6.2 MHz and the outcome of Court orders. <lb/>However, annual spectrum usage charges were levied <lb/>on the basis of AGR, as per the quantum of spectrum <lb/>assigned. A sample copy of the frequency allocation <lb/>letter is annexed hereto as Annexure XV. <lb/></body>

			<body>WHEREAS Spectrum for the 3G Band (i.e. 2100 <lb/>MHz band) was auctioned in 2010. The terms of the <lb/>auction stipulated that, for successful new entrants, a <lb/>fresh license agreement would be entered into and for <lb/>existing licensees who were successful in the auction, <lb/>the license agreement would be amended for use of <lb/>Spectrum in the 3G band. A copy of the Notice inviting <lb/>Applications and Clarifications thereto are annexed <lb/>hereto and marked as Annexure XVI (Colly). The <lb/>terms of the amendment letter provided, inter alia, that <lb/>the 3G spectrum would stand withdrawn if the license <lb/>stood terminated for any reason. <lb/>A copy of the <lb/>standard form of the amendment letter is annexed <lb/>hereto and marked as Annexure XVII. <lb/>WHEREAS letters of intent were issued for 122 <lb/>Licenses for providing 2G services on or after 10 January <lb/>2008, against which licenses (the &quot;2008 Licenses&quot;) <lb/>were subsequently issued. However, pursuant to the <lb/>judgment of this Hon&apos;ble Court dated 2 nd February, 2012 <lb/>in Writ Petition (Civil) No.423 of 2010 (the &quot;Judgment&quot;), <lb/>the 2008 Licenses have been quashed. A copy of the <lb/>judgment is annexed hereto and marked Annexure <lb/>XVIII. <lb/>WHEREAS the GoI has also filed an Interlocutory <lb/>Application for clarification of the Judgment, wherein the <lb/>GoI has placed on record the manner in which the <lb/>auction is proposed to be held pursuant to the Judgment <lb/>and sought appropriate clarificatory orders/directions <lb/>from the Hon&apos;ble Court. A copy of the Interlocutory <lb/>Application is annexed hereto and marked as Annexure <lb/>XIX. <lb/>WHEREAS while the GoI is implementing the <lb/>directions set out in the Judgment at paragraph 81 and <lb/>proceeding with a fresh grant of licences and allocation <lb/>of spectrum by auction, the GoI is seeking a limited <lb/>review of the Judgment to the extent it impacts <lb/>generally the method for allocation of national resources <lb/>by the State. A copy of the Review Petition is annexed <lb/>hereto and marked as Annexure XX. <lb/></body>

			<body>WHEREAS by the Judgment, this Hon&apos;ble Court <lb/>directed TRAI to make fresh recommendations for grant <lb/>of licenses and allocation of Spectrum in the 2G band by <lb/>holding an auction, as was done for the allocation of <lb/>Spectrum for the 3G licenses. <lb/>WHEREAS, in terms of the directions of this <lb/>Hon&apos;ble Court, GoI would now be allocating Spectrum in <lb/>the relevant 2G bands at prices discovered through <lb/>auction. <lb/>WHEREAS based on the recommendations of TRAI <lb/>dated 11.05.2010 followed by further clarifications and <lb/>recommendations, the GoI has prescribed in February <lb/>2012, the limit for spectrum assignment in the Metro <lb/>Service Areas as 2x10MHz/2x6.25 MHz and in rest of the <lb/>Service Areas as 2x8MHz/2x5 MHz for GSM (900 MHz, <lb/>1800 MHz band)/CDMA(800 MHZ band), respectively <lb/>subject to the condition that the Licensee can acquire <lb/>additional spectrum beyond prescribed limit in the open <lb/>market should there be an auction of spectrum subject <lb/>to the further condition that total spectrum held by it <lb/>does not exceed the limits prescribed for merger of <lb/>licenses i.e. 25% of the total spectrum assigned in that <lb/>Service Area by way of auction or otherwise. This limit <lb/>for CDMS spectrum is 10 MHz. <lb/>WHEREAS, in view of the fact that Spectrum may <lb/>need to be allocated to individual entities from time to <lb/>time in accordance with criteria laid down by the GoI, <lb/>such as subscriber base, availability of Spectrum in a <lb/>particular circle, inter-se priority depending on whether <lb/>the Spectrum comprises the initial allocation or <lb/>additional allocation, etc., it may not always be possible <lb/>to conduct an auction for the allocation of Spectrum. <lb/>AND WHEREAS in view of the aforesaid, the <lb/>auctioning of Spectrum in the 2G bands may result in a <lb/>situation where none of the Licensees, using the 2G <lb/>bands of 800 MHz., 900 MHz and 1800 MHz would have <lb/>paid any separate upfront fee for the allocation of <lb/>Spectrum. <lb/>AND WHEREAS the Government of India has <lb/></body>

			<page> 10 <lb/></page>

			<body>received various notices from companies based in other <lb/>countries, invoking bilateral investment agreements and <lb/>seeking damages against the Union of India by reason <lb/>of the cancellation/threat of cancellation of the licenses. <lb/>AND WHEREAS in the circumstance certain <lb/>questions of law of far reaching national and <lb/>international implications have arisen, including in <lb/>relation to the conduct of the auction and the regulation <lb/>of the telecommunications industry in accordance with <lb/>the Judgment and FDI into this country in the telecom <lb/>industry and otherwise in other sectors. <lb/>Given that the issues which have arisen are of <lb/>great public importance, and that questions of law have <lb/>arisen of public importance and with such far reaching <lb/>consequences for the development of the country that it <lb/>is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Hon&apos;ble <lb/>Supreme Court of India thereon. <lb/>NOW THEREFORE, in exercise of powers <lb/>conferred upon me by clause (1) of Article 143 of the <lb/>Constitution of India, I, Pratibha Devisingh Patil, <lb/>President of India, hereby refer the following questions <lb/>to the Supreme Court of India for consideration and <lb/>report thereon, namely: <lb/>Q.1 Whether the only permissible method for disposal <lb/>of all natural resources across all sectors and in all <lb/>circumstances is by the conduct of auctions? <lb/>Q.2 Whether a broad proposition of law that only the <lb/>route of auctions can be resorted to for disposal of <lb/>natural resources does not run contrary to several <lb/>judgments of the Supreme Court including those of <lb/>Larger Benches? <lb/>Q.3 Whether the enunciation of a broad principle, even <lb/>though expressed as a matter of constitutional law, <lb/>does not really amount to formulation of a policy <lb/>and has the effect of unsettling policy decisions <lb/>formulated and approaches taken by various <lb/>successive governments over the years for valid <lb/>considerations, including lack of public resources <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 10<lb/></note>

			<page> 11 <lb/></page>

			<body>and the need to resort to innovative and different <lb/>approaches for the development of various sectors <lb/>of the economy? <lb/>Q.4 What is the permissible scope for interference by <lb/>courts with policy making by the Government <lb/>including methods for disposal of natural <lb/>resources? <lb/>Q.5 Whether, if the court holds, within the permissible <lb/>scope of judicial review, that a policy is flawed, is <lb/>the court not obliged to take into account <lb/>investments made under the said policy including <lb/>investments made by foreign investors under <lb/>multilateral/bilateral agreements? <lb/>Q.6 If the answers to the aforesaid questions lead to an <lb/>affirmation of the judgment dated 02.02.2012 then <lb/>the following questions may arise, viz. <lb/>(i) whether the judgment is required to be given <lb/>retrospective effect so as to unsettle all <lb/>licences issued and 2G spectrum (800, 900, <lb/>and 1800 MHz bands) allocated in and after <lb/>1994 and prior to 10.01.2008? <lb/>(ii) whether the allocation of 2G spectrum in all <lb/>circumstances and in all specific cases for <lb/>different policy considerations would <lb/>nevertheless have to be undone? <lb/>And specifically <lb/>(iii) Whether the telecom licences granted in <lb/>1994 would be affected? <lb/>(iv) Whether the Telecom licences granted by <lb/>way of basic licences in 2001 and licences <lb/>granted between the period 2003-2007 <lb/>would be affected? <lb/>(v) Whether it is open to the Government of <lb/>India to take any action to alter the terms <lb/>of any licence to ensure a level playing field <lb/>among all existing licensees? <lb/></body>

			<page> 12 <lb/></page>

			<body>(vi) Whether dual technology licences granted <lb/>in 2007 and 2008 would be affected? <lb/>(vii) Whether it is necessary or obligatory for <lb/>the Government of India to withdraw the <lb/>Spectrum allocated to all existing licensees <lb/>or to charge for the same with <lb/>retrospective effect and if so on what basis <lb/>and from what date? <lb/>Q.7 Whether, while taking action for conduct of auction <lb/>in accordance with the orders of the Supreme <lb/>Court, it would remain permissible for the <lb/>Government to: <lb/>(i) Make provision for allotment of Spectrum <lb/>from time to time at the auction discovered <lb/>price and in accordance with laid down <lb/>criteria during the period of validity of the <lb/>auction determined price? <lb/>(ii) Impose a ceiling on the acquisition of <lb/>Spectrum with the aim of avoiding the <lb/>emergence of dominance in the market by <lb/>any licensee/applicant duly taking into <lb/>consideration TRAI recommendations in this <lb/>regard? <lb/>(iii) Make provision for allocation of Spectrum <lb/>at auction related prices in accordance with <lb/>laid down criteria in bands where there <lb/>may be inadequate or no competition (for <lb/>e.g. there is expected to be a low level of <lb/>competition for CDMA in 800 MHz band and <lb/>TRAI has recommended an equivalence <lb/>ratio of 1.5 or 1.3X1.5 for 800 MHz and 900 <lb/>MHz bands depending upon the quantum of <lb/>spectrum held by the licensee that can be <lb/>applied to auction price in 1800 MHz band <lb/>in the absence of a specific price for these <lb/>bands)? <lb/>Q.8 What is the effect of the judgment on 3G Spectrum <lb/>acquired by entities by auction whose licences <lb/></body>

			<body>have been quashed by the said judgment? <lb/>NEW DELHI; <lb/>DATED: 12 April 2012   PRESIDENT OF <lb/>INDIA&quot; <lb/>2. A bare reading of the Reference shows that it is occasioned <lb/>by the decision of this Court, rendered by a bench of two <lb/>learned Judges on 2 nd February, 2012 in Centre for Public <lb/>Interest Litigation &amp; Ors. Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors. 1 <lb/>(for brevity &quot;2G Case&quot;). <lb/>3. On receipt of the Reference, vide order dated 9 th May, <lb/>2012, notice was issued to the Attorney General for India. <lb/>Upon hearing the learned Attorney General, it was directed <lb/>vide order dated 11 th May, 2012, that notice of the <lb/>Reference shall be issued to all the States through their <lb/>Standing Counsel; on Centre for Public Interest Litigation <lb/>(CPIL) and Dr. Subramanian Swamy (petitioners in the 2G <lb/>Case); as also on the Federation of Indian Chambers of <lb/>Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Confederation of <lb/>Indian Industry (CII), as representatives of the Indian <lb/>industry. <lb/>On the suggestion of the learned Attorney <lb/>General, it was also directed (though not recorded in the <lb/>order), that the reference shall be dealt with in two parts <lb/></body>

			<body>viz. in the first instance, only questions No. 1 to 5 would be <lb/>taken up for consideration and the remaining questions <lb/>shall be taken up later in the light of our answers to the <lb/>first five questions. <lb/>4. At the commencement of the hearing of the Reference on <lb/>10 th July, 2012, a strong objection to the maintainability of <lb/>the Reference was raised by the writ petitioners in the 2G <lb/>Case. Accordingly, it was decided to first hear the learned <lb/>counsel on the question of validity of the Reference. <lb/>SUBMISSIONS ON MAINTAINABILITY : <lb/>5. Mr. Soli Sorabjee, learned senior counsel, appearing for <lb/>CPIL, strenuously urged that in effect and substance, the <lb/>Reference seeks to question the correctness of the <lb/>judgment in the 2G Case, which is not permissible once <lb/>this Court has pronounced its authoritative opinion on the <lb/>question of law now sought to be raised. The learned <lb/>counsel argued that reference under Article 143(1) of the <lb/>Constitution does not entail appellate or review <lb/>jurisdiction, especially in respect of a judgment which has <lb/>attained finality. According to the learned counsel, it is <lb/></body>

			<body>evident from the format of the Reference that it does not <lb/>express or suggest any &apos;doubt&apos; as regards the question of <lb/>fact or law relating to allocation of all natural resources, a <lb/>sine-qua-non for a valid reference. In support of the <lb/>proposition, <lb/>learned <lb/>counsel <lb/>placed <lb/>reliance <lb/>on <lb/>observations in earlier references -In Re: The Delhi <lb/>Laws Act, 1912, the Ajmer-Merwara (Extension of <lb/>Laws) Act, 1947 And The Part C States (Laws) Act, <lb/>1950 2 , In Re: The Berubari Union and Exchange of <lb/>Enclaves Reference Under Article 143(1) of the <lb/>Constitution of India 3 , In Re: The Kerala Education <lb/>Bill, 195,7 In Reference Under Article 143(1) Of The <lb/>Constitution of India 4 , Special Reference No.1 of <lb/>1964 5 (commonly referred to as &quot;Keshav Singh&quot;), In Re: <lb/>Presidential Poll 6 , In Re: The Special Courts Bill, <lb/>1978 7 , In the Matter of : Cauvery Water Disputes <lb/>Tribunal 8 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Cauvery-II&quot;) and <lb/>Special Reference No.1 of 1998 Re. 9 <lb/></body>

			<body>6. Next, it was contended by the learned senior counsel that <lb/>if for any reason, the Executive feels that the 2G Case <lb/>does not lay down a correct proposition of law, it is open to <lb/>it to persuade another bench, before which the said <lb/>judgment is relied upon, to refer the issue to a larger <lb/>bench for reconsideration. In short, the submission was <lb/>that an authoritative pronouncement, like the one in the <lb/>2G Case, cannot be short circuited by recourse to Article <lb/>143(1). <lb/>7. Learned counsel also contended that the Reference as <lb/>framed is of an omnibus nature, seeking answers on <lb/>hypothetical and vague questions, and therefore, must not <lb/>be answered. Commending us to In Re: The Special <lb/>Courts Bill, 1978 (supra) and several other decisions, <lb/>learned counsel urged that a reference under Article <lb/>143(1) of the Constitution for opinion has to be on a <lb/>specific question or questions. It was asserted that by <lb/>reason of the construction of the terms of Reference, the <lb/>manner in which the questions have been framed and the <lb/>nature of the answers proposed, this Court would be <lb/>entitled to return the Reference unanswered by pointing <lb/></body>

			<body>out the aforesaid impediments in answering it. Lastly, it <lb/>was fervently pleaded that if the present Reference is <lb/>entertained, it would pave the way for the Executive to <lb/>circumvent or negate the effect of inconvenient <lb/>judgments, like the decision in the 2G Case, which would <lb/>not only set a dangerous and unhealthy precedent, but <lb/>would also be clearly contrary to the ratio of the decision in <lb/>Cauvery II. <lb/>8. Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned senior counsel, while <lb/>adopting the arguments advanced by Mr. Soli Sorabjee, <lb/>reiterated that from the format of questions No.1 to 5, as <lb/>well as from the review petition filed by the Government in <lb/>the 2G Case, it is clear that the present Reference seeks <lb/>to overrule the decision in the 2G Case by reading down <lb/>the direction that allowed only &apos;auction&apos; as the permissible <lb/>means for allocation of all natural resource, in paragraphs <lb/>94 to 96 of the 2G Case, to the specific case of spectrum. <lb/>It was argued by the learned counsel that it is apparent <lb/>from the grounds urged in the review petition filed by the <lb/>Government that it understood the ratio of the 2G Case, <lb/>binding them to the form of procedure to be followed while <lb/></body>

			<body>alienating precious natural resources belonging to the <lb/>people, and yet it is seeking to use the advisory jurisdiction <lb/>of this Court as an appeal over its earlier decision. It was <lb/>contended that even if it be assumed that a doubt relating <lb/>to the disposal of all natural resources has arisen on <lb/>account of conflict of decisions on the point, such a conflict <lb/>cannot be resolved by way of a Presidential reference; that <lb/>would amount to holding that one or the other judgments <lb/>is incorrectly decided, which, according to the learned <lb/>counsel, is beyond the scope of Article 143(1). Learned <lb/>counsel alleged that the language in which the Reference <lb/>is couched, exhibits mala fides on the part of the <lb/>Executive. He thus, urged that we should refrain from <lb/>giving an opinion. <lb/>9. Dr. Subramanian Swamy, again vehemently objecting to <lb/>the maintainability of the Reference, on similar grounds, <lb/>added that the present Reference is against the very spirit <lb/>of Article 143(1), which, according to the constituent <lb/>assembly debates, was meant to be invoked sparingly, <lb/>unlike the case here. It was pleaded that the Reference is <lb/>yet another attempt to delay the implementation of the <lb/></body>

			<body>directions in the 2G Case. Relying on the decision of this <lb/>Court in Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui &amp; Ors. Vs. Union of <lb/>India &amp; Ors. 10 , Dr. Swamy submitted that we will be well <lb/>advised to return the Reference unanswered. <lb/>10. Mr. G.E. Vahanvati, the learned Attorney General for India, <lb/>defending the Reference, submitted that the plea <lb/>regarding non-maintainability of the Reference on the <lb/>ground that it does not spell out a &apos;doubt&apos;, is fallacious on a <lb/>plain reading of the questions framed therein. According <lb/>to him, Article 143(1) uses the word &apos;question&apos; which arises <lb/>only when there is a &apos;doubt&apos; and the very fact that the <lb/>President has sought the opinion of this Court on the <lb/>questions posed, shows that there is a doubt in the mind of <lb/>the Executive on those issues. It was stressed that merely <lb/>because the Reference does not use the word &apos;doubt&apos; in <lb/>the recitals, as in other cited cases, does not imply that in <lb/>substance no doubt is entertained in relation to the mode <lb/>of alienation of all natural resources, other than spectrum, <lb/>more so when the questions posed for opinion have far <lb/>reaching national and international implications. It was <lb/></body>

			<body>urged that the content of the Reference is to be <lb/>appreciated in proper perspective, keeping in view the <lb/>context and not the form. <lb/>11. It was urged that maintainability and the discretion to <lb/>decline to answer a reference are two entirely different <lb/>things. The question of maintainability arises when ex-<lb/>facie, the Presidential reference does not meet the basic <lb/>requirements of Article 143(1), contrastive to the question <lb/>of discretion, which is the power of the Court to decline to <lb/>answer a reference, for good reasons, once the reference <lb/>is maintainable. In support of the proposition, reliance was <lb/>placed on In Re: The Kerala Education Bill, 1957 <lb/>(supra), Keshav Singh and In Re: The Special Courts <lb/>Bill, 1978 (supra). According to the learned counsel, the <lb/>question as to whether the reference is to be answered or <lb/>not, is not an aspect of maintainability, and is to be <lb/>decided only after hearing the reference on merits. <lb/>12. Learned Attorney General, while contesting the plea that in <lb/>a reference under Article 143(1), correctness or otherwise <lb/>of earlier decisions can never be gone into, submitted that <lb/>in a Presidential reference, there is no constitutional <lb/></body>

			<body>embargo against reference to earlier decisions in order to <lb/>clarify, restate or even to form a fresh opinion on a <lb/>principle of law, as long as an inter partes decision is left <lb/>unaffected. In support of the contention that in the past, <lb/>references have been made on questions in relation to the <lb/>correctness of judgments, learned counsel placed reliance <lb/>on the decisions of this Court In Re: The Delhi Laws Act, <lb/>1912 (supra), Special Reference No.1 of 1998 (supra), <lb/>Keshav Singh (supra) and of the Privy Council In re <lb/>Piracy Jure Gentium 11 . It was asserted that it has been <lb/>repeatedly clarified on behalf of the Executive that the <lb/>decision in the 2G Case has been accepted and is not <lb/>being challenged. The Reference was necessitated by <lb/>certain observations made as a statement of law in the <lb/>said judgment which require to be explicated. Referring to <lb/>certain observations in Re: The Berubari Union and <lb/>Exchange of Enclaves (supra), learned counsel <lb/>submitted that this Court had accepted that a reference <lb/>could be answered to avoid protracted litigation. <lb/>13. Learned Attorney General also contended that withdrawal <lb/></body>

			<body>of the review petition by the Government is of no <lb/>consequence ; its withdrawal does not imply that the <lb/>question about the permissible manner of disposal of other <lb/>natural resources, and the issues regarding the <lb/>environment for investment in the country, stood settled. <lb/>Stoutly refuting the allegation that the reference is mala <lb/>fide, learned counsel submitted that in In Re Presidential <lb/>Poll (supra), it is clearly laid down that the Court cannot <lb/>question the bona fides of the President making the <lb/>reference. <lb/>14. Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina, learned senior counsel, voiced <lb/>concerns arising out of an apparent conflict between <lb/>provisions of the statutes and the judgment delivered in <lb/>the 2G Case; specifically with reference to Sections 10 and <lb/>11 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and <lb/>Development) Act, 1957 (for short, &quot;MMRD Act&quot;), which <lb/>prescribe a policy of preferential treatment and first come <lb/>first served, unlike the 2G Case, which according to the <lb/>learned counsel only mandates auction for all natural <lb/>resources. <lb/>He thus, urged this Court to dispel all <lb/>uncertainties regarding the true position of law after the <lb/></body>

			<body>judgment in the 2G Case, by holding it as per incuriam in <lb/>light of the provisions of the MMRD Act and other statutes. <lb/>15. Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel, appearing on <lb/>behalf of CII, while supporting the Reference, fervently <lb/>urged that the contention that the Reference deserves to <lb/>be returned unanswered due to the absence of the use of <lb/>the word &apos;doubt&apos; in the recitals of the Reference, is <lb/>untenable. According to the learned counsel, under Article <lb/>143(1), the President can seek an opinion on any question <lb/>of law or fact that has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is <lb/>of such a nature and such public importance that it is <lb/>expedient to seek the opinion of this Court. There is no <lb/>additional condition that there should be any &apos;doubt&apos; in the <lb/>mind of the President. It was submitted by the learned <lb/>counsel that the need for a Presidential reference may also <lb/>arise to impart certainty to certain questions of law or fact <lb/>which are of such a nature and of such moment as to <lb/>warrant seeking opinion of this Court. It was urged that a <lb/>pedantic interpretation, by which a Presidential reference <lb/>would be declined on semantic considerations, such as the <lb/>failure to use the word &apos;doubt&apos; in the reference, should be <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 23<lb/></note>

			<page> 24 <lb/></page>

			<body>eschewed. <lb/>16. Learned counsel contended that at the stage of making a <lb/>reference, it is the satisfaction of the President in relation <lb/>to the nature of the question and its importance that is <lb/>relevant. As a matter of comity of institutions, this Court <lb/>has always declined to go behind the reasons that <lb/>prevailed upon the President to make a reference and its <lb/>bona fides. <lb/>Nevertheless, this Court always has the <lb/>discretion not to answer any such reference or the <lb/>questions raised therein for good reasons. It was stressed <lb/>that since this Court does not sit in review over the <lb/>satisfaction of the President, the question of jurisdiction <lb/>and of maintainability does not arise. <lb/>17. Learned counsel also argued that the premise that earlier <lb/>judgments of this Court are binding in reference <lb/>jurisdiction, and thus any reference, which impinges upon <lb/>an earlier judgment should be returned unanswered, is <lb/>equally fallacious. It was argued that the principle of stare <lb/>decisis and the doctrine of precedent are generally <lb/>accepted and followed as rules of judicial discipline and not <lb/>jurisdictional fetters and, therefore, this Court is not <lb/></body>

			<body>prevented from re-examining the correctness of an earlier <lb/>decision. On the contrary, the precedents support the <lb/>proposition that this Court can, when exercising its <lb/>jurisdiction under Article 143(1), examine the correctness <lb/>of past precedents. According to the learned counsel, in <lb/>Keshav Singh, this Court did examine the correctness of <lb/>the judgment in Pandit M.S.M. Sharma Vs. Shri Sri <lb/>Krishna Sinha &amp; Ors. 12 (hereinafter referred to as <lb/>&quot;Sharma&quot;). <lb/>Explaining the ratio of the decision in <lb/>Cauvery-II, learned counsel submitted that it is clear <lb/>beyond any pale of doubt that the said pronouncement <lb/>does not lay down, as an abstract proposition of law, that <lb/>under Article 143(1), this Court cannot consider the <lb/>correctness of any precedent. What it lays down is that <lb/>once a lis between the parties is decided, the operative <lb/>decree can only be opened by way of a review. According <lb/>to the learned counsel, overruling a judgment -as a <lb/>precedent -does not tantamount to reopening the <lb/>decree. <lb/>18. Arguing on similar lines, Mr. C.A. Sundaram, learned senior <lb/></body>

			<body>counsel appearing on behalf of FICCI, contended that if the <lb/>observations in the 2G Case are read as applying to all <lb/>natural resources and not limited to spectrum, it would <lb/>tantamount to de facto policy formulation by the Court, <lb/>which is beyond the scope of judicial review. He also took <lb/>a nuanced stance on this Court&apos;s power of reconsideration <lb/>over its precedents. It was submitted that a precedent can <lb/>be sliced into two parts viz. the decision or operative part <lb/>of an order or decree pertaining to the inter partes dispute <lb/>and the ratio with respect to the position of law; the former <lb/>being beyond this Court&apos;s powers of review once an earlier <lb/>bench of this Court has pronounced an authoritative <lb/>opinion on it, but not the latter. He thus, urged that this <lb/>Court does have the power to reconsider the principles of <lb/>law laid down in its previous pronouncements even under <lb/>Article 141. <lb/>19. Mr. Darius Khambata, learned Advocate General of <lb/>Maharashtra, submitted that observations in the 2G Case <lb/>were made only with regard to spectrum thus, leaving it <lb/>open to this Court to examine the issue with regard to <lb/>alienation of other natural resources. It was urged that <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 26<lb/></note>

			<page> 27 <lb/></page>

			<body>even if broader observations were made with respect to all <lb/>natural resources, it would still be open to this Court under <lb/>Article 143(1) to say otherwise. He also pointed to certain <lb/>State legislations that prescribe methods other than <lb/>auction and thus, urged this Court to answer the first <lb/>question in the negative lest all those legislations be <lb/>deemed unconstitutional. <lb/>20. Mr. Sunil Gupta, learned senior counsel, appearing on <lb/>behalf of the State of U.P., added that when Article 143(1) <lb/>of the Constitution unfolds a high prerogative of a <lb/>constitutional authority, namely, the President, to consult <lb/>this Court on question of law or fact, it contains a no less <lb/>high prerogative of this Court to report to the President its <lb/>opinion on the question referred, either by making or <lb/>declining to give an answer to the question. In other <lb/>words, according to the learned counsel, the issue of a <lb/>reference being maintainable at the instance of the <lb/>President is an issue different from the judicial power of <lb/>this Court to answer or not to answer the question posed in <lb/>the reference. <lb/>21. Mr. Ravindra Shrivastava, learned senior counsel <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 27<lb/></note>

			<page> 28 <lb/></page>

			<body>appearing on behalf of the State of Chhattisgarh, <lb/>contended that neither history supports nor reality <lb/>warrants auction to be a rule of disposal of all natural <lb/>resources in all situations. He referred to decisions of this <lb/>Court that unambiguously strike a just balance between <lb/>considerations of power of the State and duty towards <lb/>public good, by leaving the choice of method of allocation <lb/>of natural resources to the State, as long as it conforms to <lb/>the requirements of Article 14. It was pleaded that the <lb/>State be allowed the choice of methodology of allocation, <lb/>especially in cases where it intends to incentivize <lb/>investments and job creation in backward regions that <lb/>would otherwise have been left untouched by private <lb/>players if resources were given at market prices. <lb/>22. To sum up, the objections relating to the maintainability of <lb/>the Reference converge mainly on the following points: (i) <lb/>the foundational requirement for reference under Article <lb/>143(1) viz. a genuine &apos;doubt&apos; about questions of fact or law <lb/>that the executive labours under, is absent; (ii) the filing <lb/>and withdrawal of a review petition whose recitals pertain <lb/>to the 2G Case would be an impediment in the exercise of <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 28<lb/></note>

			<page>29 <lb/></page>

			<body>discretion under Article 143(1); (iii) the language in which <lb/>the Reference is couched exhibits mala fides on the part of <lb/>the Executive; (iv) in light of enunciation of law on the <lb/>point in Cauvery II, entertaining a Presidential reference <lb/>on a subject matter, which has been decided upon directly <lb/>and with finality, is barred; (v) the present Reference is an <lb/>attempt to overturn the judgment of this Court in the 2G <lb/>Case, which is against the spirit of Article 143(1) of the <lb/>Constitution and (vi) the Executive is adopting the route of <lb/>this Reference to wriggle out of the directions in the 2G <lb/>Case as the same are inconvenient for them to follow. <lb/>DISCUSSION: <lb/>23. Before we evaluate the rival stands on the maintainability <lb/>of the Reference, it would be necessary to examine the <lb/>scope and breadth of Article 143 of the Constitution, which <lb/>reads thus: <lb/>&quot;143. Power of President to consult Supreme <lb/>Court.-(1) If at any time it appears to the President <lb/>that a question of law or fact has arisen, or is likely to <lb/>arise, which is of such a nature and of such public <lb/>importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion <lb/>of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer the <lb/>question to that Court for consideration and the Court <lb/>may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the <lb/>President its opinion thereon. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 29 <lb/></note>

			<page> 30 <lb/></page>

			<body>(2) The President may, notwithstanding anything in <lb/>the proviso to article 131, refer a dispute of the kind <lb/>mentioned in the said proviso to the Supreme Court <lb/>for opinion and the Supreme Court shall, after such <lb/>hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its <lb/>opinion thereon.&quot; <lb/>A bare reading at the Article would show that it is couched in <lb/>broad terms. It is plain from the language of Article 143(1) that <lb/>it is not necessary that the question on which the opinion of the <lb/>Supreme Court is sought must have actually arisen. The <lb/>President can make a reference under the said Article even at <lb/>an anterior stage, namely, at the stage when the President is <lb/>satisfied that the question is likely to arise. The satisfaction <lb/>whether the question meets the pre-requisites of Article 143(1) <lb/>is essentially a matter for the President to decide. Upon receipt <lb/>of a reference under Article 143(1), the function of this Court is <lb/>to consider the reference; the question(s) on which the <lb/>President has made the reference, on the facts as stated in the <lb/>reference and report to the President its opinion thereon. <lb/>24. Nevertheless, the usage of the word &quot;may&quot; in the latter <lb/>part of Article 143(1) implies that this Court is not bound to <lb/>render advisory opinion in every reference and may refuse <lb/>to express its opinion for strong, compelling and good <lb/></body>

			<page> 31 <lb/></page>

			<body>reasons. In Keshav Singh, highlighting the difference in <lb/>the phraseology used in clauses (1) and (2) of Article 143, <lb/>P.B. Gajendragadkar, C.J., speaking for the majority, held <lb/>as follows: <lb/>&quot;…whereas in the case of reference made under <lb/>Article 143 (2) it is the constitutional obligation of this <lb/>Court to make a report on that reference embodying <lb/>its advisory opinion, in a reference made under Article <lb/>143 (1) there is no such obligation. In dealing with <lb/>this latter class of reference, it is open to this Court to <lb/>consider whether it should make a report to the <lb/>President giving its advisory opinion on the questions <lb/>under reference.&quot; <lb/>25. Further, even in an earlier judgment in In re: Allocation <lb/>of Lands and Buildings Situate in a Chief <lb/>Commissioner&apos;s Province and in the matter of <lb/>Reference by the Governor-General under S. 213, <lb/>Government of India Act, 1935 13 , the Federal Court had <lb/>said that even though the Court is within its authority to <lb/>refuse to answer a question on a reference, it must be <lb/>unwilling to exercise its power of refusal &quot;except for good <lb/>reasons.&quot; A similar phrase was used in In Re: The Kerala <lb/>Education Bill, 1957 (supra) when this Court observed <lb/>that opinion on a reference under Article 143(1), may be <lb/></body>

			<body>declined in a &quot;proper case&quot; and &quot;for good reasons&quot;. In Dr. <lb/>M. Ismail Faruqui &amp; Ors. (supra), it was added that a <lb/>reference may not be answered when the Court is not <lb/>competent to decide the question which is based on expert <lb/>evidence or is a political one. <lb/>26. Having noted the relevant contours of Article 143(1) of the <lb/>Constitution, we may now deal with the objections to the <lb/>maintainability of the Reference. <lb/>27. There is no denying the fact that in the entire Reference <lb/>the word &apos;doubt&apos; has not been used. It is also true that in <lb/>all previous references, noted in para 5 (supra), it had <lb/>been specifically mentioned that doubts had arisen about <lb/>various issues. Nonetheless, the fact remains that Article <lb/>143(1) does not use the term &apos;doubt&apos;. No specific format <lb/>has been provided in any of the Schedules of the <lb/>Constitution as to how a reference is to be drawn. The use <lb/>of the word &apos;doubt&apos; in a reference is also not a <lb/>constitutional command or mandate. Needless to <lb/></body>

			<body>emphasise that the expression, &apos;doubt&apos;, which refers to a <lb/>state of uncertainty, may be with regard to a fact or a <lb/>principle. In P. Ramanatha Aiyar&apos;s, The Major Law <lb/>Lexicon, 4 th Edition, the words &apos;doubt&apos; and &apos;question&apos; <lb/>have been dealt with in the following manner:-<lb/>&quot;Doubt, Question. These terms express the act of the <lb/>mind in staying its decision. Doubt lies altogether in <lb/>the mind; it is a less active feeling than question; by <lb/>the former we merely suspend decision; by the latter <lb/>we actually demand proofs in order to assist us in <lb/>deciding. We may doubt in silence. We cannot <lb/>question without expressing it directly or indirectly. <lb/>He who suggests doubts does it with caution: he who <lb/>makes a question throws in difficulties with a degree <lb/>of confidence. We doubt the truth of a position; we <lb/>question the veracity of an author. (Crabb.)&quot; <lb/>As per the Concise Oxford Dictionary (Tenth Edition), <lb/>&apos;question&apos; means : &quot;a doubt; the raising of a doubt or objection; <lb/>a problem requiring solution&quot;. <lb/>In Black&apos;s Law Dictionary &apos;doubt&apos;, as a verb, has been defined <lb/>as follows: <lb/>&quot;To question or hold questionable.&quot; <lb/>The word &apos;doubt&apos;, as a noun, has been described as under:-<lb/>&quot;Uncertainty of mind; the absence of a settled opinion <lb/>or conviction; the attitude of mind towards the <lb/>acceptance of or belief in a proposition, theory, or <lb/></body>

			<body>statement, in which the judgment is not at rest but <lb/>inclines alternately to either side.&quot; <lb/>28. The afore-extracted recitals of the instant Reference state <lb/>that in the current circumstances, certain questions of law <lb/>with far reaching national and international implications <lb/>have arisen, including in relation to conduct of the auction <lb/>and the regulation of the telecommunications industry in <lb/>accordance with the judgment (2G Case) that may affect <lb/>the flow of FDI in the telecom industry and otherwise in <lb/>other sectors into this country. Thereafter, it is also stated <lb/>that questions of law that have arisen are of great public <lb/>importance and are of far reaching consequences for the <lb/>development of the country and hence, it is thought <lb/>expedient to obtain the opinion of this Court. Question <lb/>No.1 of the reference reads as follows:-<lb/>&quot;Whether the only permissible method for disposal of <lb/>all natural resources across all sectors and in all <lb/>circumstances is by the conduct of auctions?&quot; <lb/>29. At this juncture, reference may profitably be made to the <lb/>decision in In Re: The Special Courts Bill, 1978 (supra), <lb/>an opinion by a Bench of seven learned Judges, wherein it <lb/>was observed as follows: <lb/></body>

			<body>&quot;27. We were, at one stage of the arguments, so <lb/>much exercised over the undefined breadth of the <lb/>reference that we were considering seriously whether <lb/>in the circumstances it was not advisable to return <lb/>the reference unanswered. But the written briefs filed <lb/>by the parties and the oral arguments advanced <lb/>before us have, by their fullness and ability, helped to <lb/>narrow down the legal controversies surrounding the <lb/>Bill and to crystallize the issues which arise for our <lb/>consideration. We propose to limit our opinion to the <lb/>points specifically raised before us. <lb/>It will be <lb/>convenient to indicate at this stage what those points <lb/>are.&quot; <lb/>While expressing the hope that, in future, specific questions <lb/>would be framed for the opinion of this Court, Y.V. Chandrachud <lb/>(as his Lordship then was), speaking for the majority, said: <lb/>&quot;30. We hope that in future, whenever a reference is <lb/>made to this Court under Article 143 of the <lb/>Constitution, care will be taken to frame specific <lb/>questions for the opinion of the Court. Fortunately, it <lb/>has been possible in the instant reference to consider <lb/>specific questions as being comprehended within the <lb/>terms of the reference but the risk that a vague and <lb/>general reference may be returned unanswered is <lb/>real and ought to engage the attention of those <lb/>whose duty it is to frame the reference. Were the Bill <lb/>not as short as it is, it would have been difficult to <lb/>infuse into the reference the comprehension of the <lb/>two points mentioned by us above and which we <lb/>propose to decide. A long Bill would have presented <lb/>to us a rambling task in the absence of reference on <lb/>specific points, rendering it impossible to formulate <lb/>succinctly the nature of constitutional challenge to <lb/>the provisions of the Bill.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>30. From the afore-extracted paragraphs, three broad <lb/>principles emerge: (i) a reference should not be vague, <lb/>general and undefined, (ii) this Court can go through the <lb/>written briefs and arguments to narrow down the legal <lb/>controversies, and (iii) when the question becomes <lb/>unspecific and incomprehensible, the risk of returning the <lb/>reference unanswered arises. In Keshav Singh, this Court <lb/>while dealing with the validity of the reference, referred to <lb/>earlier decisions and opined as follows: <lb/>&quot;…It would thus be seen that the questions so far <lb/>referred by the President for the Advisory opinion of <lb/>this Court under Article 143(1) do not disclose a <lb/>uniform pattern and that is quite clearly consistent <lb/>with the broad and wide words used in Article <lb/>143(1).&quot; <lb/>31. An analysis of the afore-noted cases, indicates that neither <lb/>has a particular format been prescribed nor any specific <lb/>pattern been followed in framing references. The first <lb/>principle relates to the &apos;form&apos; and the second pertains to <lb/>the &apos;pattern of content&apos;. Holistically understood, on the <lb/>ground of form or pattern alone, a reference is not to be <lb/>returned unanswered. It requires appropriate analysis, <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 36<lb/></note>

			<page> 37 <lb/></page>

			<body>understanding and appreciation of the content or the issue <lb/>on which doubt is expressed, keeping in view the concept <lb/>of constitutional responsibility, juridical propriety and <lb/>judicial discretion. <lb/>32. Thus, we find it difficult to accept the stand that use of the <lb/>word &apos;doubt&apos; is a necessary condition for a reference to be <lb/>maintainable under Article 143(1). That apart, in our view, <lb/>question No.1, quoted above, is neither vague nor general <lb/>or unspecific, but is in the realm of comprehension which is <lb/>relatable to a question of law. It expresses a &apos;doubt&apos; and <lb/>seeks the opinion of the Court on that question, besides <lb/>others. <lb/>33. In so far as the impact of filing and withdrawal of the <lb/>review application by the Union of India, against the <lb/>decision in the 2G Case on the maintainability of the <lb/>instant Reference is concerned, it is a matter of record that <lb/>in the review petition, certain aspects of the grounds for <lb/>review which have been stated in the recitals of the <lb/>Reference as well as in some questions, were highlighted. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 37 <lb/></note>

			<page> 38 <lb/></page>

			<body>However, there is a gulf of difference between the <lb/>jurisdiction exercised by this Court in a review and the <lb/>discretion exercised in answering a reference under Article <lb/>143(1) of the Constitution. A review is basically guided by <lb/>the well-settled principles for review of a judgment and a <lb/>decree or order passed inter se parties. The Court in <lb/>exercise of power of review may entertain the review <lb/>under the acceptable and settled parameters. But, when <lb/>an opinion of this Court is sought by the Executive taking <lb/>recourse to a constitutional power, needless to say, the <lb/>same stands on a different footing altogether. A review is <lb/>lis specific and the rights of the parties to the controversy <lb/>are dealt with therein, whereas a reference is answered <lb/>keeping in view the terms of the reference and scrutinising <lb/>whether the same satisfies the requirements inherent in <lb/>the language employed under Article 143(1) of the <lb/>Constitution. In our view, therefore, merely because a <lb/>review had been filed and withdrawn and in the recital the <lb/>narration pertains to the said case, the same would not be <lb/>an embargo or impediment for exercise of discretion to <lb/>answer the Reference. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 38 <lb/></note>

			<page> 39 <lb/></page>

			<body>34. As far as the allegation of mala fide is concerned, it is trite <lb/>that this Court is neither required to go into the truth or <lb/>otherwise of the facts of the recitals nor can it go into the <lb/>question of bona fides or otherwise of the authority making <lb/>a reference. [See: In Re: Presidential Poll (supra)]. To <lb/>put it differently, the constitutional power to seek opinion <lb/>of this Court rests with the President. The only discretion <lb/>this Court has is either to answer the reference or <lb/>respectfully decline to send a report to the President. <lb/>Therefore, the challenge on the ground of mala fide, as <lb/>raised, is unsustainable. <lb/>35. The principal objection to the maintainability of the <lb/>Reference is that it is an indirect endeavour to unsettle and <lb/>overturn the verdict in the 2G Case, which is absolutely <lb/>impermissible. The stand of the objectors is that the 2G <lb/>Case is an authoritative precedent in respect of the <lb/>principle or proposition of law that all natural resources are <lb/>to be disposed of by way of public auction and, therefore, <lb/>the Reference should be held as not maintainable. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 39<lb/></note>

			<page> 40 <lb/></page>

			<body>Emphasis in this behalf was on paragraphs 85 and 94 to 96 <lb/>of the said judgment. In support of the proposition, heavy <lb/>reliance was placed on Cauvery II. <lb/>36. At the outset, we may note that the learned Attorney <lb/>General has more than once stated that the Government of <lb/>India is not questioning the correctness of the directions in <lb/>the 2G Case, in so far as the allocation of spectrum is <lb/>concerned, and in fact the Government is in the process of <lb/>implementing the same, in letter and spirit. Therefore, in <lb/>the light of the said statement, we feel that it would be <lb/>unnecessary to comment on the submission that the <lb/>Reference is an attempt to get an opinion to unsettle the <lb/>decision and directions of this Court in the 2G Case. <lb/>Nevertheless, since in support of the aforesaid submission, <lb/>the opinion of this Court in Cauvery II has been referred <lb/>to and relied upon in extenso, it would be appropriate to <lb/>decipher the true ratio of Cauvery II, the lynchpin of the <lb/>opposition to maintainability of the present Reference. <lb/></body>

			<body>37. Cauvery II was preceded by State of Tamil Nadu Vs. <lb/>State of Karnataka &amp; Ors. 14 (hereinafter referred to as <lb/>&quot;Cauvery I&quot;), which dwelled on the issue whether the <lb/>Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (for short &quot;the Tribunal&quot;) <lb/>had the power to grant interim relief. <lb/>In that case, <lb/>applications filed by the State of Tamil Nadu for urgent <lb/>interim reliefs were rejected by the Tribunal on the ground <lb/>that they were not maintainable. <lb/>This order was <lb/>challenged, resulting in the judgment dated 26 th April, <lb/>1991 by this Court, where it was held as follows: <lb/>&quot;15. Thus, we hold that this Court is the ultimate <lb/>interpreter of the provisions of the Interstate Water <lb/>Disputes Act, 1956 and has an authority to decide the <lb/>limits, powers and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal <lb/>constituted under the Act. This Court has not only the <lb/>power but obligation to decide as to whether the <lb/>Tribunal has any jurisdiction or not under the Act, to <lb/>entertain any interim application till it finally decides <lb/>the dispute referred to it…&quot; <lb/>38. The Tribunal had ruled that since it was not like other <lb/>courts with inherent powers to grant interim relief, only in <lb/>case the Central Government referred a case for interim <lb/>relief to it, would it have the jurisdiction to grant the same. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 41<lb/></note>

			<page> 42 <lb/></page>

			<body>Inter-alia, the Court observed that the Tribunal was wrong <lb/>in holding that the Central Government had not made any <lb/>reference for granting any interim relief, and concluded <lb/>that the interim reliefs prayed for clearly fell within the <lb/>purview of the dispute referred by the Central <lb/>Government. Accordingly, the appeals preferred by the <lb/>State of Tamil Nadu were allowed and the Tribunal was <lb/>directed to decide the applications for interim relief. <lb/>However, the Court did not decide the larger question of <lb/>whether a Tribunal, constituted under the Interstate Water <lb/>Disputes Act, 1956 had the power to grant an interim <lb/>relief, though the answer to the same may be deduced <lb/>from the final direction. <lb/>39. In pursuance of these directions, the Tribunal decided the <lb/>application and vide its order dated 25 th June, 1991, <lb/>proceeded to issue certain directions to the State of <lb/>Karnataka. Thereafter, on 25 th July 1991, the Governor of <lb/>Karnataka issued an Ordinance named &quot;The Karnataka <lb/>Cauvery Basin Irrigation Protection Ordinance, 1991&quot;. Hot <lb/>on the heels of the Ordinance, the State of Karnataka also <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page  42<lb/></note>

			<page> 43 <lb/></page>

			<body>instituted a suit under Article 131 of the Constitution <lb/>against the State of Tamil Nadu for a declaration that the <lb/>Tribunal&apos;s order granting interim relief was without <lb/>jurisdiction and, therefore, null and void, etc. <lb/>The <lb/>Ordinance was replaced by Act 27 of 1991. In the context <lb/>of these developments, the President made a reference to <lb/>this Court under Article 143(1) of the Constitution, posing <lb/>three questions for opinion. The third question of the <lb/>reference, relevant for the present Reference, was :-<lb/>&quot;3. Whether a Water Disputes Tribunal constituted <lb/>under the Act is competent to grant any interim relief <lb/>to the parties to the dispute.&quot; <lb/>However, while dealing with the reference in Cauvery II, the <lb/>Court split the question, viz., whether a Water Disputes Tribunal <lb/>constituted under the Act is competent to grant any interim <lb/>relief into two parts: (i) when a reference for grant of interim <lb/>relief is made to the Tribunal, and (ii) when no such reference is <lb/>made to it. It was contended by the States of Karnataka and <lb/>Kerala that if the Tribunal did not have power to grant interim <lb/>relief, the Central Government would be incompetent to make a <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 43 <lb/></note>

			<page> 44 <lb/></page>

			<body>reference for the purpose in the first place and the Tribunal in <lb/>turn would have no jurisdiction to entertain such reference, if <lb/>made. Dealing with the said submission, after making a <lb/>reference to the earlier order, this Court observed that once the <lb/>Central Government had made a reference to the Tribunal for <lb/>consideration of the claim for interim relief, prayed for by the <lb/>State of Tamil Nadu, the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider the <lb/>said request being a part of the reference itself. Implicit in the <lb/>said decision was the finding that the subject of interim relief <lb/>was a matter connected with or relevant to the water dispute <lb/>within the meaning of Section 5(1) of the said Act. It was held <lb/>that the Central Government could refer the matter for granting <lb/>interim relief to the Tribunal for adjudication. <lb/>40. The consequence of the Court in coming to the conclusion, <lb/>while replying to the third question was that the Tribunal <lb/>did not have the jurisdiction to make an interim award or <lb/>grant interim relief, would have not only resulted in the <lb/>Court overruling its earlier decision between the two <lb/>contending parties i.e. the two States, but it would have <lb/>also then required the Court to declare the order of the <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 44 <lb/></note>

			<page>45 <lb/></page>

			<body>Tribunal as being without jurisdiction. The Court therefore, <lb/>said : <lb/>&quot;83…Although this Court by the said decision has <lb/>kept open the question, viz., whether the Tribunal has <lb/>incidental, ancillary, inherent or implied power to <lb/>grant the interim relief when no reference for grant of <lb/>such relief is made to it, it has in terms concluded the <lb/>second part of the question. We cannot, therefore, <lb/>countenance a situation whereby question 3 and for <lb/>that matter questions 1 and 2 may be so construed <lb/>as to invite our opinion on the said decision of this <lb/>Court. That would obviously be tantamount to our <lb/>sitting in appeal on the said decision which it is <lb/>impermissible for us to do even in adjudicatory <lb/>jurisdiction. Nor is it competent for the President to <lb/>invest us with an appellate jurisdiction over the said <lb/>decision through a Reference under Article 143 of the <lb/>Constitution.&quot; <lb/>These observations would suggest that the Court declined to <lb/>construe Article 143 as a power any different from its <lb/>adjudicative powers and for that reason, said that what could <lb/>not be done in the adjudicatory process would equally not be <lb/>achieved through the process of a reference. <lb/>41. The expression, &quot;sitting in appeal&quot; was accurately used. An <lb/>appellate court vacates the decree (or writ, order or <lb/>direction) of the lower court when it allows an appeal -<lb/>which is what this Court was invited to do in Cauvery I. <lb/>This Court, in that appeal decided earlier, held that the <lb/>Tribunal had the jurisdiction to pass the interim order <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 45 <lb/></note>

			<page> 46 <lb/></page>

			<body>sought by the State of Tamil Nadu. To nullify the interim <lb/>order passed by the Tribunal, pursuant to a direction of the <lb/>Supreme Court, on the ground that it was without <lb/>jurisdiction, would necessarily require vacating the <lb/>direction of the Supreme Court to the Tribunal to exercise <lb/>its jurisdiction and decide the interim matter. Para 85 of <lb/>that decision puts the matter beyond any pale of doubt: <lb/>&quot;85... In the first instance, the language of clause <lb/>(1) of Article 143 far from supporting Shri <lb/>Nariman&apos;s contention is opposed to it. The said <lb/>clause empowers the President to refer for this <lb/>Court&apos;s opinion a question of law or fact which has <lb/>arisen or is likely to arise. When this Court in its <lb/>adjudicatory <lb/>jurisdiction <lb/>pronounces <lb/>its <lb/>authoritative opinion on a question of law, it cannot <lb/>be said that there is any doubt about the question <lb/>of law or the same is res integra so as to require <lb/>the President to know what the true position of law <lb/>on the question is. The decision of this Court on a <lb/>question of law is binding on all courts and <lb/>authorities. Hence under the said clause the <lb/>President can refer a question of law only when <lb/>this Court has not decided it. Secondly, a decision <lb/>given by this Court can be reviewed only under <lb/>Article 137 read with Rule 1 of Order 40 of the <lb/>Supreme Court Rules, 1966 and on the conditions <lb/>mentioned therein. When, further, this Court <lb/>overrules the view of law expressed by it in an <lb/>earlier case, it does not do so sitting in appeal and <lb/>exercising an appellate jurisdiction over the earlier <lb/>decision. It does so in exercise of its inherent <lb/>power and only in exceptional circumstances such <lb/>as when the earlier decision is per incuriam or is <lb/>delivered in the absence of relevant or material <lb/></body>

			<body>facts or if it is manifestly wrong and productive of <lb/>public mischief. [See: Bengal Immunity Company <lb/>Ltd. v. State of Bihar (1955) 2 SCR 603]. Under the <lb/>Constitution such appellate jurisdiction does not <lb/>vest in this Court, nor can it be vested in it by the <lb/>President under Article 143. To accept Shri <lb/>Nariman&apos;s contention would mean that the <lb/>advisory jurisdiction under Article 143 is also an <lb/>appellate jurisdiction of this Court over its own <lb/>decision between the same parties and the <lb/>executive has a power to ask this Court to revise <lb/>its decision. If such power is read in Article 143 it <lb/>would be a serious inroad into the independence of <lb/>judiciary.&quot; <lb/>42. Eventually, the reference was answered in respect of <lb/>question No.3 in the following terms:-<lb/>&quot;Question No.3: (i) A Water Disputes Tribunal <lb/>constituted under the Act is competent to grant any <lb/>interim relief to the parties to the dispute when a <lb/>reference for such relief is made by the Central <lb/>Government; <lb/>(ii) whether the Tribunal has power to grant <lb/>interim relief when no reference is made by the <lb/>Central Government for such relief is a question which <lb/>does not arise in the facts and circumstances under <lb/>which the Reference is made. Hence we do not deem <lb/>it necessary to answer the same.&quot; <lb/>43. The main emphasis of Mr. Soli Sorabjee was on the second <lb/>part of paragraph 85, which, according to him, prohibits <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 47 <lb/></note>

			<page> 48 <lb/></page>

			<body>this Court from overruling a view expressed by it <lb/>previously under Article 143(1). We are not persuaded to <lb/>agree with the learned senior counsel. The paragraph has <lb/>to be read carefully. <lb/>Sawant J. first considers the case <lb/>of a &quot;decision&quot; of this Court whereas in the subsequent <lb/>sentence he considers a &quot;view of law&quot; expressed by the <lb/>Court, and attempts to explain the difference between the <lb/>approaches to these two situations. These words are <lb/>sometimes used interchangeably but not hereinabove. We <lb/>believe that Justice Sawant consciously draws a difference <lb/>between the two by using the words &quot;When, further, this <lb/>Court overrules the view of law…&quot; after discussing the <lb/>case of a &quot;decision&quot;. <lb/>44. Black&apos;s Law Dictionary defines a &quot;decision&quot; as &quot;a <lb/>determination arrived at after consideration of facts, and, <lb/>in legal context, law&quot;; an &quot;opinion&quot; as &quot;the statement by a <lb/>judge or court of the decision reached in regard to a cause <lb/>tried or argued before them, expounding the law as <lb/>applied to the case, and detailing the reasons upon which <lb/>the judgment is based&quot;; and explains the difference <lb/>between a &quot;decision&quot; and &quot;opinion&quot; as follows: <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 48 <lb/></note>

			<page>  49 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;Decision is not necessarily synonymous with <lb/>&apos;opinion&apos;. A decision of the Court is its judgment; the <lb/>opinion is the reasons given for that judgment, or the <lb/>expression of the views of the judge.&quot; <lb/>45. Therefore, references in Para 85 to &quot;decision&quot; and &quot;view of <lb/>law&quot; must be severed from each other. The learned Judge <lb/>observes that in case of a decision, the appellate structure <lb/>is exhausted after a pronouncement by the Supreme <lb/>Court. Therefore, the only option left to the parties is of <lb/>review or curative jurisdiction (a remedy carved out in the <lb/>judgment in Rupa Ashok Hurra Vs. Ashok Hurra &amp; <lb/>Anr. 15 ). After the exercise of those limited options, the <lb/>concerned parties have absolutely no relief with regard to <lb/>the dispute; it is considered settled for eternity in the eyes <lb/>of the law. However what is not eternal and still malleable <lb/>in the eyes of law is the opinion or &quot;view of law&quot; <lb/>pronounced in the course of reaching the decision. Justice <lb/>Sawant clarifies that unlike this Court&apos;s appellate power, its <lb/>power to overrule a previous precedent is an outcome of <lb/>its inherent power <lb/>when he says, &quot;…it does not do so <lb/>sitting in appeal and exercising an appellate jurisdiction <lb/></body>

			<body>over the earlier decision. It does so in exercise of its <lb/>inherent power and only in exceptional circumstances….&quot; <lb/>This Court has pointed out the difference between the two <lb/>expressions in Rupa Ashok Hurra (supra), in the <lb/>following words: <lb/>&quot;24. There is no gainsaying that the Supreme Court is <lb/>the court of last resort -the final court on questions <lb/>both of fact and of law including constitutional law. <lb/>The law declared by this Court is the law of the land; <lb/>it is precedent for itself and for all the courts/tribunals <lb/>and authorities in India. In a judgment there will be <lb/>declaration of law and its application to the facts of <lb/>the case to render a decision on the dispute between <lb/>the parties to the lis. It is necessary to bear in mind <lb/>that the principles in regard to the highest court <lb/>departing from its binding precedent are different <lb/>from the grounds on which a final judgment between <lb/>the parties, can be reconsidered. Here, we are mainly <lb/>concerned <lb/>with <lb/>the <lb/>latter. <lb/>However, <lb/>when <lb/>reconsideration of a judgment of this Court is sought <lb/>the finality attached both to the law declared as well <lb/>as to the decision made in the case, is normally <lb/>brought under challenge…&quot; <lb/>Therefore, there are two limitations -one jurisdictional and the <lb/>other self-imposed. <lb/>46. The first limitation is that a decision of this Court can be <lb/>reviewed only under Article 137 or a Curative Petition and <lb/>in no other way. It was in this context that in para 85 of <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 50 <lb/></note>

			<page>  51 <lb/></page>

			<body>Cauvery II, this Court had stated that the President can <lb/>refer a question of law when this Court has not decided it. <lb/>Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel, is right when he <lb/>argues that once a lis between parties is decided, the <lb/>operative decree can only be opened in review. Overruling <lb/>the judgment -as a precedent -does not reopen the <lb/>decree. <lb/>47. The second limitation, a self imposed rule of judicial <lb/>discipline, was that overruling the opinion of the Court on a <lb/>legal issue does not constitute sitting in appeal, but is done <lb/>only in exceptional circumstances, such as when the <lb/>earlier decision is per incuriam or is delivered in the <lb/>absence of relevant or material facts or if it is manifestly <lb/>wrong and capable of causing public mischief. For this <lb/>proposition, the Court relied upon the judgment in the <lb/>Bengal Immunity case (supra) wherein it was held that <lb/>when Article 141 lays down that the law declared by this <lb/>Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of <lb/>India, it quite obviously refers to courts other than this <lb/>Court; and that the Court would normally follow past <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 51 <lb/></note>

			<page> 52 <lb/></page>

			<body>precedents save and except where it was necessary to <lb/>reconsider the correctness of law laid down in that <lb/>judgment. In fact, the overruling of a principle of law is not <lb/>an outcome of appellate jurisdiction but a consequence of <lb/>its inherent power. This inherent power can be exercised <lb/>as long as a previous decree vis-à-vis lis inter partes is not <lb/>affected. It is the attempt to overturn the decision of a <lb/>previous case that is problematic which is why the Court <lb/>observes that &quot;under the Constitution such appellate <lb/>jurisdiction does not vest in this Court, nor can it be vested <lb/>in it by the President under Article 143.&quot; <lb/>48. Therefore, the controversy in Cauvery II was covered by <lb/>the decision rendered by this Court in Cauvery I between <lb/>the parties and the decision operated as res judicata and <lb/>hence, it was opined that discretion under Article 143(1) <lb/>could not be exercised. It has also been observed that this <lb/>Court had analysed the relevant provisions of the Inter-<lb/>State Water Disputes Act, 1956 and thereafter had come <lb/>to the conclusion that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to grant <lb/>interim relief if the question of granting interim relief <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 52<lb/></note>

			<page> 53 <lb/></page>

			<body>formed part of the reference. On this bedrock it was held <lb/>that the decision operated as res judicata. It is, therefore, <lb/>manifest from Cauvery II that the Court was clearly not <lb/>opposed to clarifying the ratio of a previous judgment in <lb/>Cauvery I, in the course of an advisory jurisdiction. Afore-<lb/>extracted para 85 of Cauvery II, restricts this Court&apos;s <lb/>advisory jurisdiction on the limited point of overturning a <lb/>decided issue vis-à-vis a &apos;dispute&apos; or lis inter partes. <lb/>49. Finally a seven Judge Bench of this Court has clearly held <lb/>that this Court, under Article 143(1), does have the power <lb/>to overrule a previous view delivered by it. <lb/>Justice <lb/>Chandrachud, C.J. in In re: The Special Courts Bill <lb/>(supra) held: <lb/>&quot;101…We are inclined to the view that though it is <lb/>always open to this Court to re-examine the question <lb/>already decided by it and to overrule, if necessary, the <lb/>view earlier taken by it, insofar as all other courts in the <lb/>territory of India are concerned they ought to be bound <lb/>by the view expressed by this Court even in the exercise <lb/>of its advisory jurisdiction under Article 143(1) of the <lb/>Constitution.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 53<lb/></note>

			<page> 54 <lb/></page>

			<body>50. There is a catena of pronouncements in which this Court <lb/>has either explained, clarified or read down the ratio of <lb/>previous judgments. In the very first reference, In Re: <lb/>Delhi Laws Act, 1912 (supra), the reference was made <lb/>by reason of a judgment of the Federal Court in Jatindra <lb/>Nath Gupta Vs. The Province of Bihar &amp; Ors. 16 . The <lb/>background of that reference was explained by Mukherjea, <lb/>J. as under: <lb/>&quot;The necessity of seeking the advisory opinion of this <lb/>Court is stated to have arisen from the fact that <lb/>because of the decision of the Federal Court in <lb/>Jatindra Nath Gupta v. The Province of Bihar, which <lb/>held the proviso to sub-section (3) of Section 1 of the <lb/>Bihar Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1947, ultra <lb/>vires the Bihar Provincial Legislature, by reason of its <lb/>amounting to a delegation of its legislative powers to <lb/>an extraneous authority, doubts have arisen <lb/>regarding the validity of the three legislative <lb/>provisions mentioned above, the legality of the first <lb/>and the second being actually called in question in <lb/>certain judicial proceedings which are pending before <lb/>some of the High Courts in India.&quot; <lb/>Justice Das in the same opinion, while noting that reliance was <lb/>placed by learned counsel for the interveners on the judgment <lb/>of the Federal Court in Jatindra Nath Gupta (supra), recorded <lb/>that the learned Attorney General had strenuously challenged <lb/></body>

			<page> 55 <lb/></page>

			<body>the correctness of the decision of the majority of the Federal <lb/>Court in that case. Inter-alia, observing that the reference was <lb/>in a way occasioned by that decision, the learned Judge held as <lb/>follows: <lb/>&quot;I feel bound to say, with the utmost humility and for <lb/>reasons given already, that the observations of the <lb/>majority of the Federal Court in that case went too far <lb/>and, in agreement with the learned Attorney-General, <lb/>I am unable to accept them as correct exposition of <lb/>the principles relating to the delegation of legislative <lb/>power.&quot; <lb/>51. In this context, it would be beneficial to refer to Keshav <lb/>Singh&apos;s case. In the said case, a reference was made by <lb/>the President which fundamentally pertained to the <lb/>privileges of the Legislative Assembly and exercise of <lb/>jurisdiction by a Bench of the High Court. The High Court <lb/>entertained a writ petition under Article 226 of the <lb/>Constitution, challenging the decision of the Assembly <lb/>committing one Keshav Singh, who was not one of its <lb/>members, to prison for its contempt. <lb/>The issue was <lb/>whether by entertaining the writ petition, the Judges of the <lb/>High Court were in contempt of the Legislature for <lb/>infringement of its privileges and immunities. For the <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 55 <lb/></note>

			<body>same, this Court proceeded to construe the relevant <lb/>provisions <lb/>contained <lb/>in <lb/>Article <lb/>194(3) <lb/>and <lb/>its <lb/>harmonization with other Articles of the Constitution, <lb/>especially Articles 19(1)(a), 21 &amp; 22. In that context, the <lb/>decision in &quot;Sharma&quot; (supra) came up for consideration. <lb/>One of the questions that arose in Sharma&apos;s case was the <lb/>impact of Articles 19(1)(a) and 21 on the provisions <lb/>contained in the latter part of Article 194(3). The majority <lb/>view was that the privilege in question was subsisting at <lb/>the relevant time and must, therefore, deemed to be <lb/>included under the latter part of Article 194(3). It was held <lb/>that Article 19(1)(a) did not apply under the rule of <lb/>harmonious construction, where Article 19(1)(a) was in <lb/>direct conflict with Article 194(3). The particular provision <lb/>in the latter Article would prevail over the general <lb/>provision contained in the former. It was further held that <lb/>though Article 21 applied, it had not been contravened. <lb/>The minority view, on the other hand, held that the <lb/>privilege in question had not been established; even <lb/>assuming the same was established and it was to be <lb/>included in the latter part of Article 194(3), yet it must be <lb/></body>

			<body>controlled by Article 19(1)(a) on the ground that <lb/>Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Part III of the <lb/>Constitution were of paramount importance and must <lb/>prevail over a provision like the one contained in Article <lb/>194(3) which may be inconsistent with them. The majority <lb/>decision also commented on the decision in Gunupati <lb/>Keshavram Reddy Vs. Nafisul Hasan &amp; the State of <lb/>U.P. 17 and observed that the said decision was based <lb/>entirely on a concession and could not, therefore, be <lb/>deemed to be a considered decision of this Court. <lb/>52. The decision in Keshavram Reddy (supra) dealt with the <lb/>applicability of Article 22(2) to a case falling under the <lb/>latter part of Article 194(3). It is worth noting that the <lb/>minority opinion of Sharma treated Keshavram Reddy, <lb/>as expressing a considered opinion, which was binding on <lb/>the Court. In Keshav Singh it was opined that in <lb/>Sharma&apos;s case, the majority decision held in terms that <lb/>Article 21 was applicable to the contents of Article 194(3), <lb/>but on merits, it came to the conclusion that the alleged <lb/></body>

			<body>contravention had not been proved. Commenting on the <lb/>minority view it was opined that it was unnecessary to <lb/>consider whether Article 21 as such applied because the <lb/>said view treated all the Fundamental Rights guaranteed <lb/>by Part III as paramount, and therefore, each one of them <lb/>could control the provisions of Article 194(3). <lb/>53. At that juncture, the Bench stated that in the case of <lb/>Sharma, contentions urged by the petitioner did not raise <lb/>a general issue as to the relevance and applicability of all <lb/>the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III at all. The <lb/>contravention of only two Articles was pleaded and they <lb/>were Articles 19(1)(a) and 21. Strictly speaking, it was, <lb/>therefore, unnecessary to consider the larger issue as to <lb/>whether the latter part of Article 194(3) was subject to the <lb/>fundamental rights in general, and indeed, even on the <lb/>majority view it could not be said that the said view <lb/>excluded the application of all fundamental rights, for the <lb/>obvious and simple reason that Article 21 was held to be <lb/>applicable and the merits of the petitioner&apos;s arguments <lb/>about its alleged contravention in his case were examined <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 58 <lb/></note>

			<page> 59 <lb/></page>

			<body>and rejected. Therefore, it was not right to read the <lb/>majority decision as laying down a general proposition that <lb/>whenever there is a conflict between the provisions of the <lb/>latter part of Article 194(3) and any of the provisions of the <lb/>fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III, the latter must <lb/>always yield to the former. It was further observed that <lb/>the majority decision had incidentally commented on the <lb/>decision in Keshavram Reddy&apos;s case (supra). Apart from <lb/>that there was no controversy about the applicability of <lb/>Article 22 in that case, and, therefore, the comment made <lb/>by the majority judgment on the earlier decision was partly <lb/>not accurate. Their Lordships adverted to the facts in <lb/>Sharma&apos;s case wherein the majority judgment had <lb/>observed that it &quot;proceeded entirely on a concession of <lb/>counsel and cannot be regarded as a considered opinion <lb/>on the subject.&quot; After so stating, the Bench opined thus: <lb/>&quot;…There is no doubt that the first part of this <lb/>comment is not accurate. A concession was made by <lb/>the Attorney-General not on a point of law which was <lb/>decided by the Court, but on a point of fact; and so, <lb/>this part of the comment cannot strictly be said to be <lb/>justified. <lb/>It is, however, true that there is no <lb/>discussion about the merits of the contention raised <lb/>on behalf of Mr. Mistry and to that extent, it may have <lb/>been permissible to the majority judgment to say that <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 59 <lb/></note>

			<page> 60 <lb/></page>

			<body>it was not a considered opinion of the Court. But, as <lb/>we have already pointed out, it was hardly necessary <lb/>for the majority decision to deal with the point <lb/>pertaining to the applicability of Article 22(2), <lb/>because that point did not arise in the proceedings <lb/>before the Court in Pandit Sharma&apos;s case. That is why <lb/>we wish to make it clear that the obiter observations <lb/>made in the majority judgment about the validity or <lb/>correctness of the earlier decision of this Court in <lb/>Gunupati Keshavram Reddy&apos;s case should not be <lb/>taken as having decided the point in question. In <lb/>other words, the question as to whether Article 22(2) <lb/>would apply to such a case may have to be <lb/>considered by this Court if and when it becomes <lb/>necessary to do so.&quot; <lb/>54. From the aforesaid decision it is clear that while exercising <lb/>jurisdiction under Article 143(1) of the Constitution this <lb/>Court can look into an earlier decision for the purpose of <lb/>whether the contentions urged in the previous decision did <lb/>raise a general issue or not; whether it was necessary to <lb/>consider the larger issue that did not arise; and whether a <lb/>general proposition had been laid down. It has also been <lb/>stated that where no controversy arose with regard to <lb/>applicability of a particular facet of constitutional law, the <lb/>comments made in a decision could be treated as not <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 60 <lb/></note>

			<page> 61 <lb/></page>

			<body>accurate; and further it could be opined that in an earlier <lb/>judgment there are certain obiter observations. <lb/>55. Thus, in Keshav Singh, a seven-Judge Bench, while <lb/>entertaining a reference under Article 143(1), dealt with a <lb/>previous decision in respect of its interpretation involving a <lb/>constitutional principle in respect of certain Articles, and <lb/>proceeded to opine that the view expressed in Sharma&apos;s <lb/>case, in relation to a proposition laid down in Keshavram <lb/>Reddy&apos;s case, was inaccurate. <lb/>56. At this stage, it is worthy to refer to Supreme Court <lb/>Advocates-on-Record Association and Ors. Vs. Union <lb/>of India 18 . J.S. Verma, J., (as his Lordship then was) <lb/>speaking for the majority, apart from other conclusions <lb/>relating to appointment of Judges and the Chief Justices, <lb/>while dealing with transfer, expressed thus: <lb/></body>

			<body>&quot;(8) <lb/>Consent of the transferred Judge/Chief <lb/>Justice is not required for either the first or any <lb/>subsequent transfer from one High Court to another. <lb/>(9) <lb/>Any transfer made on the recommendation <lb/>of the Chief Justice of India is not to be deemed to be <lb/>punitive, and such transfer is not justiciable on any <lb/>ground. <lb/>(10) <lb/>In making all appointments and transfers, <lb/>the norms indicated must be followed. However, the <lb/>same do not confer any justiciable right in anyone. <lb/>(11) <lb/>Only limited judicial review on the grounds <lb/>specified earlier is available in matters of <lb/>appointments and transfers.&quot; <lb/>As far as the ground of limited judicial review is concerned the <lb/>majority opined thus: <lb/>&quot;481. These guidelines in the form of norms are not <lb/>to be construed as conferring any justiciable right in <lb/>the transferred Judge. Apart from the constitutional <lb/>requirement of a transfer being made only on the <lb/>recommendation of the Chief Justice of India, the <lb/>issue of transfer is not justiciable on any other <lb/>ground, including the reasons for the transfer or their <lb/>sufficiency. The opinion of the Chief Justice of India <lb/>formed in the manner indicated is sufficient safeguard <lb/>and protection against any arbitrariness or bias, as <lb/>well as any erosion of the independence of the <lb/>judiciary. <lb/>482. …Except on the ground of want of consultation <lb/>with the named constitutional functionaries or lack of <lb/>any condition of eligibility in the case of an <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 62<lb/></note>

			<page> 63 <lb/></page>

			<body>appointment, or of a transfer being made without the <lb/>recommendation of the Chief Justice of India, these <lb/>matters are not justiciable on any other ground, <lb/>including that of bias, which in any case is excluded <lb/>by the element of plurality in the process of decision-<lb/>making.&quot; <lb/>57. In Special Reference No. 1 of 1998, <lb/>(commonly <lb/>referred as the &quot;Second Judges Case&quot;), question No. 2 <lb/>reads as follows: <lb/>&quot;(2) Whether the transfer of Judges is judicially <lb/>reviewable in the light of the observation of the <lb/>Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgment that &apos;such <lb/>transfer is not justiciable on any ground&apos; and its <lb/>further observation that limited judicial review is <lb/>available in matters of transfer, and the extent and <lb/>scope of judicial review.&quot; <lb/>While answering the same, the Bench opined thus: <lb/>&quot;37. It is to our mind imperative, given the gravity <lb/>involved in transferring High Court Judges, that the <lb/>Chief Justice of India should obtain the views of the <lb/>Chief Justice of the High Court from which the <lb/>proposed transfer is to be effected as also the Chief <lb/>Justice of the High Court to which the transfer is to be <lb/>effected. This is in accord with the majority judgment <lb/>in the Second Judges case which postulates <lb/>consultation with the Chief Justice of another High <lb/>Court. The Chief Justice of India should also take into <lb/>account the views of one or more Supreme Court <lb/>Judges who are in a position to provide material which <lb/>would assist in the process of deciding whether or not <lb/>a proposed transfer should take place. These views <lb/>should be expressed in writing and should be <lb/>considered by the Chief Justice of India and the four <lb/>seniormost puisne Judges of the Supreme Court. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 63<lb/></note>

			<page> 64 <lb/></page>

			<body>These views and those of each of the four seniormost <lb/>puisne Judges should be conveyed to the Government <lb/>of India along with the proposal of transfer. Unless the <lb/>decision to transfer has been taken in the manner <lb/>aforestated, it is not decisive and does not bind the <lb/>Government of India.&quot; <lb/>In the conclusion their Lordships clearly state as follows: <lb/>&quot;1. The expression &quot;consultation with the Chief Justice <lb/>of India&quot; in Articles 217(1) and 222(1) of the <lb/>Constitution of India requires consultation with a <lb/>plurality of Judges in the formation of the opinion of <lb/>the Chief Justice of India. The sole individual opinion <lb/>of the Chief Justice of India does not constitute <lb/>&quot;consultation&quot; within the meaning of the said articles. <lb/>2. The transfer of puisne Judges is judicially <lb/>reviewable <lb/>only <lb/>to <lb/>this <lb/>extent: <lb/>that <lb/>the <lb/>recommendation that has been made by the Chief <lb/>Justice of India in this behalf has not been made in <lb/>consultation with the four seniormost puisne Judges of <lb/>the Supreme Court and/or that the views of the Chief <lb/>Justice of the High Court from which the transfer is to <lb/>be effected and of the Chief Justice of the High Court <lb/>to which the transfer is to be effected have not been <lb/>obtained.&quot; <lb/>58. From the aforesaid, it is demonstrable that while <lb/>entertaining the reference under Article 143(1), this Court <lb/>had analysed the principles enunciated in the earlier <lb/>judgment and also made certain modifications. The said <lb/>modifications may be stated as one of the mode or method <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 64 <lb/></note>

			<page> 65 <lb/></page>

			<body>of inclusion by way of modification without changing the <lb/>ratio decidendi. For the purpose of validity of a reference, <lb/>suffice it to say, dwelling upon an earlier judgment is <lb/>permissible. That apart, one cannot be oblivious of the fact <lb/>that the scope of limited judicial review, in the Second <lb/>Judges Case, which otherwise is quite restricted, was <lb/>slightly expanded in the Court&apos;s opinion to the Presidential <lb/>reference. <lb/>59. It is of some interest to note that almost every reference, <lb/>filed under Article 143(1), has witnessed challenge as to its <lb/>maintainability on one ground or the other, but all the <lb/>same, the references have been answered, except in Dr. <lb/>M. Ismail Faruqui &amp; Ors. (supra), which was returned <lb/>unanswered, mainly on the ground that the reference did <lb/>not serve a constitutional purpose. <lb/>60. From the aforesaid analysis, it is quite vivid that this Court <lb/>would respectfully decline to answer a reference if it is <lb/>improper, inadvisable and undesirable; or the questions <lb/>formulated have purely socio-economic or political <lb/>reasons, which have no relation whatsoever with any of the <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 65 <lb/></note>

			<page> 66 <lb/></page>

			<body>provisions of the Constitution or otherwise are of no <lb/>constitutional significance; or <lb/>are incapable of being <lb/>answered; or would not subserve any purpose; or there is <lb/>authoritative pronouncement of this Court which <lb/>has <lb/>already decided the question referred. <lb/>61. In the case at hand, it is to be scrutinized whether the 2G <lb/>Case is a decision which has dealt with and decided the <lb/>controversy encapsulated in question No. 1 or meets any <lb/>of the criteria mentioned above. As we perceive, the <lb/>question involves interpretation of a constitutional <lb/>principle inherent under Article 14 of the Constitution and <lb/>it is of great public importance as it deals with <lb/>allocation/alienation/disposal/ <lb/>distribution <lb/>of <lb/>natural <lb/>resources. Besides, the question whether the 2G Case is <lb/>on authoritative pronouncement in that regard, has to be <lb/>looked into and only then an opinion can be expressed. <lb/>For the said purpose all other impediments do not <lb/>remotely come into play in the present Reference. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 66 <lb/></note>

			<page> 67 <lb/></page>

			<body>62. We are, therefore, of the view that as long as the decision <lb/>with respect to the allocation of spectrum licenses is <lb/>untouched, this Court is within its jurisdiction to evaluate <lb/>and clarify the ratio of the judgment in the 2G Case. For <lb/>the purpose of this stage of argumentation, it needs little <lb/>emphasis, that we have the jurisdiction to clarify the ratio <lb/>of the judgment in 2G Case, irrespective of whether we <lb/>actually choose to do so or not. Therefore, the fact that <lb/>this Reference may require us to say something different <lb/>to what has been enunciated in the 2G Case as a <lb/>proposition of law, cannot strike at the root of the <lb/>maintainability of the Reference. Consequently, we reject <lb/>the preliminary objection and hold that this Reference is <lb/>maintainable, notwithstanding its effect on the ratio of the <lb/>2G Case, as long as the decision in that case qua lis inter <lb/>partes is left unaffected. <lb/>ON MERITS : <lb/>63. This leads us to the merits of the controversy disclosed in <lb/>the questions framed in the Reference for our advisory <lb/>opinion. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 67 <lb/></note>

			<page> 68 <lb/></page>

			<body>64. As already pointed out, the judgment in the 2G Case <lb/>triggered doubts about the validity of methods other than <lb/>&apos;auction&apos; for disposal of natural resources which, ultimately <lb/>led to the filing of the present Reference. Therefore, <lb/>before we proceed to answer question No.1, it is <lb/>imperative to understand what has been precisely stated <lb/>in the 2G Case and decipher the law declared in that case. <lb/>65. All the counsel agreed that paragraphs 94 to 96 in the said <lb/>decision are the repository of the ratio vis-à-vis disposal of <lb/>natural resources in the 2G Case. On the one hand it was <lb/>argued that these paragraphs lay down, as a proposition of <lb/>law, that all natural resources across all sectors, and in all <lb/>circumstances are to be disposed of by way of public <lb/>auction, and on the other, it was urged that the <lb/>observations therein were made only qua spectrum. <lb/>Before examining the strength of the rival stands, we may <lb/>briefly recapitulate the principles that govern the <lb/>determination of the &apos;law declared&apos; by a judgment and its <lb/>true ratio. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 68 <lb/></note>

			<page> 69 <lb/></page>

			<body>66. Article 141 of the Constitution lays down that the &apos;law <lb/>declared&apos; by the Supreme Court is binding upon all the <lb/>courts within the territory of India. The &apos;law declared&apos; has <lb/>to be construed as a principle of law that emanates from a <lb/>judgment, or an interpretation of a law or judgment by the <lb/>Supreme Court, upon which, the case is decided. [See: <lb/>Fida Hussain &amp; Ors. Vs. Moradabad Development <lb/>Authority &amp; Anr. 19 ]. Hence, it flows from the above that <lb/>the &apos;law declared&apos; is the principle culled out on the reading <lb/>of a judgment as a whole in light of the questions raised, <lb/>upon which the case is decided. [Also see: Ambica <lb/>Quarry Works Vs. State of Gujarat &amp; Ors. 20 and <lb/>Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Sun Engineering <lb/>Works (P) Ltd. 21 ]. In other words, the &apos;law declared&apos; in a <lb/>judgment, which is binding upon courts, is the ratio <lb/>decidendi of the judgment. It is the essence of a decision <lb/>and the principle upon which, the case is decided, which <lb/>has to be ascertained in relation to the subject-matter of <lb/>the decision. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">19 (2011) 12 SCC 615 <lb/>20 (1987) 1 SCC 213 <lb/>21 (1992) 4 SCC 363 <lb/></note>

			<body>67. Each case entails a different set of facts and a decision is a <lb/>precedent on its own facts; not everything said by a Judge <lb/>while giving a judgment can be ascribed precedental <lb/>value. The essence of a decision that binds the parties to <lb/>the case is the principle upon which the case is decided <lb/>and for this reason, it is important to analyse a decision <lb/>and cull out from it, the ratio decidendi. In the matter of <lb/>applying precedents, the erudite Justice Benjamin Cardozo <lb/>in &quot;The Nature of a Judicial Process&quot;, had said that &quot;if <lb/>the judge is to pronounce it wisely, some principles of <lb/>selection there must be to guide him along all potential <lb/>judgments that compete for recognition&quot; and &quot;almost <lb/>invariably his first step is to examine and compare them;&quot; <lb/>&quot;it is a process of search, comparison and little more&quot; and <lb/>ought not to be akin to matching &quot;the colors of the case at <lb/>hand against the colors of many sample cases&quot; because in <lb/>that case &quot;the man who had the best card index of the <lb/>cases would also be the wisest judge&quot;. Warning against <lb/>comparing precedents with matching colours of one case <lb/>with another, he summarized the process, in case the <lb/>colours don&apos;t match, in the following wise words:-<lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 70 <lb/></note>

			<page>71 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;It is when the colors do not match, when the <lb/>references in the index fail, when there is no decisive <lb/>precedent, that the serious business of the judge <lb/>begins. He must then fashion law for the litigants <lb/>before him. In fashioning it for them, he will be <lb/>fashioning it for others. The classic statement is <lb/>Bacon&apos;s: &quot;For many times, the things deduced to <lb/>judgment may be meum and tuum, when the reason <lb/>and consequence thereof may trench to point of <lb/>estate. The sentence of today will make the right and <lb/>wrong of tomorrow.&quot; <lb/>68. With reference to the precedential value of decisions, in <lb/>State of Orissa &amp; Ors. Vs. Md. Illiyas 22 this Court <lb/>observed: <lb/>&quot;…According to the well-settled theory of precedents, <lb/>every decision contains three basic postulates: (i) <lb/>findings of material facts, direct and inferential. An <lb/>inferential finding of facts is the inference which the <lb/>Judge draws from the direct, or perceptible facts; (ii) <lb/>statements of the principles of law applicable to the <lb/>legal problems disclosed by the facts; and (iii) <lb/>judgment based on the combined effect of the above. <lb/>A decision is an authority for what it actually decides. <lb/>What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not <lb/>every observation found therein nor what logically <lb/>flows from the various observations made in the <lb/>judgment…&quot; <lb/>69. Recently, in Union of India Vs. Amrit Lal Manchanda &amp; <lb/>Anr. 23 , this Court has observed as follows: <lb/></body>
			
			<note place='footnote'>22 (2006) 1 SCC 275 <lb/>23 (2004) 3 SCC 75 <lb/></note>

			<note place='footnote'>page 71 <lb/></note>

			<page> 72 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;…Observations of courts are neither to be read as <lb/>Euclid&apos;s theorems nor as provisions of the statute and <lb/>that too taken out of their context. These <lb/>observations must be read in the context in which <lb/>they appear to have been stated. Judgments of courts <lb/>are not to be construed as statutes. To interpret <lb/>words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may <lb/>become necessary for Judges to embark into lengthy <lb/>discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and <lb/>not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not <lb/>interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; <lb/>their words are not to be interpreted as statutes.&quot; <lb/>70. It is also important to read a judgment as a whole keeping <lb/>in mind that it is not an abstract academic discourse with <lb/>universal applicability, but heavily grounded in the facts <lb/>and circumstances of the case. Every part of a judgment is <lb/>intricately linked to others constituting a larger whole and <lb/>thus, must be read keeping the logical thread intact. In this <lb/>regard, in Islamic Academy of Education &amp; Anr. Vs. <lb/>State of Karnataka &amp; Ors. 24 , the Court made the <lb/>following observations: <lb/>&quot;The ratio decidendi of a judgment has to be found <lb/>out only on reading the entire judgment. In fact, the <lb/>ratio of the judgment is what is set out in the <lb/>judgment itself. The answer to the question would <lb/>necessarily have to be read in the context of what is <lb/>set out in the judgment and not in isolation. In case of <lb/>any doubt as regards any observations, reasons and <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 72<lb/></note>

			<page> 73 <lb/></page>

			<body>principles, the other part of the judgment has to be <lb/>looked into. By reading a line here and there from the <lb/>judgment, one cannot find out the entire ratio <lb/>decidendi of the judgment.&quot; <lb/>71. The ratio of the 2G Case must, therefore, be understood <lb/>and appreciated in light of the above guiding principles. <lb/>72. In the 2G Case, the Bench framed five questions. <lb/>Questions No. (ii) and (v) pertain to the factual matrix and <lb/>are not relevant for settling the controversy at hand. The <lb/>remaining three questions are reproduced below: <lb/>&quot;(i) Whether the Government has the right to <lb/>alienate, <lb/>transfer <lb/>or <lb/>distribute <lb/>natural <lb/>resources/national assets otherwise than by following <lb/>a fair and transparent method consistent with the <lb/>fundamentals of the equality clause enshrined in the <lb/>Constitution? <lb/>(iii) <lb/>Whether the exercise undertaken by DoT <lb/>from September 2007 to March 2008 for grant of UAS <lb/>licences to the private respondents in terms of the <lb/>recommendations made by TRAI is vitiated due to <lb/>arbitrariness and mala fides and is contrary to public <lb/>interest? <lb/>(iv) Whether the policy of first-come-first-served <lb/>followed by DoT for grant of licences is ultra vires the <lb/>provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution and <lb/>whether the said policy was arbitrarily changed by the <lb/>Minister <lb/>of <lb/>Communications <lb/>and <lb/>Information <lb/>Technology (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Minister of <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 73 <lb/></note>

			<page>74 <lb/></page>

			<body>Communications and Information Technology&quot;), <lb/>without consulting TRAI, with a view to favour some of <lb/>the applicants?&quot; <lb/>73. While dealing with question No.(i), the Court observed that <lb/>the State is empowered to distribute natural resources as <lb/>they constitute public property/national assets. Thereafter, <lb/>the Bench observed as follows: <lb/>&quot;75.…while distributing natural resources the State is <lb/>bound to act in consonance with the principles of <lb/>equality and public trust and ensure that no action is <lb/>taken which may be detrimental to public interest. <lb/>Like any other State action, constitutionalism must be <lb/>reflected at every stage of the distribution of natural <lb/>resources. In Article 39(b) of the Constitution it has <lb/>been provided that the ownership and control of the <lb/>material resources of the community should be so <lb/>distributed so as to best subserve the common good, <lb/>but no comprehensive legislation has been enacted to <lb/>generally define natural resources and a framework <lb/>for their protection...&quot; <lb/>74. The learned Judges adverted to the &apos;public trust doctrine&apos; <lb/>as enunciated in The Illinois Central Railroad Co. Vs. <lb/>The People of the State of Illinois 25 ; M.C. Mehta Vs. <lb/>Kamal Nath &amp; Ors. 26 ; Jamshed Hormusji Wadia Vs. <lb/>Board of Trustees, Port of Mumbai &amp; Anr. 27 ; <lb/>Intellectuals Forum, Tirupathi Vs.

			<body>Vs. Minguel Martins &amp; Ors. 29 and Reliance Natural <lb/>Resources Limited Vs. Reliance Industries Limited 30 <lb/>and held: <lb/>&quot;85. As natural resources are public goods, the <lb/>doctrine of equality, which emerges from the <lb/>concepts of justice and fairness, must guide the State <lb/>in determining the actual mechanism for distribution <lb/>of natural resources. In this regard, the doctrine of <lb/>equality has two aspects: first, it regulates the rights <lb/>and obligations of the State vis-à-vis its people and <lb/>demands that the people be granted equitable access <lb/>to natural resources and/or its products and that they <lb/>are adequately compensated for the transfer of the <lb/>resource to the private domain; and second, it <lb/>regulates the rights and obligations of the State vis-à-<lb/>vis private parties seeking to acquire/use the resource <lb/>and demands that the procedure adopted for <lb/>distribution is just, non-arbitrary and transparent and <lb/>that it does not discriminate between similarly placed <lb/>private parties.&quot; <lb/>Referring to the decisions of this Court in Akhil Bhartiya <lb/>Upbhokta Congress Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; Ors. 31 <lb/>and Sachidanand Pandey &amp; Anr. Vs. State of West Bengal <lb/>&amp; Ors. 32 , the Bench ultimately concluded thus: <lb/>&quot;89. In conclusion, we hold that the State is the legal <lb/>owner of the natural resources as a trustee of the <lb/>people and although it is empowered to distribute the <lb/>same, the process of distribution must be guided by <lb/>the constitutional principles including the doctrine of <lb/>equality and larger public good.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>75. On a reading of the above paragraphs, it can be noticed <lb/>that the doctrine of equality; larger public good, adoption <lb/>of a transparent and fair method, opportunity of <lb/>competition; and avoidance of any occasion to scuttle the <lb/>claim of similarly situated applicants were emphasised <lb/>upon. While dealing with alienation of natural resources <lb/>like spectrum, it was stated that it is the duty of the State <lb/>to ensure that a non-discriminatory method is adopted for <lb/>distribution and alienation which would necessarily result <lb/>in the protection of national/public interest. <lb/>76. Paragraphs 85 and 89, while referring to the concept of <lb/>&apos;public trust doctrine&apos;, lay emphasis on the doctrine of <lb/>equality, which has been segregated into two parts -one is <lb/>the substantive part and the other is the regulatory part. <lb/>In the regulatory facet, paragraph 85 states that the <lb/>procedure adopted for distribution should be just and non-<lb/>arbitrary and must be guided by constitutional principles <lb/>including the doctrine of equality and larger public good. <lb/>Similarly, in paragraph 89 stress has been laid on <lb/>transparency and fair opportunity of competition. It is <lb/></body>

			<body>further reiterated that the burden of the State is to ensure <lb/>that a non-discriminatory method is adopted for <lb/>distribution and alienation which would necessarily result <lb/>in the protection of national and public interest. <lb/>77. Dealing with Questions No.(iii) and (iv) in paragraphs 94 to <lb/>96 of the judgment, the Court opined as follows: <lb/>&quot;94. There is a fundamental flaw in the first-come-<lb/>first-served policy inasmuch as it involves an element <lb/>of pure chance or accident. In matters involving <lb/>award of contracts or grant of licence or permission to <lb/>use public property, the invocation of first-come-first-<lb/>served policy has inherently dangerous implications. <lb/>Any person who has access to the power corridor at <lb/>the highest or the lowest level may be able to obtain <lb/>information from the government files or the files of <lb/>the agency/instrumentality of the State that a <lb/>particular public property or asset is likely to be <lb/>disposed of or a contract is likely to be awarded or a <lb/>licence or permission is likely to be given, he would <lb/>immediately make an application and would become <lb/>entitled to stand first in the queue at the cost of all <lb/>others who may have a better claim. <lb/>95. This Court has repeatedly held that wherever a <lb/>contract is to be awarded or a licence is to be given, <lb/>the public authority must adopt a transparent and fair <lb/>method for making selections so that all eligible <lb/>persons get a fair opportunity of competition. To put it <lb/>differently, <lb/>the <lb/>State <lb/>and <lb/>its <lb/>agencies/ <lb/>instrumentalities must always adopt a rational <lb/>method for disposal of public property and no attempt <lb/>should be made to scuttle the claim of worthy <lb/>applicants. When it comes to alienation of scarce <lb/>natural resources like spectrum, etc. it is the burden <lb/>of the State to ensure that a non-discriminatory <lb/>method is adopted for distribution and alienation, <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 77 <lb/></note>

			<page> 78 <lb/></page>

			<body>which would necessarily result in protection of <lb/>national/public interest. <lb/>96. In our view, a duly publicised auction conducted <lb/>fairly and impartially is perhaps the best method for <lb/>discharging this burden and the methods like first-<lb/>come-first-served when used for alienation of natural <lb/>resources/public property are likely to be misused by <lb/>unscrupulous people who are only interested in <lb/>garnering maximum financial benefit and have no <lb/>respect for the constitutional ethos and values. In <lb/>other words, while transferring or alienating the <lb/>natural resources, the State is duty-bound to adopt <lb/>the method of auction by giving wide publicity so that <lb/>all eligible persons can participate in the process.&quot; <lb/>78. Our reading of these paragraphs suggests that the Court <lb/>was not considering the case of auction in general, but <lb/>specifically evaluating the validity of those methods <lb/>adopted in the distribution of spectrum from September <lb/>2007 to March 2008. It is also pertinent to note that <lb/>reference to auction is made in the subsequent paragraph <lb/>(96) with the rider &apos;perhaps&apos;. It has been observed that &quot;a <lb/>duly publicized auction conducted fairly and impartially is <lb/>perhaps the best method for discharging this burden.&quot; We <lb/>are conscious that a judgment is not to be read as a <lb/>statute, but at the same time, we cannot be oblivious to <lb/>the fact that when it is argued with vehemence that the <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 78 <lb/></note>

			<page> 79 <lb/></page>

			<body>judgment lays down auction as a constitutional principle, <lb/>the word &quot;perhaps&quot; gains significance. This suggests that <lb/>the recommendation of auction for alienation of natural <lb/>resources was never intended to be taken as an absolute <lb/>or blanket statement applicable across all natural <lb/>resources, but simply a conclusion made at first blush over <lb/>the attractiveness of a method like auction in disposal of <lb/>natural resources. <lb/>The choice of the word &apos;perhaps&apos; <lb/>suggests that the learned Judges considered situations <lb/>requiring a method other than auction as conceivable and <lb/>desirable. <lb/>79. Further, the final conclusions summarized in paragraph <lb/>102 of the judgment (SCC) make no mention about auction <lb/>being the only permissible and intra vires method for <lb/>disposal of natural resources; the findings are limited to <lb/>the case of spectrum. In case the Court had actually <lb/>enunciated, as a proposition of law, that auction is the only <lb/>permissible method or mode for alienation/allotment of <lb/>natural resources, the same would have found a mention <lb/>in the summary at the end of the judgment. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 79 <lb/></note>

			<page> 80 <lb/></page>

			<body>80. Moreover, if the judgment is to be read as holding auction <lb/>as the only permissible means of disposal of all natural <lb/>resources, it would lead to the quashing of a large number <lb/>of laws that prescribe methods other than auction, e.g., the <lb/>MMRD Act. While dealing with the merits of the Reference, <lb/>at a later stage, we will discuss whether or not auction can <lb/>be a constitutional mandate under Article 14 of the <lb/>Constitution, but for the present, it would suffice to say <lb/>that no court would ever implicitly, indirectly, or by <lb/>inference, hold a range of laws as ultra vires the <lb/>Constitution, without allowing every law to be tested on its <lb/>merits. <lb/>One of the most profound tenets of <lb/>constitutionalism is the presumption of constitutionality <lb/>assigned to each legislation enacted. We find that the 2G <lb/>Case does not even consider a plethora of laws and <lb/>judgments that prescribe methods, other than auction, for <lb/>dispensation of natural resources; something that it would <lb/>have done, in case, it intended to make an assertion as <lb/>wide as applying auction to all natural resources. <lb/>Therefore, we are convinced that the observations in Paras <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 80 <lb/></note>

			<page> 81 <lb/></page>

			<body>94 to 96 could not apply beyond the specific case of <lb/>spectrum, which according to the law declared in the 2G <lb/>Case, is to be alienated only by auction and no other <lb/>method. <lb/>81. Thus, having come to the conclusion that the 2G Case <lb/>does not deal with modes of allocation for natural <lb/>resources, other than spectrum, we shall now proceed to <lb/>answer the first question of the Reference pertaining to <lb/>other natural resources, as the question subsumes the <lb/>essence of the entire reference, particularly the set of first <lb/>five questions. <lb/>82. The President seeks this Court&apos;s opinion on the limited <lb/>point of permissibility of methods other than auction for <lb/>alienation of natural resources, other than spectrum. The <lb/>question also harbours several concepts, which were <lb/>argued before us through the hearing of the Reference, <lb/>that require to be answered in order to derive a <lb/>comprehensive answer to the parent question. Are some <lb/></body>

			<body>methods ultra vires and others intra vires the Constitution <lb/>of India, especially Article 14? Can disposal through the <lb/>method of auction be elevated to a Constitutional <lb/>principle? Is this Court entitled to direct the executive to <lb/>adopt a certain method because it is the &apos;best&apos; method? If <lb/>not, to what extent can the executive deviate from such <lb/>&apos;best&apos; method? An answer to these issues, in turn, will give <lb/>an answer to the first question which, as noted above, will <lb/>answer the Presidential Reference. <lb/>83. Before proceeding to answer these questions, we would <lb/>like to dispose of a couple of minor objections. The first <lb/>pertained to the classification of resources made in the 2G <lb/>Case. Learned counsel appearing for CPIL argued that all <lb/>that the judgment in the 2G Case has done is to carve out <lb/>a special category of cases where public auction is the only <lb/>legally sustainable method of alienation viz. natural <lb/>resources that are scarce, valuable and are allotted to <lb/>private entities for commercial exploitation. The learned <lb/>Attorney General, however, contested this claim and <lb/>argued that no such proposition was laid down in the 2G <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 82<lb/></note>

			<page> 83 <lb/></page>

			<body>judgment. He pointed out that the words &quot;commercial <lb/>exploitation&quot; were not even used anywhere in the <lb/>judgment except in an extract from another judgment in a <lb/>different context. We agree that the judgment itself does <lb/>not carve out any special case for scarce natural resources <lb/>only meant for commercial exploitation. However, we feel, <lb/>despite that, in this Reference, CPIL is not barred from <lb/>making a submission drawing a distinction between natural <lb/>resources meant for commercial exploitation and those <lb/>meant for other purposes. This Court has the jurisdiction <lb/>to classify the subject matter of a reference, if a genuine <lb/>case for it exists. <lb/>84. Mr. Shanti Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel, in support <lb/>of his stand that the first question of the Reference <lb/>must be answered in a way so as to allow auction <lb/>as the only mode for the disposal of natural resources, <lb/>submitted that a combined reading of Article 14, which <lb/>dictates non-arbitrariness in State action and equal <lb/>opportunity to those similarly placed; Article 39(b) which is <lb/>a Directive Principle of State Policy dealing with <lb/>distribution of natural resources for the common good of <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 83 <lb/></note>

			<page> 84 <lb/></page>

			<body>the people; and the &quot;trusteeship&quot; principle found in the <lb/>Preamble which mandates that the State holds all natural <lb/>resources in the capacity of a trustee, on behalf of the <lb/>people, would make auction a constitutional mandate <lb/>under Article 14 of the Constitution. It is imperative, <lb/>therefore, that we evaluate each of these principles before <lb/>coming to any conclusion on the constitutional verdict on <lb/>auction. <lb/>85. In the 2G Case, two concepts namely, &quot;public trust <lb/>doctrine&quot; and &quot;trusteeship&quot; have been adverted to, which <lb/>were also relied upon by learned counsel for CPIL, in <lb/>defence of the argument that the State holds natural <lb/>resources in a fiduciary relationship with the people. As far <lb/>as &quot;trusteeship&quot; is concerned, there is no cavil that the <lb/>State holds all natural resources as a trustee of the public <lb/>and must deal with them in a manner that is consistent <lb/>with the nature of such a trust. However, what was <lb/>asserted on behalf of CPIL was that all natural resources <lb/>fall within the domain of the &quot;public trust doctrine&quot;, and <lb/>therefore, there is an obligation on the Government to <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 84 <lb/></note>

			<page> 85 <lb/></page>

			<body>ensure that their transfer or alienation for commercial <lb/>exploitation is in a fair and transparent manner and only in <lb/>pursuit of public good. The learned Attorney General on <lb/>the other hand, zealously urged that the subject matter of <lb/>the doctrine and the nature of restrictions, it imposes, are <lb/>of limited scope; that the applicability of the doctrine is <lb/>restricted to certain common properties pertaining to the <lb/>environment, like rivers, seashores, forest and air, meant <lb/>for free and unimpeded use of the general public and the <lb/>restrictions it imposes is in the term of a complete <lb/>embargo on any alienation of such resources, for private <lb/>ownership. According to him, the extension of the public <lb/>trust doctrine to all natural resources has led to a <lb/>considerable confusion and needs to be clarified. <lb/>86. The doctrine of public trust enunciated more thoroughly by <lb/>the United States Supreme Court in Illinois (supra) was <lb/>introduced to Indian environmental jurisprudence by this <lb/>Court in M.C. Mehta (supra). Speaking for the majority, <lb/>Kuldip Singh, J. observed as follows : <lb/>&quot;25. The Public Trust Doctrine primarily rests on the <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 85 <lb/></note>

			<page> 86 <lb/></page>

			<body>principle that certain resources like air, sea, waters and <lb/>the forests have such a great importance to the people <lb/>as a whole that it would be wholly unjustified to make <lb/>them a subject of private ownership. The said resources <lb/>being a gift of nature, they should be made freely <lb/>available to everyone irrespective of the status in life. <lb/>The doctrine enjoins upon the Government to protect <lb/>the resources for the enjoyment of the general public <lb/>rather than to permit their use for private ownership or <lb/>commercial purposes. According to Professor Sax the <lb/>Public Trust Doctrine imposes the following restrictions <lb/>on governmental authority: <lb/>&apos;Three types of restrictions on governmental <lb/>authority are often thought to be imposed by <lb/>the public trust: first, the property subject to <lb/>the trust must not only be used for a public <lb/>purpose, but it must be held available for use <lb/>by the general public; second, the property <lb/>may not be sold, even for a fair cash <lb/>equivalent; and third the property must be <lb/>maintained for particular types of uses&apos;.&quot; <lb/>The learned Judge further observed:-<lb/>&quot;34. Our legal system -based on English common law <lb/>-includes the public trust doctrine as part of its <lb/>jurisprudence. The State is the trustee of all natural <lb/>resources which are by nature meant for public use and <lb/>enjoyment. Public at large is the beneficiary of the sea-<lb/>shore, running waters, airs, forests and ecologically <lb/>fragile lands. The State as a trustee is under a legal duty <lb/>to protect the natural resources. These resources meant <lb/>for public use cannot be converted into private <lb/>ownership.&quot; <lb/>87. The judgment in Kamal Nath&apos;s case (supra) was <lb/>explained in Intellectuals Forum (supra). Reiterating <lb/>that the State is the trustee of all natural resources which <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 86 <lb/></note>

			<page> 87 <lb/></page>

			<body>are by nature meant for public use and enjoyment, the <lb/>Court observed thus: <lb/>&quot;76. The Supreme Court of California, in National <lb/>Audubon Society Vs. Superior Court of Alpine <lb/>Country also known as Mono Lake case summed up <lb/>the substance of the doctrine. The Court said: <lb/>&quot;Thus the public trust is more than an <lb/>affirmation of State power to use public <lb/>property for public purposes. It is an <lb/>affirmation of the duty of the State to protect <lb/>the people&apos;s common heritage of streams, <lb/>lakes, marshlands and tidelands, surrendering <lb/>the right only in those rare cases when the <lb/>abandonment of the right is consistent with <lb/>the purposes of the trust.&quot; <lb/>This is an articulation of the doctrine from the angle of <lb/>the affirmative duties of the State with regard to public <lb/>trust. Formulated from a negatory angle, the doctrine <lb/>does not exactly prohibit the alienation of the property <lb/>held as a public trust. However, when the State holds a <lb/>resource that is freely available for the use of the public, <lb/>it provides for a high degree of judicial scrutiny on any <lb/>action of the Government, no matter how consistent <lb/>with the existing legislations, that attempts to restrict <lb/>such free use. To properly scrutinise such actions of the <lb/>Government, the courts must make a distinction <lb/>between the Government&apos;s general obligation to act for <lb/>the public benefit, and the special, more demanding <lb/>obligation which it may have as a trustee of certain <lb/>public resources…&quot; <lb/>It was thus, held that when the affirmative duties are set out <lb/>from a nugatory angle, the doctrine does not exactly prohibit <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 87 <lb/></note>

			<page> 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>the alienation of property held as a public trust, but mandates a <lb/>high degree of judicial scrutiny. <lb/>88. In Fomento (supra), the Court was concerned with the <lb/>access of the public to a beach in Goa. Holding that it was <lb/>a public beach which could not be privatized or blocked <lb/>denying traditional access, this Court reiterated the public <lb/>trust doctrine as follows: <lb/>&quot;52. The matter deserves to be considered from <lb/>another angle. The public trust doctrine which has been <lb/>invoked by Ms Indira Jaising in support of her argument <lb/>that the beach in question is a public beach and the <lb/>appellants cannot privatise the same by blocking/ <lb/>obstructing traditional access available through Survey <lb/>No. 803 (new No. 246/2) is implicitly engrafted by the <lb/>State Government in Clause 4(ix) of the agreement. <lb/>That doctrine primarily rests on the principle that <lb/>certain resources like air, sea, waters and the forests <lb/>have such a great importance to the people as a whole <lb/>that it would be wholly unjustified to make them a <lb/>subject of private ownership. These resources are gift of <lb/>nature, therefore, they should be freely available to <lb/>everyone irrespective of one&apos;s status in life.&quot; <lb/>89. In Reliance Natural Resources (supra), it has been <lb/>observed that even though the doctrine of pubic trust has <lb/>been applied in cases dealing with environmental <lb/>jurisprudence, &quot;it has broader application&quot;. Referring to <lb/>Kamal Nath (supra), the Court held that it is the duty of <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 88 <lb/></note>

			<page> 89 <lb/></page>

			<body>the Government to provide complete protection to the <lb/>natural resources as a trustee of the people at large. <lb/>90. The public trust doctrine is a specific doctrine with a <lb/>particular domain and has to be applied carefully. It has <lb/>been seriously debated before us as to whether the <lb/>doctrine can be applied beyond the realm of environmental <lb/>protection. Richard J. Lazarus in his article, &quot;Changing <lb/>Conceptions of Property and Sovereignty in Natural <lb/>Resources: Questioning the Public Trust Doctrine&quot;, <lb/>while expressing scepticism over the &apos;liberation&apos; of the <lb/>doctrine, makes the following observations:-<lb/>&quot;The strength of the public trust doctrine necessarily <lb/>lies in its origins; navigable waters and submerged lands <lb/>are the focus of the doctrine, and the basic trust <lb/>interests in navigation, commerce, and fishing are the <lb/>object of its guarantee of public access. Commentators <lb/>and judges alike have made efforts to &quot;liberate&quot;, <lb/>&quot;expand&quot;, and &quot;modify&quot; the doctrine&apos;s scope yet its <lb/>basic focus remains relatively unchanged. Courts still <lb/>repeatedly return to the doctrine&apos;s historical function to <lb/>determine its present role. <lb/>When the doctrine is <lb/>expanded, more often than not the expansions require <lb/>tortured constructions of the present rather than <lb/>repudiations of the doctrine&apos;s past.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 89 <lb/></note>

			<page> 90 <lb/></page>

			<body>However, we feel that for the purpose of the present opinion, it <lb/>is not necessary to delve deep into the issue as in Intellectuals <lb/>Forum (supra), the main departure from the principle explained <lb/>by Joseph. L. Sax in his Article &quot;The Public Trust Doctrine in <lb/>Natural Resource Law: Effective Judicial Intervention&quot; is <lb/>that public trust mandates a high degree of judicial scrutiny, an <lb/>issue that we will anyway elaborately discuss while enunciating <lb/>the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution. <lb/>91. We would also like to briskly deal with a similar argument <lb/>made by Mr. Shanti Bhushan. The learned senior counsel <lb/>submitted that the repository of sovereignty in our <lb/>framework is the people of this country since the opening <lb/>words of the Constitution read &quot;We The People of India… <lb/>do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this <lb/>Constitution,&quot; and therefore the government, as the agent <lb/>of the Sovereign, the people, while alienating natural <lb/>resources, must heed to judicial care and due process. <lb/>Firstly, this Court has held in Raja Ram Pal Vs. Hon&apos;ble <lb/>Speaker, Lok Sabha &amp; Ors. 33 that the &quot;Constitution is <lb/></body>

			<body>the supreme lex in this country&quot; and &quot;all organs of the <lb/>State derive their authority, jurisdiction and powers from <lb/>the Constitution and owe allegiance to it&quot;. Further, the <lb/>notion that the Parliament is an agent of the people was <lb/>squarely rebutted in In Re: Delhi Laws Act, 1912 <lb/>(supra), where it was observed that &quot;the legislature as a <lb/>body cannot be seen to be an agency of the electorate as a <lb/>whole&quot; and &quot;acts on its own authority or power which it <lb/>derives from the Constitution&quot;. <lb/>92. In Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs. Birla Cotton, <lb/>Spinning and Weaving Mills, Delhi &amp; Anr. 34 this Court <lb/>held that &quot;the doctrine that it (the Parliament) is a <lb/>delegate of the people coloured certain American decision <lb/>does not arise here&quot; and that in fact the &quot;Parliament which <lb/>by a concentration of all the powers of legislation derived <lb/>from all the three Legislative Lists becomes the most <lb/>competent and potent legislature it is possible to erect <lb/>under our Constitution.&quot; We however, appreciate the <lb/>concern of Mr. Shanti Bhushan that the lack of any such <lb/></body>

The underlying object of Article 14 is to secure to all <lb/>persons, citizens or non-citizens, the equality of status and <lb/>opportunity referred to in the preamble to our Constitution. <lb/>The language of Article 14 is couched in negative terms <lb/>and is in form, an admonition addressed to the State.

For the first couple of decades after the establishment of <lb/>this Court, the &apos;classification&apos; test was adopted which <lb/>allowed for a classification between entities as long as it <lb/>was based on an intelligible differentia and displayed a <lb/>rational nexus with the ultimate objective of the policy. <lb/>Budhan Choudhry &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Bihar 36 referred <lb/>to in Shri Ram Krishna Dalmiya Vs. Shri Justice S.R. <lb/>Tendolkar and Ors. 37 explained it in the following terms: <lb/>&quot;It is now well established that while article 14 forbids <lb/>class legislation, it does not forbid reasonable <lb/>classification for the purposes of legislation. In order, <lb/>however, to pass the test of permissible classification <lb/>two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (i) that the <lb/>classification must be founded on an intelligible <lb/>differentia which distinguishes persons or things that <lb/></body>
			
			<note place='footnote'>ensures for the benefit of all persons, for, as a necessary result of the operation of this <lb/>Article, they all enjoy equality before the law.

			<body>are grouped together from others left out of the group <lb/>and, (ii) that that differentia must have a rational <lb/>relation to the object sought to be achieved by the <lb/>statute in question. The classification may be founded <lb/>on different bases, namely, geographical, or according <lb/>to objects or occupations or the like. What is necessary <lb/>is that there must be a nexus between the basis of <lb/>classification and the object of the Act under <lb/>consideration. It is also well established by the decisions <lb/>of this Court that article 14 condemns discrimination not <lb/>only by a substantive law but also by a law of <lb/>procedure.&quot; <lb/>96. However, after the judgment of this Court in E.P. <lb/>Royappa Vs. State of Tamil Nadu &amp; Anr 38 the <lb/>&apos;arbitrariness&apos; doctrine was introduced which dropped a <lb/>pedantic approach towards equality and held the mere <lb/>existence of arbitrariness as violative of Article 14, <lb/>however equal in its treatment. Justice Bhagwati (as his <lb/>Lordship was then) articulated the dynamic nature of <lb/>equality and borrowing from Shakespeare&apos;s Macbeth, said <lb/>that the concept must not be &quot;cribbed, cabined and <lb/>confined&quot; within doctrinaire limits: -<lb/>&quot;85. …Now, what is the content and reach of this great <lb/>equalising principle?

			<body>truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning, for to do <lb/>so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is <lb/>a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions <lb/>and it cannot be &quot;cribbed, cabined and confined&quot; within <lb/>traditional and doctrinaire limits.&quot; <lb/>His Lordship went on to explain the length and breadth of Article <lb/>14 in the following lucid words: <lb/>&quot;85… From a positivistic point of view, equality is <lb/>antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and <lb/>arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule <lb/>of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and <lb/>caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is <lb/>arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both <lb/>according to political logic and constitutional law and is <lb/>therefore violative of Article 14, and if it effects any <lb/>matter relating to public employment, it is also violative <lb/>of Article 16. Articles 14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in <lb/>State action and ensure fairness and equality of <lb/>treatment. They require that State action must be based <lb/>on valid relevant principles applicable alike to all <lb/>similarly situate and it must not be guided by any <lb/>extraneous or irrelevant considerations because that <lb/>would be denial of equality. Where the operative reason <lb/>for State action, as distinguished from motive inducing <lb/>from the antechamber of the mind, is not legitimate and <lb/>relevant but is extraneous and outside the area of <lb/>permissible considerations, it would amount to mala fide <lb/>exercise of power and that is hit by Articles 14 and 16. <lb/>Mala fide exercise of power and arbitrariness are <lb/>different lethal radiations emanating from the same <lb/>vice: in fact the latter comprehends the former. Both are <lb/>inhibited by Articles 14 and 16.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>97. Building upon his opinion delivered in Royappa&apos;s case <lb/>(supra), Bhagwati, J., held in Maneka Gandhi Vs. Union <lb/>of India &amp; Anr. 39 : <lb/>&quot;The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well <lb/>as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or <lb/>non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding <lb/>omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by <lb/>Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in <lb/>order to be in conformity with Article 14. It must be <lb/>&quot;right and just and fair&quot; and not arbitrary, fanciful or <lb/>oppressive.&quot; <lb/>98. In Ajay Hasia &amp; Ors. Vs. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi &amp; <lb/>Ors. 40 , this Court said that the &apos;arbitrariness&apos; test was lying <lb/>&quot;latent and submerged&quot; in the &quot;simple but pregnant&quot; form of <lb/>Article 14 and explained the switch from the &apos;classification&apos; <lb/>doctrine to the &apos;arbitrariness&apos; doctrine in the following words: <lb/>&quot;16…The doctrine of classification which is evolved by <lb/>the courts is not paraphrase of Article 14 nor is it the <lb/>objective and end of that article. It is merely a judicial <lb/>formula for determining whether the legislative or <lb/>executive action in question is arbitrary and therefore <lb/>constituting denial of equality. If the classification is not <lb/>reasonable and does not satisfy the two conditions <lb/>referred to above, the impugned legislative or executive <lb/>action would plainly be arbitrary and the guarantee of <lb/>equality under Article 14 would be breached. Wherever <lb/>therefore there is arbitrariness in State action whether it <lb/>be of the legislature or of the executive or of an <lb/>&apos;authority&apos; under Article 12, Article 14 immediately <lb/>springs into action and strikes down such State action. <lb/></body>

			<body>In fact, the concept of reasonableness and non-<lb/>arbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional scheme <lb/>and is a golden thread which runs through the whole of <lb/>the fabric of the Constitution.&quot; <lb/>99. Ramana Dayaram Shetty Vs. International Airport <lb/>Authority of India &amp; Ors. 41 explained the limitations of <lb/>Article 14 on the functioning of the Government as follows: -<lb/>&quot;12…It must, therefore, be taken to be the law that <lb/>where the Government is dealing with the public, <lb/>whether by way of giving jobs or entering into contracts <lb/>or issuing quotas or licences or granting other forms of <lb/>largesse, the Government cannot act arbitrarily at its <lb/>sweet will and, like a private individual, deal with any <lb/>person it pleases, but its action must be in conformity <lb/>with standard or norms which is not arbitrary, irrational <lb/>or irrelevant. The power or discretion of the Government <lb/>in the matter of grant of largesse including award of <lb/>jobs, contracts, quotas, licences, etc. must be confined <lb/>and structured by rational, relevant and non-<lb/>discriminatory standard or norm and if the Government <lb/>departs from such standard or norm in any particular <lb/>case or cases, the action of the Government would be <lb/>liable to be struck down, unless it can be shown by the <lb/>Government that the departure was not arbitrary, but <lb/>was based on some valid principle which in itself was <lb/>not irrational, unreasonable or discriminatory.&quot; <lb/>100. Equality and arbitrariness were thus, declared &quot;sworn <lb/>enemies&quot; and it was held that an arbitrary act would fall foul <lb/>of the right to equality. Non-arbitrariness was equated with <lb/>the rule of law about which Jeffrey Jowell in his seminal <lb/>article &quot;The Rule of Law Today&quot; said: -<lb/></body>

When the rule of law is ignored by <lb/>an official it may on occasion be enforced by courts.&quot; <lb/>101. As is evident from the above, the expressions &apos;arbitrariness&apos; <lb/>and &apos;unreasonableness&apos; have been used interchangeably and <lb/>in fact, one has been defined in terms of the other. More <lb/>recently, in Sharma Transport Vs. Government of A.P. &amp; <lb/>Ors. 42 , this Court has observed thus: <lb/>&quot;25…In order to be described as arbitrary, it must be <lb/>shown that it was not reasonable and manifestly <lb/>arbitrary. The expression &quot;arbitrarily&quot; means: in an <lb/>unreasonable manner, as fixed or done capriciously or <lb/>at pleasure, without adequate determining principle, not <lb/>founded in the nature of things, non-rational, not done <lb/>or acting according to reason or judgment, depending <lb/>on the will alone.&quot; <lb/>102. Further, even though the &apos;classification&apos; doctrine was never <lb/>overruled, it has found less favour with this Court as <lb/>compared to the &apos;arbitrariness&apos; doctrine. In Om Kumar &amp; <lb/>Ors. Vs. Union of India 43 , this Court held thus: <lb/>&quot;59. But, in E.P. Royappa v. State of T. N. Bhagwati, J <lb/>laid down another test for purposes of Article 14.

However, this Court has also alerted against the arbitrary <lb/>use of the &apos;arbitrariness&apos; doctrine. Typically, laws are <lb/>struck down for violating Part III of the Constitution of <lb/>India, legislative incompetence or excessive delegation. <lb/>However, since Royappa&apos;s case (supra), the doctrine has <lb/>been loosely applied. This Court in State of A.P. &amp; Ors. <lb/>Vs. McDowell &amp; Co. &amp; Ors. 44 stressed on the need for an <lb/>objective and scientific analysis of arbitrariness, especially <lb/>while striking down legislations. Justice Jeevan Reddy <lb/>observed: <lb/>&quot;43…The power of Parliament or for that matter, the <lb/>State Legislatures is restricted in two ways. A law made <lb/>by Parliament or the legislature can be struck down by <lb/>courts on two grounds and two grounds alone, viz., (1) <lb/>lack of legislative competence and (2) violation of any of <lb/>the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the <lb/>Constitution or of any other constitutional provision. <lb/>There is no third ground. We do not wish to enter into a <lb/>discussion <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>concepts <lb/>of <lb/>procedural <lb/>unreasonableness and substantive unreasonableness -<lb/>concepts inspired by the decisions of United States <lb/>Supreme Court.

			<body>particular the concept of substantive due process have <lb/>proved to be of unending controversy, the latest <lb/>thinking tending towards a severe curtailment of this <lb/>ground (substantive due process). The main criticism <lb/>against the ground of substantive due process being <lb/>that it seeks to set up the courts as arbiters of the <lb/>wisdom of the legislature in enacting the particular <lb/>piece of legislation. It is enough for us to say that by <lb/>whatever name it is characterised, the ground of <lb/>invalidation must fall within the four corners of the two <lb/>grounds mentioned above. In other words, say, if an <lb/>enactment is challenged as violative of Article 14, it can <lb/>be struck down only if it is found that it is violative of <lb/>the equality clause/equal protection clause enshrined <lb/>therein. Similarly, if an enactment is challenged as <lb/>violative of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by <lb/>clauses (a) to (g) of Article 19(1), it can be struck down <lb/>only if it is found not saved by any of the clauses (s) to <lb/>(6) of Article 19 and so on. No enactment can be struck <lb/>down by just saying that it is arbitrary** or <lb/>unreasonable. Some or other constitutional infirmity <lb/>has to be found before invalidating an Act. <lb/>An <lb/>enactment cannot be struck down on the ground that <lb/>court thinks it unjustified. <lb/>Parliament and the <lb/>legislatures, <lb/>composed <lb/>as <lb/>they <lb/>are <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>representatives of the people, are supposed to know <lb/>and be aware of the needs of the people and what is <lb/>good and bad for them. <lb/>The court cannot sit in <lb/>judgment over their wisdom. In this connection, it <lb/>should be remembered that even in the case of <lb/>administrative action, the scope of judicial review is <lb/>limited to three grounds, viz., (i) unreasonableness, <lb/>which can more appropriately be called irrationality, (ii) <lb/>illegality and (iii) procedural impropriety (see Council of <lb/>Civil Service Unions v. Minister for Civil Service which <lb/>decision has been accepted by this Court as well). <lb/>**An expression used widely and rather indiscriminately <lb/>-an expression of inherently imprecise import. The <lb/>extensive use of this expression in India reminds one of <lb/>what Frankfurter, J said in Hattie Mae Tiller v. <lb/>Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., 87 L ED 610 : 318 <lb/></body>

Therefore, ever since the Royappa era, the conception of <lb/>&apos;arbitrariness&apos; has not undergone any significant change. <lb/>Some decisions have commented on the doctrinal <lb/>looseness of the arbitrariness test and tried keeping its <lb/>folds within permissible boundaries.

			<body>of land, is to be tested on the touchstone of Article 14 of <lb/>the Constitution. A law may not be struck down for being <lb/>arbitrary without the pointing out of a constitutional <lb/>infirmity as McDowell&apos;s case (supra) has said. Therefore, <lb/>a State action has to be tested for constitutional infirmities <lb/>qua Article 14 of the Constitution. The action has to be fair, <lb/>reasonable, <lb/>non-discriminatory, <lb/>transparent, <lb/>non-<lb/>capricious, unbiased, without favouritism or nepotism, in <lb/>pursuit of promotion of healthy competition and equitable <lb/>treatment. It should conform to the norms which are <lb/>rational, informed with reasons and guided by public <lb/>interest, etc. All these principles are inherent in the <lb/>fundamental conception of Article 14. This is the mandate <lb/>of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. <lb/>WHETHER &apos; AUCTION &apos; A CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE : <lb/>106. Such being the constitutional intent and effect of <lb/>Article 14, the question arises -can auction as a method of <lb/>disposal of natural resources be declared a constitutional <lb/>mandate under Article 14 of the Constitution of India? We <lb/>would unhesitatingly answer it in the negative since any <lb/></body>

			<body>other answer would be completely contrary to the scheme <lb/>of Article 14. Firstly, Article 14 may imply positive and <lb/>negative rights for an individual, but with respect to the <lb/>State, it is only couched in negative terms; like an <lb/>admonition against the State which prohibits the State <lb/>from taking up actions that may be arbitrary, <lb/>unreasonable, capricious or discriminatory. Article 14, <lb/>therefore, is an injunction to the State against taking <lb/>certain type of actions rather than commanding it to take <lb/>particular steps. Reading the mandate of auction into its <lb/>scheme would thus, be completely contrary to the intent of <lb/>the Article apparent from its plain language. <lb/>107. Secondly, a constitutional mandate is an absolute principle <lb/>that has to be applied in all situations; it cannot be applied <lb/>in some and not tested in others. The absolute principle is <lb/>then applied on a case by case basis to see which actions <lb/>fulfill the requirements of the constitutional principle and <lb/>which do not. <lb/></body>

			<body>108. Justice K. Subba Rao in his lectures compiled in a book <lb/>titled &quot;Some Constitutional Problems&quot;, critically <lb/>analyzing the trends of Indian constitutional development, <lb/>stated as follows: <lb/>&quot;If the Courts, instead of limiting the scope of the <lb/>articles by construction, exercise their jurisdiction in <lb/>appropriate cases, I have no doubt that the arbitrariness <lb/>of the authorities will be minimised. If these authorities <lb/>entrusted with the discretionary powers, realize that <lb/>their illegal orders infringing the rights of the people <lb/>would be quashed by the appropriate authority, they <lb/>would rarely pass orders in excess of their powers. If <lb/>they knew that not only the form but the substance of <lb/>the orders would be scrutinized in open court, they <lb/>would try to keep within their bounds. The fear of <lb/>ventilation of grievance in public has always been an <lb/>effective deterrent. The apprehension that the High <lb/>Courts would be swamped with writs has no basis.&quot; <lb/>109. Similar sentiments were expressed by Justice K. K. Mathew <lb/>in series of lectures incorporated in the form of a book <lb/>titled &quot;Democracy, Equality and Freedom&quot; in which it is <lb/>stated that &quot;the strength of judicial review lies in case to <lb/>case adjudication.&quot; This is precisely why this Court in His <lb/>Holiness Kesavananda Bharti Sripadagalvaru Vs. <lb/>State of Kerala &amp; Anr. 46 quoting from an American <lb/>decision, observed as follows: <lb/></body>

			<body>&quot;1695…The reason why the expression &quot;due process&quot; <lb/>has never been defined is that it embodies a concept of <lb/>fairness which has to be decided with reference to the <lb/>facts and circumstances of each case and also <lb/>according to the mores for the time being in force in a <lb/>society to which the concept has to be applied. As <lb/>Justice Frankfurter said, &quot;due process&quot; is not a technical <lb/>conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place <lb/>and circumstances [See Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee <lb/>Committee v. McGrath 341 U.S. 123]&quot;. <lb/>110. Equality, therefore, cannot be limited to mean only <lb/>auction, without testing it in every scenario. In The State <lb/>of West Bengal Vs. Anwar Ali Sarkar 47 , this Court, <lb/>quoting from Kotch Vs. Pilot Comm&apos;rs 48 , had held that <lb/>&quot;the constitutional command for a State to afford equal <lb/>protection of the laws sets a goal not attainable by the <lb/>invention and application of a precise formula. This Court <lb/>has never attempted that impossible task&quot;. One cannot <lb/>test the validity of a law with reference to the essential <lb/>elements of ideal democracy, actually incorporated in the <lb/>Constitution. (See: Indira Nehru Gandhi Vs. <lb/>Raj <lb/>Narain 49 ).

The repercussion of holding auction as a <lb/>constitutional mandate would be the voiding of every <lb/>action that deviates from it, including social endeavours, <lb/>welfare schemes and promotional policies, even though <lb/>CPIL itself has argued against the same, and asked for <lb/>making auction mandatory only in the alienation of scarce <lb/>natural resources meant for private and commercial <lb/>business ventures. It would be odd to derive auction as a <lb/>constitutional principle only for a limited set of situations <lb/>from the wide and generic declaration of Article 14. The <lb/>strength of constitutional adjudication lies in case to case <lb/>adjudication and therefore auction cannot be elevated to a <lb/>constitutional mandate. <lb/>111. Finally, reading auction as a constitutional mandate would <lb/>be impermissible because such an approach may distort <lb/>another constitutional principle embodied in Article 39(b). <lb/></body>

			<body>The said article enumerating certain principles of policy, to <lb/>be followed by the State, reads as follows: <lb/>&quot;The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards <lb/>securing -<lb/>(a) <lb/>… <lb/>… <lb/>… <lb/>(b) that the ownership and control of the <lb/>material resources of the community are <lb/>so distributed as best to subserve the <lb/>common good; <lb/>… <lb/>… <lb/>…&quot; <lb/>The disposal of natural resources is a facet of the use and <lb/>distribution of such resources. Article 39(b) mandates that the <lb/>ownership and control of natural resources should be so <lb/>distributed so as to best subserve the common good. Article 37 <lb/>provides that the provisions of Part IV shall not be enforceable <lb/>by any Court, but the principles laid down therein are <lb/>nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and <lb/>it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in <lb/>making laws. <lb/></body>

The <lb/>overarching <lb/>and <lb/>underlying <lb/>principle <lb/>governing <lb/>&apos;distribution&apos; is furtherance of common good. But for the <lb/>achievement of that objective, the Constitution uses the <lb/>generic word &apos;distribution&apos;. Distribution has broad contours <lb/>and cannot be limited to meaning only one method i.e. <lb/>auction. It envisages all such methods available for <lb/>distribution/allocation of natural resources which ultimately <lb/>subserve the &quot;common good&quot;. <lb/>113. In State of Tamil Nadu &amp; Ors. Vs. L. Abu Kavur Bai &amp; <lb/>Ors. 50 , this Court explained the broad-based concept of <lb/>&apos;distribution&apos; as follows: <lb/>&quot;89. …The word &apos;distribution&apos; used in Article 39(b) must <lb/>be broadly construed so that a court may give full and <lb/>comprehensive effect to the statutory intent contained <lb/>in Article 39 (b). A narrow construction of the word <lb/>&apos;distribution&apos; might defeat or frustrate the very object <lb/>which the Article seeks to subserve…&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>114. After noting definitions of &apos;distribution&apos; from different <lb/>dictionaries, this Court held: <lb/>&quot;92. It is obvious, therefore, that in view of the vast <lb/>range of transactions contemplated by the word <lb/>&apos;distribution&apos; as mentioned in the dictionaries referred <lb/>to above, it will not be correct to construe the word <lb/>&apos;distribution&apos; in a purely literal sense so as to mean <lb/>only division of a particular kind or to particular <lb/>persons. <lb/>The words, apportionment, allotment, <lb/>allocation, classification, clearly fall within the broad <lb/>sweep of the word &apos;distribution&apos;. So construed, the <lb/>word &apos;distribution&apos; as used in Article 39(b) will include <lb/>various facets, aspects, methods and terminology of a <lb/>broad-based concept of distribution…&quot; <lb/>115. It can thus, be seen from the afore-quoted paragraphs that <lb/>the term &quot;distribute&quot; undoubtedly, has wide amplitude and <lb/>encompasses all manners and methods of distribution, <lb/>which would include classes, industries, regions, private <lb/>and public sections, etc. Having regard to the basic nature <lb/>of Article 39(b), a narrower concept of equality under <lb/>Article 14 than that discussed above, may frustrate the <lb/>broader concept of distribution, as conceived in Article <lb/>39(b). There cannot, therefore, be a cavil that &quot;common <lb/>good&apos; and &quot;larger public interests&quot; have to be regarded as <lb/>constitutional reality deserving actualization. <lb/></body>

			<body>116. Learned counsel for CPIL argued that revenue <lb/>maximization during the sale or alienation of a natural <lb/>resource for commercial exploitation is the only way of <lb/>achieving public good since the revenue collected can be <lb/>channelized to welfare policies and controlling the <lb/>burgeoning deficit. According to the learned counsel, since <lb/>the best way to maximize revenue is through the route of <lb/>auction, it becomes a constitutional principle even under <lb/>Article 39(b). However, we are not persuaded to hold so. <lb/>Auctions may be the best way of maximizing revenue but <lb/>revenue maximization may not always be the best way to <lb/>subserve public good. &quot;Common good&quot; is the sole guiding <lb/>factor under Article 39(b) for distribution of natural <lb/>resources. It is the touchstone of testing whether any <lb/>policy subserves the &quot;common good&quot; and if it does, <lb/>irrespective of the means adopted, it is clearly in <lb/>accordance with the principle enshrined in Article 39(b). <lb/>117.

In his inimitable style, <lb/>his Lordship opined thus: <lb/>&quot;83. Two conclusions strike us as quintessential. Part <lb/>IV, especially Article 39(b) and (c), is a futuristic <lb/>mandate <lb/>to <lb/>the <lb/>state with <lb/>a <lb/>message <lb/>of <lb/>transformation of the economic and social order. <lb/>Firstly, such change calls for collaborative effort from <lb/>all the legal institutions of the system: the legislature, <lb/>the judiciary and the administrative machinery. <lb/>Secondly and consequentially, loyalty to the high <lb/>purpose of the Constitution, viz., social and economic <lb/>justice in the context of material want and utter <lb/>inequalities on a massive scale, compels the court to <lb/>ascribe expansive meaning to the pregnant words <lb/>used with hopeful foresight, not to circumscribe their <lb/>connotation into contradiction of the objectives <lb/>inspiring the provision. To be Pharisaic towards the <lb/>Constitution through ritualistic construction is to <lb/>weaken the social-spiritual thrust of the founding <lb/>fathers&apos; dynamic faith.&quot; <lb/>118. In the case of Bennett Coleman &amp; Co. and Ors. Vs. <lb/>Union of India and Ors 52 ., it has been held by this Court <lb/>that &quot;the only norm which the Constitution furnishes for <lb/>distribution of material resources of the community is <lb/>elastic norm of common good.&quot; Thus &quot;common good&quot; is a <lb/>norm in Article 39(b) whose applicability was considered by <lb/></body>

The norm of &quot;common good&quot; has to be understood and <lb/>appreciated in a holistic manner. It is obvious that the <lb/>manner in which the common good is best subserved is not <lb/>a matter that can be measured by any constitutional <lb/>yardstick -it would depend on the economic and political <lb/>philosophy of the government. Revenue maximization is <lb/>not the only way in which the common good can be <lb/>subserved. Where revenue maximization is the object of a <lb/>policy, being considered qua that resource at that point of <lb/>time to be the best way to subserve the common good, <lb/>auction would be one of the preferable methods, though <lb/>not the only method. Where revenue maximization is not <lb/>the object of a policy of distribution, the question of <lb/>auction would not arise.

			<body>120. Therefore, in conclusion, the submission that the mandate <lb/>of Article 14 is that any disposal of a natural resource for <lb/>commercial use must be for revenue maximization, and <lb/>thus by auction, is based neither on law nor on logic. There <lb/>is no constitutional imperative in the matter of economic <lb/>policies-Article 14 does not pre-define any economic policy <lb/>as a constitutional mandate. Even the mandate of 39(b) <lb/>imposes no restrictions on the means adopted to subserve <lb/>the public good and uses the broad term &apos;distribution&apos;, <lb/>suggesting that the methodology of distribution is not <lb/>fixed. Economic logic establishes that alienation/allocation <lb/>of natural resources to the highest bidder may not <lb/>necessarily be the only way to subserve the common good, <lb/>and at times, may run counter to public good. Hence, it <lb/>needs little emphasis that disposal of all natural resources <lb/>through auctions is clearly not a constitutional mandate. <lb/>LEGITIMATE DEVIATIONS FROM AUCTION <lb/>121.

			<body>resources in different circumstances. It would be profitable <lb/>to refer to a few cases and appreciate the reasons this <lb/>Court has adopted for deviating from the method of <lb/>auction. <lb/>122. In M/s Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy Vs. State of <lb/>Jammu &amp; Kashmir &amp; Anr. 53 , while comparing the <lb/>efficacy of auction in promoting a domestic industry, P.N. <lb/>Bhagwati, J. observed: -<lb/>&quot;22. …If the State were giving tapping contract <lb/>simpliciter there can be no doubt that the State would <lb/>have to auction or invite tenders for securing the <lb/>highest price, subject, of course, to any other relevant <lb/>overriding considerations of public weal or interest, but <lb/>in a case like this where the State is allocating <lb/>resources such as water, power, raw materials etc. for <lb/>the purpose of encouraging setting up of industries <lb/>within the State, we do not think the State is bound to <lb/>advertise and tell the people that it wants a particular <lb/>industry to be set up within the State and invite those <lb/>interested to come up with proposals for the purpose. <lb/>The State may choose to do so, if it thinks fit and in a <lb/>given situation, it may even turn out to be <lb/>advantageous for the State to do so, but if any private <lb/>party comes before the State and offers to set up an <lb/>industry, the State would not be committing breach of <lb/>any constitutional or legal obligation if it negotiates <lb/>with such party and agrees to provide resources and <lb/>other facilities for the purpose of setting up the <lb/>industry. The State is not obliged to tell such party: <lb/>&quot;Please wait I will first advertise, wee whether any <lb/></body>

			<body>other offers are forthcoming and then after considering <lb/>all offers, decide whether I should let you set up the <lb/>industry&quot;...The State must be free in such a case to <lb/>negotiate with a private entrepreneur with a view to <lb/>inducing him to set up an industry within the State and <lb/>if the State enters into a contract with such <lb/>entrepreneur for providing resources and other <lb/>facilities for setting up an industry, the contract cannot <lb/>be assailed as invalid so long as the State has acted <lb/>bona fide, reasonably and in public interest. If the <lb/>terms and conditions of the contract or the <lb/>surrounding circumstances show that the State has <lb/>acted mala fide or out of improper or corrupt motive or <lb/>in order to promote the private interests of someone at <lb/>the cost of the State, the court will undoubtedly <lb/>interfere and strike down State action as arbitrary, <lb/>unreasonable or contrary to public interest. But so long <lb/>as the State action is bona fide and reasonable, the <lb/>court will not interfere merely on the ground that no <lb/>advertisement was given or publicity made or tenders <lb/>invited.&quot; <lb/>123. In Sachidanand Pandey (supra) after noticing Kasturi <lb/>Lal&apos;s case (supra), it was concluded as under: <lb/>&quot;40. On a consideration of the relevant cases cited <lb/>at the Bar the following propositions may be taken <lb/>as well established: State-owned or public-owned <lb/>property is not to be dealt with at the absolute <lb/>discretion of the executive. Certain precepts and <lb/>principles have to be observed. Public interest is <lb/>the paramount consideration. One of the methods <lb/>of securing the public interest, when it is <lb/>considered necessary to dispose of a property, is to <lb/>sell the property by public auction or by inviting <lb/>tenders. Though that is the ordinary rule, it is not <lb/>an invariable rule. There may be situations where <lb/>there are compelling reasons necessitating <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page116 <lb/></note>

			<page> 117 <lb/></page>

			<body>departure from the rule but then the reasons for <lb/>the departure must be rational and should not be <lb/>suggestive of discrimination. Appearance of public <lb/>justice is as important as doing justice. Nothing <lb/>should be done which gives an appearance of bias, <lb/>jobbery or nepotism.&quot; <lb/>124. In Haji T.M. Hassan Rawther Vs. Kerala Financial <lb/>Corpn. 54 , after an exhaustive review of the law including <lb/>the decisions in Kasturi Lal (supra) and Sachidanand <lb/>Pandey (supra), it was held that public disposal of State <lb/>owned properties is not the only rule. It was, inter-alia, <lb/>observed that: <lb/>&quot;14. The public property owned by the State or by any <lb/>instrumentality of the State should be generally sold by <lb/>public auction or by inviting tenders. This Court has <lb/>been insisting upon that rule, not only to get the highest <lb/>price for the property but also to ensure fairness in the <lb/>activities of the State and public authorities. They <lb/>should undoubtedly act fairly. Their actions should be <lb/>legitimate. Their dealings should be aboveboard. Their <lb/>transactions should be without aversion or affection. <lb/>Nothing should be suggestive of discrimination. Nothing <lb/>should be done by them which gives an impression of <lb/>bias, favouritism or nepotism. Ordinarily these factors <lb/>would be absent if the matter is brought to public <lb/>auction or sale by tenders. That is why the court <lb/>repeatedly stated and reiterated that the State-owned <lb/>properties are required to be disposed of publicly. But <lb/>that is not the only rule. As O. Chinnappa Reddy, J. <lb/>observed &quot;that though that is the ordinary rule, it is not <lb/>an invariable rule&quot;. There may be situations <lb/>necessitating departure from the rule, but then such <lb/>instances must be justified by compulsions and not by <lb/></body>

			<body>compromise. It must be justified by compelling reasons <lb/>and not by just convenience.&quot; <lb/>Here, the Court added to the previous decisions and said that a <lb/>blithe deviation from public disposal of resources would not be <lb/>tolerable; such a deviation must be justified by compelling <lb/>reasons and not by just convenience. <lb/>125. In M.P. Oil Extraction and Anr. Vs. State of M.P. &amp; <lb/>Ors. 55 , this Court held as follows: <lb/>&quot;45. Although to ensure fair play and transparency in <lb/>State action, distribution of largesse by inviting open <lb/>tenders or by public auction is desirable, it cannot be <lb/>held that in no case distribution of such largesse by <lb/>negotiation is permissible. In the instant case, as a <lb/>policy decision protective measure by entering into <lb/>agreements with selected industrial units for assured <lb/>supply of sal seeds at concessional rate has been taken <lb/>by the Government. The rate of royalty has also been <lb/>fixed on some accepted principle of pricing formula as <lb/>will be indicated hereafter. Hence, distribution or <lb/>allotment of sal seeds at the determined royalty to the <lb/>respondents and other units covered by the agreements <lb/>cannot be assailed. It is to be appreciated that in this <lb/>case, distribution by public auction or by open tender <lb/>may not achieve the purpose of the policy of protective <lb/>measure by way of supply of sal seeds at concessional <lb/>rate of royalty to the industrial units covered by the <lb/>agreements on being selected on valid and objective <lb/>considerations.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>126. In Netai Bag &amp; Ors. Vs. State of W.B. &amp; Ors. 56 , this <lb/>Court observed that non-floating of tenders or not holding <lb/>of public auction would, not in all cases, be deemed to be <lb/>the result of the exercise of the executive power in an <lb/>arbitrary manner. It was <lb/>stated: <lb/>&quot;19. …There cannot be any dispute with the proposition <lb/>that generally when any State land is intended to be <lb/>transferred or the State largesse decided to be <lb/>conferred, resort should be had to public auction or <lb/>transfer by way of inviting tenders from the people. That <lb/>would be a sure method of guaranteeing compliance <lb/>with the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution. Non-<lb/>floating of tenders or not holding of public auction would <lb/>not in all cases be deemed to be the result of the <lb/>exercise of the executive power in an arbitrary manner. <lb/>Making an exception to the general rule could be <lb/>justified by the State executive, if challenged in <lb/>appropriate proceedings. The constitutional courts <lb/>cannot be expected to presume the alleged <lb/>irregularities, illegalities or unconstitutionality nor the <lb/>courts can substitute their opinion for the bona fide <lb/>opinion of the State executive. The courts are not <lb/>concerned with the ultimate decision but only with the <lb/>fairness of the decision-making process. <lb/>This Court once again pointed out that there can be exceptions <lb/>from auction; the ultimate test is only that of fairness of the <lb/>decision making process and compliance with Article 14 of the <lb/>Constitution. <lb/></body>

			<body>127. In M &amp; T Consultants, Secunderabad Vs. S.Y. <lb/>Nawab 57 , this Court again reiterated that non-floating of <lb/>tenders does not always lead to the conclusion that the <lb/>exercise of the power is arbitrary: <lb/>&quot;17. A careful and dispassionate assessment and <lb/>consideration of the materials placed on record does <lb/>not leave any reasonable impression, on the peculiar <lb/>facts and circumstances of this case, that anything <lb/>obnoxious which requires either public criticism or <lb/>condemnation by courts of law had taken place. It is by <lb/>now well settled that non-floating of tenders or <lb/>absence of public auction or invitation alone is no <lb/>sufficient reason to castigate the move or an action of <lb/>a public authority as either arbitrary or unreasonable <lb/>or amounting to mala fide or improper exercise or <lb/>improper abuse of power by the authority concerned. <lb/>Courts have always leaned in favour of sufficient <lb/>latitude being left with the authorities to adopt their <lb/>own techniques of management of projects with <lb/>concomitant economic expediencies depending upon <lb/>the exigencies of a situation guided by appropriate <lb/>financial policy in the best interests of the authority <lb/>motivated by public interest as well in undertaking <lb/>such ventures.&quot; <lb/>128. In Villianur Iyarkkai Padukappu Maiyam Vs. Union of <lb/>India &amp; Ors. 58 , a three Judge Bench of this Court was <lb/>concerned with the development of the Port of Pondicherry <lb/>where a contractor had been selected without floating a <lb/>tender or holding public auction. It was held as under: <lb/></body>
			
			<note place='footnote'>57 (2003) 8 SCC 100 <lb/>58 (2009) 7 SCC 561 <lb/></note>

			<note place='footnote'>page 122<lb/></note>

			<page> 121 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;164. The plea raised by the learned counsel for the <lb/>appellants that the Government of Pondicherry was <lb/>arbitrary and unreasonable in switching the whole <lb/>public tender process into a system of personal <lb/>selection and, therefore, the appeals should be <lb/>accepted, is devoid of merits. It is well settled that <lb/>non-floating of tenders or not holding of public <lb/>auction would not in all cases be deemed to be the <lb/>result of the exercise of the executive power in an <lb/>arbitrary manner. <lb/>171. In a case like this where the State is allocating <lb/>resources such as water, power, raw materials, etc. <lb/>for the purpose of encouraging development of the <lb/>port, this Court does not think that the State is bound <lb/>to advertise and tell the people that it wants <lb/>development of the port in a particular manner and <lb/>invite those interested to come up with proposals for <lb/>the purpose. The State may choose to do so if it <lb/>thinks fit and in a given situation it may turn out to be <lb/>advantageous for the State to do so, but if any <lb/>private party comes before the State and offers to <lb/>develop the port, the State would not be committing <lb/>breach of any constitutional obligation if it negotiates <lb/>with such a party and agrees to provide resources <lb/>and other facilities for the purpose of development of <lb/>the port.&quot; <lb/>129. Hence, it is manifest that there is no constitutional <lb/>mandate in favour of auction under Article 14. The <lb/>Government has repeatedly deviated from the course of <lb/>auction and this Court has repeatedly upheld such actions. <lb/>The judiciary tests such deviations on the limited scope of <lb/>arbitrariness and fairness under Article 14 and its role is <lb/>limited to that extent. Essentially whenever the object of <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 121<lb/></note>

			<page> 122 <lb/></page>

			<body>policy is anything but revenue maximization, the Executive <lb/>is seen to adopt methods other than auction. <lb/>130. A fortiori, besides legal logic, mandatory auction may be <lb/>contrary to economic logic as well. Different resources <lb/>may require different treatment. Very often, exploration <lb/>and exploitation contracts are bundled together due to the <lb/>requirement of heavy capital in the discovery of natural <lb/>resources. A concern would risk undertaking such <lb/>exploration and incur heavy costs only if it was assured <lb/>utilization of the resource discovered; a prudent business <lb/>venture, would not like to incur the high costs involved in <lb/>exploration activities and then compete for that resource <lb/>in an open auction. The logic is similar to that applied in <lb/>patents. Firms are given incentives to invest in research <lb/>and development with the promise of exclusive access to <lb/>the market for the sale of that invention. Such an approach <lb/>is economically and legally sound and sometimes <lb/>necessary to spur research and development. Similarly, <lb/>bundling exploration and exploitation contracts may be <lb/>necessary to spur growth in a specific industry. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 122<lb/></note>

			<page> 123 <lb/></page>

			<body>131. Similar deviation from auction cannot be ruled out when <lb/>the object of a State policy is to promote domestic <lb/>development of an industry, like in Kasturi Lal&apos;s case, <lb/>discussed above. However, these examples are purely <lb/>illustrative in order to demonstrate that auction cannot be <lb/>the sole criteria for alienation of all natural resources. <lb/>POTENTIAL OF ABUSE <lb/>132. It was also argued that even if the method of auction is not <lb/>a mandate under Article 14, it must be the only <lb/>permissible method, due to the susceptibility of other <lb/>methods to abuse. This argument, in our view, is contrary <lb/>to an established position of law on the subject cemented <lb/>through a catena of decisions. <lb/>133. In R.K. Garg Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors. 59 , Justice P. N. <lb/>Bhagwati, speaking for a Constitution Bench of five learned <lb/>Judges, held: <lb/>&quot;8.…The Court must always remember that &quot;legislation <lb/>is directed to practical problems, that the economic <lb/>mechanism is highly sensitive and complex, that many <lb/></body>

			<body>problems are singular and contingent, that laws are not <lb/>abstract propositions and do not relate to abstract units <lb/>and are not to be measured by abstract symmetry&quot;; <lb/>&quot;that exact wisdom and nice adaption of remedy are not <lb/>always possible&quot; and that &quot;judgment is largely a <lb/>prophecy based on meager and uninterpreted <lb/>experience&quot;. Every legislation particularly in economic <lb/>matters is essentially empiric and it is based on <lb/>experimentation or what one may call trial and error <lb/>method and therefore it cannot provide for all possible <lb/>situations or anticipate all possible abuses. There may <lb/>be crudities and inequities in complicated experimental <lb/>economic legislation but on that account alone it cannot <lb/>be struck down as invalid. The courts cannot, as pointed <lb/>out by the United States Supreme Court in Secretary <lb/>of Agriculture v. Central Reig Refining Company 60 <lb/>be converted into tribunals for relief from such crudities <lb/>and inequities. There may even be possibilities of abuse, <lb/>but that too cannot of itself be a ground for invalidating <lb/>the legislation, because it is not possible for any <lb/>legislature to anticipate as if by some divine prescience, <lb/>distortions and abuses of its legislation which may be <lb/>made by those subject to its provisions and to provide <lb/>against such distortions and abuses. Indeed, howsoever <lb/>great may be the care bestowed on its framing, it is <lb/>difficult to conceive of a legislation which is not capable <lb/>of being abused by perverted human ingenuity. The <lb/>Court must therefore adjudge the constitutionality of <lb/>such legislation by the generality of its provisions and <lb/>not by its crudities or inequities or by the possibilities of <lb/>abuse of any of its provisions. If any crudities, inequities <lb/>or possibilities of abuse come to light, the legislature <lb/>can always step in and enact suitable amendatory <lb/>legislation. That is the essence of pragmatic approach <lb/>which must guide and inspire the legislature in dealing <lb/>with complex economic issues.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>134. Then again, in D. K. Trivedi &amp; Sons &amp; Ors. Vs. State of <lb/>Gujarat &amp; Ors. 61 , while upholding the constitutional <lb/>validity of Section 15(1) of the MMRD Act, this Court <lb/>explained the principle in the following words: <lb/>&quot;50. Where a statute confers discretionary powers <lb/>upon the executive or an administrative authority, the <lb/>validity or constitutionality of such power cannot be <lb/>judged on the assumption that the executive or such <lb/>authority will act in an arbitrary manner in the <lb/>exercise of the discretion conferred upon it. If the <lb/>executive or the administrative authority acts in an <lb/>arbitrary manner, its action would be bad in law and <lb/>liable to be struck down by the courts but the <lb/>possibility of abuse of power or arbitrary exercise of <lb/>power cannot invalidate the statute conferring the <lb/>power or the power which has been conferred by it.&quot; <lb/>135. Therefore, a potential for abuse cannot be the basis for <lb/>striking down a method as ultra vires the Constitution. It is <lb/>the actual abuse itself that must be brought before the <lb/>Court for being tested on the anvil of constitutional <lb/>provisions. In fact, it may be said that even auction has a <lb/>potential of abuse, like any other method of allocation, but <lb/>that cannot be the basis of declaring it as an <lb/>unconstitutional methodology either. These drawbacks <lb/>include cartelization, &quot;winners curse&quot; (the phenomenon by <lb/></body>

			<body>which a bidder bids a higher, unrealistic and unexecutable <lb/>price just to surpass the competition; or where a bidder, in <lb/>case of multiple auctions, bids for all the resources and <lb/>ends up winning licenses for exploitation of more <lb/>resources than he can pragmatically execute), etc. <lb/>However, all the same, auction cannot be called ultra vires <lb/>for the said reasons and continues to be an attractive and <lb/>preferred means of disposal of natural resources especially <lb/>when revenue maximization is a priority. <lb/>Therefore, <lb/>neither auction, nor any other method of disposal can be <lb/>held ultra vires the Constitution, merely because of a <lb/>potential abuse. <lb/>JUDICIAL REVIEW OF POLICY DECISIONS <lb/>136. The learned Attorney General also argued that dictating a <lb/>method of distribution for natural resources violates the <lb/>age old established principle of non-interference by the <lb/>judiciary in policy matters. Even though the contours of the <lb/>power of judicial review of policy decisions has become a <lb/>trite subject, as the Courts have repeatedly delivered <lb/>opinions on it, we wish to reiterate some of the principles <lb/></body>

			<body>in brief, especially with regard to economic policy choices <lb/>and pricing. <lb/>137. One of the earliest pronouncements on the subject came <lb/>from this Court in Rustom Cavasjee Cooper Vs. Union <lb/>of India 62 (commonly known as &quot;Bank Nationalization <lb/>Case&quot;) wherein this Court held that it is not the forum <lb/>where conflicting policy claims may be debated; it is only <lb/>required to adjudicate the legality of a measure which has <lb/>little to do with relative merits of different political and <lb/>economic theories. The Court observed: <lb/>&quot;63. This Court is not the forum in which these <lb/>conflicting claims may be debated. Whether there is a <lb/>genuine need for banking facility in the rural sector, <lb/>whether certain classes of the community are deprived <lb/>of the benefit of the resources of the banking industry, <lb/>whether administration by the Government of the <lb/>commercial banking sector will not prove beneficial to <lb/>the community and will lead to rigidity in the <lb/>administration, whether the Government administration <lb/>will eschew the profit-motive, and even if it be <lb/>eschewed, there will accrue substantial benefits to the <lb/>public, whether an undue accent on banking as a means <lb/>of social regeneration, especially in the backward areas, <lb/>is a doctrinaire approach to a rational order of priorities <lb/>for attaining the national objectives enshrined in our <lb/>Constitution, and whether the policy followed by the <lb/></body>

			<body>Government in office or the policy propounded by its <lb/>opponents may reasonably attain the national <lb/>objectives are matters which have little relevance in <lb/>determining the legality of the measure. It is again not <lb/>for this Court to consider the relative merits of the <lb/>different political theories or economic policies. The <lb/>Parliament has under Entry 45, List I the power to <lb/>legislate in respect of banking and other commercial <lb/>activities of the named banks necessarily incidental <lb/>thereto: it has the power to legislate for acquiring the <lb/>undertaking of the named banks under Entry 42, List III. <lb/>Whether by the exercise of the power vested in the <lb/>Reserve Bank under the pre-existing laws, results could <lb/>be achieved which it is the object of the Act to achieve, <lb/>is, in our judgment, not relevant in considering whether <lb/>the Act amounts to abuse of legislative power. This <lb/>Court has the power to strike down a law on the ground <lb/>of want of authority, but the Court will not sit in appeal <lb/>over the policy of the Parliament in enacting a law. The <lb/>Court cannot find fault with the Act merely on the <lb/>ground that it is inadvisable to take over the <lb/>undertaking of banks which, it is said by the petitioner, <lb/>by thrift and efficient management had set up an <lb/>impressive and efficient business organization serving <lb/>large sectors of industry.&quot; <lb/>138. In R.K. Garg (supra), this Court even observed that <lb/>greater judicial deference must be shown towards a law <lb/>relating to economic activities due to the complexity of <lb/>economic problems and their fulfillment through a <lb/>methodology of trial and error. As noted above, it was also <lb/>clarified that the fact that an economic legislation may be <lb/>troubled by crudities, inequities, uncertainties or the <lb/>possibility of abuse cannot be the basis for striking it <lb/></body>

			<body>down. The following observations which refer to a couple <lb/>of American Supreme Court decisions are a limpid <lb/>enunciation on the subject : <lb/>&quot;8. Another rule of equal importance is that laws <lb/>relating to economic activities should be viewed with <lb/>greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as <lb/>freedom of speech, religion etc. It has been said by no <lb/>less a person than Holmes, J., that the legislature should <lb/>be allowed some play in the joints, because it has to <lb/>deal with complex problems which do not admit of <lb/>solution through any doctrinaire or strait-jacket formula <lb/>and this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing <lb/>with economic matters, where, having regard to the <lb/>nature of the problems required to be dealt with, <lb/>greater play in the joints has to be allowed to the <lb/>legislature. The court should feel more inclined to give <lb/>judicial deference to legislative judgment in the field of <lb/>economic regulation than in other areas where <lb/>fundamental human rights are involved. Nowhere has <lb/>this admonition been more felicitously expressed than in <lb/>Morey v. Doud 63 where Frankfurter, J., said in his <lb/>inimitable style: <lb/>&apos;In the utilities, tax and economic regulation <lb/>cases, there are good reasons for judicial self-<lb/>restraint if not judicial deference to legislative <lb/>judgment. The legislature after all has the <lb/>affirmative responsibility. The courts have <lb/>only the power to destroy, not to reconstruct. <lb/>When these are added to the complexity of <lb/>economic regulation, the uncertainty, the <lb/>liability to error, the bewildering conflict of the <lb/>experts, and the number of times the judges <lb/>have been overruled by events -self-<lb/>limitation can be seen to be the path to <lb/>judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and <lb/>stability&apos;...&quot; <lb/></body>

State of T.N. &amp; Ors. 64 <lb/>this Court clarified that it is the validity of a law and not its <lb/>efficacy that can be challenged: <lb/>&quot;54. It is not the domain of the court to embark upon <lb/>unchartered ocean of public policy in an exercise to <lb/>consider as to whether a particular public policy is wise <lb/>or a better public policy can be evolved. Such exercise <lb/>must be left to the discretion of the executive and <lb/>legislative authorities as the case may be. The court is <lb/>called upon to consider the validity of a public policy <lb/>only when a challenge is made that such policy decision <lb/>infringes fundamental rights guaranteed by the <lb/>Constitution of India or any other statutory right...&quot; <lb/>140. In Delhi Science Forum &amp; Ors. Vs. Union of India &amp; <lb/>Anr. 65 a Bench of three learned Judges of this Court, while <lb/>rejecting a claim against the opening up of the telecom <lb/>sector reiterated that the forum for debate and discourse <lb/>over the merits and demerits of a policy is the Parliament. <lb/>It restated that the services of this Court are not sought till <lb/>the legality of the policy is disputed, and further, that no <lb/>direction can be given or be expected from the courts, <lb/>unless while implementing such policies, there is violation <lb/></body>

What has been said in respect of legislations is <lb/>applicable even in respect of policies which have been <lb/>adopted by Parliament. They cannot be tested in Court <lb/>of Law. The courts cannot express their opinion as to <lb/>whether at a particular juncture or under a particular <lb/>situation prevailing in the country any such national <lb/>policy should have been adopted or not. There may be <lb/>views and views, opinions and opinions which may be <lb/>shared and believed by citizens of the country including <lb/>the representatives of the people in Parliament. But that <lb/>has to be sorted out in Parliament which has to approve <lb/>such policies…&quot; <lb/>141. In BALCO Employees&apos; Union (Regd.) Vs. Union of <lb/>India &amp; Ors. 66 , this Court further pointed out that the <lb/>Court ought to stay away from judicial review of efficacy of <lb/>policy matters, not only because the same is beyond its <lb/>jurisdiction, but also because it lacks the necessary <lb/>expertise required for such a task. Affirming the previous <lb/>views of this Court, the Court observed that while dealing <lb/>with economic legislations, the Courts, while not <lb/>jettisoning its jurisdiction to curb arbitrary action or <lb/>unconstitutional legislation, should interfere only in those <lb/>cases where the view reflected in the legislation is not <lb/></body>

The Court went on to <lb/>emphasize that unless the economic decision, based on <lb/>economic expediencies, is demonstrated to be so violative <lb/>of constitutional or legal limits on power or so abhorrent to <lb/>reason, that the courts would decline to interfere. <lb/>142. In BALCO (supra), the Court took notice of the judgment <lb/>in Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. <lb/>&amp; Anr. Vs. Reserve Bank of India 67 and observed that <lb/>some matters like price fixation are based on such <lb/>uncertainties and dynamics that even experts face <lb/>difficulty in making correct projections, making it all the <lb/>more necessary for this Court to exercise non-<lb/>interference: <lb/>&quot;31. The function of the Court is to see that lawful <lb/>authority is not abused but not to appropriate to itself <lb/>the task entrusted to that authority. It is well settled <lb/>that a public body invested with statutory powers must <lb/>take care not to exceed or abuse its power. It must keep <lb/>within the limits of the authority committed to it. It must <lb/>act in good faith and it must act reasonably. Courts are <lb/>not to interfere with economic policy which is the <lb/>function of experts. It is not the function of the courts to <lb/>sit in judgment over matters of economic policy and it <lb/>must necessarily be left to the expert bodies. In such <lb/>matters even experts can seriously and doubtlessly <lb/>differ. Courts cannot be expected to decide them <lb/></body>

			<body>without even the aid of experts.&quot; <lb/>143. In an earlier case in M/s Prag Ice &amp; Oil Mills &amp; Anr. Vs. <lb/>Union of India 68 , this Court had observed as under: (SCC <lb/>p. 478, Para 24) <lb/>&quot;We do not think that it is the function of this Court or of <lb/>any court to sit in judgment over such matters of <lb/>economic policy as must necessarily be left to the <lb/>government of the day to decide. Many of them, as a <lb/>measure of price fixation must necessarily be, are <lb/>matters of prediction of ultimate results on which even <lb/>experts can seriously err and doubtlessly by differ. <lb/>Courts can certainly not be expected to decide them <lb/>without even the aid of experts.&quot; <lb/>144. In State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Narmada Bachao <lb/>Andolan &amp; Anr. 69 , this Court said that the judiciary cannot <lb/>engage in an exercise of comparative analysis over the <lb/>fairness, logical or scientific basis, or wisdom of a policy. It <lb/>held that the Court cannot strike down a policy decision <lb/>taken by the Government merely because it feels that <lb/>another decision would have been fairer, or more scientific <lb/>or logical, or wiser. The wisdom and advisability of the <lb/>policies are ordinarily not amenable to judicial review <lb/>unless the policies are contrary to statutory or <lb/></body>

			<body>constitutional provisions or arbitrary or irrational or an <lb/>abuse of power. <lb/>145. Mr. Subramanian Swamy also brought to our notice a <lb/>Report on Allocation of Natural Resources, prepared by a <lb/>Committee, chaired by Mr. Ashok Chawla (hereinafter <lb/>referred to as the &quot;Chawla Committee Report&quot;), which has <lb/>produced a copious conceptual framework for the <lb/>Government of India on the allocation and pricing of scarce <lb/>natural resources viz. coal, minerals, petroleum, natural <lb/>gas, spectrum, forests, land and water. He averred to <lb/>observations of the report in favour of auction as a means <lb/>of disposal. However, since the opinion rendered in the <lb/>Chawla Committee Report is pending acceptance by the <lb/>Government, it would be inappropriate for us to place <lb/>judicial reliance on it. Besides, the Report conducts an <lb/>economic, and not legal, analysis of the means of disposal <lb/>of natural resources. The purpose of this Reference would <lb/>be best served if this Court gave a constitutional answer <lb/>rather than economic one. <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 134 <lb/></note>

			<body>146. To summarize in the context of the present Reference, it <lb/>needs to be emphasized that this Court cannot conduct a <lb/>comparative study of the various methods of distribution <lb/>of natural resources and suggest the most efficacious <lb/>mode, if there is one universal efficacious method in the <lb/>first place. It respects the mandate and wisdom of the <lb/>executive for such matters. The methodology pertaining to <lb/>disposal of natural resources is clearly an economic policy. <lb/>It entails intricate economic choices and the Court lacks <lb/>the necessary expertise to make them. As has been <lb/>repeatedly said, it cannot, and shall not, be the endeavour <lb/>of this Court to evaluate the efficacy of auction vis-à-vis <lb/>other methods of disposal of natural resources. The Court <lb/>cannot mandate one method to be followed in all facts and <lb/>circumstances. Therefore, auction, an economic choice of <lb/>disposal of natural resources, is not a constitutional <lb/>mandate. We may, however, hasten to add that the Court <lb/>can test the legality and constitutionality of these <lb/>methods. When questioned, the Courts are entitled to <lb/>analyse the legal validity of different means of distribution <lb/>and give a constitutional answer as to which methods are <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 135 <lb/></note>

			<page> 136 <lb/></page>

			<body>ultra vires and intra vires the provisions of the <lb/>Constitution. Nevertheless, it cannot and will not compare <lb/>which policy is fairer than the other, but, if a policy or law <lb/>is patently unfair to the extent that it falls foul of the <lb/>fairness requirement of Article 14 of the Constitution, the <lb/>Court would not hesitate in striking it down. <lb/>147. Finally, market price, in economics, is an index of the value <lb/>that a market prescribes to a good. However, this valuation <lb/>is a function of several dynamic variables; it is a science <lb/>and not a law. Auction is just one of the several price <lb/>discovery mechanisms. Since multiple variables are <lb/>involved in such valuations, auction or any other form of <lb/>competitive bidding, cannot constitute even an economic <lb/>mandate, much less a constitutional mandate. <lb/>148. In our opinion, auction despite being a more preferable <lb/>method of alienation/allotment of natural resources, <lb/>cannot be held to be a constitutional requirement or <lb/>limitation for alienation of all natural resources and <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page136 <lb/></note>

			<page> 137 <lb/></page>

			<body>therefore, every method other than auction cannot be <lb/>struck down as ultra-vires the constitutional mandate. <lb/>149. Regard being had to the aforesaid precepts, we have <lb/>opined that auction as a mode cannot be conferred the <lb/>status of a constitutional principle. Alienation of natural <lb/>resources is a policy decision, and the means adopted for <lb/>the same are thus, executive prerogatives. However, <lb/>when such a policy decision is not backed by a social or <lb/>welfare purpose, and precious and scarce natural <lb/>resources are alienated for commercial pursuits of profit <lb/>maximizing private entrepreneurs, adoption of means <lb/>other than those that are competitive and maximize <lb/>revenue may be arbitrary and face the wrath of Article 14 <lb/>of the Constitution. Hence, rather than prescribing or <lb/>proscribing a method, we believe, a judicial scrutiny of <lb/>methods of disposal of natural resources should depend on <lb/>the facts and circumstances of each case, in consonance <lb/>with the principles which we have culled out above. Failing <lb/>which, the Court, in exercise of power of judicial review, <lb/>shall term the executive action as arbitrary, unfair, <lb/></body>

			<body>unreasonable and capricious due to its antimony with <lb/>Article 14 of the Constitution. <lb/>150. In conclusion, our answer to the first set of five questions is <lb/>that auctions are not the only permissible method for <lb/>disposal of all natural resources across all sectors and in all <lb/>circumstances. <lb/>151. As regards the remaining questions, we feel that answer to <lb/>these questions would have a direct bearing on the mode <lb/>of alienation of Spectrum and therefore, in light of the <lb/>statement by the learned Attorney General that the <lb/>Government is not questioning the correctness of <lb/>judgment in the 2G Case, we respectfully decline to <lb/>answer these questions. The Presidential Reference is <lb/>answered accordingly. <lb/>152. This opinion shall be transmitted to the President in <lb/>accordance with the procedure prescribed in Part V of the <lb/>Supreme Court Rules, 1966. <lb/></body>

			<body> O P I N I O N <lb/>JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J. <lb/>1. <lb/>I have had the privilege of perusing the opinion <lb/>rendered by my esteemed brother, D.K. Jain, J. <lb/>Every <lb/>bit of the opinion (which shall hereinafter be referred <lb/>to by me, as the &quot;main opinion&quot;) is based on settled <lb/>propositions of law declared by this Court. There can, <lb/>therefore, <lb/>be <lb/>no <lb/>question <lb/>of <lb/>any <lb/>disagreement <lb/>therewith. <lb/>I fully endorse the opinion expressed <lb/>therein. <lb/>2. <lb/>The first question posed in the Presidential <lb/>reference, is in fact the reason, for my having to <lb/>record, some other nuances on the subject whereof <lb/>advice has been sought. <lb/>The first question in the <lb/>Presidential reference requires the Supreme Court to <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 140 <lb/></note>

			<page>141 <lb/></page>

			<body>tender advice on, &quot;Whether the only permissible method <lb/>for disposal of all natural resources across all <lb/>sectors and in all circumstances, is by the conduct of <lb/>auctions?&quot;. It is of utmost importance to understand, <lb/>the tenor of the first question in the Presidential <lb/>reference. Take for instance a hypothetical situation <lb/>where, the legality of 100 instances of disposal of <lb/>different types of natural resources is taken up for <lb/>consideration. <lb/>If the first question is taken in its <lb/>literal sense, as to whether the method of disposal of <lb/>all natural resources in all circumstances is by <lb/>auction alone, then, even if 99 out of the aforesaid <lb/>100 different natural resources are such, which can <lb/>only be disposed of by way of auction, the answer to <lb/>the first question would still be in the negative. <lb/>This answer in the negative would give the erroneous <lb/>impression, that it is not necessary to dispose of <lb/>natural resources by way of auction. <lb/>Surely, the <lb/>Presidential reference has not been made, to seek such <lb/>an innocuous advice. The instant reference has been <lb/>made despite the Central Government being alive to the <lb/>fact, that there are natural resources which can only <lb/>be disposed of by way of auction. A mining lease for <lb/></body>

			<page> 142 <lb/></page>

			<body>coal under Section 11A of the Mines and Minerals <lb/>(Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 can be granted, <lb/>only by way of selection through auction by competitive <lb/>bidding. Furthermore, the learned Attorney General for <lb/>India informed us, about a conscious decision having <lb/>been taken by the Central Government to henceforth <lb/>allot spectrum only through competitive bidding by way <lb/>of auction. Such instances can be multiplied. It is <lb/>therefore obvious, that Government is alive to the <lb/>fact, that disposal of some natural resources have to <lb/>be made only by auction. <lb/>If that is so, the first <lb/>question in the reference does not seek a literal <lb/>response. <lb/>The first question must be understood to <lb/>seek this Court&apos;s opinion on whether there are <lb/>circumstances in which natural resources ought to be <lb/>disposed of only by auction. <lb/>Tendering an opinion, <lb/>without a response to this facet of the matter, would <lb/>not make the seeker of advice, any wiser. It is this <lb/>aspect alone, which will be the main subject of focus <lb/>of my instant opinion. <lb/>3. <lb/>Before venturing into the area of consideration <lb/>expressed in the foregoing paragraph, it is necessary <lb/>to record, that there was extensive debate during the <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 142<lb/></note>

			<page> 143 <lb/></page>

			<body>course of hearing, on whether, maximization of revenue <lb/>must be the sole permissible consideration, for <lb/>disposal of all natural resources, across all sectors <lb/>and in all circumstances. <lb/>During the course of this <lb/>debate, <lb/>the <lb/>learned <lb/>Attorney <lb/>General <lb/>for <lb/>India <lb/>acknowledged, that auction by way of competitive <lb/>bidding, was certainly an indisputable means, by which <lb/>maximization of revenue returns is assured. It is not <lb/>as if, one would like to bind the learned Attorney <lb/>General to the acquiesced proposition. <lb/>During the <lb/>course of the days and weeks of erudite debate, learned <lb/>counsel <lb/>emphasized, <lb/>that <lb/>disposal <lb/>of <lb/>assets <lb/>by <lb/>processes of tender, tender-cum-auction and auction, <lb/>could assure maximization of revenue returns. <lb/>Of <lb/>course, there are a large variety of tender and auction <lb/>processes, each one with its own nuances. And we were <lb/>informed, <lb/>that <lb/>a <lb/>rightful <lb/>choice, <lb/>would <lb/>assure <lb/>maximization of revenue returns. <lb/>The term &quot;auction&quot; <lb/>expressed in my instant opinion, may therefore be read <lb/>as a means to maximize revenue returns, irrespective of <lb/>whether the means adopted should technically and <lb/>correctly be described as tender, tender-cum-auction, <lb/>or auction. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. <lb/>The concept of equality before the law and equal <lb/>protection of the laws, emerges from the fundamental <lb/>right expressed in Article 14 of the Constitution of <lb/>India. Equality is a definite concept. The variation <lb/>in its understanding may at best have reference to the <lb/>maturity and evolution of the nation&apos;s thought. <lb/>To <lb/>start with, breach of equality was a plea advanced by <lb/>individuals claiming fair treatment. <lb/>Challenges were <lb/>raised also on account of discriminatory treatment. <lb/>Equality was sought by those more meritorious, when <lb/>benefits were bestowed on those with lesser caliber. <lb/>Gradually, judicial intervention came to be sought for <lb/>equitable treatment, even for a section of the society <lb/>put together. <lb/>A jurisdiction, which in due course, <lb/>came to be described as public interest litigation. It <lb/>all started with a demand for the basic rights for <lb/>respectable human existence. <lb/>Over the years, the <lb/>concept of determination of societal rights, has <lb/>traversed into different directions and avenues. <lb/>So <lb/>much so, that now rights in equity, sometimes even <lb/>present situations of conflict between individual <lb/>rights and societal rights. <lb/>The present adjudication <lb/>can be stated to be a dispute of such nature. <lb/>In a <lb/></body>

			<body>maturing society, individual rights and plural rights <lb/>have to be balanced, so that the oscillating pendulum <lb/>of rights, fairly and equally, recognizes their <lb/>respective parameters. For a country like India, the <lb/>pendulum must be understood to balance the rights of <lb/>one citizen on the one side, and 124,14,91,960 (the <lb/>present estimated population of India) citizens of the <lb/>country on the other. The true effect of the Article <lb/>14 of the Constitution of India is to provide equality <lb/>before the law and equal protection of the laws not <lb/>only with reference to individual rights, but also by <lb/>ensuring that its citizens on the other side of the <lb/>balance are likewise not deprived of their right to <lb/>equality before the law, and their right to equal <lb/>protection of the laws. <lb/>An individual citizen cannot <lb/>be a beneficiary, at the cost of the country (the <lb/>remaining 124,14,91,960 citizens) i.e., the plurality. <lb/>Enriching one at the cost of all others would amount to <lb/>deprivation to the plurality i.e., the nation itself. <lb/>The gist of the first question in the Presidential <lb/>reference, raises the issue whether ownership rights <lb/>over the nation&apos;s natural resources, vest in the <lb/>citizens of the country. <lb/>An answer to the instant <lb/></body>

			<body>issue in turn would determine, whether or not it is <lb/>imperative for the executive while formulating a policy <lb/>for the disposal of natural resources, to ensure that <lb/>it subserves public good and public interest. <lb/>5. <lb/>The introduction and acceptance of public <lb/>interest litigation as a jurisprudential concept is a <lb/>matter of extensive debate in India, and even more than <lb/>that, outside India. <lb/>This concept brings into focus <lb/>the rights of the plurality (as against individual&apos;s <lb/>right) specially when the plurality is, for one or the <lb/>other reason, not in a position to seek redressal of <lb/>its grievances. This inadequacy may not always emerge <lb/>from financial constrains. It may sometimes arise out <lb/>of lack of awareness. At other times merely from the <lb/>overwhelming might of executive authority. <lb/>The <lb/>jurisprudential thought in this country, after the <lb/>emergence of public interest litigation, is seeking to <lb/>strike a balance between individual rights and the <lb/>rights of the plurality. <lb/>After all, all natural <lb/>resources are the nation&apos;s collective wealth. <lb/>This <lb/>Court has had the occasion over the last few decades, <lb/>to determine rights of citizens with reference to <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 146 <lb/></note>

			<page> 147 <lb/></page>

			<body>natural resources. The right of an individual citizen <lb/>to those assets, as also, the rights of the remaining <lb/>citizens of the country, have now emerged on opposite <lb/>sides in a common litigation. <lb/>One will endeavour to <lb/>delineate the legal position expressed in decisions <lb/>rendered by this Court, on issues relatable to disposal <lb/>of resources by the State, to determine whether the <lb/>instant issue stands settled, by law declared by this <lb/>Court. <lb/>6(a) <lb/>First of all reference was made to the decision <lb/>of this Court in S.G. Jaisinghani Vs. Union of India &amp; <lb/>Ors., AIR 1967 SC 1427, wherein this Court observed as <lb/>under: <lb/>&quot;14. <lb/>In this context it is important to <lb/>emphasize that the absence of arbitrary power is <lb/>the first essential of the rule of law upon which <lb/>our whole constitutional system is based. In a <lb/>system governed by rule of law, discretion, when <lb/>conferred upon executive authorities, must be <lb/>confined within clearly defined limits. The rule <lb/>of law from this point of view means that <lb/>decisions should be made by the application of <lb/>known principles and rules and, in general, such <lb/>decisions should be predictable and the citizen <lb/>should know where he is . If a decision is taken <lb/>without any principle or without any rule it is <lb/>unpredictable <lb/>and <lb/>such <lb/>a <lb/>decision <lb/>is <lb/>the <lb/>antithesis of a decision taken in accordance with <lb/>the Rule of law. (See Dicey -Law of the <lb/>Constitution -10th Edn., Introduction cx). &quot;Law <lb/>has reached its finest moments,&quot; stated Douglas, <lb/></body>

			<body>J. in United States v. Wunderlich, (1951) 342 US <lb/>98, &quot;when it has freed man from the unlimited <lb/>discretion of some ruler.... Where discretion, is <lb/>absolute, man has always suffered.&quot; It is in this <lb/>sense that the rule of law may be said to be the <lb/>sworn enemy of caprice. Discretion, as Lord <lb/>Mansfield slated it in classic terms in the case <lb/>of John Wilkes, (1770) 4 Burr 2528 at p. 2539 <lb/>&quot;means sound discretion guided by law. It must be <lb/>governed by Rule, not by humour: it must not be <lb/>arbitrary, vague, and fanciful.&quot; <lb/>(emphasis is mine) <lb/>In the aforesaid case, it came to be emphasized that <lb/>executive action should have clearly defined limits and <lb/>should be predictable. In other words, the man on the <lb/>street should know why the decision has been taken in <lb/>favour of a particular party. <lb/>What came to be <lb/>impressed upon was, that lack of transparency in the <lb/>decision making process would render it arbitrary. <lb/>(b) <lb/>Also cited for our consideration was the <lb/>judgment in Rashbihari Panda etc. Vs. State of Orissa <lb/>(1969) 1 SCC 414. <lb/>In this case it was canvassed on <lb/>behalf of <lb/>the appellants, that the machinery devised <lb/>by the Government for sale of Kendu leaves in which <lb/>they had acquired a trade monopoly, was violative of <lb/>the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and <lb/>19(1)(g) of the Constitution. It was pointed out, that <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 148 <lb/></note>

			<page> 149 <lb/></page>

			<body>in the scheme of events the purchasers were merely <lb/>nominees of the agents. It is also contended, that <lb/>after the Supreme Court had struck down the policy <lb/>under which the agents were to carry on business in <lb/>Kendu leaves on their own and to make profit for <lb/>themselves, the Government to help their party-men set <lb/>up a body of persons who were to be purchasers to whom <lb/>the monopoly sales were to be made at concessional <lb/>rates and that the benefit which would have otherwise <lb/>been earned by the State would now get diverted to <lb/>those purchasers. It was held: <lb/>&quot;15. <lb/>Section 10 of the Act is a counterpart <lb/>of Section 3 and authorises the Government to <lb/>sell or otherwise dispose of Kendu leaves in <lb/>such manner as the Government may direct. If the <lb/>monopoly of purchasing Kendu leaves by Section 3 <lb/>is valid, insofar as it is intended to be <lb/>administered only for the benefit of the State, <lb/>the sale or disposal of Kendu leaves by the <lb/>Government must also be in the public interest <lb/>and not to serve the private interest of any <lb/>person or class of persons. It is true that it <lb/>is for the Government, having regard to all the <lb/>circumstances, to act as a prudent businessman <lb/>would, and to sell or otherwise dispose of Kendu <lb/>leaves purchased under the monopoly acquired <lb/>under Section 3, but the profit resulting from <lb/>the sale must be for the public benefit and not <lb/>for private gain . Section 11 which provides that <lb/>out of the net profits derived by the Government <lb/>from the trade in Kendu leaves an amount not <lb/>less than one half is to be paid to the Samitis <lb/>and Gram Panchayats emphasises the concept that <lb/>the machinery of sale or disposal of Kendu <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 149 <lb/></note>

			<page> 150 <lb/></page>

			<body>leaves must also be quashed to serve the public <lb/>interest. If the scheme of disposal creates a <lb/>class of middlemen who would purchase from the <lb/>Government Kendu leaves at concessional rates <lb/>and would earn large profits disproportionate to <lb/>the nature of the service rendered or duty <lb/>performed <lb/>by <lb/>them, <lb/>it <lb/>cannot <lb/>claim <lb/>the <lb/>protection of Article 19(6)( ii ) . <lb/>16. <lb/>Section 10 leaves the method of sale <lb/>or disposal of Kendu leaves to the Government as <lb/>they think fit. The action of the Government if <lb/>conceived and executed in the interest of the <lb/>general public is not open to judicial scrutiny. <lb/>But it is not given to the Government thereby to <lb/>create a monopoly in favour of third parties <lb/>from their own monopoly . <lb/>17. <lb/>Validity of the schemes adopted by the <lb/>Government of Orissa for sale of Kendu leaves <lb/>must be adjudged in the light of Article 19(1) <lb/>(g) and Article 14. Instead of inviting tenders <lb/>the <lb/>Government <lb/>offered <lb/>to <lb/>certain <lb/>old <lb/>contractors the option to purchase Kendu leaves <lb/>for the year 1968 on terms mentioned therein. <lb/>The reason suggested by the Government that <lb/>these offers were made because the purchasers <lb/>had carried out their obligations in the <lb/>previous year to the satisfaction of the <lb/>Government is not of any significance. From the <lb/>affidavit filed by the State Government it <lb/>appears that the price fetched at public <lb/>auctions before and after January 1968, were <lb/>much higher than the prices at which Kendu <lb/>leaves were offered to the old contractors . The <lb/>Government realised that the scheme of offering <lb/>to enter into contracts with the old licensees <lb/>and to renew their terms was open to grave <lb/>objection, since it sought arbitrarily to <lb/>exclude many persons interested in the trade. <lb/>The Government then decided to invite offers for <lb/>advance purchases of Kendu leaves but restricted <lb/>the invitation to those individuals who had <lb/>carried out the contracts in the previous year <lb/>without default and to the satisfaction of the <lb/></body>

			<body>Government. By the new scheme instead of the <lb/>Government <lb/>making <lb/>an <lb/>offer, <lb/>the <lb/>existing <lb/>contractors were given the exclusive right to <lb/>make offers to purchase Kendu leaves. But <lb/>insofar as the right to make tenders for the <lb/>purchase of Kendu leaves was restricted to those <lb/>persons who had obtained contracts in the <lb/>previous year the scheme was open to the same <lb/>objection. The right to make offers being open <lb/>to a limited class of persons it effectively <lb/>shut out all other persons carrying on trade in <lb/>Kendu leaves and also new entrants into that <lb/>business. It was ex facie discriminatory, and <lb/>imposed unreasonable restrictions upon the right <lb/>of persons other than existing contractors to <lb/>carry on business. In our view, both the schemes <lb/>evolved by the Government were violative of the <lb/>fundamental right of the petitioners under <lb/>Article 19(1)( g ) and Article 14 because the <lb/>schemes gave rise to a monopoly in the trade in <lb/>Kendu leaves to certain traders, and singled out <lb/>other traders for discriminatory treatment . <lb/>18. <lb/>The <lb/>classification <lb/>based <lb/>on <lb/>the <lb/>circumstance that certain existing contractors <lb/>had carried out their obligations in the <lb/>previous year regularly and to the satisfaction <lb/>of the Government is not based on any real and <lb/>substantial distinction bearing a just and <lb/>reasonable relation to the object sought to be <lb/>achieved <lb/>i.e. <lb/>effective <lb/>execution <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>monopoly in the public interest. Exclusion of <lb/>all persons interested in the trade, who were <lb/>not in the previous year licensees is ex facie <lb/>arbitrary, it had no direct relation to the <lb/>object of preventing exploitation of pluckers <lb/>and growers of Kendu leaves, nor had it any just <lb/>or reasonable relation to the securing of the <lb/>full benefit from the trade to the State. <lb/>19. <lb/>Validity of the law by which the State <lb/>assumed the monopoly to trade in a given <lb/>commodity has to be judged by the test whether <lb/>the entire benefit arising therefrom is to enure <lb/>to the State, and the monopoly is not used as a <lb/></body>

			<body>cloak for conferring private benefit upon a <lb/>limited class of persons . The scheme adopted by <lb/>the Government first of offering to enter into <lb/>contracts with certain named licensees, and <lb/>later inviting tenders from licensees who had in <lb/>the previous year carried out their contracts <lb/>satisfactorily is liable to be adjudged void on <lb/>the ground that it unreasonably excludes traders <lb/>in Kendu leaves from carrying on their business. <lb/>The scheme of selling Kendu leaves to selected <lb/>purchasers or of accepting tenders only from a <lb/>specified <lb/>class <lb/>of <lb/>purchasers <lb/>was <lb/>not <lb/>&quot;integrally and essentially&quot; connected with the <lb/>creation of the monopoly and was not on the view <lb/>taken by this Court in Akadasi Padhan case, <lb/>(1963) Supp. 2 SCC 691, protected by Article <lb/>19(6)(ii): it had therefore to satisfy the <lb/>requirement of reasonableness under the first <lb/>part of Article 19(6). No attempt was made to <lb/>support the scheme on the ground that it imposed <lb/>reasonable <lb/>restrictions <lb/>on <lb/>the <lb/>fundamental <lb/>rights of the traders to carry on business in <lb/>Kendu leaves. The High Court also did not <lb/>consider whether the restrictions imposed upon <lb/>persons excluded from the benefit of trading <lb/>satisfied the test of reasonableness under the <lb/>first part of Article 19(6). The High Court <lb/>examined the problem from the angle whether the <lb/>action of the State Government was vitiated on <lb/>account of any oblique motive, and whether it <lb/>was such as a prudent person carrying on <lb/>business may adopt. <lb/>20. <lb/>No explanation has been attempted on <lb/>behalf of the State as to why an offer made by a <lb/>well known manufacturer of bidis interested in <lb/>the trade to purchase the entire crop of Kendu <lb/>leaves for the year 1968 for rupees three crores <lb/>was turned down. If the interests of the State <lb/>alone were to be taken into consideration, the <lb/>State stood to gain more than rupees one crore <lb/>by accepting that offer . We are not suggesting <lb/>that merely because that offer was made, the <lb/>Government <lb/>was <lb/>bound <lb/>to <lb/>accept <lb/>it. <lb/>The <lb/>Government <lb/>had <lb/>to <lb/>consider, <lb/>as <lb/>prudent <lb/></body>

			<body>businessman, whether, having regard to the <lb/>circumstances, it should accept the offer, <lb/>especially in the light of the financial <lb/>position of the offeror, the security which he <lb/>was willing to give and the effect which the <lb/>acceptance of the offer may have on the other <lb/>traders and the general public interest. <lb/>21. <lb/>The learned Judges of the High Court <lb/>have observed that in their view the exercise of <lb/>the discretion was not shown to be arbitrary, <lb/>nor was the action shown to be lacking in bona <lb/>fides. But that conclusion is open to criticism <lb/>that the Government is not shown to have <lb/>considered the prevailing prices of Kendu leaves <lb/>about the time when offers were made, the <lb/>estimated crop of Kendu leaves, the conditions <lb/>in the market and the likelihood of offerers at <lb/>higher prices carrying out their obligations, <lb/>and whether it was in the interests of the State <lb/>to invite tenders in the open market from all <lb/>persons whether they had or had not taken <lb/>contracts <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>previous <lb/>year. <lb/>If <lb/>the <lb/>Government was anxious to ensure due performance <lb/>by those who submitted tenders for purchase of <lb/>Kendu leaves, it was open to the Government to <lb/>devise adequate safeguards in that behalf. In <lb/>our judgment, the plea that the action of the <lb/>Government was bona fide cannot be an effective <lb/>answer to a claim made by a citizen that his <lb/>fundamental rights were infringed by the action <lb/>of the Government, nor can the claim of the <lb/>petitioners be defeated on the plea that the <lb/>Government in adopting the impugned scheme <lb/>committed an error of judgment. <lb/>22. <lb/>That plea would have assisted the <lb/>Government if the action was in law valid and <lb/>the objection was that the Government erred in <lb/>the <lb/>exercise <lb/>of <lb/>its <lb/>discretion. <lb/>It <lb/>is <lb/>unnecessary in the circumstances to consider <lb/>whether the Government acted in the interest of <lb/>their party-men and to increase party funds in <lb/>devising the schemes for sale of Kendu leaves in <lb/>1968. <lb/></body>

The persons to <lb/>whom the contracts were given are not before us, <lb/>and we cannot declare the contracts which had <lb/>been entered into by the Government for the sale <lb/>of Kendu leaves for the year 1968 unlawful in <lb/>these proceedings. Counsel for the appellants <lb/>agrees that it would be sufficient if it be <lb/>directed that the tenders for purchase of Kendu <lb/>leaves be invited by the Government in the next <lb/>season from all persons interested in the trade. <lb/>We trust that in accepting tenders, the State <lb/>Government will act in the interest of the <lb/>general public and not of any class of traders <lb/>so that in the next season the State may get the <lb/>entire benefit of the monopoly in the trade in <lb/>Kendu leaves and no disproportionate share <lb/>thereof may be diverted to any private agency . <lb/>Subject to these observations we make no further <lb/>order in the petitions out of which these <lb/>appeals arise.&quot; <lb/>(emphasis is mine) <lb/>A perusal of the observations made by this Court <lb/>reveal, that the Government must act as a prudent <lb/>businessman, and that, the profit earned should be for <lb/>public benefit and not for private gains. <lb/>A plea of <lb/>reasonable restriction raised under Article 19(6) of <lb/>the Constitution of India to save the governmental <lb/>action was rejected on the ground that the scheme <lb/>created middlemen who would earn large disproportionate <lb/>profits. <lb/>This Court also held the action to be <lb/>discriminatory because it excluded others like the <lb/></body>

			<body>petitioners from the zone of consideration. Finally, a <lb/>direction came to be issued by this Court requiring the <lb/>Government to act in the interest of the general public <lb/>and to invite tenders so that the State may earn the <lb/>entire benefit in a manner that no disproportionate <lb/>profits are diverted to any private agency. <lb/>(c) <lb/>Reliance was also placed on Ramana Dayaram <lb/>Shetty Vs. International Airport Authority of India &amp; <lb/>Ors., (1979) 3 SCC 489, wherein this Court held as <lb/>under: <lb/>&quot;21. <lb/>This rule also flows directly from the <lb/>doctrine of equality embodied in Article 14. It is <lb/>now well-settled as a result of the decisions of <lb/>this Court in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu, <lb/>(1974) 4 SCC 3, and Maneka Gandhi v. Union of <lb/>India, (1978) 1 SCC 248, that Article 14 strikes <lb/>at arbitrariness in State action and ensures <lb/>fairness and equality of treatment. It requires <lb/>that State action must not be arbitrary but must <lb/>be based on some rational and relevant principle <lb/>which is non-discriminatory: it must not be guided <lb/>by any extraneous or irrelevant considerations, <lb/>because that would be denial of equality . The <lb/>principle of reasonableness and rationality which <lb/>is legally as well as philosophically an essential <lb/>element <lb/>of <lb/>equality <lb/>or <lb/>non-arbitrariness <lb/>is <lb/>projected by Article 14 and it must characterise <lb/>every State action, whether it be under authority <lb/>of law or in exercise of executive power without <lb/>making of law. The State cannot, therefore, act <lb/>arbitrarily <lb/>in <lb/>entering <lb/>into <lb/>relationship, <lb/>contractual or otherwise with a third party, but <lb/>its action must conform to some standard or norm <lb/>which is rational and non-discriminatory . This <lb/>principle was recognised and applied by a Bench of <lb/></body>

			<body>this Court presided over by Ray, C.J., in Erusian <lb/>Equipment and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of West <lb/>Bengal (supra) where the learned Chief Justice <lb/>pointed out that-<lb/>&quot;the State can carry on executive function <lb/>by making a law or without making a law. <lb/>The exercise of such powers and functions <lb/>in trade by the State is subject to Part <lb/>III of the Constitution. Article 14 speaks <lb/>of equality before the law and equal <lb/>protection <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>laws. <lb/>Equality <lb/>of <lb/>opportunity should apply to matters of <lb/>public contracts. The State has the right <lb/>to trade. The State has there the duty to <lb/>observe equality. An ordinary individual <lb/>can choose not to deal with any person. The <lb/>Government cannot choose to exclude persons <lb/>by <lb/>discrimination . <lb/>The <lb/>order <lb/>of <lb/>blacklisting has the effect of depriving a <lb/>person of equality of opportunity in the <lb/>matter of public contract. A person who is <lb/>on the approved list is unable to enter <lb/>into <lb/>advantageous <lb/>relations <lb/>with <lb/>the <lb/>Government <lb/>because <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>order <lb/>of <lb/>blacklisting .... A citizen has a right to <lb/>claim equal treatment to enter into a <lb/>contract which may be proper, necessary and <lb/>essential to his lawful calling .... It is <lb/>true that neither the petitioner nor the <lb/>respondent has any right to enter into a <lb/>contract but they are entitled to equal <lb/>treatment with others who offer tender or <lb/>quotations for the purchase of the goods&quot;. <lb/>It <lb/>must, <lb/>therefore <lb/>follow <lb/>as <lb/>a <lb/>necessary <lb/>corollary <lb/>from <lb/>the <lb/>principle <lb/>of <lb/>equality <lb/>enshrined in Article 14 that though the State is <lb/>entitled to refuse to enter into relationship <lb/>with any one, yet if it does so, it cannot <lb/>arbitrarily choose any person it likes for <lb/>entering into such relationship and discriminate <lb/>between persons similarly circumstanced, but it <lb/>must act in conformity with some standard or <lb/>principle which meets the test of reasonableness <lb/>and non-discrimination and any departure from <lb/></body>

			<body>such standard or principle would be invalid <lb/>unless it can be supported or justified on some <lb/>rational and non discriminatory ground . <lb/>22. <lb/>It is interesting to find that this <lb/>rule was recognised and applied by a Constitution <lb/>Bench of this Court in a case of sale of kendu <lb/>leaves by the Government of Orissa in Rashbihari <lb/>Panda v. State of Orissa, (1969) 1 SCC 414….. <lb/>This decision wholly supports the view we are <lb/>taking in regard to the applicability of the rule <lb/>against arbitrariness in State action.&quot; <lb/>(emphasis is mine) <lb/>An analysis of the aforesaid determination by this <lb/>Court would lead to the inference that the State has <lb/>the right to trade. <lb/>In executing public contracts in <lb/>its trading activity the State must be guided by <lb/>relevant <lb/>principles, <lb/>and <lb/>not <lb/>by <lb/>extraneous <lb/>or <lb/>irrelevant consideration. The same should be based on <lb/>reasonableness <lb/>and <lb/>rationality <lb/>as <lb/>well <lb/>as <lb/>non-<lb/>arbitrariness. It came to be concluded, that the State <lb/>while entering into a contractual relationship, was <lb/>bound to maintain the standards referred to above. And <lb/>any departure from the said standards would be invalid <lb/>unless the same is supported by good reasons. <lb/>(d) <lb/>Our attention was also invited to the decision <lb/>rendered in Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy Vs. State of <lb/>Jammu &amp; Kashmir &amp; Anr., (1980) 4 SCC 1, wherein the <lb/></body>

			<body>factual background as well as, the legal position came <lb/>to be expressed in paragraph 19 of the judgment which <lb/>is being set out below: <lb/>&quot;19. <lb/>It is clear from the backdrop of the <lb/>facts and circumstances in which the impugned <lb/>Order came to be made and the terms and <lb/>conditions set out in the impugned Order that it <lb/>was not a tapping contract simpliciter which was <lb/>intended to be given to the second respondents. <lb/>The second respondents wanted to be assured of <lb/>regular supply of raw material in the shape of <lb/>resin before they could decide to set up a <lb/>factory within the State and it was for the <lb/>purpose of ensuring supply of such raw material <lb/>that the impugned Order was made giving tapping <lb/>contract to the second respondents. It was <lb/>really by way of allocation of raw material for <lb/>running the factory that the impugned Order was <lb/>passed. The terms of the impugned Order show <lb/>beyond doubt that the second respondents were <lb/>under an obligation to set up a factory within <lb/>the State and that 3500 metric tonnes of resin <lb/>which was permitted to be retained by the second <lb/>respondents out of the resin extracted by them <lb/>was required to be utilised in the factory to be <lb/>set up by them and it was provided that no part <lb/>of the resin extracted should be allowed to be <lb/>removed outside the State. The whole object of <lb/>the impugned Order was to make available 3500 <lb/>metric tonnes of resin to the second respondents <lb/>for the purpose of running the factory to be set <lb/>up by them. The advantage to the State was that <lb/>a <lb/>new <lb/>factory <lb/>for <lb/>manufacture <lb/>of <lb/>rosin, <lb/>turpentine oil and other derivatives would come <lb/>up within its territories offering more job <lb/>opportunities to the people of the State <lb/>increasing their prosperity and augmenting the <lb/>State revenues and in addition the State would <lb/>be assured of a definite supply of at least 1500 <lb/>metric tonnes of resin for itself without any <lb/>financial involvement or risk and with this <lb/>additional quantity of resin available to it, it <lb/></body>

			<body>would be able to set up another factory creating <lb/>more employment opportunities and, in fact, as <lb/>the counter-affidavit of Ghulam Rasul, Under-<lb/>Secretary to the Government filed on behalf of <lb/>the State shows the Government lost no time in <lb/>taking steps to set up a public sector resin <lb/>distillation plant in a far-flung area of the <lb/>State, namely, Sundarbani, in Rajouri District. <lb/>Moreover, the State would be able to secure <lb/>extraction of resin from these inaccessible <lb/>areas on the best possible terms instead of <lb/>allowing them to remain unexploited or given <lb/>over at ridiculously low royalty. We cannot <lb/>accept the contention of the petitioners that <lb/>under the impugned Order a huge benefit was <lb/>conferred on the second respondents at the cost <lb/>of the State. It is clear from the terms of the <lb/>impugned Order that the second respondents would <lb/>have to extract at least 5000 metric tonnes of <lb/>resin from the blazes allotted to them in order <lb/>to be entitled to retain 3500 metric tonnes. The <lb/>counter-affidavit of Ghulam Rasul on behalf of <lb/>the first respondent and Guran Devaya on behalf <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>second <lb/>respondents <lb/>show <lb/>that <lb/>the <lb/>estimated cost of extraction and collection of <lb/>resin from these inaccessible areas would be at <lb/>the least Rs 175 per quintal, though according <lb/>to Guran Devaya it would be in the neighbourhood <lb/>of Rs.200 per quintal, but even if we take the <lb/>cost at the minimum figure of Rs.175 per <lb/>quintal, the total cost of extraction and <lb/>collection would come to Rs.87,50,000 and on <lb/>this investment of Rs.87,50,000 required to be <lb/>made by the second respondents the amount of <lb/>interest at the prevailing bank rate would work <lb/>out to about Rs.13,00,000. Now, as against this <lb/>expenditure of Rs 87,50,000 plus Rs.13,00,000 <lb/>the second respondents would be entitled to <lb/>claim from the State, in respect of 1500 metric <lb/>tonnes of resin to be delivered to it only at <lb/>the rate sanctioned by the Forest Department for <lb/>the adjoining accessible forests which were <lb/>being worked on wage-contract basis. It is <lb/>stated in the counter-affidavits of Ghulam Rasul <lb/>and Guran Devaya and this statement is not <lb/></body>

			<body>seriously <lb/>challenged <lb/>on <lb/>behalf <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>petitioners, that the cost of extraction and <lb/>collection <lb/>as <lb/>sanctioned <lb/>by <lb/>the <lb/>Forest <lb/>Department for the adjoining accessible forests <lb/>given on wage-contract basis in the year 1978-79 <lb/>was <lb/>Rs.114 <lb/>per <lb/>quintal <lb/>and <lb/>the <lb/>second <lb/>respondents would, thus, be entitled to claim <lb/>from the State no more than Rs.114 per quintal <lb/>in respect of 1500 metric tonnes to be delivered <lb/>to it and apart from bearing the difference <lb/>between the actual cost of extraction and <lb/>collection and the amount received from the <lb/>State at the rate of Rs.114 per quintal in <lb/>respect of 1500 metric tonnes, the second <lb/>respondents would have to pay the price of the <lb/>remaining 3500 metric tonnes to be retained by <lb/>them at the rate of Rs.350 per quintal. On this <lb/>reckoning, the cost of 3500 metric tonnes to be <lb/>retained by the second respondents would work <lb/>out at Rs.474 per quintal. The result would be <lb/>that under the impugned Order the State would <lb/>get 1500 metric tonnes of resin at the rate of <lb/>Rs.114 per quintal while the second respondents <lb/>would have to pay at the rate of Rs.474 per <lb/>quintal for the balance of 3500 metric tonnes <lb/>retained by them. Obviously, a large benefit <lb/>would accrue to the State under the impugned <lb/>Order. If the State were to get the blazes in <lb/>these inaccessible areas tapped through wage <lb/>contract, the minimum cost would be Rs.175 per <lb/>quintal, <lb/>without <lb/>taking <lb/>into <lb/>account <lb/>the <lb/>additional expenditure on account of interest, <lb/>but under the impugned Order the State would get <lb/>1500 metric tonnes of resin at a greatly reduced <lb/>rate of Rs.114 per quintal without any risk or <lb/>hazard. The State would also receive for 3500 <lb/>metric tonnes of resin retained by the second <lb/>respondents price or royalty at the rate of <lb/>Rs.474 per quintal which would be much higher <lb/>than the rate of Rs.260 per quintal at which the <lb/>State was allotting resin to medium scale <lb/>industrial units and the rate of Rs.320 per <lb/>quintal at which it was allotting resin to small <lb/>scale units within the State. It is difficult to <lb/>see how on these facts the impugned Order could <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 160 <lb/></note>

			<page> 161 <lb/></page>

			<body>be said to be disadvantageous to the State or in <lb/>any way favouring the second respondents at the <lb/>cost <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>State. <lb/>The <lb/>argument <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>petitioners was that at the auctions held in <lb/>December 1978, January 1979 and April 1979, the <lb/>price of resin realised was as much as Rs.484, <lb/>Rs.520 and Rs.700 per quintal respectively and <lb/>when the market price was so high, it was <lb/>improper and contrary to public interest on the <lb/>part of the State to sell resin to the second <lb/>respondents at the rate of Rs.320 per quintal <lb/>under <lb/>the <lb/>impugned <lb/>Order. <lb/>This <lb/>argument, <lb/>plausible though it may seem, is fallacious <lb/>because it does not take into account the policy <lb/>of the State not to allow export of resin <lb/>outside its territories but to allot it only for <lb/>use in factories set up within the State. It is <lb/>obvious that, in view of this policy, no resin <lb/>would be auctioned by the State and there would <lb/>be no question of sale of resin in the open <lb/>market and in this situation, it would be <lb/>totally irrelevant to import the concept of <lb/>market price with reference to which the <lb/>adequacy of the price charged by the State to <lb/>the 2nd respondents could be judged. If the <lb/>State were simply selling resin, there can be no <lb/>doubt that the State must endeavour to obtain <lb/>the highest price subject, of course, to any <lb/>other <lb/>overriding <lb/>considerations <lb/>of <lb/>public <lb/>interest and in that event, its action in giving <lb/>resin to a private individual at a lesser price <lb/>would be arbitrary and contrary to public <lb/>interest. But, where the State has, as a matter <lb/>of policy, stopped selling resin to outsiders <lb/>and decided to allot it only to industries set <lb/>up <lb/>within <lb/>the <lb/>State <lb/>for <lb/>the <lb/>purpose <lb/>of <lb/>encouraging industrialisation, there can be no <lb/>scope for complaint that the State is giving <lb/>resin at a lesser price than that which could be <lb/>obtained in the open market. The yardstick of <lb/>price in the open market would be wholly inept, <lb/>because in view of the State policy, there would <lb/>be no question of any resin being sold in the <lb/>open market. The object of the State in such a <lb/>case is not to earn revenue from sale of resin, <lb/></body>

			<body>but to promote the setting up of industries <lb/>within the State . Moreover, the prices realised <lb/>at the auctions held in December 1978, January <lb/>1979 and April 1979 did not reflect the correct <lb/>and genuine price of resin, because by the time <lb/>these auctions came to be held, it had become <lb/>known that the State had taken a policy decision <lb/>to ban export of resin from its territories with <lb/>effect from 1979-80 and the prices realised at <lb/>the auctions were therefore scarcity prices. In <lb/>fact, the auction held in April 1979 was the <lb/>last auction in the State and since it was known <lb/>that in future no resin would be available for <lb/>sale by auction in the open market to outsiders, <lb/>an unduly high price of Rs.700 per quintal was <lb/>offered by the factory owners having their <lb/>factories outside the State, so that they would <lb/>get as much resin for the purpose of feeding <lb/>their industrial units for some time. The <lb/>counter-affidavits show that, in fact, the <lb/>average sale price of resin realised during the <lb/>year 1978-79 was only Rs.433 per quintal and as <lb/>compared to this price, the 2nd respondents were <lb/>required to pay price or royalty at a higher <lb/>rate of Rs.474 per quintal for 3500 metric <lb/>tonnes of resin to be retained by them under the <lb/>impugned Order. It is in the circumstances <lb/>impossible to see how it can at all be said that <lb/>any <lb/>benefit <lb/>was <lb/>conferred <lb/>on <lb/>the <lb/>second <lb/>respondents at the cost of the State. The first <lb/>head of challenge against the impugned Order <lb/>must, therefore, be rejected.&quot; <lb/>(emphasis is mine) <lb/>An examination of the factual position of the <lb/>controversy dealt with in the judgment extracted above <lb/>reveals, that the State Government formulated a policy <lb/>to set up a factory within the State, which would <lb/>result in creation of more job opportunities for the <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 162<lb/></note>

			<body>people of the State. <lb/>The setting up of the said <lb/>factory would assure the State of atleast 1500 metric <lb/>tones of resin without any financial involvement. This <lb/>in turn would enable the State to set up another <lb/>factory creating further employment opportunities for <lb/>the people of the State. <lb/>It is therefore, that this <lb/>Court concluded that the impugned order passed by the <lb/>State in favour of the second respondent could not be <lb/>said to be disadvantageous to the State and favouring <lb/>the second respondent. <lb/>In a manner of understanding, <lb/>this Court found no infirmity in the impugned order <lb/>passed by the State Government because the State <lb/>Government had given effect to a policy which would <lb/>&quot;best subserve the common good&quot; of the inhabitants of <lb/>the State (as in Article 39(b) of the Constitution of <lb/>India) while assigning a material resource, though no <lb/>reference was made to Article 39(b) of the Constitution <lb/>of India in the judgment. What is also of importance <lb/>is, that this Court expressly noticed, that if the <lb/>State Government was simply selling resin, it was <lb/>obliged to obtain the highest possible price. <lb/>(e) <lb/>Reference was then made to Dwarkadas Marfatia <lb/>and Sons Vs.

It was further asserted, <lb/>that there was no challenge to this evidence in cross-<lb/>examination.

It is for the party challenging <lb/>its validity to show that the action is <lb/>unreasonable, arbitrary or contrary to the <lb/>professed norms or not informed by public <lb/>interest, and the burden is a heavy one. <lb/>….. <lb/>…... <lb/>37. <lb/>As we look upon the facts of this <lb/></body>

Once that <lb/>norm is established whether that policy is the <lb/>best policy or whether another policy was <lb/>possible, is not relevant for consideration. It <lb/>is, therefore, not necessary for our present <lb/>purposes to dwell on the question whether the <lb/>obligation of the Port Trust authorities to act <lb/>in pursuance of a public purpose was a public <lb/>law purpose or a private law purpose.

			<body>observations of this Court in Radha Krishna Agarwal <lb/>v. State of Bihar, (1977) 3 SCC 457. It appears to <lb/>us, <lb/>at <lb/>the <lb/>outset, <lb/>that <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>facts <lb/>and <lb/>circumstances of the case, the respondent company <lb/>IOC is an organ of the State or an instrumentality <lb/>of the State as contemplated under Article 12 of the <lb/>Constitution. The State acts in its executive power <lb/>under Article 298 of the Constitution in entering or <lb/>not entering in contracts with individual parties. <lb/>Article 14 of the Constitution would be applicable <lb/>to those exercises of power . Therefore, the action <lb/>of State organ under Article 14 can be checked. See <lb/>Radha Krishna Agarwal v. State of Bihar at p. 462, <lb/>but Article 14 of the Constitution cannot and has <lb/>not been construed as a charter for judicial review <lb/>of State action after the contract has been entered <lb/>into, to call upon the State to account for its <lb/>actions in its manifold activities by stating <lb/>reasons for such actions. In a situation of this <lb/>nature certain activities of the respondent company <lb/>which constituted State under Article 12 of the <lb/>Constitution may be in certain circumstances subject <lb/>to Article 14 of the Constitution in entering or not <lb/>entering into contracts and must be reasonable and <lb/>taken only upon lawful and relevant consideration; <lb/>it depends upon facts and circumstances of a <lb/>particular transaction whether hearing is necessary <lb/>and reasons have to be stated. In case any right <lb/>conferred on the citizens which is sought to be <lb/>interfered, such action is subject to Article 14 of <lb/>the Constitution, and must be reasonable and can be <lb/>taken only upon lawful and relevant grounds of <lb/>public interest. <lb/>Where there is arbitrariness in <lb/>State action of this type of entering or not <lb/>entering into contracts, Article 14 springs up and <lb/>judicial review strikes such an action down. Every <lb/>action of the State executive authority must be <lb/>subject to rule of law and must be informed by <lb/>reason. So, whatever be the activity of the public <lb/>authority, <lb/>in <lb/>such <lb/>monopoly <lb/>or <lb/>semi-monopoly <lb/>dealings, it should meet the test of Article 14 of <lb/>the Constitution. If a governmental action even in <lb/>the matters of entering or not entering into <lb/>contracts, <lb/>fails <lb/>to <lb/>satisfy <lb/>the <lb/>test <lb/>of <lb/>reasonableness, the same would be unreasonable .

			<body> this connection reference may be made to E.P. <lb/>Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu, (1974) 4 SCC 3, <lb/>Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248, <lb/>Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi, (1981) 1 SCC <lb/>722, R.D. Shetty v. International Airport Authority <lb/>of India, (1979) 3 SCC 489, and also Dwarkadas <lb/>Marfatia and Sons v. Board of Trustees of the Port <lb/>of Bombay, (1989) 3 SCC 293. It appears to us that <lb/>rule of reason and rule against arbitrariness and <lb/>discrimination, rules of fair play and natural <lb/>justice are part of the rule of law applicable in <lb/>situation or action by State instrumentality in <lb/>dealing with citizens in a situation like the <lb/>present one. Even though the rights of the citizens <lb/>are in the nature of contractual rights, the manner, <lb/>the method and motive of a decision of entering or <lb/>not entering into a contract, are subject to <lb/>judicial review on the touchstone of relevance and <lb/>reasonableness, fair play, natural justice, equality <lb/>and <lb/>non-discrimination <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>type <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>transactions and nature of the dealing as in the <lb/>present case . <lb/>….. <lb/>….. <lb/>17. <lb/>We are of the opinion that in all such cases <lb/>whether public law or private law rights are <lb/>involved, depends upon the facts and circumstances <lb/>of the case. The dichotomy between rights and <lb/>remedies cannot be obliterated by any strait-jacket <lb/>formula. It has to be examined in each particular <lb/>case. Mr Salve sought to urge that there are certain <lb/>cases under Article 14 of arbitrary exercise of such <lb/>&quot;power&quot; and not cases of exercise of a &quot;right&quot; <lb/>arising either under a contract or under a statute. <lb/>We are of the opinion that that would depend upon <lb/>the factual matrix. <lb/>18. <lb/>Having considered the facts and circumstances <lb/>of the case and the nature of the contentions and <lb/>the dealing between the parties and in view of the <lb/>present state of law, we are of the opinion that <lb/>decision of the State/public authority under Article <lb/>298 of the Constitution, is an administrative <lb/>decision and can be impeached on the ground that the <lb/>decision is arbitrary or violative of Article 14 of <lb/></body>

			<body>the Constitution of India on any of the grounds <lb/>available in public law field . It appears to us that <lb/>in respect of corporation like IOC when without <lb/>informing the parties concerned, as in the case of <lb/>the appellant-firm herein on alleged change of <lb/>policy and on that basis action to seek to bring to <lb/>an end to course of transaction over 18 years <lb/>involving large amounts of money is not fair action, <lb/>especially in view of the monopolistic nature of the <lb/>power of the respondent in this field. Therefore, it <lb/>is necessary to reiterate that even in the field of <lb/>public law, the relevant persons concerned or to be <lb/>affected, should be taken into confidence. Whether <lb/>and in what circumstances that confidence should be <lb/>taken into consideration cannot be laid down on any <lb/>strait-jacket basis. It depends on the nature of the <lb/>right involved and nature of the power sought to be <lb/>exercised in a particular situation. It is true that <lb/>there is discrimination between power and right but <lb/>whether the State or the instrumentality of a State <lb/>has the right to function in public field or private <lb/>field is a matter which, in our opinion, depends <lb/>upon the facts and circumstances of the situation, <lb/>but such exercise of power cannot be dealt with by <lb/>the State or the instrumentality of the State <lb/>without informing and taking into confidence, the <lb/>party whose rights and powers are affected or sought <lb/>to be affected , into confidence. In such situations <lb/>most often people feel aggrieved by exclusion of <lb/>knowledge if not taken into confidence. <lb/>19. <lb/>Such <lb/>transaction <lb/>should <lb/>continue <lb/>as <lb/>an <lb/>administrative decision with the organ of the State. <lb/>It may be contractual or statutory but in a <lb/>situation of transaction between the parties for <lb/>nearly two decades, such procedure should be <lb/>followed which will be reasonable, fair and just, <lb/>that is, the process which normally be accepted ( sic <lb/>is expected) to be followed by an organ of the State <lb/>and that process must be conscious and all those <lb/>affected should be taken into confidence . <lb/>20. <lb/>Having <lb/>regard <lb/>to <lb/>the <lb/>nature <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>transaction, we are of the opinion that it would be <lb/>appropriate to state that in cases where the <lb/></body>

			<body>instrumentality of the state enters the contractual <lb/>field, it should be governed by the incidence of the <lb/>contract. It is true that it may not be necessary to <lb/>give reasons but, in our opinion, in the field of <lb/>this nature fairness must be there to the parties <lb/>concerned, and having regard to the large number or <lb/>the long period and the nature of the dealings <lb/>between the parties, the appellant should have been <lb/>taken into confidence. Equality and fairness at <lb/>least demands this much from an instrumentality of <lb/>the State dealing with a right of the State not to <lb/>treat the contract as subsisting. We must, however, <lb/>evolve such process which will work. <lb/>….. <lb/>….. <lb/>23. <lb/>It is not our decision which is important but <lb/>a decision on the above basis should be arrived at <lb/>which should be fair, just and reasonable -and <lb/>consistent with good government -which will be <lb/>arrived at fairly and should be taken after taking <lb/>the persons concerned whose rights/obligations are <lb/>affected, into confidence. Fairness in such action <lb/>should be perceptible, if not transparent .&quot; <lb/>(emphasis is mine) <lb/>What came to be concluded in the judgment extracted <lb/>above can be described as an extension of the <lb/>applicability of Article 14 of the Constitution of <lb/>India on the subject of contractual agreements. <lb/>Hithertobefore, an act of awarding contracts was <lb/>adjudged on the touchstone of fairness. For the first <lb/>time, even a decision of not entering into a <lb/>contractual arrangement has been brought under the <lb/>scope of judicial review. <lb/>The requirement of being <lb/>fair, just and reasonable, i.e., principles applicable <lb/></body>

			<body>in good governance, have been held to be equally <lb/>applicable <lb/>for <lb/>not <lb/>entering <lb/>into <lb/>a <lb/>contractual <lb/>arrangement. <lb/>Another facet of the aforesaid decision <lb/>was, that this Court expressed, that the contracting <lb/>party had the right to be informed (the right to know) <lb/>why the contractual arrangement which had continued for <lb/>long years (from 1965 to 1983) was being terminated. <lb/>(g) <lb/>Much emphasis was placed on the judgment <lb/>rendered by this Court in Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi &amp; <lb/>Ors. Vs. State of U.P. &amp; Ors. (1991) 1 SCC 212. <lb/>Observations which relied upon during the course of <lb/>hearing are being set out hereinunder: <lb/>21. <lb/>The Preamble of the Constitution of <lb/>India resolves to secure to all its citizens <lb/>Justice, social, economic and political; and <lb/>Equality of status and opportunity. Every State <lb/>action must be aimed at achieving this goal. Part <lb/>IV of the Constitution contains &apos;Directives <lb/>Principles of State Policy&apos; which are fundamental <lb/>in the governance of the country and are aimed at <lb/>securing <lb/>social <lb/>and <lb/>economic <lb/>freedoms <lb/>by <lb/>appropriate State action which is complementary <lb/>to individual fundamental rights guaranteed in <lb/>Part III for protection against excesses of State <lb/>action, to realise the vision in the Preamble. <lb/>This being the philosophy of the Constitution, <lb/>can it be said that it contemplates exclusion of <lb/>Article 14 -non-arbitrariness which is basic to <lb/>rule of law -from State actions in contractual <lb/>field when all actions of the State are meant for <lb/>public good and expected to be fair and just? We <lb/>have no doubt that the Constitution does not <lb/>envisage or permit unfairness or unreasonableness <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 171 <lb/></note>

			<page>  172 <lb/></page>

			<body>in State actions in any sphere of its activity <lb/>contrary to the professed ideals in the Preamble. <lb/>In our opinion, it would be alien to the <lb/>constitutional scheme to accept the argument of <lb/>exclusion of Article 14 in contractual matters . <lb/>The scope and permissible grounds of judicial <lb/>review in such matters and the relief which may <lb/>be available are different matters but that does <lb/>not justify the view of its total exclusion. This <lb/>is more so when the modern trend is also to <lb/>examine the unreasonableness of a term in such <lb/>contracts where the bargaining power is unequal <lb/>so that these are not negotiated contracts but <lb/>standard form contracts between unequals . <lb/>22. <lb/>There is an obvious difference in the <lb/>contracts between private parties and contracts <lb/>to which the State is a party. Private parties <lb/>are concerned only with their personal interest <lb/>whereas the State while exercising its powers and <lb/>discharging its functions, acts indubitably, as <lb/>is expected of it, for public good and in public <lb/>interest. The impact of every State action is <lb/>also on public interest. This factor alone is <lb/>sufficient to import at least the minimal <lb/>requirements of public law obligations and <lb/>impress with this character the contracts made by <lb/>the State or its instrumentality . It is a <lb/>different matter that the scope of judicial <lb/>review in respect of disputes falling within the <lb/>domain of contractual obligations may be more <lb/>limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be <lb/>relegated to adjudication of their rights by <lb/>resort to remedies provided for adjudication of <lb/>purely contractual disputes. However, to the <lb/>extent, challenge is made on the ground of <lb/>violation of Article 14 by alleging that the <lb/>impugned <lb/>act <lb/>is <lb/>arbitrary, <lb/>unfair <lb/>or <lb/>unreasonable, the fact that the dispute also <lb/>falls <lb/>within <lb/>the <lb/>domain <lb/>of <lb/>contractual <lb/>obligations would not relieve the State of its <lb/>obligation to comply with the basic requirements <lb/>of Article 14 . To this extent, the obligation is <lb/>of a public character invariably in every case <lb/>irrespective of there being any other right or <lb/></body>

			<body>obligation in addition thereto. An additional <lb/>contractual obligation cannot divest the claimant <lb/>of the guarantee under Article 14 of non-<lb/>arbitrariness at the hands of the State in any of <lb/>its actions. <lb/>23. <lb/>Thus, in a case like the present, if it <lb/>is shown that the impugned State action is <lb/>arbitrary and, therefore, violative of Article 14 <lb/>of the Constitution, there can be no impediment <lb/>in striking down the impugned act irrespective of <lb/>the <lb/>question <lb/>whether <lb/>an <lb/>additional <lb/>right, <lb/>contractual or statutory, if any, is also <lb/>available to the aggrieved persons . <lb/>24. <lb/>The State cannot be attributed the <lb/>split personality of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the <lb/>contractual field so as to impress on it all the <lb/>characteristics of the State at the threshold <lb/>while making a contract requiring it to fulfil <lb/>the obligation of Article 14 of the Constitution <lb/>and thereafter permitting it to cast off its garb <lb/>of State to adorn the new robe of a private body <lb/>during the subsistence of the contract enabling <lb/>it to act arbitrarily subject only to the <lb/>contractual obligations and remedies flowing from <lb/>it. It is really the nature of its personality as <lb/>State which is significant and must characterize <lb/>all its actions, in whatever field, and not the <lb/>nature of function, contractual or otherwise, <lb/>which is decisive of the nature of scrutiny <lb/>permitted for examining the validity of its act. <lb/>The requirement of Article 14 being the duty to <lb/>act fairly, justly and reasonably, there is <lb/>nothing which militates against the concept of <lb/>requiring the State always to so act, even in <lb/>contractual matters . There is a basic difference <lb/>between the acts of the State which must <lb/>invariably be in pubic interest and those of a <lb/>private <lb/>individual, <lb/>engaged <lb/>in <lb/>similar <lb/>activities, being primarily for personal gain, <lb/>which may or may not promote public interest. <lb/>Viewed in this manner, in which we find no <lb/>conceptual difficulty or anachronism, we find no <lb/></body>

			<page> 174 <lb/></page>

			<body>reason why the requirement of Article 14 should <lb/>not extend even in the sphere of contractual <lb/>matters for regulating the conduct of the State <lb/>activity. <lb/>25. <lb/>In Wade: Administrative Law (6th edn.) <lb/>after indicating that &apos;the powers of public <lb/>authorities are essentially different from those <lb/>of private persons&apos;, it has been succinctly <lb/>stated at pp. 400-01 as under: <lb/>&quot;... The whole conception of unfettered <lb/>discretion is inappropriate to a public <lb/>authority, which possesses powers solely in <lb/>order that it may use them for the public <lb/>good. <lb/>There <lb/>is <lb/>nothing <lb/>paradoxical <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>imposition of such legal limits. It would <lb/>indeed be paradoxical if they were not <lb/>imposed. Nor is this principle an oddity of <lb/>British or American law: it is equally <lb/>prominent in French law. Nor is it a <lb/>special restriction which fetters only <lb/>local authorities: it applies no less to <lb/>ministers of the Crown. Nor is it confined <lb/>to <lb/>the <lb/>sphere <lb/>of <lb/>administration: <lb/>it <lb/>operates wherever discretion is given for <lb/>some public purpose , for example where a <lb/>judge has a discretion to order jury trial. <lb/>It is only where powers are given for the <lb/>personal benefit of the person empowered <lb/>that the discretion is absolute. Plainly <lb/>this can have no application in public law. <lb/>For the same reasons there should in <lb/>principle be no such thing as unreviewable <lb/>administrative discretion, which should be <lb/>just as much a contradiction in terms as <lb/>unfettered discretion . The question which <lb/>has to be asked is what is the scope of <lb/>judicial review, and in a few special cases <lb/>the scope for the review of discretionary <lb/>decisions <lb/>may <lb/>be <lb/>minimal. <lb/>It <lb/>remains <lb/>axiomatic that all discretion is capable of <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 174 <lb/></note>

			<page> 175 <lb/></page>

			<body> abuse, and that legal limits to every power <lb/>are to be found somewhere. <lb/>The view, we are taking, is, therefore, in <lb/>consonance with the current thought in this <lb/>field. We have no doubt that the scope of <lb/>judicial review may vary with reference to the <lb/>type of matter involved, but the fact that the <lb/>action is reviewable, irrespective of the sphere <lb/>in which it is exercised, cannot be doubted. <lb/>26. <lb/>A useful treatment of the subject is to <lb/>be found in an article &quot;Judicial Review and <lb/>Contractual Powers of Public Authorities&quot;, (1990) <lb/>106 LQR 277-92. The conclusion drawn in the <lb/>article on the basis of recent English decisions <lb/>is that &quot;public law principles designed to <lb/>protect the citizens should apply because of the <lb/>public nature of the body, and they may have some <lb/>role in protecting the public interest&quot;. The <lb/>trend <lb/>now <lb/>is <lb/>towards <lb/>judicial <lb/>review <lb/>of <lb/>contractual powers and the other activities of <lb/>the government. Reference is made also to the <lb/>recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Jones <lb/>v. Swansea City Council, (1990) 1 WLR 54, where <lb/>the court&apos;s clear inclination to the view that <lb/>contractual powers should generally be reviewable <lb/>is indicated, even though the Court of Appeal <lb/>faltered at the last step and refrained from <lb/>saying so. It is significant to note that <lb/>emphasis now is on reviewability of every State <lb/>action because it stems not from the nature of <lb/>function, but from the public nature of the body <lb/>exercising <lb/>that <lb/>function; <lb/>and <lb/>all <lb/>powers <lb/>possessed by a public authority, howsoever <lb/>conferred, are possessed &apos; solely in order that it <lb/>may use them for the public good &apos; . The only <lb/>exception limiting the same is to be found in <lb/>specific cases where such exclusion may be <lb/>desirable for strong reasons of public policy . <lb/>This, however, does not justify exclusion of <lb/>reviewability in the contractual field involving <lb/>the State since it is no longer a mere private <lb/>activity to be excluded from public view or <lb/>scrutiny. <lb/></body>

			<body>27. <lb/>Unlike a private party whose acts <lb/>uninformed by reason and influenced by personal <lb/>predilections in contractual matters may result <lb/>in adverse consequences to it alone without <lb/>affecting the public interest, any such act of <lb/>the State or a public body even in this field <lb/>would adversely affect the public interest. Every <lb/>holder of a public office by virtue of which he <lb/>acts on behalf of the State or public body is <lb/>ultimately accountable to the people in whom the <lb/>sovereignty vests. As such, all powers so vested <lb/>in him are meant to be exercised for public good <lb/>and promoting the public interest. This is <lb/>equally true of all actions even in the field of <lb/>contract. Thus, every holder of a public office <lb/>is a trustee whose highest duty is to the people <lb/>of the country and, therefore, every act of the <lb/>holder of a public office, irrespective of the <lb/>label classifying that act, is in discharge of <lb/>public duty meant ultimately for public good. <lb/>With the diversification of State activity in a <lb/>Welfare State requiring the State to discharge <lb/>its wide ranging functions even through its <lb/>several <lb/>instrumentalities, <lb/>which <lb/>requires <lb/>entering into contracts also, it would be unreal <lb/>and not pragmatic, apart from being unjustified <lb/>to exclude contractual matters from the sphere of <lb/>State actions required to be non-arbitrary and <lb/>justified on the touchstone of Article 14 . <lb/>28. <lb/>Even assuming that it is necessary to <lb/>import the concept of presence of some public <lb/>element in a State action to attract Article 14 <lb/>and permit judicial review, we have no hesitation <lb/>in saying that the ultimate impact of all actions <lb/>of the State or a public body being undoubtedly <lb/>on public interest, the requisite public element <lb/>for this purpose is present also in contractual <lb/>matters. We, therefore, find it difficult and <lb/>unrealistic to exclude the State actions in <lb/>contractual matters, after the contract has been <lb/>made, from the purview of judicial review to test <lb/>its validity on the anvil of Article 14 . <lb/>29. <lb/>It can no longer be doubted at this <lb/></body>

			<body>point of time that Article 14 of the Constitution <lb/>of India applies also to matters of governmental <lb/>policy and if the policy or any action of the <lb/>government, even in contractual matters, fails to <lb/>satisfy the test of reasonableness, it would be <lb/>unconstitutional. [See Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. <lb/>International Airport Authority of India, (1979) <lb/>3 SCC 489, and Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v. State <lb/>of Jammu and Kashmir, (1980) 4 SCC 1]. In Col. <lb/>A.S. Sangwan v. Union of India, (1980) Supp. SCC <lb/>559, while the discretion to change the policy in <lb/>exercise of the executive power, when not <lb/>trammelled by the statute or rule, was held to be <lb/>wide, it was emphasised as imperative and <lb/>implicit in Article 14 of the Constitution that a <lb/>change in policy must be made fairly and should <lb/>not give the impression that it was so done <lb/>arbitrarily or by any ulterior criteria. The wide <lb/>sweep of Article 14 and the requirement of every <lb/>State action qualifying for its validity on this <lb/>touchstone, irrespective of the field of activity <lb/>of the State, has long been settled. Later <lb/>decisions of this Court have reinforced the <lb/>foundation of this tenet and it would be <lb/>sufficient to refer only to two recent decisions <lb/>of this Court for this purpose. <lb/>….. <lb/>….. <lb/>33. <lb/>No doubt, it is true, as indicated by <lb/>us earlier, that there is a presumption of <lb/>validity of the State action and the burden is on <lb/>the person who alleges violation of Article 14 to <lb/>prove the assertion. However, where no plausible <lb/>reason or principle is indicated nor is it <lb/>discernible and the impugned State action, <lb/>therefore, appears to be ex facie arbitrary, the <lb/>initial burden to prove the arbitrariness is <lb/>discharged shifting onus on the State to justify <lb/>its action as fair and reasonable. If the State <lb/>is unable to produce material to justify its <lb/>action as fair and reasonable, the burden on the <lb/>person alleging arbitrariness must be held to be <lb/>discharged. The scope of judicial review is <lb/>limited as indicated in Dwarkadas Marfatia case <lb/>(supra) to oversee the State action for the <lb/></body>

			<body> purpose of satisfying that it is not vitiated by <lb/>the vice of arbitrariness and no more. The wisdom <lb/>of the policy or the lack of it or the <lb/>desirability of a better alternative is not <lb/>within the permissible scope of judicial review <lb/>in such cases. It is not for the courts to recast <lb/>the policy or to substitute it with another which <lb/>is considered to be more appropriate, once the <lb/>attack <lb/>on <lb/>the <lb/>ground <lb/>of <lb/>arbitrariness <lb/>is <lb/>successfully repelled by showing that the act <lb/>which was done, was fair and reasonable in the <lb/>facts and circumstances of the case. As indicated <lb/>by Diplock, L.J., in Council of Civil Service <lb/>Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service, (1984) <lb/>3 All ER 935, the power of judicial review is <lb/>limited <lb/>to <lb/>the <lb/>grounds <lb/>of <lb/>illegality, <lb/>irrationality and procedural impropriety. In the <lb/>case <lb/>of <lb/>arbitrariness, <lb/>the <lb/>defect <lb/>of <lb/>irrationality is obvious. <lb/>….. <lb/>….. <lb/>36. <lb/>The <lb/>meaning <lb/>and <lb/>true <lb/>import <lb/>of <lb/>arbitrariness is more easily visualized than <lb/>precisely stated or defined. The question, <lb/>whether an impugned act is arbitrary or not, is <lb/>ultimately to be answered on the facts and in the <lb/>circumstances of a given case. An obvious test to <lb/>apply is to see whether there is any discernible <lb/>principle emerging from the impugned act and if <lb/>so, does it satisfy the test of reasonableness. <lb/>Where a mode is prescribed for doing an act and <lb/>there <lb/>is <lb/>no <lb/>impediment <lb/>in <lb/>following <lb/>that <lb/>procedure, performance of the act otherwise and <lb/>in a manner which does not disclose any <lb/>discernible principle which is reasonable, may <lb/>itself attract the vice of arbitrariness. Every <lb/>State action must be informed by reason and it <lb/>follows that an act uninformed by reason, is <lb/>arbitrary. Rule of law contemplates governance by <lb/>laws and not by humour, whims or caprices of the <lb/>men to whom the governance is entrusted for the <lb/>time being . It is trite that &apos;be you ever so <lb/>high, the laws are above you&apos;. This is what men <lb/>in power must remember, always.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body> (emphasis is mine) <lb/>The legal proposition laid down in the instant judgment <lb/>may be summarized as follows. Firstly, State action in <lb/>the contractual field are meant for public good and in <lb/>public interest and are expected to be fair and just. <lb/>Secondly, it would be alien to the constitutional <lb/>scheme to accept the argument of exclusion of Article <lb/>14 of the Constitution of India in contractual matters. <lb/>Thirdly, the fact that a dispute falls in the domain of <lb/>contractual obligation, would make no difference, to a <lb/>challenge raised under Article 14 of the Constitution <lb/>of India on the ground that the impugned act is <lb/>arbitrary, unfair and unreasonable. Fourthly, every <lb/>State action must be informed of reason and it follows <lb/>that an act uninformed by reason is arbitrary. Fifthly, <lb/>where no plausible reason or principle is indicated (or <lb/>is discernible), and where the impugned action ex facie <lb/>appears to be arbitrary, the onus shifts on the State <lb/>to justify its action as fair and reasonable. Sixthly, <lb/>every holder of public office is accountable to the <lb/>people in whom the sovereignty vests. <lb/>All powers <lb/>vested in a public office, even in the field of <lb/>contract, are meant to be exercised for public good and <lb/></body>

			<body> for promoting public interest. And Seventhly, Article <lb/>14 of the Constitution of India applies also to matters <lb/>of governmental policy even in contractual matters, and <lb/>if the policy or any action of the government fails to <lb/>satisfy the test of reasonableness, the same would be <lb/>unconstitutional. <lb/>(h) <lb/>Thereafter our attention was invited to the <lb/>decision rendered in Lucknow Development Authority Vs. <lb/>M.K. Gupta, (1994) 1 SCC 243. <lb/>Seriously, the instant <lb/>judgment has no direct bearing to the issue in hand. <lb/>The judgment determines whether compensation can be <lb/>awarded to an aggrieved consumer under the Consumer <lb/>Protection Act, 1986. <lb/>It also settles who should <lb/>shoulder the responsibility of paying the compensation <lb/>awarded. <lb/>But all the same it has some interesting <lb/>observations which may be noticed in the context of the <lb/>matter <lb/>under <lb/>deliberation. <lb/>Portions <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>observations emphasized upon are being noticed below: <lb/>&quot;8. <lb/>….. Under our Constitution sovereignty <lb/>vests <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>people. <lb/>Every <lb/>limb <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>constitutional machinery is obliged to be people <lb/>oriented. <lb/>No <lb/>functionary <lb/>in <lb/>exercise <lb/>of <lb/>statutory power can claim immunity, except to <lb/>the extent protected by the statute itself. <lb/>Public <lb/>authorities <lb/>acting <lb/>in <lb/>violation <lb/>of <lb/>constitutional <lb/>or <lb/>statutory <lb/>provisions <lb/>oppressively are accountable for their behaviour <lb/></body>

			<body>before authorities created under the statute <lb/>like the commission or the courts entrusted with <lb/>responsibility of maintaining the rule of law . <lb/>Each hierarchy in the Act is empowered to <lb/>entertain a complaint by the consumer for value <lb/>of the goods or services and compensation. The <lb/>word &apos;compensation&apos; is again of very wide <lb/>connotation. It has not been defined in the Act. <lb/>According to dictionary it means, &apos;compensating <lb/>or <lb/>being <lb/>compensated; <lb/>thing <lb/>given <lb/>as <lb/>recompense;&apos;. In legal sense it may constitute <lb/>actual loss or expected loss and may extend to <lb/>physical, mental or even emotional suffering, <lb/>insult or injury or loss. Therefore, when the <lb/>Commission has been vested with the jurisdiction <lb/>to award value of goods or services and <lb/>compensation it has to be construed widely <lb/>enabling <lb/>the <lb/>Commission <lb/>to <lb/>determine <lb/>compensation for any loss or damage suffered by <lb/>a consumer which in law is otherwise included in <lb/>wide meaning of compensation. The provision in <lb/>our opinion enables a consumer to claim and <lb/>empowers the Commission to redress any injustice <lb/>done to him. Any other construction would defeat <lb/>the very purpose of the Act. The Commission or <lb/>the Forum in the Act is thus entitled to award <lb/>not only value of the goods or services but also <lb/>to compensate a consumer for injustice suffered <lb/>by him. <lb/>….. <lb/>….. <lb/>10. <lb/>Who should pay the amount determined by <lb/>the Commission for harassment and agony, the <lb/>statutory authority or should it be realised <lb/>from <lb/>those <lb/>who <lb/>were <lb/>responsible <lb/>for <lb/>it? <lb/>Compensation as explained includes both the just <lb/>equivalent for loss of goods or services and <lb/>also for sufferance of injustice. For instance <lb/>in Civil Appeal No. ... of 1993 arising out of <lb/>SLP (Civil) No. 659 of 1991 the Commission <lb/>directed the Bangalore Development Authority to <lb/>pay Rs 2446 to the consumer for the expenses <lb/>incurred by him in getting the lease-cum-sale <lb/>agreement <lb/>registered <lb/>as <lb/>it <lb/>was <lb/>additional <lb/>expenditure for alternative site allotted to <lb/></body>

			<body>him. No misfeasance was found. The moment the <lb/>authority came to know of the mistake committed <lb/>by it, it took immediate action by alloting <lb/>alternative site to the respondent. It was <lb/>compensation for exact loss suffered by the <lb/>respondent. It arose in due discharge of duties. <lb/>For such acts or omissions the loss suffered has <lb/>to be made good by the authority itself. But <lb/>when the sufferance is due to mala fide or <lb/>oppressive or capricious acts etc. of a public <lb/>servant, then the nature of liability changes. <lb/>The Commission under the Act could determine <lb/>such amount if in its opinion the consumer <lb/>suffered <lb/>injury <lb/>due <lb/>to <lb/>what <lb/>is <lb/>called <lb/>misfeasance of the officers by the English <lb/>Courts. Even in England where award of exemplary <lb/>or aggravated damages for insult etc. to a <lb/>person has now been held to be punitive, <lb/>exception has been carved out if the injury is <lb/>due <lb/>to, <lb/>&apos;oppressive, <lb/>arbitrary <lb/>or <lb/>unconstitutional action by servants of the <lb/>Government&apos; (Salmond and Heuston on the Law of <lb/>Torts). <lb/>Misfeasance <lb/>in <lb/>public <lb/>office <lb/>is <lb/>explained by Wade in his book on Administrative <lb/>Law thus: <lb/>&quot;Even where there is no ministerial duty as <lb/>above, and even where no recognised tort <lb/>such as trespass, nuisance, or negligence <lb/>is <lb/>committed, <lb/>public <lb/>authorities <lb/>or <lb/>officers may be liable in damages for <lb/>malicious, deliberate or injurious wrong-<lb/>doing. There is thus a tort which has been <lb/>called misfeasance in public office, and <lb/>which includes malicious abuse of power, <lb/>deliberate maladministration, and perhaps <lb/>also other unlawful acts causing injury.&quot; <lb/>(p. 777) <lb/>The jurisdiction and power of the courts to <lb/>indemnify a citizen for injury suffered due to <lb/>abuse of power by public authorities is founded <lb/>as observed by Lord Hailsham in Cassell &amp; Co. <lb/>Ltd. v. Broome, 1972 AC 1027, on the principle <lb/>that, &apos;an award of exemplary damages can serve a <lb/></body>

			<body> useful purpose in vindicating the strength of <lb/>law&apos;. An ordinary citizen or a common man is <lb/>hardly equipped to match the might of the State <lb/>or its instrumentalities. That is provided by <lb/>the rule of law. It acts as a check on arbitrary <lb/>and capricious exercise of power. In Rookes v. <lb/>Barnard, 1964 AC 1129, it was observed by Lord <lb/>Devlin, &apos;the servants of the government are also <lb/>the servants of the people and the use of their <lb/>power must always be subordinate to their duty <lb/>of service&apos;. A public functionary if he acts <lb/>maliciously or oppressively and the exercise of <lb/>power results in harassment and agony then it is <lb/>not an exercise of power but its abuse. No law <lb/>provides protection against it. He who is <lb/>responsible for it must suffer it. Compensation <lb/>or damage as explained earlier may arise even <lb/>when the officer discharges his duty honestly <lb/>and bona fide. But when it arises due to <lb/>arbitrary or capricious behaviour then it loses <lb/>its individual character and assumes social <lb/>significance. Harassment of a common man by <lb/>public authorities is socially abhorring and <lb/>legally <lb/>impermissible. <lb/>It <lb/>may <lb/>harm <lb/>him <lb/>personally but the injury to society is far more <lb/>grievous. <lb/>Crime <lb/>and <lb/>corruption <lb/>thrive <lb/>and <lb/>prosper in the society due to lack of public <lb/>resistance. Nothing is more damaging than the <lb/>feeling of helplessness. An ordinary citizen <lb/>instead of complaining and fighting succumbs to <lb/>the pressure of undesirable functioning in <lb/>offices <lb/>instead <lb/>of <lb/>standing <lb/>against <lb/>it. <lb/>Therefore <lb/>the <lb/>award <lb/>of <lb/>compensation <lb/>for <lb/>harassment <lb/>by <lb/>public <lb/>authorities <lb/>not <lb/>only <lb/>compensates <lb/>the <lb/>individual, <lb/>satisfies <lb/>him <lb/>personally but helps in curing social evil. It <lb/>may result in improving the work culture and <lb/>help in changing the outlook. Wade in his book <lb/>Administrative Law has observed that it is to <lb/>the credit of public authorities that there are <lb/>simply few reported English decisions on this <lb/>form of malpractice, namely, misfeasance in <lb/>public offices which includes malicious use of <lb/>power, deliberate maladministration and perhaps <lb/>also other unlawful acts causing injury.

			<body>the reasons for this appears to be development <lb/>of <lb/>law <lb/>which, <lb/>apart, <lb/>from <lb/>other <lb/>factors <lb/>succeeded in keeping a salutary check on the <lb/>functioning in the government or semi-government <lb/>offices by holding the officers personally <lb/>responsible for their capricious or even ultra <lb/>vires action resulting in injury or loss to a <lb/>citizen <lb/>by <lb/>awarding <lb/>damages <lb/>against <lb/>them . <lb/>Various decisions rendered from time to time <lb/>have been referred to by Wade on Misfeasance by <lb/>Public Authorities. We shall refer to some of <lb/>them to demonstrate how necessary it is for our <lb/>society. In Ashby v. White, (1703) 2 LD Raym <lb/>938, the House of Lords invoked the principle of <lb/>ubi jus ibi remedium in favour of an elector who <lb/>was wrongfully prevented from voting and decreed <lb/>the claim of damages. The ratio of this decision <lb/>has been applied and extended by English Courts <lb/>in various situations. <lb/>11. <lb/>Today the issue thus is not only of <lb/>award of compensation but who should bear the <lb/>brunt. The concept of authority and power <lb/>exercised by public functionaries has many <lb/>dimensions. It has undergone tremendous change <lb/>with passage of time and change in socio-<lb/>economic outlook. The authority empowered to <lb/>function under a statute while exercising power <lb/>discharges public duty. It has to act to <lb/>subserve general welfare and common good. In <lb/>discharging this duty honestly and bona fide, <lb/>loss may accrue to any person. And he may claim <lb/>compensation which may in circumstances be <lb/>payable. But where the duty is performed <lb/>capriciously or the exercise of power results in <lb/>harassment and agony then the responsibility to <lb/>pay the loss determined should be whose? In a <lb/>modern society no authority can arrogate to <lb/>itself the power to act in a manner which is <lb/>arbitrary. It is unfortunate that matters which <lb/>require immediate attention linger on and the <lb/>man in the street is made to run from one end to <lb/>other with no result. The culture of window <lb/>clearance appears to be totally dead. Even in <lb/>ordinary matters a common man who has neither <lb/></body>

			<body>the political backing nor the financial strength <lb/>to match the inaction in public oriented <lb/>departments gets frustrated and it erodes the <lb/>credibility <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>system. <lb/>Public <lb/>administration, no doubt involves a vast amount <lb/>of administrative discretion which shields the <lb/>action of administrative authority. But where it <lb/>is found that exercise of discretion was mala <lb/>fide <lb/>and <lb/>the <lb/>complainant <lb/>is <lb/>entitled <lb/>to <lb/>compensation for mental and physical harassment <lb/>then the officer can no more claim to be under <lb/>protective cover . When a citizen seeks to <lb/>recover compensation from a public authority in <lb/>respect <lb/>of <lb/>injuries <lb/>suffered <lb/>by <lb/>him <lb/>for <lb/>capricious exercise of power and the National <lb/>Commission finds it duly proved then it has a <lb/>statutory obligation to award the same. It was <lb/>never more necessary than today when even social <lb/>obligations are regulated by grant of statutory <lb/>powers. The test of permissive form of grant is <lb/>over. It is now imperative and implicit in the <lb/>exercise of power that it should be for the sake <lb/>of society. When the court directs payment of <lb/>damages or compensation against the State the <lb/>ultimate sufferer is the common man. It is the <lb/>tax payers&apos; money which is paid for inaction of <lb/>those who are entrusted under the Act to <lb/>discharge their duties in accordance with law . <lb/>It is, therefore, necessary that the Commission <lb/>when it is satisfied that a complainant is <lb/>entitled to compensation for harassment or <lb/>mental agony or oppression, which finding of <lb/>course should be recorded carefully on material <lb/>and convincing circumstances and not lightly, <lb/>then it should further direct the department <lb/>concerned to pay the amount to the complainant <lb/>from the public fund immediately but to recover <lb/>the same from those who are found responsible <lb/>for such unpardonable behaviour by dividing it <lb/>proportionately where there are more than one <lb/>functionaries.&quot; <lb/>(emphasis is mine) <lb/>The judgment brings out the foundational principle of <lb/></body>

			<body> executive governance. The said foundational principle <lb/>is based on the realization that sovereignty vests in <lb/>the people. The judgment therefore records that every <lb/>limb of the constitutional machinery is obliged to be <lb/>people oriented. The fundamental principle brought out <lb/>by the judgment is, that a public authority exercising <lb/>public power discharges a public duty, and therefore, <lb/>has to subserve general welfare and common good. <lb/>All <lb/>power should be exercised for the sake of society. The <lb/>issue which was the subject matter of consideration, <lb/>and has been noticed along with the citation, was <lb/>decided by concluding that compensation shall be <lb/>payable by the State (or its instrumentality) where <lb/>inappropriate deprivation on account of improper <lb/>exercise of discretion has resulted in a loss, <lb/>compensation <lb/>is <lb/>payable <lb/>by <lb/>the <lb/>State <lb/>(or <lb/>its <lb/>instrumentality). <lb/>But where the public functionary <lb/>exercises <lb/>his <lb/>discretion <lb/>capriciously, <lb/>or <lb/>for <lb/>considerations <lb/>which <lb/>are <lb/>malafide, <lb/>the <lb/>public <lb/>functionary himself must shoulder the burden of <lb/>compensation held as payable. The reason for shifting <lb/>the onus to the public functionary deserves notice. <lb/>This Court felt, that when a court directs payment of <lb/></body>

			<body> damages or compensation against the State, the ultimate <lb/>sufferer is the common man, because it is tax payers <lb/>money out of which damages and costs are paid. <lb/>(i) <lb/>Next cited for our consideration was the <lb/>judgment in Common Cause, A Registered Society Vs. <lb/>Union of India &amp; Ors., (1996) 6 SCC 530. The instant <lb/>case dealt with a challenge to the allotment of retail <lb/>outlets <lb/>for <lb/>petroleum <lb/>products <lb/>(petrol <lb/>pumps). <lb/>Allotment was made in favour of 15 persons on the <lb/>ground of poverty or unemployment. <lb/>Rest of the <lb/>relevant facts emerge from the extracts from the <lb/>judgment reproduced below: <lb/>&quot;24. <lb/>The orders of the Minister reproduced <lb/>above read: &quot;the applicant has no regular income <lb/>to support herself and her family&quot;, &quot;the <lb/>applicant is an educated lady and belongs to <lb/>Scheduled Tribe community&quot;, &quot;the applicant is <lb/>unemployed and has no regular source of income&quot;, <lb/>&quot;the applicant is an uneducated, unemployed <lb/>Scheduled Tribe youth without regular source of <lb/>livelihood&quot;, &quot;the applicant is a housewife whose <lb/>family <lb/>is <lb/>facing <lb/>difficult <lb/>financial <lb/>circumstances&quot; <lb/>etc. <lb/>etc. <lb/>There <lb/>would <lb/>be <lb/>literally millions of people in the country <lb/>having these circumstances or worse. There is no <lb/>justification whatsoever to pick up these <lb/>persons except that they happen to have won the <lb/>favour <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>Minister <lb/>on <lb/>mala <lb/>fide <lb/>considerations. None of these cases fall within <lb/>the categories placed before this Court in <lb/>Centre for Public Interest Litigation v.

			<body>in some of those or similar guidelines the <lb/>exercise of discretion was wholly arbitrary. <lb/>Such a discretionary power which is capable of <lb/>being exercised arbitrarily is not permitted by <lb/>Article 14 of the Constitution of India. While <lb/>Article 14 permits a reasonable classification <lb/>having a rational nexus to the objective sought <lb/>to be achieved, it does not permit the power to <lb/>pick and choose arbitrarily out of several <lb/>persons falling in the same category. A <lb/>transparent and objective criteria/procedure has <lb/>to be evolved so that the choice among the <lb/>members belonging to the same class or category <lb/>is based on reason, fair play and non-<lb/>arbitrariness. It is essential to lay down as a <lb/>matter of policy as to how preferences would be <lb/>assigned between two persons falling in the same <lb/>category. If there are two eminent sportsmen in <lb/>distress and only one petrol pump is available, <lb/>there should be clear, transparent and objective <lb/>criteria/procedure to indicate who out of the <lb/>two is to be preferred. Lack of transparency in <lb/>the system promotes nepotism and arbitrariness . <lb/>It is absolutely essential that the entire <lb/>system should be transparent right from the <lb/>stage of calling for the applications up to the <lb/>stage of passing the orders of allotment. The <lb/>names of the allottees, the orders and the <lb/>reasons for allotment should be available for <lb/>public knowledge and scrutiny . Mr Shanti Bhushan <lb/>has suggested that the petrol pumps, agencies <lb/>etc. may be allotted by public auction -<lb/>category <lb/>wise <lb/>amongst <lb/>the <lb/>eligible <lb/>and <lb/>objectively selected applicants. We do not wish <lb/>to impose any procedure on the Government. It is <lb/>a matter of policy for the Government to lay <lb/>down. We, however, direct that any procedure <lb/>laid down by the Government must be transparent, <lb/>just, fair and non-arbitrary . <lb/>….. <lb/>….. <lb/>26. <lb/>With the change in socio-economic <lb/>outlook, the public servants are being entrusted <lb/>with more and more discretionary powers even in <lb/>the field of distribution of government wealth <lb/></body>

			<body>in various forms . We take it to be perfectly <lb/>clear, that if a public servant abuses his <lb/>office either by an act of omission or <lb/>commission, and the consequence of that is <lb/>injury to an individual or loss of public <lb/>property, an action may be maintained against <lb/>such public servant. No public servant can say <lb/>&quot;you may set aside an order on the ground of <lb/>mala fide but you cannot hold me personally <lb/>liable&quot;. No public servant can arrogate to <lb/>himself the power to act in a manner which is <lb/>arbitrary.&quot; <lb/>(emphasis is mine) <lb/>This judgment has a direct bearing on the controversy <lb/>in hand. <lb/>It clearly delineates the manner in which <lb/>discretion must be exercised, specially when the object <lb/>of discretion is State largesse. <lb/>A perusal of the <lb/>observations reproduced above reveal, that the State <lb/>largesse under reference (petrol pumps) were to be <lb/>allotted on the ground of poverty and unemployment. <lb/>Such an allotment was obviously based on a policy to <lb/>&quot;best subserve the common good&quot; enshrined in Article <lb/>39(b) of the Constitution of India. <lb/>This Court found <lb/>no fault in the policy itself. The fault was with the <lb/>manner of giving effect to the policy. <lb/>It was held, <lb/>that a transparent and objective criteria/procedure has <lb/>to be evolved, so that the choice out of those who are <lb/>eligible <lb/>can <lb/>be <lb/>made <lb/>fairly <lb/>and <lb/>without <lb/>any <lb/></body>

			<body>arbitrariness. <lb/>The exercise of discretion which <lb/>enables the competent authority to arbitrarily pick and <lb/>choose out of several persons falling in the same <lb/>category, according to the above decision would be <lb/>arbitrary, and as such violative of Article 14 of the <lb/>Constitution of India. <lb/>(j) <lb/>Out of the more recent judgments our attention <lb/>was invited to Meerut Development Authority Vs. <lb/>Association of Management Studies &amp; Anr. etc., (2009) 6 <lb/>SCC 171. The controversy adjudicated upon in this case <lb/>emerges from the decision of the appellant to allotment <lb/>of 2 plots of land. For the said purpose the appellant <lb/>invited tenders from interested persons. <lb/>In response <lb/>the respondent submitted its tender. <lb/>After the <lb/>allotment of one of the plots to the respondent, the <lb/>respondent raised an objection that the appellant had <lb/>fixed the reserved price of the second plot at a rate <lb/>much higher than its adjoining plots. <lb/>The respondent <lb/>assailed the action of the appellant in issuing a fresh <lb/>advertisement for the allotment of the second plot. In <lb/>the <lb/>course <lb/>of <lb/>determination <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>aforesaid <lb/>controversy this Court held: <lb/>&quot;26. <lb/>A tender is an offer. It is something <lb/></body>

			<page> 191 <lb/></page>

			<body>which invites and is communicated to notify <lb/>acceptance. <lb/>Broadly <lb/>stated <lb/>it <lb/>must <lb/>be <lb/>unconditional; must be in the proper form, the <lb/>person by whom tender is made must be able to <lb/>and willing to perform his obligations. The <lb/>terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open <lb/>to judicial scrutiny because the invitation to <lb/>tender is in the realm of contract. However, a <lb/>limited judicial review may be available in <lb/>cases where it is established that the terms of <lb/>the invitation to tender were so tailor-made to <lb/>suit the convenience of any particular person <lb/>with a view to eliminate all others from <lb/>participating in the bidding process. <lb/>27. <lb/>The <lb/>bidders <lb/>participating <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>tender process have no other right except the <lb/>right to equality and fair treatment in the <lb/>matter of evaluation of competitive bids offered <lb/>by interested persons in response to notice <lb/>inviting tenders in a transparent manner and <lb/>free from hidden agenda . One cannot challenge <lb/>the terms and conditions of the tender except on <lb/>the abovestated ground, the reason being the <lb/>terms of the invitation to tender are in the <lb/>realm of the contract. No bidder is entitled as <lb/>a matter of right to insist the authority <lb/>inviting <lb/>tenders <lb/>to <lb/>enter <lb/>into <lb/>further <lb/>negotiations unless the terms and conditions of <lb/>notice so provided for such negotiations. <lb/>28. <lb/>It is so well settled in law and needs <lb/>no restatement at our hands that disposal of the <lb/>public <lb/>property <lb/>by <lb/>the <lb/>State <lb/>or <lb/>its <lb/>instrumentalities partakes the character of a <lb/>trust. The methods to be adopted for disposal of <lb/>public property must be fair and transparent <lb/>providing an opportunity to all the interested <lb/>persons to participate in the process . <lb/>29. <lb/>The Authority has the right not to <lb/>accept the highest bid and even to prefer a <lb/>tender other than the highest bidder, if there <lb/>exist good and sufficient reasons, such as, the <lb/></body>

A man making his will may, subject to <lb/>any rights of his dependants, dispose of his <lb/>property just as he may wish. He may act out of <lb/>malice or a spirit of revenge, but in law this <lb/>does not affect his exercise of his power. In <lb/>the same way a private person has an absolute <lb/>power to allow whom he likes to use his land, to <lb/>release a debtor, or, where the law permits, to <lb/>evict a tenant, regardless of his motives. This <lb/>is unfettered discretion. But a public authority <lb/>may do none of these things unless it acts <lb/>reasonably and in good faith and upon lawful and <lb/>relevant grounds of public interest . So a city <lb/>council <lb/>acted <lb/>unlawfully <lb/>when <lb/>it <lb/>refused <lb/>unreasonably to let a local rugby football club <lb/>use the city&apos;s sports ground, though a private <lb/>owner <lb/>could <lb/>of <lb/>course <lb/>have <lb/>refused <lb/>with <lb/>impunity. Nor may a local authority arbitrarily <lb/>release debtors, and if it evicts tenants, even <lb/>though in accordance with a contract, it must <lb/>act reasonably and &apos; within the limits of fair <lb/>dealing &apos; . The whole conception of unfettered <lb/>discretion <lb/>is <lb/>inappropriate <lb/>to <lb/>a <lb/>public <lb/>authority, which possesses powers solely in <lb/>order that it may use them for the public <lb/>good.&quot; , Administrative Law, 9th Edn. H.W.R. Wade <lb/>and C.F. Forsyth. <lb/>40. <lb/>There is no difficulty to hold that <lb/>the authorities owe a duty to act fairly but it <lb/>is equally well settled in judicial review, the <lb/>court is not concerned with the merits or <lb/></body>

The court cannot substitute its own <lb/>opinion for the opinion of the authority <lb/>deciding the matter. <lb/>41. <lb/>The <lb/>distinction <lb/>between <lb/>appellate <lb/>power and a judicial review is well known but <lb/>needs reiteration. By way of judicial review, <lb/>the court cannot examine the details of the <lb/>terms of the contract which have been entered <lb/>into by the public bodies or the State. The <lb/>courts have inherent limitations on the scope of <lb/>any such enquiry. If the contract has been <lb/>entered into without ignoring the procedure <lb/>which can be said to be basic in nature and <lb/>after an objective consideration of different <lb/>options available taking into account the <lb/>interest of the State and the public, then the <lb/>court cannot act as an appellate court by <lb/>substituting its opinion in respect of selection <lb/>made for entering into such contract. But at the <lb/>same time the courts can certainly examine <lb/>whether <lb/>the <lb/>&quot; decision-making <lb/>process &quot; <lb/>was <lb/>reasonable, <lb/>rational, <lb/>not <lb/>arbitrary <lb/>and <lb/>violative of Article 14 . (See Sterling Computers <lb/>Ltd. Vs. M&amp;N Publications Ltd., (1993) 1 SCC <lb/>445). <lb/>….. <lb/>….. <lb/>50. <lb/>We are, however, of the opinion that <lb/>the effort, if any, made by MDA to augment its <lb/>financial resources and revenue itself cannot be <lb/>said to be an unreasonable decision. It is well <lb/>said that the struggle to get for the State the <lb/>full value of its resources is particularly <lb/>pronounced in the sale of State-owned natural <lb/>assets to the private sector. Whenever the <lb/>Government or the authorities get less than the <lb/>full value of the asset, the country is being <lb/>cheated; there is a simple transfer of wealth <lb/>from the citizens as a whole to whoever gets the <lb/>assets &quot; at a discount &quot; . Most of the times the <lb/>wealth of the State goes to the individuals <lb/></body>

The view <lb/>expressed in Wades Tretise on Administrative Law, that <lb/>public authorities cannot act in a manner which is open <lb/>to private persons, was accepted. Public authorities, <lb/>it was held, can neither act out of malice nor a spirit <lb/>of revenge. <lb/>A public authority is ordained to act, <lb/>reasonably and in good faith and upon lawful and <lb/>relevant grounds of public interest. Most importantly <lb/>it was concluded, that the State &quot;must&quot; get the &quot;full <lb/>value&quot; of the resources, specially when State owned <lb/>assets are passed over to private individuals/entities. <lb/>Not stopping there the Court added further, that <lb/>whoever pays less than the full value, get the assets <lb/>belonging to the citizens &quot;at a discount&quot;, and as such <lb/>the wealth that belongs to the nation slips away. <lb/></body>

			<body>(k) <lb/>Also cited for our consideration was the <lb/>judgment in Reliance Natural Resources Ltd. Vs. <lb/>Reliance Industries Ltd. etc., (2010) 7 SCC 1. <lb/>The <lb/>Court&apos;s attention was invited to the following: <lb/>&quot;33. <lb/>Mr R.F. Nariman, learned Senior Counsel <lb/>appearing for RIL concentrated his argument with <lb/>reference to Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies <lb/>Act. According to him, Section 392 of the Act had <lb/>no predecessors either in English law or in the <lb/>Companies Act of 1913. The reason why the <lb/>legislature appears to have felt the necessity of <lb/>enacting Section 392 is to bring Section 391 on a <lb/>par with Section 394. Section 394 applies only to <lb/>companies <lb/>which <lb/>are <lb/>reconstructing <lb/>and <lb/>or <lb/>amalgamating, involving the transfer of assets and <lb/>liabilities to another company. It is thus, <lb/>applicable to a species of the genus of company <lb/>referred to under Section 391. Section 394, sub-<lb/>section 1 specifically gives the Company Court the <lb/>power not merely to sanction the compromise or <lb/>arrangement but also gives the Company Court the <lb/>power, by a subsequent order, to make provisions <lb/>for <lb/>&quot;such <lb/>incidental, <lb/>consequential <lb/>and <lb/>supplemental matters as are necessary to secure <lb/>that the reconstruction or amalgamation shall be <lb/>fully and effectively carried out&quot; [Section 394(1) <lb/>(vi)]. This power is absent in Section 391, so <lb/>that companies falling within Section 391, but not <lb/>within Section 394, would not be amenable to the <lb/>Company <lb/>Court&apos;s <lb/>jurisdiction <lb/>to <lb/>enforce <lb/>a <lb/>compromise or arrangement made under Section 391 <lb/>and to see that they are fully carried out. Hence, <lb/>the power under Section 392 has to be understood <lb/>in the above context, and is of the same quality <lb/>as the power expressly given to the Company Court <lb/>post-sanction under Section 394. <lb/>….. <lb/>….. <lb/>122. <lb/>From the above analysis, the following <lb/>are the broad sustainable conclusions which can be <lb/></body>

			<body>derived from the position of the Union: <lb/>(1) The natural resources are vested with the <lb/>Government as a matter of trust in the name of <lb/>the people of India. Thus, it is the solemn <lb/>duty of the State to protect the national <lb/>interest. <lb/>(2) Even <lb/>though <lb/>exploration, <lb/>extraction <lb/>and <lb/>exploitation of natural resources are within <lb/>the domain of governmental function, the <lb/>Government has decided to privatise some of <lb/>its <lb/>functions. <lb/>For <lb/>this <lb/>reason, <lb/>the <lb/>constitutional restrictions on the Government <lb/>would equally apply to the private players in <lb/>this process. Natural resources must always be <lb/>used in the interests of the country, and not <lb/>private interests . <lb/>(3) The broader constitutional principles, the <lb/>statutory scheme as well as the proper <lb/>interpretation <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>PSC <lb/>mandates <lb/>the <lb/>Government to determine the price of the gas <lb/>before it is supplied by the contractor. <lb/>(4) The policy of the Government, including the <lb/>gas utilisation policy and the decision of <lb/>EGOM would be applicable to the pricing in the <lb/>present case. <lb/>(5) The Government cannot be divested of its <lb/>supervisory powers to regulate the supply and <lb/>distribution of gas . <lb/>….. <lb/>….. <lb/>128. <lb/>In a constitutional democracy like ours, <lb/>the national assets belong to the people. The <lb/>Government holds such natural resources in trust. <lb/>Legally, therefore, the Government owns such <lb/>assets for the purposes of developing them in the <lb/>interests of the people . In the present case, the <lb/>Government owns the gas till it reaches its <lb/>ultimate consumer. A mechanism is provided under <lb/>the PSC between the Government and the contractor <lb/>(RIL, in the present case). The PSC shall override <lb/>any other contractual obligation between the <lb/>contractor and any other party. <lb/>….. <lb/>….. <lb/></body>

			<body>243. <lb/>The structure of our Constitution is not <lb/>such that it permits the reading of each of the <lb/>Directive Principles of State Policy, that have <lb/>been framed for the achievement of conditions of <lb/>social, <lb/>economic <lb/>and <lb/>political <lb/>justice <lb/>in <lb/>isolation. The structural lines of logic, of <lb/>ethical imperatives of the State and the lessons <lb/>of history flow from one to the other. In the <lb/>quest for national development and unity of the <lb/>nation, it was felt that the &quot; ownership and <lb/>control <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>material <lb/>resources <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>community &quot; if distributed in a manner that does <lb/>not result in common good, it would lead to <lb/>derogation from the quest for national development <lb/>and the unity of the nation . Consequently, Article <lb/>39(b) of the Constitution should be construed in <lb/>light of Article 38 of the Constitution and be <lb/>understood as placing an affirmative obligation <lb/>upon the State to ensure that distribution of <lb/>material resources of the community does not <lb/>result in heightening of inequalities amongst <lb/>people and amongst regions. In line with the logic <lb/>of the constitutional matrix just enunciated, and <lb/>in the sweep of the quest for national development <lb/>and unity, is another provision. Inasmuch as <lb/>inequalities between people and regions of the <lb/>nation are inimical to those goals, Article 39(c) <lb/>posits that the &quot;operation of the economic system&quot; <lb/>when left unattended and unregulated, leads to <lb/>&quot;concentration of wealth and means of production <lb/>to the common detriment&quot; and commands the State to <lb/>ensure that the same does not occur. <lb/>….. <lb/>….. <lb/>250 <lb/>We hold that with respect to the natural <lb/>resources <lb/>extracted <lb/>and <lb/>exploited <lb/>from <lb/>the <lb/>geographic zones specified in Article 297 the <lb/>Union may not: <lb/>(1) transfer title of those resources after their <lb/>extraction unless the Union receives just and <lb/>proper compensation for the same; <lb/>(2) allow a situation to develop wherein the <lb/>various users in different sectors could <lb/></body>

			<body>potentially be deprived of access to such <lb/>resources; <lb/>(3) allow the extraction of such resources without <lb/>a clear policy statement of conservation, <lb/>which takes into account total domestic <lb/>availability, <lb/>the <lb/>requisite <lb/>balancing <lb/>of <lb/>current <lb/>needs <lb/>with <lb/>those <lb/>of <lb/>future <lb/>generations, <lb/>and <lb/>also <lb/>India&apos;s <lb/>security <lb/>requirements; <lb/>(4) allow the extraction and distribution without <lb/>periodic <lb/>evaluation <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>current <lb/>distribution and making an assessment of how <lb/>greater equity can be achieved, as between <lb/>sectors and also between regions; <lb/>(5) allow a contractor or any other agency to <lb/>extract and distribute the resources without <lb/>the explicit permission of the Union of India, <lb/>which permission can be granted only pursuant <lb/>to a rationally framed utilisation policy; and <lb/>(6) no end user may be given any guarantee for <lb/>continued access and of use beyond a period to <lb/>be specified by the Government. <lb/>Any contract including a PSC which does not take <lb/>into its ambit stated principles may itself become <lb/>vulnerable and fall foul of Article 14 of the <lb/>Constitution. <lb/>(emphasis is mine) <lb/>Interestingly, in this case the position adopted by the <lb/>Union needs to be highlighted. <lb/>This Court was <lb/>informed, that natural resources are vested in the <lb/>Government, as a matter of trust, in the name of the <lb/>people of India. And that, it was the solemn duty of <lb/>the State to protect the national interest. <lb/>The most <lb/>significant assertion expressed on behalf of the Union <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 198 <lb/></note>

			<page> 199 <lb/></page>

			<body>was, that natural resources must always be used in the <lb/>interest of the country and not in private interest. <lb/>It is in the background of the stance adopted by the <lb/>Union, that this Court issued the necessary directions <lb/>extracted above. <lb/>(l) <lb/>Last of all reference was made to the decision <lb/>of this Court in Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta Congress Vs. <lb/>State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; Ors., (2011) 5 SCC 29: <lb/>65. <lb/>What needs to be emphasised is that the <lb/>State <lb/>and/or <lb/>its <lb/>agencies/instrumentalities <lb/>cannot give largesse to any person according to <lb/>the sweet will and whims of the political <lb/>entities and/or officers of the State. Every <lb/>action/decision <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>State <lb/>and/or <lb/>its <lb/>agencies/instrumentalities to give largesse or <lb/>confer benefit must be founded on a sound, <lb/>transparent, <lb/>discernible <lb/>and <lb/>well-defined <lb/>policy, which shall be made known to the public <lb/>by publication in the Official Gazette and other <lb/>recognised modes of publicity and such policy <lb/>must be implemented/executed by adopting a non-<lb/>discriminatory <lb/>and <lb/>non-arbitrary <lb/>method <lb/>irrespective of the class or category of persons <lb/>proposed to be benefited by the policy. The <lb/>distribution of largesse like allotment of land, <lb/>grant of quota, permit licence, etc. by the <lb/>State and its agencies/instrumentalities should <lb/>always be done in a fair and equitable manner <lb/>and the element of favouritism or nepotism shall <lb/>not influence the exercise of discretion, if <lb/>any, conferred upon the particular functionary <lb/>or officer of the State . <lb/>66. <lb/>We may add that there cannot be any <lb/>policy, <lb/>much <lb/>less, <lb/>a <lb/>rational <lb/>policy <lb/>of <lb/>allotting land on the basis of applications made <lb/></body>

			<body>by <lb/>individuals, <lb/>bodies, <lb/>organisations <lb/>or <lb/>institutions <lb/>dehors <lb/>an <lb/>invitation <lb/>or <lb/>advertisement <lb/>by <lb/>the <lb/>State <lb/>or <lb/>its <lb/>agency/instrumentality. <lb/>By <lb/>entertaining <lb/>applications made by individuals, organisations <lb/>or institutions for allotment of land or for <lb/>grant of any other type of largesse the State <lb/>cannot exclude other eligible persons from <lb/>lodging competing claim. Any allotment of land <lb/>or grant of other form of largesse by the State <lb/>or its agencies/instrumentalities by treating <lb/>the exercise as a private venture is liable to <lb/>be treated as arbitrary, discriminatory and an <lb/>act of favouritism and/or nepotism violating the <lb/>soul of the equality clause embodied in Article <lb/>14 of the Constitution . <lb/>67. <lb/>This, however, does not mean that the <lb/>State <lb/>can <lb/>never <lb/>allot <lb/>land <lb/>to <lb/>the <lb/>institutions/organisations <lb/>engaged <lb/>in <lb/>educational, cultural, social or philanthropic <lb/>activities or are rendering service to the <lb/>society except by way of auction. Nevertheless, <lb/>it is necessary to observe that once a piece of <lb/>land is earmarked or identified for allotment to <lb/>institutions/organisations engaged in any such <lb/>activity, the actual exercise of allotment must <lb/>be done in a manner consistent with the doctrine <lb/>of equality. The competent authority should, as <lb/>a matter of course, issue an advertisement <lb/>incorporating <lb/>therein <lb/>the <lb/>conditions <lb/>of <lb/>eligibility so as to enable all similarly <lb/>situated <lb/>eligible <lb/>persons, <lb/>institutions/organisations to participate in the <lb/>process of allotment, whether by way of auction <lb/>or otherwise. In a given case the Government may <lb/>allot land at a fixed price but in that case <lb/>also allotment must be preceded by a wholesome <lb/>exercise consistent with Article 14 of the <lb/>Constitution.&quot; <lb/>(emphasis is mine) <lb/>The observations of this Court in the judgment <lb/></body>

			<body>extracted above neither need any summarization, nor any <lb/>further elaboration. <lb/>(m) <lb/>Surely, there cannot be any escape from a <lb/>reference to the judgment rendered by this Court in <lb/>Centre for Public Interest Litigation and others v. <lb/>Union of India &amp; Ors., (2012) 3 SCC 1, which according <lb/>to the preamble of the Presidential reference, seems to <lb/>be the reason why the reference came to be made. <lb/>During the course of hearing extensive debate, between <lb/>rival parties, ensued on the effect of the observations <lb/>recorded by this Court in paragraphs 95 and 96 of the <lb/>judgment. The aforesaid paragraphs are being extracted <lb/>hereinbelow: <lb/>&quot;95. This Court has repeatedly held that <lb/>wherever a contract is to be awarded or a <lb/>licence is to be given, the public authority <lb/>must adopt a transparent and fair method for <lb/>making selections so that all eligible persons <lb/>get a fair opportunity of competition. To put it <lb/>differently, <lb/>the <lb/>State <lb/>and <lb/>its <lb/>agencies/instrumentalities must always adopt a <lb/>rational method for disposal of public property <lb/>and no attempt should be made to scuttle the <lb/>claim of worthy applicants. When it comes to <lb/>alienation of scarce natural resources like <lb/>spectrum etc., it is the burden of the State to <lb/>ensure that a non-discriminatory method is <lb/>adopted for distribution and alienation, which <lb/>would <lb/>necessarily <lb/>result <lb/>in <lb/>protection <lb/>of <lb/>national/public interest. <lb/></body>

			<body>96. In our view, a duly publicized auction <lb/>conducted fairly and impartially is perhaps the <lb/>best method for discharging this burden and the <lb/>methods like first-come-first-served when used <lb/>for <lb/>alienation <lb/>of <lb/>natural <lb/>resources/public <lb/>property <lb/>are <lb/>likely <lb/>to <lb/>be <lb/>misused <lb/>by <lb/>unscrupulous people who are only interested in <lb/>garnering maximum financial benefit and have no <lb/>respect for the constitutional ethos and values. <lb/>In other words, while transferring or alienating <lb/>the natural resources, the State is duty bound <lb/>to adopt the method of auction by giving wide <lb/>publicity so that all eligible persons can <lb/>participate in the process.&quot; <lb/>In so far as the controversy in the aforesaid case is <lb/>concerned, it would be relevant to mention that the <lb/>petitioner approached this Court by invoking the <lb/>extraordinary writ jurisdiction of this Hon&apos;ble Court <lb/>under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. <lb/>The <lb/>petition came to be filed as a cause in public <lb/>interest. The reason which promoted the petitioner to <lb/>approach this Court was that the Union had adopted the <lb/>policy of &quot;first come first serve&quot; for allocation of <lb/>licences of spectrum. <lb/>It was alleged that the <lb/>aforesaid policy involved the element of pure chance or <lb/>accident. It was asserted on behalf of the petitioners <lb/>that invocation of the principles of &quot;first come first <lb/>serve&quot; for permission to use natural resources had <lb/>inherently dangerous implications. <lb/>The implications <lb/></body>

			<body>expressed by the petitioners were duly taken into <lb/>consideration and the plea raised on behalf of the <lb/>petitioners was accepted. <lb/>Thereupon, the following <lb/>directions came to be issued in paragraph 102 of the <lb/>judgment: <lb/>&quot;102. In the result, the writ petitions are allowed <lb/>in the following terms: <lb/>(i) The <lb/>licences <lb/>granted <lb/>to <lb/>the <lb/>private <lb/>Respondents on or after 10.1.2008 pursuant to <lb/>two press releases issued on 10.1.2008 and <lb/>subsequent allocation of spectrum to the <lb/>licensees <lb/>are <lb/>declared <lb/>illegal <lb/>and <lb/>are <lb/>quashed. <lb/>(ii) The above direction shall become operative <lb/>after four months. <lb/>(iii) <lb/>Keeping in view the decision taken by the <lb/>Central Government in 2011, TRAI shall make <lb/>fresh recommendations for grant of licence and <lb/>allocation of spectrum in 2G band in 22 <lb/>Service Areas by auction, as was done for <lb/>allocation of spectrum in 3G band. <lb/>(iv) The Central Government shall consider the <lb/>recommendations of TRAI and take appropriate <lb/>decision within next one month and fresh <lb/>licences be granted by auction. <lb/>(v) Respondent Nos. 2, 3 and 9 who have been <lb/>benefited at the cost of Public Exchequer by a <lb/>wholly arbitrary and unconstitutional action <lb/>taken by the DoT for grant of UAS Licences and <lb/>allocation of spectrum in 2G band and who off-<lb/>loaded their stakes for many thousand crores <lb/>in the name of fresh infusion of equity or <lb/>transfer of equity shall pay cost of Rs. 5 <lb/>crores each. Respondent Nos. 4, 6, 7 and 10 <lb/>shall pay cost of Rs. 50 lakhs each because <lb/></body>

			<body>they too had been benefited by the wholly <lb/>arbitrary <lb/>and <lb/>unconstitutional <lb/>exercise <lb/>undertaken by the DoT for grant of UAS <lb/>Licences and allocation of spectrum in 2G <lb/>band. We have not imposed cost on the <lb/>Respondents <lb/>who <lb/>had <lb/>submitted <lb/>their <lb/>applications in 2004 and 2006 and whose <lb/>applications were kept pending till 2007. <lb/>(vi) <lb/>Within four months, 50% of the cost shall <lb/>be deposited with the Supreme Court Legal <lb/>Services <lb/>Committee <lb/>for <lb/>being <lb/>used <lb/>for <lb/>providing legal aid to poor and indigent <lb/>litigants. The remaining 50% cost shall be <lb/>deposited <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>funds <lb/>created <lb/>for <lb/>Resettlement and Welfare Schemes of the <lb/>Ministry of Defence. <lb/>(vii) <lb/>However, it is made clear that the <lb/>observations made in this judgment shall not, <lb/>in <lb/>any <lb/>manner, <lb/>affect <lb/>the <lb/>pending <lb/>investigation by the CBI, Directorate of <lb/>Enforcement <lb/>and <lb/>Ors. <lb/>agencies <lb/>or <lb/>cause <lb/>prejudice to those who are facing prosecution <lb/>in the cases registered by the CBI or who may <lb/>face <lb/>prosecution <lb/>on <lb/>the <lb/>basis <lb/>of <lb/>chargesheet(s) which may be filed by the CBI <lb/>in future and the Special Judge, CBI shall <lb/>decide <lb/>the <lb/>matter <lb/>uninfluenced <lb/>by <lb/>this <lb/>judgment.

			<body>India informed this Court that the Union had decided to <lb/>give effect to the judgment, in so far as the <lb/>allocation of spectrum is concerned. In the above view <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>matter, <lb/>one <lb/>only <lb/>needs <lb/>to <lb/>notice <lb/>the <lb/>observations recorded by this Court in paragraphs 95 <lb/>and 96 extracted hereinabove. <lb/>A perusal of the <lb/>aforesaid paragraphs reveals, that in line with the <lb/>judgments rendered by this Court interpreting Article <lb/>14 of the Constitution of India, this Court yet again <lb/>held, that while awarding a contact or a licence, the <lb/>executive must adopt a transparent and fair method. <lb/>The executive must ensure, that all eligible persons <lb/>get a fair opportunity to compete. <lb/>For awarding <lb/>contracts or licences, the executive should adopt a <lb/>rational method, so as to ensure that claims of worthy <lb/>applicants are not scuttled. On the subject of natural <lb/>resources like spectrum, etc., this Court held that it <lb/>was the bounden duty of the State to ensure the <lb/>adoption of a non-discriminatory method which would <lb/>result in protection of national/public interest. This <lb/>Court also expressed the view that &quot;perhaps&quot; the best <lb/>method for doing so would be through a duly publicized <lb/>auction conducted fairly and impartially. Thus viewed, <lb/></body>

			<body>it was affirmed, that the State was duty bound to adopt <lb/>the method of auction by giving wide publication while <lb/>alienating natural resources, so as to ensure that all <lb/>eligible persons can participate in the process. <lb/>7. <lb/>The parameters laid by this Court on the scope <lb/>of applicability of Article 14 of the Constitution of <lb/>India, <lb/>in <lb/>matters <lb/>where <lb/>the <lb/>State, <lb/>its <lb/>instrumentalities, and their functionaries, are engaged <lb/>in contractual obligations (as they emerge from the <lb/>judgments extracted in paragraph 6 above) are being <lb/>briefly paraphrased. <lb/>For an action to be able to <lb/>withstand the test of Article 14 of the Constitution of <lb/>India, it has already been expressed in the &quot;main <lb/>opinion&quot; that it has to be fair, reasonable, non-<lb/>discriminatory, transparent, non-capricious, unbiased, <lb/>without <lb/>favouritism <lb/>or <lb/>nepotism, <lb/>in <lb/>pursuit <lb/>of <lb/>promotion <lb/>of <lb/>healthy <lb/>competition <lb/>and <lb/>equitable <lb/>treatment. <lb/>The judgments referred to, endorse all <lb/>those <lb/>requirements <lb/>where <lb/>the <lb/>State, <lb/>its <lb/>instrumentalities, and their functionaries, are engaged <lb/>in <lb/>contractual <lb/>transactions. <lb/>Therefore, <lb/>all <lb/>&quot;governmental <lb/>policy&quot; <lb/>drawn <lb/>with <lb/>reference <lb/>to <lb/>contractual matters, it has been held, must conform to <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 206 <lb/></note>

			<page> 207 <lb/></page>

			<body>the aforesaid parameters. <lb/>While Article 14 of the <lb/>Constitution <lb/>of <lb/>India <lb/>permits <lb/>a <lb/>reasonable <lb/>classification having a rational nexus to the object <lb/>sought to be achieved, it does not permit the power of <lb/>pick and choose arbitrarily out of several persons <lb/>falling in the same category. Therefore, a criteria or <lb/>procedure has to be adopted so that the choice among <lb/>those falling in the same category is based on reason, <lb/>fair play and non-arbitrariness. <lb/>Even if there are <lb/>only <lb/>two <lb/>contenders <lb/>falling <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>zone <lb/>of <lb/>consideration, there should be a clear, transparent and <lb/>objective criteria or procedure to indicate which out <lb/>of the two is to be preferred. It is this, which would <lb/>ensure transparency. <lb/>8. <lb/>Another aspect which emerges from the judgments <lb/>(extracted in paragraph 6 above) is that, the State, <lb/>its instrumentalities and their functionaries, while <lb/>exercising their executive power in matters of trade or <lb/>business etc. including making of contracts, should be <lb/>mindful of public interest, public purpose and public <lb/>good. <lb/>This is so, because every holder of public <lb/>office by virtue of which he acts on behalf of the <lb/>State, <lb/>or <lb/>its <lb/>instrumentalities, <lb/>is <lb/>ultimately <lb/></body>

			<body>accountable to the people in whom sovereignty vests. <lb/>As such, all powers vested in the State are meant to be <lb/>exercised for public good and in public interest. <lb/>Therefore, the question of unfettered discretion in an <lb/>executive authority, just does not arise. The fetters <lb/>on discretion are -a clear, transparent and objective <lb/>criteria or procedure which promotes public interest, <lb/>public purpose and public good. A public authority is <lb/>ordained, therefore to act, reasonably and in good <lb/>faith and upon lawful and relevant grounds of public <lb/>interest. <lb/>9. <lb/>Observations recorded by this Court on the <lb/>subject of revenue returns, during the course of the <lb/>States engagements in commercial ventures (emerging <lb/>from the judgments extracted in paragraph 6 above), are <lb/>being summarized hereunder. <lb/>It has been held, where <lb/>the Sate is simply selling a product, there can be no <lb/>doubt that the State must endeavour to obtain the <lb/>highest price, subject of course to any other <lb/>overriding public consideration. <lb/>The validity of a <lb/>trading agreement executed by the Government has to be <lb/>judged by the test, that the entire benefit arising <lb/>therefrom enures to the State, and is not used as a <lb/></body>

			<body>cloak for conferring private benefits on a limited <lb/>class of persons. If a contract has been entered into, <lb/>taking in account the interest of the State and the <lb/>public, the same would not be interfered with by a <lb/>Court, by assuming the position of an appellate <lb/>authority. <lb/>The endeavour to get the State the &quot;full <lb/>value&quot; of its resources, it has been held, is <lb/>particularly pronounced in the sale of State owned <lb/>natural resources, to the private sector. Whenever the <lb/>State gets less than the full value of the assets, it <lb/>has been inferred, that the country has been cheated, <lb/>in a much as, it amounts to a simple transfer of <lb/>wealth, from the citizens as a whole, to whoever gets <lb/>the assets at a discount. <lb/>And in that sense, it has <lb/>been concluded, the wealth that belongs to the nation <lb/>is lost. <lb/>In Reliance Natural Resources Ltd.&apos;s case <lb/>(supra), the Union of India adopted the position, that <lb/>natural resources are vested in the State as a matter <lb/>of trust, for and on behalf of the citizens of the <lb/>country. <lb/>It was also acknowledged, that it was the <lb/>solemn duty of the State, to protect those natural <lb/>resources. <lb/>More importantly, it was accepted, that <lb/>natural resources must always be used in the common <lb/></body>

			<body>interest of the citizens of the country, and not for <lb/>private interest. <lb/>10. <lb/>Based <lb/>on <lb/>the <lb/>legal/constitutional <lb/>parameters/requirements culled out in the preceding <lb/>three paragraphs, I shall venture an opinion on whether <lb/>there are circumstances in which natural resources <lb/>ought to be disposed of only by ensuring maximum <lb/>returns. <lb/>For this, I shall place reliance on a <lb/>conclusion drawn in the &quot;main opinion&quot;, namely, <lb/>&quot;Distribution <lb/>of <lb/>natural <lb/>resources <lb/>is <lb/>a <lb/>policy <lb/>decision, and the means adopted for the same are thus, <lb/>executive prerogatives. <lb/>However, when such a policy <lb/>decision is not backed by a social or welfare purpose, <lb/>and precious and scarce natural resources are alienated <lb/>for commercial pursuits of profit maximizing private <lb/>entrepreneurs, adoption of means other than those that <lb/>are competitive and maximize revenue, may be arbitrary <lb/>and face the wrath of Article 14 of the Constitution.&quot; <lb/>(refer to paragraph 149 of the &quot;main opinion&quot;). I am <lb/>in respectful agreement with the aforesaid conclusion, <lb/>and <lb/>would <lb/>accordingly <lb/>opine, <lb/>that <lb/>when <lb/>natural <lb/>resources are made available by the State to private <lb/>persons for commercial exploitation exclusively for <lb/></body>

			<body>their individual gains, the State&apos;s endeavour must be <lb/>towards maximization of revenue returns. <lb/>This alone <lb/>would ensure, that the fundamental right enshrined in <lb/>Article 14 of the Constitution of India (assuring <lb/>equality before the law and equal protection of the <lb/>laws), and the directive principle contained in Article <lb/>39(b) of the Constitution of India (that material <lb/>resources of the community are so distributed as best <lb/>to subserve the common good), have been extended to the <lb/>citizens of the country. <lb/>11. <lb/>A similar conclusion would also emerge in a <lb/>slightly different situation. <lb/>This Court in a case <lb/>dealing with a challenge to the allotment of retail <lb/>outlets for petroleum products [Common Cause, A <lb/>Registered Society Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors., (1996) 6 <lb/>SCC 530] has held, that Article 14 of the Constitution <lb/>of India, does not countenance discretionary power <lb/>which is capable of being exercised arbitrarily. While <lb/>accepting that Article 14 of the Constitution of India <lb/>permits a reasonable classification having a rational <lb/>nexus to the object sought to be achieved, it was held <lb/>that Article 14 of the Constitution of India does not <lb/>permit the State to pick and choose arbitrarily out of <lb/></body>

			<body>several persons falling in the same category. <lb/>A <lb/>transparent and objective criteria/procedure has to be <lb/>evolved so that the choice amongst those belonging to <lb/>the same class or category is based on reason, fair <lb/>play, and non-arbitrariness. <lb/>Envisage a situation as <lb/>the <lb/>one <lb/>expressed <lb/>above, <lb/>where <lb/>by <lb/>reasonable <lb/>classification based on some public purpose, the choice <lb/>is limited to a set of private persons, amongst whom <lb/>alone, the State has decided to dispose of natural <lb/>resources. <lb/>Herein again, in my opinion, if the <lb/>participation of private persons is for commercial <lb/>exploitation exclusively for their individual gains, <lb/>then the State&apos;s endeavour to maximize revenue alone, <lb/>would satisfy the constitutional mandate contained in <lb/>Articles 14 and 39(b) of the Constitution of India. <lb/>12. <lb/>In the &quot;main opinion&quot;, it has been concluded, <lb/>that auction is not a constitutional mandate, in the <lb/>nature of an absolute principle which has to be applied <lb/>in all situations. And as such, auction cannot be read <lb/>into Article 14 of the Constitution of India, so as to <lb/>be applied in all situations (refer to paragraph 107 of <lb/>the &quot;main opinion&quot;). <lb/>Auction is certainly not a <lb/>constitutional mandate in the manner expressed, but it <lb/></body>

			<body>can surely be applied in some situations to maximize <lb/>revenue returns, to satisfy legal and constitutional <lb/>requirements. <lb/>It is, therefore, that I have chosen to <lb/>express the manner of disposal of natural resources by using <lb/>the words &quot;maximization of revenue&quot; in place of the term <lb/>&quot;auction&quot;, in the foregoing two paragraphs. But it may be <lb/>pointed out, the Attorney General for India had acknowledged <lb/>during the course of hearing, that auction by way of <lb/>competitive bidding was certainly an indisputable means, by <lb/>which maximization of revenue returns is assured (in this <lb/>behalf other observations recorded by me in paragraph 3 <lb/>above may also be kept in mind). In the aforesaid view of <lb/>the matter, all that needs to be stated is, that if the <lb/>State arrives at the conclusion, in a given situation, <lb/>that maximum revenue would be earned by auction of the <lb/>natural resource in question, then that alone would be <lb/>the process which it would have to adopt, in the <lb/>situations <lb/>contemplated <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>foregoing <lb/>two <lb/>paragraphs. <lb/>13. <lb/>One is compelled to take judicial notice of the <lb/>fact, that allotment of natural resources is an issue <lb/>of extensive debate in the country, so much so, that <lb/>the issue of allocation of such resources had recently <lb/></body>

			<body>resulted in a washout of two sessions of Parliament. <lb/>The current debate on allotment of material resources <lb/>has been prompted by a report submitted by the <lb/>Comptroller and Auditor General, asserting extensive <lb/>loss in revenue based on inappropriate allocations. <lb/>The report it is alleged, points out that private and <lb/>public sector companies had made windfall gains because <lb/>the process of competitive bidding had not been <lb/>adopted. The country witnessed a similar political spat <lb/>a little while earlier, based on the allocation of the <lb/>2G spectrum. <lb/>On that occasion the controversy was <lb/>brought to this Court by way of a public interest <lb/>litigation, the judgment whereof is reported as Centre <lb/>for Public Interest Litigation Vs. Union of India, <lb/>(2012) 3 SCC 1. Extensive revenue loss, in the course <lb/>of allocation of the 2G spectrum was duly noticed. On <lb/>each occasion when the issue of allocation of natural <lb/>resources, results in an alleged loss of revenue, it is <lb/>portrayed as a loss to the nation. <lb/>The issue then <lb/>becomes a subject matter of considerable debate at all <lb/>levels of the Indian polity. Loss of one, essentially <lb/>entails a gain to the other. <lb/>On each such occasion <lb/>loss to the nation, translates into the identification <lb/></body>

			<body>of private players as the beneficiaries. <lb/>If one were <lb/>to accept the allegations appearing in the media, on <lb/>account of defects in the disposal mechanism, private <lb/>parties have been beneficiaries to the tune of lakhs of <lb/>crores of Indian Rupees, just for that reason. In the <lb/>current debate, rival political parties have made <lb/>allegations against those responsible, which have been <lb/>repudiated with counter allegations. <lb/>This Court is <lb/>not, and should never be seen to be, a part of that <lb/>debate. <lb/>But it does seem, that the Presidential <lb/>reference is aimed at invoking this Court&apos;s advisory <lb/>jurisdiction to iron out the creases, so that legal and <lb/>constitutional parameters are correctly understood. <lb/>This would avoid such controversies in future. <lb/>It is <lb/>therefore, that an opinion is also being rendered by <lb/>me, on the fourth question, namely, &quot;What is the <lb/>permissible scope for interference by courts with <lb/>policy making by the Government including methods for <lb/>disposal of natural resources?&quot; <lb/>On this the advice <lb/>tendered in the &quot;main opinion&quot; inter alia expresses, <lb/>&quot;We may, however, hasten to add that the Court can test <lb/>the legality and constitutionality of these methods. <lb/>When questioned, the Courts are entitled to analyse the <lb/></body>

Certain principles of policy to be <lb/>followed by the State -The State shall <lb/>in particular, direct its policy towards <lb/>securing -<lb/>(b) that the ownership and control of the <lb/>material resources of the community are <lb/>so distributed as best to subserve the <lb/>common good ; <lb/>(emphasis is mine) <lb/>The mandate contained in the Article extracted above <lb/>envisages, that all material resources ought to be <lb/></body>

			<body>distributed in a manner which would &quot;best subserve the <lb/>common good&quot;. <lb/>It is therefore apparent, that <lb/>governmental policy for distribution of such resources <lb/>should be devised by keeping in mind the &quot;common good&quot; <lb/>of the community i.e., the citizens of this country. <lb/>It has been expressed in the &quot;main opinion&quot;, that <lb/>matters of policy fall within the realm of the <lb/>legislature or the executive, and cannot be interfered <lb/>with, unless the policy is in violation of statutory <lb/>law, or is ultra vires the provision(s) of the <lb/>Constitution of India. It is not within the scope of <lb/>judicial review for a Court to suggest an alternative <lb/>policy, which in the wisdom of the Court could be <lb/>better suited in the circumstances of a case. Thus far <lb/>the position is clearly unambiguous. <lb/>The legality and constitutionality of policy is <lb/>one matter, and the manner of its implementation quite <lb/>another. Even at the implementation stage a forthright <lb/>and legitimate policy, may take the shape of an <lb/>illegitimate stratagem (which has been illustrated at a <lb/>later juncture hereinafter). <lb/>Since the Presidential <lb/>reference is not based on any concrete fact situation, <lb/></body>

			<body>it would be appropriate to hypothetically create one. <lb/>This would enable those responsible for decision <lb/>making, to be able to appreciate the options available <lb/>to them, without the fear of trespassing beyond the <lb/>limitations of legality and constitutionality. <lb/>This <lb/>would also ensure that a truly meaningful opinion has <lb/>been rendered. The illustration, that has been chosen <lb/>is imaginary, and therefore, should not be taken as a <lb/>reference <lb/>to <lb/>any <lb/>similar <lb/>real <lb/>life <lb/>situation(s)/circumstance(s). The focus in the instant <lb/>consideration is limited to allocation of natural <lb/>resources for private commercial exploitation, i.e., <lb/>where a private player will be the beneficiary of such <lb/>allocation, and will exploit the natural resource to <lb/>make personal profits therefrom. <lb/>The illustration chosen will be used to express an <lb/>opinion on matters which are governed by statutory <lb/>provisions, as also, those which are based on <lb/>governmental policy. This is so because in so far as <lb/>the present controversy is concerned, the parameters <lb/>for distribution of natural resources must be examined <lb/>under these two heads separately. <lb/></body>

			<body>Coal is a natural resource. <lb/>It shall constitute <lb/>the illustrative natural resource for the present <lb/>consideration. <lb/>Let us assume a governmental decision <lb/>to <lb/>allocate <lb/>coal <lb/>lots <lb/>for <lb/>private <lb/>commercial <lb/>exploitation. <lb/>First, the legislative policy angle. <lb/>Reference may be made to the Mines and Minerals <lb/>(Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (hereinafter <lb/>referred to as, the MMDR Act). <lb/>The enactment deals <lb/>exclusively with natural resources. Section 11A of the <lb/>MMDR Act has been chosen as the illustrative provision, <lb/>to demonstrate how a forthright legitimate legislative <lb/>policy, may take the shape of an illegitimate <lb/>stratagem. <lb/>The choice of Section 11A aforesaid is on <lb/>account of the fact that it was added to the MMDR Act <lb/>only on 13.2.2012, and as such, there may not have <lb/>been, as of now, any actual allocation of coal lots <lb/>based thereon. <lb/>Section 11A of the MMDR Act, is <lb/>being placed hereunder : <lb/>&quot;11A. Procedure in respect of coal or lignite <lb/>-The Central Government may, for the purpose <lb/>of granting reconnaissance permit, prospecting <lb/>licence or mining lease in respect of an area <lb/>containing coal or lignite, select, through <lb/>auction by competitive bidding on such terms <lb/>and conditions as may be prescribed, a company <lb/>engaged in, -<lb/>(i) <lb/>production of iron and steel; <lb/></body>

			<body>(ii) <lb/>generation of power; <lb/>(iii) washing of coal obtained from a <lb/>mine; or <lb/>(iv) <lb/>such <lb/>other <lb/>end <lb/>use <lb/>as <lb/>the <lb/>Central Government <lb/>may, <lb/>by <lb/>notification <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>Official Gazette, specify, and the <lb/>State Government shall grant such <lb/>reconnaissance <lb/>permit, <lb/>prospecting <lb/>licence or mining lease in respect of <lb/>coal or lignite to such company as <lb/>selected through auction by competitive <lb/>bidding under this section: <lb/>Provided that the auction by competitive <lb/>bidding shall not be applicable to an area <lb/>containing coal or lignite,-<lb/>(a) where such area is considered for <lb/>allocation to a Government <lb/>company <lb/>or <lb/>corporation <lb/>for mining or such other <lb/>specified end use; <lb/>(b) where such area is considered for <lb/>allocation <lb/>to <lb/>a <lb/>company <lb/>or <lb/>corporation <lb/>that <lb/>has been awarded <lb/>a <lb/>power <lb/>project <lb/>on <lb/>the <lb/>basis <lb/>of <lb/>competitive <lb/>bids <lb/>for <lb/>tariff <lb/>(including Ultra Mega Power Projects).&quot; <lb/>Explanation -<lb/>For the purposes of this <lb/>section &quot;company&quot; means a company as defined <lb/>in section 3 of the Companies Act, 1956 and <lb/>includes a foreign company within the meaning <lb/>of section 591 of that Act. <lb/>(emphasis is mine) <lb/>For the grant of a mining lease in respect of an area <lb/>containing coal, the provision leaves no room for any <lb/>doubt, that selection would be made through auction by <lb/>competitive bidding. <lb/>No process other than auction, <lb/></body>

			<body>can therefore be adopted for the grant of a coal mining <lb/>lease. <lb/>Section 11A of the MMDR Act also defines the zone <lb/>of eligibility, for participation in such competitive <lb/>bidding. To be eligible, the contender must be engaged <lb/>in the production of iron and steel, or generation of <lb/>power, or washing of coal obtained from a mine, or an <lb/>activity notified by the Central Government. <lb/>Only <lb/>those satisfying the legislatively prescribed zone of <lb/>eligibility, are permitted to compete for a coal mining <lb/>lease. <lb/>For the sake of fairness, and to avoid <lb/>arbitrariness, the provision contemplates, that the <lb/>highest bidder amongst those who participate in the <lb/>process of competitive bidding, would succeed in <lb/>obtaining the concerned coal mining lease. <lb/>The <lb/>legislative policy limiting the zone of consideration <lb/>could be subject matter of judicial review. <lb/>It could <lb/>be assailed, in case of violation of a legal or <lb/>constitutional provision. <lb/>As expressed in the &quot;main <lb/>opinion&quot; the facts of each individual case, will be the <lb/>deciding factor for such determination. In the absence <lb/>of any such challenge, the legislative policy would be <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 221 <lb/></note>

			<page> 222 <lb/></page>

			<body>binding and enforceable. In such an eventuality, those <lb/>who do not fall within the zone of consideration, would <lb/>be precluded from the process of competitive bidding <lb/>for a mining lease over an area having coal deposits. <lb/>In the process of auction through competitive bidding, <lb/>if the objective is to best subserve the common good <lb/>(as in Article 39(b) of the Constitution of India) the <lb/>legislative policy would be fully legitimate. <lb/>If <lb/>however, the expressed legislative policy has no nexus <lb/>to any legitimate objective, or it transgresses the <lb/>mandate of distribution of material resources to &quot;best <lb/>subserve the common good&quot;, it may well be unfair, <lb/>unreasonable or discriminatory. <lb/>For an effective analysis, Section 11A of the MMDR <lb/>Act needs a further closer examination. <lb/>Section 11A <lb/>aforesaid, as an exception to the legislative policy <lb/>referred to in the foregoing paragraph, also provides <lb/>for the grant of a mining lease for coal to a private <lb/>player, without following the auction route. <lb/>The <lb/>provision contemplates the grant of a mining lease for <lb/>coal, <lb/>without <lb/>any <lb/>reciprocal <lb/>monetary <lb/>or <lb/>other <lb/>consideration from the lessee. The proviso in section <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 222<lb/></note>

			<page> 223 <lb/></page>

			<body>11A of the MMDR Act, excludes the auction route where <lb/>the beneficiary is engaged in power generation. <lb/>Such <lb/>exclusion, <lb/>is <lb/>contemplated <lb/>only <lb/>when <lb/>the <lb/>power <lb/>generating concern, was awarded the power project, on <lb/>the basis of &quot;competitive bids for tariff&quot;. <lb/>It is <lb/>important to highlight, that there is no express <lb/>assurance <lb/>in <lb/>section <lb/>11A <lb/>aforesaid, <lb/>that <lb/>every <lb/>entrepreneur who sets up a power project, having <lb/>succeeded on the basis of competitive bidding, would be <lb/>allotted a coal mining lease. But if such an allotment <lb/>is <lb/>actually <lb/>made, <lb/>it <lb/>is <lb/>apparent, <lb/>that <lb/>such <lb/>entrepreneur would get the coal lot, without having to <lb/>participate in an auction, free of cost. <lb/>The <lb/>legislative policy incorporated in Section 11A of the <lb/>MMDR Act, if intended to best subserve the common good, <lb/>may well be valid, even in a situation where the <lb/>material resource is being granted free of cost. What <lb/>appears to be free of cost in the proviso in Section <lb/>11A of the MMDR Act, is in actuality consideration <lb/>enmeshed in providing electricity at a low tariff. The <lb/>aforesaid proviso may be accepted as fair, and may not <lb/>violate the mandate contained in Article 14 of the <lb/>Constitution of India, or even the directive principles <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 223 <lb/></note>

			<page> 224 <lb/></page>

			<body>contained in Article 39(b) of the Constitution of <lb/>India. <lb/>Hypothetically, <lb/>assume <lb/>a <lb/>competitive <lb/>bidding <lb/>process for tariff, amongst private players interested <lb/>in a power generation project. The private party which <lb/>agrees to supply electricity at the lowest tariff would <lb/>succeed in such an auction. The important question is, <lb/>if the private party who succeeds in the award of the <lb/>project, is granted a mining lease in respect of an <lb/>area containing coal, free of cost, would such a grant <lb/>satisfy the test of being fair, reasonable, equitable <lb/>and impartial. <lb/>The answer to the instant query would <lb/>depend <lb/>on <lb/>the <lb/>facts <lb/>of <lb/>each <lb/>individual <lb/>case. <lb/>Therefore, the answer could be in the affirmative, as <lb/>well as, in the negative. Both aspects of the matter <lb/>are being explained in the succeeding paragraph. <lb/>Going back to the hypothetical illustration based <lb/>on Section 11A of the MMDR Act. <lb/>One would add some <lb/>further facts so as to be able to effectively project <lb/>the legal point of view. <lb/>If the bidding process to <lb/>determine the lowest tariff has been held, and the said <lb/>bidding process has taken place without the knowledge, <lb/></body>

			<body>that a coal mining lease would be allotted to the <lb/>successful bidder, yet the successful bidder is awarded <lb/>a coal mining lease. Would such a grant be valid? In <lb/>the aforesaid fact situation, the answer to the <lb/>question posed, may well be in the negative. <lb/>This is <lb/>so because, the competitive bidding for tariff was not <lb/>based on the knowledge of gains, that would come to the <lb/>vying contenders, on account of grant of a coal mining <lb/>lease. <lb/>Such a grant of a coal mining lease would <lb/>therefore have no nexus to the &quot;competitive bid for <lb/>tariff&quot;. <lb/>Grant of a mining lease for coal in this <lb/>situation would therefore be a windfall, without any <lb/>nexus to the object sought to be achieved. <lb/>In the <lb/>bidding process, the parties concerned had no occasion <lb/>to bring down the electricity tariff, on the basis of <lb/>gains likely to accrue to them, from the coal mining <lb/>lease. <lb/>In this case, a material resource would be <lb/>deemed to have been granted without a reciprocal <lb/>consideration i.e., free of cost. <lb/>Such an allotment <lb/>may not be fair and may certainly be described as <lb/>arbitrary, and violative of the Article 14 of the <lb/>Constitution of India. Such an allotment having no <lb/>nexus to the objective of subserving the common good, <lb/></body>

			<note place='footnote'>page 225 <lb/></note>

			<page> 226 <lb/></page>

			<body>would fall foul even of the directive principle <lb/>contained in Article 39(b) of the Constitution of <lb/>India. Therefore, a forthright and legitimate policy, <lb/>on account of defective implementation, may become <lb/>unacceptable in law. <lb/>In a slightly changed factual scenario, the <lb/>conclusion may well be different. <lb/>If before the <lb/>holding the process of auction, for the award of a <lb/>power project (based on competitive bids for tariff), <lb/>it is made known to the contenders, that the successful <lb/>bidder would be entitled to a mining lease over an area <lb/>containing coal, those competing for the power project <lb/>would necessarily incorporate the profit they were <lb/>likely to make from such mining lease. <lb/>While <lb/>projecting the tariff at which they would supply <lb/>electricity, they would be in a position to offset such <lb/>profits from their costs. This would result in an in <lb/>an opportunity to the contenders to lower the tariff to <lb/>a level lower than would have been possible without the <lb/>said lease. <lb/>In such a situation the gains from the <lb/>coal mining lease, would be enmeshed in the competitive <lb/>bidding for tariff. Therefore, it would not be just to <lb/></body>

			<body>assume in the instant sequence of facts, that the coal <lb/>lot has been granted free of cost. One must read into <lb/>the said grant, a reciprocal consideration to provide <lb/>electricity at a lower tariff. In the instant factual <lb/>scenario, the allotment of the mining lease would be <lb/>deemed to be aimed at &quot;subserving the common good&quot; in <lb/>terms of Article 39(b) of the Constitution of India. <lb/>Therefore even the allotment of such a mining lease, <lb/>which appears to result in the allocation of a natural <lb/>resource free of cost, may well satisfy the test of <lb/>fairness and reasonableness contemplated in Article 14 <lb/>of the Constitution of India. Moreso, because a fair <lb/>playing field having been made available to all those <lb/>competing for the power project, by making them aware <lb/>of the grant of a coal mining lease, well before the <lb/>bidding process. The question of favouritism therefore <lb/>would not arise. <lb/>Would such a grant of a natural <lb/>resource, free of cost, be valid? <lb/>The answer to the <lb/>query, in the instant fact situation, may well be in <lb/>the affirmative. <lb/>The policy of allocation of natural resources for <lb/>public good can be defined by the legislature, as has <lb/></body>

			<page> 228 <lb/></page>

			<body>been discussed in the foregoing paragraphs. Likewise, <lb/>policy for allocation of natural resources may also be <lb/>determined by the executive. <lb/>The parameters for <lb/>determining the legality and constitutionality of the <lb/>two are exactly the same. In the aforesaid view of the <lb/>matter, there can be no doubt about the conclusion <lb/>recorded in the &quot;main opinion&quot; that auction which is <lb/>just one of the several price recovery mechanisms, <lb/>cannot be held to be the only constitutionally <lb/>recognized method for alienation of natural resources. <lb/>That should not be understood to mean, that it can <lb/>never be a valid method for disposal of natural <lb/>resources (refer to paragraphs 10 to 12 of my instant <lb/>opinion). <lb/>I would therefore conclude by stating that no part <lb/>of the natural resource can be dissipated as a matter <lb/>of largess, charity, donation or endowment, for private <lb/>exploitation. <lb/>Each bit of natural resource expended <lb/>must bring back a reciprocal consideration. <lb/>The <lb/>consideration may be in the nature of earning revenue <lb/>or may be to &quot;best subserve the common good&quot;.
