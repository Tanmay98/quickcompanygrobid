			<body>These writ petitions have been filed by the petitioners <lb/>aggrieved against the order dated 12.10.2021 passed by the <lb/>respondents pursuant to the directions given by this Court in <lb/>various writ petitions led by Sangeeta Patidar vs. The State of <lb/>Rajsthan &amp; Ors. : S.B.C.W.P. No.7730/2021 decided on <lb/>10.08.2021. <lb/>The petitioners, aggrieved by allotment of the districts <lb/>pursuant to reshuffling by the respondents, approached this Court <lb/>by filing various writ petitions led by Sangeeta Patidar (supra). A <lb/>Coordinate Bench of this Court after hearing the parties and on <lb/>their request, inter-alia, passed the following orders: -<lb/>&quot;1. The present bunch of writ petitions enlisted <lb/>in the appended Schedule, which shall be treated to <lb/>be part and parcel of the order instant, are decided by <lb/>a common order. <lb/>2. <lb/>These writ petitions have been preferred <lb/>by the petitioners, interalia, laying challenge to the <lb/>order of the allotment of District to the petitioners. <lb/>3. <lb/>Learned counsel for the petitioners submit <lb/>that the issue involved in the present writ petitions is <lb/>squarely covered by the judgment of this Court dated <lb/>16.10.2020, passed by Jaipur Bench of this Court in <lb/>bunch of writ petitions led by Reena Vs. State of Raj. <lb/>&amp; Ors.(S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.7617/2020). <lb/>4. <lb/>Mr. Jangid, learned counsel for the <lb/>respondents does not dispute the aforesaid position of <lb/>facts and law. <lb/>5. <lb/>The Jaipur Bench in its judgment in the <lb/>case of Reena (supra) has held thus: <lb/>&quot;Keeping in view that the same principle <lb/>would be applied to the present selections, <lb/>this Court is satisfied that the directions <lb/>issued by the Coordinate Bench, at Principal <lb/>Seat, Jodhpur, as quoted in Para 35 of the <lb/></body>

			<note place='headnote'>[CW-15319/2021] <lb/></note>

			<body>judgment (supra), would have full application <lb/>to all the candidates, who have appeared in <lb/>the selection process and have been selected <lb/>as Teacher Grade-II. This Court also notices <lb/>that the case of the petitioners is identical to <lb/>the case of those petitioners, who were before <lb/>the Court in the case of Nirmal Jat (supra).&quot; <lb/>6. <lb/>Accordingly these writ petitions are <lb/>allowed. <lb/>7. <lb/>The petitioners shall be free to make a <lb/>detailed representation to the concerned authority in <lb/>terms of the circular dated 25.09.2020, 30.09.2020 <lb/>(if any) and any other circular if prevailing presently. <lb/>The representation be filed on or before 31.10.2021. <lb/>8. <lb/>Till the petitioners&apos; representations are <lb/>decided as directed hereby, interim order passed in <lb/>the writ petitions shall continue. <lb/>9. <lb/>All pending applications stand disposed of <lb/>accordingly.&quot; <lb/>Pursuant to the order dated 10.08.2021 passed by the <lb/>Coordinate Bench , the respondents issued a communication dated <lb/>12.10.2021 (Annex.7 to S.B.C.W.P. No.14988/2021) referring to <lb/>order passed by the Court and directed as under: <lb/></body>

			<note place='headnote'>[CW-15319/2021] <lb/></note>

			<body> The petitioners are aggrieved of the second part of Point <lb/>No.2, wherein it has been indicated that P.T.I. Grade-III, who have <lb/>applied for previously allotted/other districts other than the <lb/>reshuffled districts allotted to them, their representations be <lb/>rejected. <lb/>It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that <lb/>the action of the respondents in confining the choice of petitioners <lb/>for allotment of districts pursuant to order passed by this Court in <lb/>the case of Sangeeta Patidar (supra) to the allotted district is <lb/>wholly incorrect; the respondents should have permitted the <lb/>petitioners to opt for any of the districts throughout the State and <lb/>as such, the action being contrary to the directions given by this <lb/>Court, the offending portion of the communication dated <lb/>12.10.2021 deserves to be struck down. <lb/></body>

			<note place='headnote'>[CW-15319/2021] <lb/></note>

			<body>Counsel for the petitioners, in the alternative, made <lb/>submissions that as the last date given in the case of Sangeeta <lb/>Patidar for making representation was 31.10.2021 and the <lb/>respondents had issued the communication dated 12.10.2021 and <lb/>petitioners were aggrieved of the stipulation made therein, some <lb/>of them could not make the representations by 31.10.2021 as per <lb/>communication dated 12.10.2021 and, therefore, they may be <lb/>granted one more opportunity to make representation in <lb/>consonance with communication dated 12.10.2021. <lb/>E-converso, learned counsel for the State submitted that the <lb/>order dated 12.10.2021 is in consonance with the directions given <lb/>by this Court in the case of Sangeeta Patidar (supra), inasmuch as <lb/>the said case was decided directing the respondents to follow the <lb/>judgment in the case of Nirmla Jat vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. : <lb/>S.B.C.W.P. No.5753/2020 decided on 14.09.2020. Once the <lb/>direction was to follow the directions issued in the case of Nirmla <lb/>Jat (supra), the communication dated 12.10.2021 issued is in <lb/>consonance with the directions contained therein, except for <lb/>change from division to district, inasmuch as cadre in the case of <lb/>Teacher Grade-II, which was the subject matter in the case of <lb/>Nirmla Jat (supra) was Division Wise, the cadre in the case of <lb/>P.T.I. Grade-III is District Wise and as such, the plea sought to be <lb/>raised by the petitioners being wholly baseless, the writ petitions <lb/>deserves to be dismissed. <lb/>Counsel for the respondents in peculiar circumstances of the <lb/>case do not object to the alternative prayer and submits that <lb/>representations, if any, should be filed within a period of ten days. <lb/>I have considered the submissions made by the counsel for <lb/>the parties and have perused the material available on record. <lb/></body>

			<body>A perusal of the order passed in the case of Sangeeta Patidar <lb/>(supra) would reveal that said petitions were decided while <lb/>referring to order passed in Reena vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. : <lb/>S.B.C.W.P. No.7617/2020 decided on 16.10.2020 at Jaipur Bench. <lb/>The Bench at Jaipur in the case of Reena (supra) referred to <lb/>paragraph 35 of the judgment in the case of Nirmla Jat (supra) <lb/>and directed the respondents to follow the same directions. This <lb/>Court in the case of Nirmla Jat (supra) had, inter alia, directed as <lb/>under: -<lb/>&quot;34. There is yet another reason, for which this <lb/>Court does not deem it appropriate to direct the <lb/>respondents to undertake the exercise afresh. <lb/>Seniority of the teachers is reckoned Division Wise. <lb/>Now all the teachers have been allotted the division <lb/>according to their merit cum preference. When it <lb/>comes to posting, it has to be noted that they are <lb/>subject to intra division transfers, hence, posting at a <lb/>particular place cannot be claimed as a matter of right. <lb/>Posting is only a matter of convenience, which can be <lb/>addressed/redressed at a later point of time. <lb/>35. Hence, considering the submission of the <lb/>State, as noticed in para No. 21 above and in view of <lb/>the <lb/>common <lb/>consensus <lb/>and <lb/>alternative <lb/>oral <lb/>submission of all the learned counsel for the respective <lb/>petitioners, this Court deems it appropriate and in the <lb/>interest of all the concerned, particularly the <lb/>candidates (who are not before this Court) to dispose <lb/>of all the writ petitions with following directions:-<lb/>(i) The State shall publish latest subject-wise and <lb/>category-wise vacant position of each division on its <lb/>website, within a period of 15 days from today. <lb/>(ii) All the petitioners herein may submit <lb/>representations to the Director, giving choice(s) qua <lb/></body>

			<note place='headnote'>[CW-15319/2021] <lb/></note>

			<body>the vacant positions [out of their division(s)], so <lb/>published by the State. Representation(s) be furnished <lb/>within a period of four weeks from publication of such <lb/>list. <lb/>(iii) The petitioners shall also be permitted to <lb/>request for mutual transfer within their division. <lb/>(iv) <lb/>The Director/Joint Director shall decide <lb/>petitioners&apos; representations within a period of four <lb/>weeks thereafter, while trying to accommodate the <lb/>petitioners in accordance with the preference given by <lb/>them, of course, if the relevant law/guidelines so <lb/>permit. <lb/>(v) In case, petitioners&apos; representations are <lb/>rejected, the respondents shall pass a reasoned order <lb/>under intimation to the concerned. <lb/>(vi) The petitioners will be free to take up their <lb/>remedies against such orders, in accordance with law.&quot; <lb/>It may be noticed here that the Bench in the case of Nirmla <lb/>Jat (supra) observed that seniority of the Teachers is reckoned <lb/>Division Wise, which in the case of P.T.I. Grade-III, which is <lb/>subject matter of the present writ petitions, is reckoned District <lb/>Wise. If the directions given in the case of Nirmla Jat (supra) are <lb/>read mutatis mutandis qua the present case, instead of &apos;Division&apos;, <lb/>&apos;District&apos; will have to be read and consequently, the directions as <lb/>given in the case of Nirmla Jat (supra) would inter alia read as <lb/>under: -<lb/>(i) The State shall publish latest subject-wise and category-<lb/>wise vacant position of each District on its website, within a period <lb/>of 15 days from today. <lb/>(ii) All the petitioners herein may submit representations to <lb/>the Director, giving choice(s) qua the vacant positions [out of their <lb/>district(s)], so published by the State. Representation(s) be <lb/></body>

			<body>furnished within a period of four weeks from publication of such <lb/>list. <lb/>(iii) The petitioners shall also be permitted to request for <lb/>mutual transfer within their district. <lb/>The respondents in the communication dated 12.10.2021, as <lb/>quoted herein before, have required that in case of Intra-District <lb/>transfer within newly allotted districts, if representation has been <lb/>made, the same may be disposed of as per the merit of the <lb/>candidate(s) and qua the representations seeking Inter-District <lb/>Transfers, it was directed that the same be dismissed. <lb/>The communication dated 12.10.2021 is in consonance with <lb/>the directions given in the case of Nirmla Jat (supra), when the <lb/>same is read in context of the district, wherein the Court has <lb/>specifically <lb/>indicated <lb/>that <lb/>the <lb/>petitioners <lb/>may <lb/>submit <lb/>representation giving choice of any vacant position (out of their <lb/>district) so published by the State. <lb/>Once in the case of Nirmla Jat (supra), the choice was <lb/>restricted to Division, wherein the cadre was Division Wise, the <lb/>stipulation made in the communication dated 12.10.2021 <lb/>restricting the choice within the district, in the present case, <lb/>where the cadre is District Wise, the same cannot be faulted on <lb/>any count. <lb/>In view of above fact situation, no case for interference in <lb/>the order dated 12.10.2021 is made out. The petitions have no <lb/>substance, they are therefore, dismissed. <lb/>In case the representations made by the petitioners are still <lb/>pending, the same may be decided expeditiously by the <lb/></body>

			<body>respondents, preferably within a period of three weeks in <lb/>accordance with communication dated 12.10.2021. <lb/>The petitioners, who have not made any representation in <lb/>consonance with communication dated 12.10.2021, they may <lb/>make representation within a period of ten days from today i.e. by <lb/>13.12.2021 and the respondents are directed to pass appropriate <lb/>orders thereon by 24.12.2021. <lb/>(ARUN BHANSALI),J <lb/>27, 108 to 214 <lb/>&amp; 216 to 219-DJ/-<lb/></body>
