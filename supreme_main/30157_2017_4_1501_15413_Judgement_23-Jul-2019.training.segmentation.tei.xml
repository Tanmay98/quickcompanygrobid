			Arun Mishra, J.
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			These writ petitions pertain to the projects of various companies of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group in the Noida and Greater Noida.
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			It is submitted on behalf of the petitioners that in 2011 in Noida and
			<lb />
			Greater Noida various real estate projects for housing were started. In the
			<lb />
			various projects, the Amrapali Group of Companies proposed to construct
			<lb />
			approximately 42,000 flats. Various brochures were published and it was
			<lb />
			assured that the delivery of possession shall be made in 36 months and
			<lb />
			other world-class amenities were also promised.
			<lb />
			3.
			<lb />
			Various home buyers booked their apartments during the period
			<lb />
			2010-2014. The buyers signed the Standard Form of Allotment-cum-Flat
			<lb />
			Buyers Agreement and even after payment of 40 to 100 percent of total
			<lb />
			consideration, they are faced with the threat of forfeiture of huge booking
			<lb />
			amount. The agreement contained specific terms as to interest. Under
			<lb />
			Clause 14 of the agreement, the builder authorised itself to finance loan
			<lb />
			from any financial institution by way of mortgage/charge/securitization of
			<lb />
			receivable of the land and flats and the allottees will have no objection in
			<lb />
			this regard. Clause 15 also authorised the builder to keep full authority
			<lb />
			over the flat depriving the allottees of any lien or interest despite payment
			<lb />
			of entire amount thereof.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<body>
			4.
			<lb />
			The builder under Clause 19(a) was obliged to complete the flats of
			<lb />
			M/s. Amrapali Centurion Park Private Limited within 30 months from the
			<lb />
			date of commencement of excavation/signing of the agreement, which may
			<lb />
			vary for plus/minus 6 months. Under Clause 19(c), builder fixed a paltry
			<lb />
			sum of Rs.5 per square feet super area per month for the period of delay,
			<lb />
			which would include any/all damages, compensation, claims for delayed
			<lb />
			possession.
			<lb />
			5.
			<lb />
			The buyers invested their life savings and some of them had obtained
			<lb />
			the loan from the Bank. Most of the buyers have made the payment to the
			<lb />
			extent of 50 percent to 100 percent abiding by the payment schedule. The
			<lb />
			dreams of the buyers of obtaining house were given serious jolts when M/s.
			<lb />
			Amrapali Silicon City Private Limited and M/s. Amrapali Centurian Park
			<lb />
			Private Limited, respondent Nos.3 and 4 herein respectively were found in
			<lb />
			serious breach of their obligation to deliver the flats within 36 months.
			<lb />
			They did not pay the amount either to the Noida or Greater Noida Authority
			<lb />
			and also to the Banks. Several revised dates of possession were fixed
			<lb />
			unilaterally, but they failed to deliver the flats. The Amrapali Group has
			<lb />
			failed to comply with its obligation under the subvention scheme, the
			<lb />
			tenure of which was approved by the bank/financial institution. The
			<lb />
			builder had failed to comply with the abovementioned scheme as the buyer
			<lb />
			making the payment of EMIs to the banks, thereby causing a double loss.
			<lb />
			Some of the consumers approached the National Consumer Dispute
			<lb />
			Redressal Commission (for short, &apos;the NCDRC&apos;) by filing Consumer
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			5
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Complaint No.213 of 2017 under Section 12(1)(c) of the Consumer
			<lb />
			Protection Act, 1986.
			<lb />
			6.
			<lb />
			The Bank of Baroda had filed Company Petition No. (IB)-
			<lb />
			121(PB)/2017 before the National Company Law Tribunal (for short, &apos;the
			<lb />
			NCLT&apos;) under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 for
			<lb />
			triggering the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process in the matter of
			<lb />
			M/s. Amrapali Silicon City Private Limited, respondent No.3. The NCLT
			<lb />
			appointed the Interim Resolution Professional (in short, the &apos;I.R.P&apos;).
			<lb />
			Moratorium was also declared thereby restricting the institution of any
			<lb />
			suits against the corporate debtor including execution of any judgment,
			<lb />
			decree or order; transferring, encumbering, alienating or disposing of by
			<lb />
			the corporate debtor any of its assets or any legal interest therein; and any
			<lb />
			action to foreclose, recover or enforce any security interest created by the
			<lb />
			corporate debtor in respect of its property under the Securitisation and
			<lb />
			Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest
			<lb />
			Act, 2002 (for short &apos;the SARFAESI Act&apos;). The order of NCLT has a direct
			<lb />
			bearing on the home buyers of M/s. Amrapali Centurian Park Private
			<lb />
			Limited, respondent no.4, which is virtually owned by M/s. Amrapali
			<lb />
			Silicon City Private Limited with 98.84 percent shareholding. Both the
			<lb />
			companies are run by the almost same set of Directors including Mr. Anil
			<lb />
			Kumar Sharma and Mr. Shiv Priya. Thus, in order to secure the interest of
			<lb />
			home buyers, in the instant petitions under Article 32, a plethora of
			<lb />
			intervention applications have been filed.
			<lb />
		</body>

			<lb />

		<body>
			7.
			<lb />
			It is submitted on behalf of petitioners that home buyers have put
			<lb />
			their lives at stake by paying their lifetime savings and hard-earned money
			<lb />
			in the purchase of flats. As such, they cannot be categorised as ordinary
			<lb />
			financial creditors to rank pretty low in the order of priority under Section
			<lb />
			53.
			<lb />
			Corporate builder heavily counts upon the home buyers as
			<lb />
			stakeholders to sustain in the market. Section 53 of the Insolvency and
			<lb />
			Bankruptcy Code, 2016 is irrational and violates the rights of the home
			<lb />
			buyers guaranteed under Article 21 as by subjecting the home buyers to
			<lb />
			the liquidation proceedings of discriminatory nature. The very survival of
			<lb />
			home buyers has been seriously jeopardised. Not only they are going to
			<lb />
			lose the entire money with accrued interest, but they also become
			<lb />
			financially crippled for all time to come even close to the dream of a new
			<lb />
			home, let alone purchase it. There is no equal protection under the
			<lb />
			Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The moratorium imposed by
			<lb />
			NCLT directly affecting not only the home buyers of M/s.Amrapali
			<lb />
			Centurion Park Private Limited, but also similarly situated lakhs of home
			<lb />
			buyers in various other projects. They cannot be deprived of their legal
			<lb />
			rights. Similar plight has been averred by the other buyers in the other
			<lb />
			several projects.
			<lb />
			8.
			<lb />
			The matter projects the issue of larger public interest. The real estate
			<lb />
			business has developed and it mainly survived by the money invested by
			<lb />
			the buyer for the purchase of the house. They have the right to obtain
			<lb />
			houses. The facts of the instant case project that Noida and Greater Noida
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			7
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			have allotted huge plots to the builders by charging a sum of approximately
			<lb />
			10 percent and in most of the cases, thereafter no money has been paid.
			<lb />
			The large number of projects which have come up not only in Noida and
			<lb />
			Greater Noida, but most of them have not been completed by the
			<lb />
			builders/promoters and they have siphoned buyers&apos; money in large scale.
			<lb />
			No action has been taken by the Noida and Greater Noida Authorities
			<lb />
			against builders for cancellation of leases due to violation to fulfil their
			<lb />
			obligation. Bankers have financed to builder certain loan on the condition
			<lb />
			to invest in the projects, but they have also permitted the money to be used
			<lb />
			as for other purposes as apparent from the report of the Forensic Audit in
			<lb />
			the instant case which had been submitted by Auditors -Mr. Pawan
			<lb />
			Kumar Aggarwal and Mr. Ravinder Bhatia. The facts which are projected
			<lb />
			in the Forensic Auditor Report speaks for itself.
			<lb />
			9.
			<lb />
			Before we consider the Forensic Audit, it would be appropriate to
			<lb />
			refer to certain orders which were passed from time to time by this Court.
			<lb />
			This Court on the application filed by petitioner -Bikram Chatterji, passed
			<lb />
			an order on 22.11.2017, directing builder to deposit 10 percent of the dues
			<lb />
			to Noida Authorities. This Court also directed that the phase in respect of
			<lb />
			which Occupancy Certificate and No Objection Certificate, if granted, the
			<lb />
			possession of flats shall be handed over to the respective flat buyers.
			<lb />
			Liberty was granted to flat owners to complete the finishing work.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, an order was passed on 31.1.2018, requesting the builder to
			<lb />
			deposit amount as ordered on 17.11.2017. It was also pointed that in
			<lb />
		</body>

		<body>
			several places firefighting devices were not installed though the places were
			<lb />
			occupied by thousands of families of Phase-I of Silicon City of Amrapali in
			<lb />
			Sector 76, Noida. Directions were issued to do the needful. We also
			<lb />
			directed to submit the proposal within one week with respect to all the
			<lb />
			projects, which were incomplete. On 22.2.2018, the following order was
			<lb />
			passed by this Court:
			<lb />
			&quot;Applications for impleadment(s) is/are allowed to the extent of
			<lb />
			intervention only.
			<lb />
			IN W.P.Nos.160,91,164 of 2018 AND D. NO. 6636 OF 2018
			<lb />
			Issue notice on the petition as well as on the prayer for interim relief
			<lb />
			returnable within two weeks.
			<lb />
			Dasti, in addition, is also permitted.
			<lb />
			IN W.P.(C) Nos. 942/2017 AND 8 OF 2018
			<lb />
			Heard learned senior counsel for the parties.
			<lb />
			Pursuant to the order passed on 21.02.2018, Mr. Ranjit Kumar,
			<lb />
			learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. Gaurav Bhatia and Alok
			<lb />
			Aggarwal, appearing on behalf of the promoters of Amrapali Group
			<lb />
			has produced a compilation &apos;A&apos; before this court on behalf of the
			<lb />
			said promotors disclosing the particulars of the on-going projects,
			<lb />
			stages of the work vis-a-vis the towers involved, the likely time to
			<lb />
			complete the remaining works and the cost of construction therefor.
			<lb />
			Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel, has in particular drawn
			<lb />
			the attention of this court at pages 4 &amp; 5 of the compilation &apos;A&apos;
			<lb />
			which deal with 19 towers as mentioned therein of Amrapali Leisure
			<lb />
			Valley Developers Pvt. Ltd. (Leisure Park). In the chart, on these two
			<lb />
			pages of the compilation amongst others the number of units,
			<lb />
			saleable area, the proposed/likely time to complete the finishing
			<lb />
			work, the total balance amount payable by the home buyers and the
			<lb />
			total expenditure to be incurred in completing the work, have been
			<lb />
			indicated. As this chart reveals the likely time to complete the work
			<lb />
			and to deliver possession in accordance with the law, ranges from 3
			<lb />
			to 15 months. According to the respondent, an amount of Rs.87.28
			<lb />
			crores is required to complete the finishing works in fairness as
			<lb />
			mentioned therein.
			<lb />
			When enquired by this court as to the guarantee for the
			<lb />
			implementation of the arrangements proposed for all practical
			<lb />
			purposes, Mr. Ranjit Kumar, on instructions, has submitted that to
			<lb />
			ensure that the works are completed by the time as proposed 12
			<lb />
			developers in addition to the Galaxy group have given their letters to
			<lb />
			collaborate with the respondent promoters for the said purposes as
			<lb />
			testified by the documents available in compilation &apos;B&apos;.
			<lb />
		</body>

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Learned counsel appearing for the home buyers, however, have
			<lb />
			expressed some reservation contending that the arrangements as
			<lb />
			proposed do not inspire confidence in view of the past experience
			<lb />
			and have pleaded that unless the 13 developers who undertake to
			<lb />
			collaborate with promotors of Amrapali Group are tied down with
			<lb />
			necessary conditions, the very executability of the project would be
			<lb />
			doubtful. To this Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel has
			<lb />
			urged that adequate undertakings would be given by the promoters
			<lb />
			of Amrapali Group as well as the other developers.
			<lb />
			Having regard to the rival submissions made and the attendant
			<lb />
			facts and circumstances and also considering the predominant
			<lb />
			interest of the home buyers, we are of the view that it would be in
			<lb />
			the fitness of things to permit the promotors of Amrapali Group to
			<lb />
			immediately start the finishing work as proposed in the units of the
			<lb />
			towers as listed at pages 4 &amp; 5 of Compilation &apos;A&apos; on the basis of the
			<lb />
			arrangements as proposed.
			<lb />
			In order to examine the bonafide of the proposal and the progress of
			<lb />
			the works that would be achieved, list these matters on 27th March
			<lb />
			at 2 P.M. By then the promotors of Amrapali Group would furnish
			<lb />
			to this court complete details of the proposals in all respects made
			<lb />
			by the collaborators/developers and ensure completion of the
			<lb />
			projects/finishing work as indicated in chart.
			<lb />
			We part with the belief that the respondents-developers would be
			<lb />
			true to their assurances to this court and also to the home buyers.
			<lb />
			Needless to say that all promotors of Amrapali Group shall furnish
			<lb />
			their undertaking by 7th March 2018. Further orders in this regard,
			<lb />
			as considered necessary, would be passed on the next date i.e. on
			<lb />
			27.03.2018.
			<lb />
			In response to the prayer made on behalf of the developers that the
			<lb />
			insolvency proceedings before the NCLT ought to be stayed, we on
			<lb />
			this stage leave the parties to make the appropriate prayer as
			<lb />
			advised before the said Forum.&quot;
			<lb />
			10. Keeping in view the predominant interest of the home buyers, vide
			<lb />
			above order we directed the Amrapali Group to complete the projects and
			<lb />
			the finishing work as assured, but it was not done as apprehended by the
			<lb />
			home-buyers. This Court vide order dated 15.3.2018, directed to submit a
			<lb />
			joint proposal with respect to providing project wise information of the
			<lb />
			stages of various building.
			<lb />
			Thereafter, on 27.3.2018, learned senior
			<lb />
			counsel appearing for Amrapali Group stated that they are ready to
			<lb />
			undertake the completion of the projects of Amrapali Group and we
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			10
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			requested the I.R.P. of Amrapali Group not to proceed any further, in view
			<lb />
			of the assurances given by the Amrapali Group to undertake works. This
			<lb />
			Court on 10.5.2018 has passed an order for installation of lifts in the
			<lb />
			Towers and also to make certain lifts functional. We also asked the
			<lb />
			promoters/ developers to submit the statement of the total price of the
			<lb />
			flats, the total amount paid to the builder by the flat buyers, the total
			<lb />
			amount spent by the builder on the construction and how the remaining
			<lb />
			part of the money paid by buyers has been utilised. It also transpired from
			<lb />
			documents that money had been transferred to certain other companies,
			<lb />
			thus, this Court has asked for the details of the composition of the
			<lb />
			transferee company including the names of the Director and for what
			<lb />
			purpose money was transferred and how it is to be retrieved and how
			<lb />
			projects are to be completed.
			<lb />
			11. On 17.5.2018, this Court passed the following order:
			<lb />
			&quot;1. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
			<lb />
			2. Pursuant to our request made to the learned counsel, they have
			<lb />
			sat together and a joint statement has been filed for containing the
			<lb />
			proposal for completion of the various projects. A joint meeting had
			<lb />
			been conducted between the lawyers representing the buyers and
			<lb />
			builder of Amrapali Group and the representatives of Greater Noida
			<lb />
			and Noida. The proposals are in the form of four baskets with
			<lb />
			independent timelines and the co-developers had been chosen to
			<lb />
			undertake the completion of the projects and remaining work at the
			<lb />
			site. The independent proposals given by Amrapali along with the
			<lb />
			proposed co-developer had been placed before the concerned
			<lb />
			lawyers representing the flat owners in those projects and lawyers of
			<lb />
			Noida and the representatives of Greater Noida and broad
			<lb />
			consensus has been reached.
			<lb />
			3. The following are the basket-wise proposals:

			mobilization and reflects the outer limit. Let undertaking of
			<lb />
			promoter and developer be filed within seven days with respect to all
			<lb />
			the projects.
			<lb />
			4. It is apparent from the admission made by the promoter that the
			<lb />
			money to the extent of Rs.2765 crores, out of the six projects in
			<lb />
			question, has been transmitted to other projects. Though we were
			<lb />
			inclined to direct the promoter to deposit the said amount in this
			<lb />
			Court, we are not doing this at this juncture, because of the
			<lb />
			singular reason that the various promoters of the projects have
			<lb />
			shown their willingness to complete these projects by engaging the
			<lb />
			services of the co-developer. It is made clear that co-developer is the
			<lb />
			agent of the promoter. No right or interest shall accrue to the co-
			<lb />
		</titlePage>

		<page>
			15
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			developer and liability towards the buyer shall remain with the
			<lb />
			promoter.
			<lb />
			5. At this stage, we deem it appropriate to direct that an escrow
			<lb />
			account has to be opened. The said account has to be opened in the
			<lb />
			UCO Bank, Supreme Court Branch, situated in the premises itself.
			<lb />
			At this juncture, we deem it appropriate to direct the promoters to
			<lb />
			deposit a sum of Rs.250/-crores (Rupees Two Hundred Fifty
			<lb />
			Crores) in the said escrow account, and money shall be deposited
			<lb />
			on or before 15th June 2018.
			<lb />
			6. A proposal has also been submitted on behalf of the promoters of
			<lb />
			the aforesaid projects to sell some of the unencumbered property,
			<lb />
			details of which have been given at page 28 of the affidavit dated
			<lb />
			16.5.2018. Out of the aforesaid proposal, we find that the properties
			<lb />
			mentioned at serial numbers 11 and 15 are of high value. The
			<lb />
			unlaunched part of M/s. Amrapali Leisure Valley Pvt. Ltd., land of
			<lb />
			project is in Greater Noida, is held on the basis of the leasehold
			<lb />
			interest from the Greater Noida Industrial Authority, the realizable
			<lb />
			value is shown to be is Rs.917.29 crores (Rupees Nine Hundred
			<lb />
			Seventeen Crores Twenty Nine Lakhs). There is no bank loan but
			<lb />
			however, there appear to be some dues to the Greater Noida
			<lb />
			Authority on this particular property. The distress sale value is
			<lb />
			shown at Rs.491 crores (Rupees Four Hundred Ninety-One Crores).
			<lb />
			The property mentioned at serial number 15 is a part of the
			<lb />
			unlaunched property of Amrapali Centurion Park (Commercial) held
			<lb />
			on a leasehold basis from the Greater Noida Industrial Authority
			<lb />
			and its distress value is Rs.246 crores (Rupees Two Hundred Forty-
			<lb />
			Six Crores).
			<lb />
			7. There are some other commercial properties, which are in the
			<lb />
			form of hotels and other commercial properties comprising of malls,
			<lb />
			etc. and those can also be sold for completion of projects. As and
			<lb />
			when a concrete proposal is submitted before us for sale, the same
			<lb />
			shall be considered and appropriate orders would be passed in this
			<lb />
			regard. However, the amount of Rs.250 crores (Rupees Two
			<lb />
			Hundred Fifty Crores) has to be deposited by 15th of June, 2018
			<lb />
			without fail, in the escrow account to be opened with the UCO Bank
			<lb />
			of this Court.
			<lb />
			8. There are certain outstanding dues of the buyers. It would be
			<lb />
			open to the buyers to deposit the said amount in the said escrow
			<lb />
			account. However, as soon as the projects are completed, we
			<lb />
			propose to give them reasonable time to deposit the outstanding
			<lb />
			dues. As soon as the promoter and co-developer are in a position to
			<lb />
			hand over the possession, the buyers shall have to deposit the
			<lb />
			outstanding amount in the escrow account to be opened in the UCO
			<lb />
			Bank, within three months time from the date of issuance of offer of
			<lb />
			possession.
			<lb />
			9. We also propose to form a Committee to submit periodical reports
			<lb />
			of the progress of the construction, to this Court, consisting of the
			<lb />
			following members:
			<lb />
			i. Architect of the developer;
			<lb />
			ii. Structural Engineer of the developer;
			<lb />
			iii. Chartered Accountant appointed by the developer; as well

			iv. Architect of buyers
			<lb />
			v. Structural Engineer of buyers
			<lb />
			vi. Chartered Accountant appointed by the buyers and apart
			<lb />
			from the above members, we appoint Mr. M.L. Lahoty, learned
			<lb />
			Advocate, as a member of the said Committee, so as to
			<lb />
			coordinate the effective functioning and to submit an
			<lb />
			appropriate periodical report in this Court. We appoint one
			<lb />
			nominee each of Greater Noida and Noida Authority, to be the
			<lb />
			member of said Committee.
			<lb />
			10. There are certain unsold units in the various projects that have
			<lb />
			to be firstly adjusted by making swapping as agreed to, after that
			<lb />
			the remaining available units may also be permitted to be sold. In
			<lb />
			this regard, a proposal would be submitted as and when swapping
			<lb />
			process is completed and the details of property to be sold and
			<lb />
			amount of offer by the prospective buyers, be indicated by this
			<lb />
			Court. The proposal will be submitted for consideration so that
			<lb />
			appropriate orders may be passed by this Court. Let the Committee
			<lb />
			constituted by us also to supervise the swapping part.
			<lb />
			11. Eight weeks&apos; time is granted to the buyers for the purpose of
			<lb />
			applying for swapping and decision shall be taken within 15 days
			<lb />
			from the date of application for the purpose of swapping is filed
			<lb />
			before the promoters. In case there is any difficulty in swapping, the
			<lb />
			Committee is authorized to take care of the grievances and to guide
			<lb />
			the promoters as well as the buyers.
			<lb />
			12. As there are certain dues of Noida and Greater Noida
			<lb />
			Authorities
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			that
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			secured
			<lb />
			creditors
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			operational/unsecured creditors, let the proposal be submitted by
			<lb />
			the promoters in this regard, on or before 07.07.2018. We also place
			<lb />
			on record that approximately a sum of Rs.4,300-4,900/-crores will
			<lb />
			be required for completion of the various projects as pointed out by
			<lb />
			promoters.
			<lb />
			13. There are certain &apos;C&apos; category projects. With respect to those
			<lb />
			projects also, as they are not taken care of during swapping or there
			<lb />
			may be certain buyers not willing for swapping or certain amount
			<lb />
			may be required to be refunded to the buyers, who are not
			<lb />
			intending to purchase now and not opting for swapping or/and is
			<lb />
			not feasible, to take up those projects. The promoter shall also file

			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
			make the payment of dues onwards.
			<lb />
			15. The joint statement that has been filed has been signed in the
			<lb />

		<body>
			Court by the learned counsel for the promoters as well as by
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the authorities and the flat buyers, is placed on
			<lb />
			record and made part of this order as &quot;Annexure-A&quot;.
			<lb />
			16. The aforesaid Committee constituted by us is also requested to
			<lb />

			<lb />
			far and submit a report in the 1 st week of July 2018.
			<lb />

			authorities within seven days from today, under intimation to this
			<lb />
			Court.
			<lb />
			18. The matter has been heard in part and requires a further
			<lb />
			hearing. List on 18.7.2018 at 2.00 p.m.
			<lb />
			19. It is agreed to, that with respect to essential amenities, the order
			<lb />
			passed by this Court on 10.5.2018 shall also apply to Silicon City
			<lb />
			Phase I project and in case inhabitants are there in some towers,
			<lb />
			the same shall apply to Silicon City Phase-II project also.&quot;
			<lb />
			The aforesaid order was passed on the basis of the joint proposal,
			<lb />
			which was in the form of four baskets with independent timelines,
			<lb />
			submitted in this Court.
			<lb />
			12. It was also mentioned in paragraph 4 of the above order that
			<lb />
			admission has been made by the promoters/builders that the money to the
			<lb />
			extent of Rs.2,765 crores, out of six projects has been transferred to other
			<lb />
			projects. Though we were inclined to direct the promoter to deposit the
			<lb />
			said amount in this Court, we refrained from directing as the willingness to
			<lb />
			complete the projects was shown by engaging services of co-developers and
			<lb />
			builder assured that it would undertake the work. It was proposed to sell
			<lb />
			certain unencumbered properties of Amrapali Group for payment of these
			<lb />
			projects, however, this Court directed to deposit an amount of Rs.250
			<lb />
			crores in the escrow account to be opened in the UCO Bank, Supreme
			<lb />
			Court Branch on or before 15.6.2018. This order was again not complied
			<lb />
			with and the work was not undertaken and inability was shown to deposit
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the amount in the escrow account as ordered. When the case was listed on
			<lb />
			18.7.2018 in this Court, learned counsel appearing on behalf of promoters
			<lb />
			was to place progress report, but in order to wriggle out of the compliance
			<lb />
			of order, totally a different stand was taken in this Court and it was stated
			<lb />
			that a notice dated 13.7.2018 has been issued by the Ministry of Housing
			<lb />
			and Urban Affairs, which was placed on record, indicating that a High-
			<lb />
			Level Committee has been created by the Government of U.P. to redress the
			<lb />
			issues of home buyers and the affected parties of incomplete/stalled house
			<lb />
			projects in the Noida/ Greater Noida/Yamuna Expressway under the
			<lb />
			Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. It was
			<lb />
			submitted on behalf of Amrapali Group that a meeting was held today and
			<lb />
			prayed that something concrete is likely to happen within ten days. We
			<lb />
			deferred the hearing up to 1.8.2018. However, at the same time, we
			<lb />
			directed the builder to file the accounts with effect from 1.4.2008 till date
			<lb />
			under the certificate of Chartered Accountant and also a list of all assets in
			<lb />
			a sealed cover in this Court. As a matter of fact, there was no compliance
			<lb />
			of the order dated 17.5.2018 of this Court, but the totally indifferent stand
			<lb />
			was taken so as to wriggle out of their obligation under said order was
			<lb />
			passed by this Court on the basis of the joint statement.
			<lb />
			13. This Court has passed an order on 1.8.2018, wherein it was observed
			<lb />
			that in order to scuttle the hearing in this Court, it was stated that the
			<lb />
			meeting was held on the very same day. The order passed by this Court on
			<lb />
			17.5.2018 to deposit Rs.250 crores had not been complied with. There was
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			19
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			also an admission made by Amrapali Group that there was a diversion of
			<lb />
			more than Rs.2,765 crores from six projects. This Court observed that
			<lb />
			money could not have been diverted. That would prima facie tantamount
			<lb />
			to a criminal breach of trust. We directed that the individual bank
			<lb />
			accounts of the Directors of all the 40 companies be frozen and ordered
			<lb />
			attachment of the properties in the individual names of Directors and also
			<lb />
			put a restriction on the alienation of the properties in the names of
			<lb />
			individual Directors etc. Following order was passed by this Court:
			<lb />
			&quot;1. On 17.5.2018, we have passed a detailed order in these cases
			<lb />
			after hearing learned counsel for the parties for several days. We
			<lb />
			need not reiterate the directions, statements, representations made
			<lb />
			to this Court and the orders which we have passed. Order dated
			<lb />
			17.5.2018 is clear in this regard. As per the order passed by this
			<lb />
			Court, certain obligations were imposed and certain directions were
			<lb />
			issued which were to be complied with by the group of companies
			<lb />
			as well as the co-promoters, etc., as mentioned in the aforesaid
			<lb />
			order. The compliance has not been reported an effort was made to
			<lb />
			wriggle out of order passed on 17.5.2018.
			<lb />
			2. When the matter was taken up on 18.7.2018, compliance of the
			<lb />
			order was not reported and on the other hand, a letter dated
			<lb />
			13.7.2018 signed by Mr. Akhil Saxena, Deputy Secretary to the
			<lb />
			Government of India, was placed on record. The letter is extracted

			3. In order to scuttle the hearing in this Court on 18.7.2018 on
			<lb />
			which the case was listed, it was reported to us that meeting was
			<lb />
			held on that very day which was presided over by the Secretary,
			<lb />
			Ministry of Housing, who is the Chairperson of the Committee and
			<lb />
			Secretary MoUHUA. Thereafter, pursuant to the said meeting it was
			<lb />
			stated today that NBCC India Limited, a Government of India
			<lb />
			enterprise, has invited &quot;Expression of Interest&quot; for joint development
			<lb />
			in real estate with respect to the development of residential and

			commercial real estate projects in Delhi and NCR region, inclusive
			<lb />
			of the Amrapali Group for which we have already passed orders on
			<lb />
			17.5.2018.
			<lb />
			4. In case the Committee constituted by the Government of Uttar
			<lb />
			Pradesh wanted to take up the matter of Amrapali Group in view of
			<lb />
			the order dated 17.5.2018, it was necessary for them to seek the
			<lb />
			express permission from this Court, as this Court was in seisin of
			<lb />
			the matters, before transacting any business in this regard. But
			<lb />
			that has not been done and when the order of this Court stands, it
			<lb />
			was not at all appropriate or permissible to take up the matter by
			<lb />
			the Committee and intermeddle with the order passed by this Court
			<lb />
			when the matter is pending in this Court. The action has a clear
			<lb />
			effect on rendering order passed by this Court ineffective. In the
			<lb />
			circumstances, we deem it appropriate to direct the presence of the
			<lb />
			Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and the
			<lb />
			Chairman of the NBCC India Limited and to file their affidavit in
			<lb />
			this Court and produce entire record so as to show how they have
			<lb />
			convened the meeting and acted in the manner in the matter
			<lb />
			pending in this Court, without permission of this Court before
			<lb />
			dealing with the matter of Amrapali Group. Let them be present
			<lb />
			before this Court tomorrow, i.e., on 2.8.2018, at 2.00 p.m. to
			<lb />
			explain their stand.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			(CMD) of Amrapali Group of Companies were personally present in
			<lb />

			6. The order passed by this Court of depositing 250 crores of rupees
			<lb />
			has not complied. There is an admission already made by Amrapali
			<lb />
			Group that there was a diversion of more than 2765 crores of
			<lb />
			rupees from six projects to other projects. In the circumstances, we
			<lb />
			direct the Bank accounts of all the aforesaid 40 companies be
			<lb />
			frozen forthwith. We forthwith attach the entire immovable
			<lb />
			properties of these 40 group of companies. They shall not be
			<lb />
			entitled to deal with the same in any manner whatsoever without
			<lb />
			the express permission of this Court.
			<lb />
			7. There was a diversion of the funds, prima facie it is apparent that
			<lb />
			when the money was paid by the buyers for the purpose of
			<lb />
			investment in the particular project, it could not have been diverted.
			<lb />
			That would prima facie tantamount to a criminal breach of trust.
			<lb />
			We are not expressing any final opinion in this regard at this
			<lb />
			moment. However, at the same time, we propose to take a call on
			<lb />
			this after hearing the parties on this aspect. However, so as to
			<lb />
			further ascertain the extent of internal and external diversion from
			<lb />
			all the projects. The names of all the Chartered Accountants of all
			<lb />
			the aforesaid 40 companies be disclosed to us and their reports
			<lb />
			from 2008 till today be placed on record by tomorrow.
			<lb />
			8. The individual Bank accounts of the Directors of all the 40
			<lb />
			companies are also freezed and they shall not be entitled to operate
			<lb />
			the same with immediate effect. Let details of all Bank accounts be
			<lb />
			furnished by tomorrow of companies and their Directors and of
			<lb />
			personal accounts of Directors. The properties in the individual
			<lb />
			names of the Directors are also attached and the same shall not be

			<lb />
			Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma, Mr. Shiv Priya and Mr. Ajay Kumar of

			Amrapali group of companies to remain personally present in this
			<lb />
			Court tomorrow, along with the aforesaid officials.&quot;
			<lb />
			14. It was stated by Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs that
			<lb />
			he was not aware of the order passed by this Court on 17.5.2018,
			<lb />

			<lb />

		<body>
			appointing promoters and time frame and stated that he never intended to
			<lb />
			violate the order passed by this Court. On 2.8.2018, we have recalled the
			<lb />
			order dated 17.5.2018, considering the dubious and unfair conduct of the
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group of Companies and on each and every day they have been
			<lb />
			shifting their stand. Earlier, they have filed affidavits making certain
			<lb />
			representations
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			now
			<lb />
			want
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			wriggle
			<lb />
			out
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			it.
			<lb />
			Following order was passed on 2.8.2018, recalling the order dated
			<lb />
			17.5.2018:
			<lb />
			&quot;1. Pursuant to the order passed yesterday, i.e., on 1.8.2018, Mr.
			<lb />
			Durga Shankar Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban
			<lb />
			Affairs, has stated that a Committee has been constituted by the
			<lb />
			Government of Uttar Pradesh under his chairmanship to look into
			<lb />
			the problems of three lakhs home buyers of Noida, Greater Noida,
			<lb />
			and Yamuna Expressway. The Committee has been constituted so
			<lb />
			as to take a policy decision so as to solve the problems of the home
			<lb />
			buyers. On 25.6.2018, the first meeting of the then Chief Executive
			<lb />
			Officers (CEOs) of the Noida and Greater Noida, real estate
			<lb />
			representatives, etc. was held and thereafter, second meeting was
			<lb />
			held on 10.7.2018, which was attended by 32 persons, inter alia
			<lb />
			including certain representatives of the Flat Owners Welfare
			<lb />
			Association, Joint General Manager, ICICI Bank, AGM of the Bank
			<lb />
			of Baroda, General Manager of HDFC Bank and Chairman of
			<lb />
			CREDAI had also attended the meeting. Thereafter, no meeting of
			<lb />
			the Committee has been held. However, a discussion with the
			<lb />
			Chairman of representatives of the four builders, i.e., Amrapali
			<lb />
			Group, Jaypee Infratech Ltd., Three C Group and Unitech Limited
			<lb />
			was held on 18.7.2018, along with details of the housing projects
			<lb />
			promoted by their companies and with the specific plans as to how
			<lb />
			earliest they could deliver the flats/houses to the home buyers who
			<lb />
			have made payments towards their companies. It was also stated by
			<lb />
			the Secretary that he was not aware that this Court has passed an
			<lb />
			order on 17.5.2018 appointing promoters etc. and the time frame
			<lb />
			within which the projects have to be completed. He has also stated
			<lb />
			that he never intended to violate the orders passed by this Court.
			<lb />
			The statement made by Mr. Mishra is placed on record.
			<lb />
			2. It was also submitted that NBCC issued advertisement on
			<lb />
			30.7.2018 and the Chairman of the NBCC has informed us that the
			<lb />
			said advertisement was not issued specifically for Amrapali Group
			<lb />
			of companies. Similar advertisements have been issued earlier too.
			<lb />
			However, it was stated by the Chairman that they are ready to
			<lb />
			undertake the Amrapali Group projects and to complete them, after
			<lb />
			making the detailed study of the stage and investment which is
			<lb />
			required to be made in the projects that are incomplete.
			<lb />

			<lb />

		<body>
			3. Pursuant to the directions issued by the Court, Amrapali Group
			<lb />
			has placed on record the account numbers and other details of 38
			<lb />
			of Amrapali Group of companies only, but not that of the personal
			<lb />
			accounts and the accounts in names of its Directors, as per the
			<lb />
			order passed by this Court on 1.8.2018. They have furnished the
			<lb />
			details of 38 companies out of 40. They are contained in Annexures
			<lb />
			marked as X-1 and X-2.
			<lb />
			4. We direct the Registry to apprise the concerned Banks along with
			<lb />
			the text of the order and the account numbers so furnished. Let the
			<lb />
			copy of the order be sent to the Banks for its due compliance.
			<lb />
			5. It was stated that the personal Bank accounts in the names of
			<lb />
			the Directors of aforesaid 40 companies are in the process of
			<lb />
			compilation and that the account numbers shall be furnished to
			<lb />
			this Court by Monday, i.e., 6th August 2018. On the account
			<lb />
			number being furnished, the Registry is directed to intimate the
			<lb />
			order to the said Banks also regarding the order passed by this
			<lb />
			Court on 1.8.2018.
			<lb />
			6. Two applications, i.e., I.A.Nos.82917/2018 and 92775/2018 in
			<lb />
			W.P.(C)No.942/2017 have been filed by the Amrapali Silicon City
			<lb />
			Flat Owners Welfare Society and Heartbeat City for modification of
			<lb />
			order dated 17.5.2018. It was also pointed out that one of co-
			<lb />
			developer, IIFL, has backed out, thus, it was not possible to comply
			<lb />
			with the order dated 17.5.2018 and same requires modification. The
			<lb />
			sum of Rs.250 crores has also not been deposited. An application
			<lb />
			has been filed so as to waive that requirement also. When we see
			<lb />
			the conduct of the promoter on the various stages, it is apparent
			<lb />
			that on 18.7.2018 on behalf of the promoter it was stated before us
			<lb />
			that the Committee has been constituted by the Government of
			<lb />
			Uttar Pradesh under the Chairmanship of the Secretary, Ministry of
			<lb />
			Housing &amp; Urban Affairs, as such we should wait for the outcome of
			<lb />
			same. Yesterday, i.e., on 1.8.2018 it was stated before us that
			<lb />
			NBCC is now considering to take over the entire project of Amrapali
			<lb />
			Group as it has issued an advertisement for the purpose and as
			<lb />
			such the Court should stay in our hands. In the circumstances, it is
			<lb />
			apparent that the Amrapali Group does not intend to abide by order
			<lb />
			dated 17.5.2018 and its conduct is dubious. Thus, we have no
			<lb />
			hesitation in recalling the order dated 17.5.2018 permitting
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group to complete the projects. We hereby recall the order
			<lb />
			entrusting the project to the Amrapali Group of companies for
			<lb />
			completion, along with co-promoters, and we place it on record that
			<lb />
			the conduct of Amrapali Group of companies is wholly unfair and
			<lb />
			on each and every date they have been shifting their stand before us
			<lb />
			and it was absolutely improper on their part to do so. They have
			<lb />
			violated our order also. They have earlier filed affidavits making
			<lb />
			certain representations and now want to wriggle out of that. Be that
			<lb />
			as it may. We recall the order dated 17.5.2018 under the aforesaid
			<lb />
			circumstances.
			<lb />
			7. In the circumstances, as the Chairman of the NBCC is present
			<lb />
			before us and has shown willingness to undertake the projects, the
			<lb />
			matter cannot be left at that. Let the NBCC complete the projects,
			<lb />
			let it undertake the study and work out the details. Though the time
			<lb />
			of 45 days was prayed, considering the urgency of the matter, we
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			25
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			grant 30 days&apos; time, as the people are deprived of basic necessities
			<lb />
			of life, and they are residing in some incomplete buildings. We
			<lb />
			appreciate the gesture of the Chairman of NBCC, who has assured
			<lb />
			us to complete the projects as may be directed and to submit a
			<lb />
			proposal in this Court within 30 days. Let a proposal be submitted
			<lb />
			in 30 days before us.
			<lb />
			8. In the circumstances, we direct the promoters and also request
			<lb />
			Mr. M.L. Lahoty and two other representatives to be nominated by
			<lb />
			home buyers to assist and submit the details and all requisite
			<lb />
			documents to the Chairman, NBCC as also to the Chairman of the
			<lb />
			Committee. Noida authority and Greater Noida authority shall also
			<lb />
			furnish to them all the documents which are in their possession.
			<lb />
			Let promoter, Noida authority, Greater Noida authority and buyers
			<lb />
			furnish all the documents/pleadings they have submitted to this
			<lb />
			Court, within three days from today.
			<lb />
			9. We also place on record the appreciation to the offer made by the
			<lb />
			Chairman, NBCC, and also by Mr. Mishra, Chairman of the
			<lb />
			Committee. Let them make an endeavour to form policy and to solve
			<lb />
			problems of other groups of companies also. However, the matters
			<lb />
			are pending in the Court, they have to appraise this Court of their
			<lb />
			proposals and only thereafter to take steps in this regard.
			<lb />
			10. Mr. Anil Mittal, the Chartered Accountant of Anil Ajay &amp;
			<lb />
			Company, who is the statutory auditor for most of the companies, is
			<lb />
			present in the Court. Similarly, Mr. Ravi Kapoor, the Chartered
			<lb />
			Accountant of Serva Associates is also present in the Court. It is
			<lb />
			pointed out that the information furnished by them is contained on
			<lb />
			page 6 and 7 of the compilation Annexure X-1. It is stated by Mr.
			<lb />
			Anil Mittal that his engagement as statutory auditor has begun in
			<lb />
			the year 2008 and continued up to 2015. He was the auditor from
			<lb />
			2008 and has also stated before us that after 2015 no papers have
			<lb />
			been given to him. It was stated by Mr. Gaurav Bhatia, learned
			<lb />
			counsel, that at present S.N. Dhawan &amp; Company is doing the audit
			<lb />
			of the Company.
			<lb />
			11. Since we find that various documents have been placed on
			<lb />
			record indicating transfer/diversion of the fund by the Amrapali
			<lb />
			Group itself, the Amrapali Group has admitted that out of the six
			<lb />
			projects, there was transfer/diversion of Rs.2765 crores. Though it
			<lb />
			was submitted that the amount was transferred to other projects, in
			<lb />
			our opinion, this was clearly diversion of funds. The amount given
			<lb />
			by the home buyers for the completion of their projects/houses
			<lb />
			could not have been diverted before the completion of the projects.
			<lb />
			We request the auditors to find out how much money has been so
			<lb />
			transmitted/diverted to other projects and how it has been used.
			<lb />
			Let projectwise information of all projects be furnished. The
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group of Companies shall furnish the requisite
			<lb />
			information and documents and shall cooperate with the statutory
			<lb />
			auditors. Let the auditor certify how much money has been diverted
			<lb />
			from which project and how it has been used in other projects,
			<lb />
			including the projects of Heartbeat city. The internal auditor is
			<lb />
			requested to assist Mr. Anil Mittal in this regard.
			<lb />
		</body>

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			12. It was stated before us that the bank accounts of Amrapali
			<lb />
			Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. have also been frozen and it is necessary to run
			<lb />
			the hospital to keep the accounts operational. Considering the fact
			<lb />
			that the hospital requires money on a day-to-day basis, we order
			<lb />
			de-freezing of account of Amrapali Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. only.
			<lb />
			However, at the same time, we direct that let the details of the bank
			<lb />
			account(s) of it be placed before us right from 2008 till date. Interim
			<lb />
			order dated 1.8.2018 to continue unless otherwise ordered.
			<lb />
			13. For the purpose of assessing the proposal to be submitted by
			<lb />
			the NBCC and to pass requisite orders in this regard, we fix the
			<lb />
			hearing on 4.9.2018 at 2.00 p.m. Let the aforesaid reports be
			<lb />
			submitted by Mr. Anil Mittal and Mr. Ravi Kapoor, Chartered
			<lb />
			Accounts before 4.9.2018.
			<lb />
			For further order of other IAs. and arrangement of funds to be
			<lb />
			provided to NBCC and regarding furnishing of accounts, let matters
			<lb />
			be listed on 8.8.2018 at 2.00 p.m. Personal presence of Secretary,
			<lb />
			Housing and Urban Affairs and Chairman, NBCC, is dispensed
			<lb />
			with.&quot;
			<lb />
			15. There are various order sheets indicating how the wrong and
			<lb />
			incomplete information had been submitted on behalf of Directors of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group of Companies.
			<lb />
			16. The National Building Construction Corporation Ltd. had been
			<lb />
			appointed by this Court to complete the construction vide order dated
			<lb />
			12.9.2018.
			<lb />
			17. Vide order dated 8.8.2018, this Court had directed the Directors of
			<lb />
			various companies including the Managing Directors to file affidavits
			<lb />
			regarding immovable properties and moveable properties and their
			<lb />
			valuation. We had earlier asked the statutory auditors of Amrapali group of
			<lb />
			companies to conduct the audit. However, it was pointed out on 4.9.2018
			<lb />
			that there was the necessity of appointing independent auditors so as to
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			27
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			conduct a forensic audit. On 6.9.2018 this Court directed the forensic
			<lb />
			audit. Following order was passed on 4.9.2018 :
			<lb />
			&quot;We have heard learned counsel for the parties. A proposal has been
			<lb />
			submitted by the NBCC in the booklet form. Let it be placed on record
			<lb />
			along with an affidavit of a responsible officer of the NBCC. Let a copy of
			<lb />
			the same be circulated to the learned counsel appearing for the parties.
			<lb />
			Let Amrapali Group of Companies file a response to the NBCC&apos;s proposal
			<lb />
			for completion of the project.
			<lb />
			We have heard Sh. Gaurav Bhatia about the property which can be sold.
			<lb />
			He has attracted our attention to the affidavit of Shri Anil Kumar Sharma
			<lb />
			in terms of the Court&apos;s order 10.5.2018 filed with respect to I.A. No. 7366
			<lb />
			of 2018 in W.P. No. 942 of 2017.
			<lb />
			He has submitted that Saleable Area Commercial is described at page 20
			<lb />
			of the affidavit. The value is given as per the development model, not the
			<lb />
			Distress Sale Value. Let Distress Sale Value be also stated on affidavit
			<lb />
			and with respect to the fact that what are the encumbrances and also the
			<lb />
			dues of Noida/Greater Noida Authorities as against the property as
			<lb />
			mentioned at page 20 of the affidavit.
			<lb />
			He has also attracted our attention to the list of encumbered property on
			<lb />
			page 27 of the affidavit and list of unencumbered property on page 28.
			<lb />
			Let affidavit be filed specifically stating with respect to the nature and
			<lb />
			extent of encumbrances with respect to encumbered property and how
			<lb />
			much is the amount due and what are the documents executed.
			<lb />
			With respect to list of the unencumbered property also mentioned at page
			<lb />
			28 there are certain dues of Noida/Greater Noida Authority that may be
			<lb />
			clearly specified and let affidavit also specifically state that these
			<lb />
			properties are otherwise unencumbered properties. Affidavit in detail be
			<lb />
			filed in this regard too.
			<lb />
			With respect to the audit, the accounts for three years have not been
			<lb />
			made available to statutory Auditor as pointed out by Mr. Anil Mittal of
			<lb />
			Anil Ajay &amp; Co., appointed by this Court.
			<lb />
			Mr. Maninder Singh learned senior counsel has urged that there is the
			<lb />
			necessity of appointing independent auditors so as to conduct a forensic
			<lb />
			audit. He has prayed for time to suggest the names in this regard. It was
			<lb />
			also pointed out by the learned counsel appearing for the Bank of Baroda
			<lb />
			that certain audit exercise has been undertaken on behalf of the Bank of
			<lb />
			Baroda with respect to the transaction entered into with Bank of Baroda
			<lb />
			which was the subject matter of other proceedings. Let the names of
			<lb />
			Auditor be suggested so as to conduct a deep and pervasive forensic audit
			<lb />
			of the Amrapali Group of Companies.
			<lb />
			Suggestions be made on the next date of hearing.
			<lb />
			Mr. Shyam Diwan and Mr. Siddharth Luthra learned senior counsel have
			<lb />
			pressed I.A. Nos. 124711-124712 of 2018 and I.A. No. 36562 of 2018.
			<lb />
			These I.As are to be considered after forensic Audit is concluded and a

			<lb />
			18. This Court appointed Mr. Ravi Bhatia of M/s. Bhatia &amp; Co. and Mr.
			<lb />
			Pawan Kumar Aggarwal of M/s. Sharp &amp; Tannan Company to conduct the
			<lb />
			forensic audit, which was ordered to be conducted with effect from the year
			<lb />
			2008 till date, to be completed within two months. On 12.9.2018, a list of
			<lb />
			properties was submitted which was to be sold by the Debt Recovery
			<lb />
			Tribunal, Delhi, (DRT) and the details of properties, title deeds and maps
			<lb />
			were to be submitted to the DRT. This Court directed statutory Auditor, Mr.
			<lb />
			Anil Mittal, to hand over the original records of Amrapali group of
			<lb />
			companies vide order dated 12.9.2018. This Court also directed remaining
			<lb />

			<lb />
			of companies were also directed to hand over the documents required by
			<lb />
			the forensic auditors. The matter was taken up by this Court on 26.9.2018.
			<lb />
			Considering the non-cooperation of the Directors, the following order was
			<lb />
			passed by this Court on 26.9.2018 :
			<lb />
			&quot;Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
			<lb />
			It was pointed out by Mr. M.L.Lahoty, learned senior counsel that there
			<lb />
			are certain existing Directors, namely, Mr. Anurag Sanghai, Mr.Vinay
			<lb />
			Vishal and Mr.Sankalp Shukla, particulars of their properties, etc. have
			<lb />
			not been filed as ordered by this Court and there are several other
			<lb />
			existing or former directors whose names have not been disclosed. Let the
			<lb />
			names of all the directors be disclosed without remiss before the next
			<lb />
			date fixed along with details of asset etc. as already ordered by this Court.
			<lb />
			It was also pointed out by Mr. Lahoty in I.A. No.116688/2018 that &apos;O&apos; 2
			<lb />
			valley particulars have not been disclosed by the group of companies. Let
			<lb />
			reply to the said I.A be filed by the Amrapali Group of companies and
			<lb />
			details of &apos;O&apos; 2 Valley be also disclosed.
			<lb />
			It was also pointed out that DRT has initiated the proceedings and has
			<lb />
			directed the production of the original documents, sanctioned plans and
			<lb />
			other relevant documents available with Amrapali Group of Companies. It
			<lb />

		<body>
			was also submitted that valuation has also been ordered. We direct the
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group of companies and the Directors viz. Mr. Anil Kumar
			<lb />
			Sharma, Ms. Shiv Priya, and Mr.Ajay Kumar to submit Maps clearly
			<lb />
			delineating an unencumbered portion of their properties and other details
			<lb />

			<lb />
			by the DRT. Let the order of DRT be complied with by the Amrapali Group
			<lb />
			of the company before 4.10.2018.
			<lb />
			With respect to the handing over the documents by the Statutory
			<lb />
			Auditors as well as by the Amrapali Group of companies, we note it
			<lb />
			regrettably that order passed by this Court has been violated and the
			<lb />
			documents have not been handed over in spite of clear and categorical
			<lb />
			direction to hand over the documents to forensic auditors within ten
			<lb />
			days. However, it was pointed out by Mr. Gaurav Bhatia, learned counsel
			<lb />
			that statutory auditors are going to hand over the document, etc. w.e.f.
			<lb />
			2008 to 2015 by tomorrow to the forensic auditors. Let all the necessary
			<lb />
			documents which may be in possession of Amrapali Group of companies
			<lb />
			in addition to statutory auditors be also handed over from 2008-2015 and
			<lb />
			also all the papers of Amrapali Group of companies 2015-2018 by
			<lb />
			tomorrow. We make it clear that the documents with respect to 2015-
			<lb />
			2018 shall be handed over by the Amrapali Group companies along with
			<lb />
			all the original documents necessary to do audit shall be handed over to
			<lb />
			the forensic auditors by tomorrow. Let account books in whatever status
			<lb />
			they are, at present, be also handed over.
			<lb />
			We request the forensic auditors to send their representative on the next
			<lb />
			date of hearing to apprise us of compliance of this order.
			<lb />
			Before IRB certain proceedings are pending for recovery of dues and inter
			<lb />
			alia, there are dues of Bank of Maharashtra, etc also as pointed out
			<lb />
			including that of Bank of Baroda.
			<lb />
			Let the details of all the outstanding dues of secured and unsecured
			<lb />
			creditors project-wise and in total be submitted in this Court in a tabular
			<lb />
			form. Let total outstanding dues be stated, including that of Noida and
			<lb />
			Greater Noida authorities supported by affidavit.
			<lb />
			Mr. Anoop Kumar Mittal, Chairman of the NBCC and Ms. Pinky Anand,
			<lb />
			ASG are present. It was pointed out on behalf of the NBCC that detailed
			<lb />
			project report has to be prepared of Group A Project within 30 days and
			<lb />
			Group B and C Projects within 60 days. It was also pointed out that
			<lb />
			tenders may be permitted to be floated by NBCC Group A and B projects.
			<lb />
			The NBCC is permitted to float the tenders and also to go ahead with the
			<lb />
			preparation of the DPRs and also to submit detailed proposals, terms,
			<lb />
			and conditions in this Court as prayed by them. Existing architects of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group of Companies to ensure cooperation with the NBCC.
			<lb />
			Non-cooperation shall be viewed seriously by this Court.
			<lb />
			Let DRT go ahead with the process of finding out the encumbrances. We
			<lb />

			<lb />

			<lb />
			List on 9.10.2018.&quot;
			<lb />
			19. On 9.10.2018 when despite the orders dated 12.9.2018 and
			<lb />
			26.9.2018, orders were not complied with, records were not handed over
			<lb />
			and there was utter violation of orders passed by this Court, we directed
			<lb />
			the Police to seize all the documents and to hand them over to the Forensic
			<lb />
			Auditors from the possession of 46 companies and their Directors. We
			<lb />
			directed all the Directors to surrender their passports and hand them over
			<lb />
			to the Police. The observations made by this Court were being misused by
			<lb />
			Amrapali group of companies, &quot;No coercive action will be taken by any
			<lb />
			authority with respect to the building where completion is going on under
			<lb />
			the order passed by this Court&quot;. As observed on 27.3.2018, we clarified
			<lb />
			that the observations did not deal with any police investigation in any
			<lb />
			criminal case or in FIR which may have been registered with the Delhi
			<lb />
			Police, EOW, to make investigation in any case which is required to be
			<lb />
			made. Police was free to make an investigation. On 10.10.2018 this Court
			<lb />
			directed the concerned police officers to seal all the seven premises situated
			<lb />
			at Noida and Greater Noida. On 11.10.2018 certain directions were issued
			<lb />
			so as to facilitate the forensic audit. After audit work was over for the day,
			<lb />
			on a prayer made by learned counsel on behalf of the three Directors of
			<lb />
			Amrapali group of companies, they were permitted to stay overnight in
			<lb />
			Hotel Park Ascent but they shall not be allowed any access to the mobile
			<lb />
			phone or the facility of telecommunication without permission in writing of
			<lb />
		</body>

			<lb />

		<body>
			the police. This Court also directed issuance of a formal notice on the suo
			<lb />
			moto contempt.
			<lb />
			20. On 24.10.2018 the forensic auditors were present. They have
			<lb />
			disclosed as to diversion of funds of more than Rs.100 crores to a firm
			<lb />
			known as GauriSuta Infrastructures Pvt. Ltd. in which Ashish Jain and
			<lb />
			Vivek Mittal were the Directors. They are stated to be the relatives of the
			<lb />
			Statutory Auditors. We directed the personal presence of Chander Wadhwa,
			<lb />
			CFO of Amrapali group of companies on the next date. On 26.10.2018 the
			<lb />
			Forensic Auditors submitted an interim report. It was pointed out that the
			<lb />
			tally data of 23 companies, reserves and surplus figures as appearing in
			<lb />
			the tally data does not reconcile with the reserves and surplus as
			<lb />
			appearing in the last signed financials. The difference has also been
			<lb />
			pointed out in a tabular form. There were several advances, investments,
			<lb />
			utilisations, advances made to suppliers and payments made to Mr. Anil
			<lb />
			Sharma and Mr. Shiv Priya, Directors of the company for professional
			<lb />
			charges, etc. It was also pointed out that in spite of repeated reminders,
			<lb />
			groupings have not been supplied. Grouping is a process to indicate the
			<lb />
			process between the stage of trial balance, balance sheet, and profit and
			<lb />
			loss account. All files had not been handed over and Mr. Anil Mittal, the
			<lb />
			Statutory Auditor had sent one file late in the evening. This Court ordered
			<lb />
			that in case documents were not handed over, the same shall be viewed
			<lb />
			seriously and the incumbents punished suitably. The last opportunity was
			<lb />
			granted to hand over the requisite documents to the Forensic Auditors. We
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			32
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			directed Statutory Auditors to comply with the requisition made by the
			<lb />
			Forensic Auditors. It was also noted by this Court that a sum of Rs.242.38
			<lb />
			crores had been handed over to Gaurisuta Infrastructure Private Ltd.,
			<lb />
			Vidhyashree Buildcon Private Ltd., Mannat Buildcraft Private Ltd. This
			<lb />
			Court observed in para 5 thus :
			<lb />
			&quot;5. It has also been pointed out by Shri Pawan K. Aggarwal in his
			<lb />
			report that so far with respect to four companies, namely,
			<lb />
			Gaurisuta Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., Vidhyashree Buildcon Pvt. Ltd.,
			<lb />
			Mannat Buildcraft Pvt. Ltd. And Jhamb Finance &amp; Leasing Pvt.
			<lb />
			Ltd., only it has been noticed that a sum of Rs.242.38 crores has
			<lb />
			been handed over to them and in most of these firms Shri Ashish
			<lb />
			Jain and Shri Vivek Mittal are the Directors. Beside, it was stated
			<lb />
			before us by Shri Anil Mittal, statutory auditor, that his nephew-
			<lb />
			Vivek Mittal joined as a Director on the request made by Shri
			<lb />
			Chander Wadhwa, CFO, to create a company and he has in turn
			<lb />
			asked Shri Ashish Jain, an employee of his client, to join as
			<lb />
			another Directory of at least 10 companies, created at the request
			<lb />
			of the CFO and Amrapali Group of Companies. It is a shocking
			<lb />
			state of affairs that the statutory auditor himself was responsible
			<lb />
			for the creation of companies in an aforesaid manner. Shri Anil
			<lb />
			Mittal has also stated before us that he was aware that the money
			<lb />
			was flowing to the said companies through bank statements.
			<lb />
			However, on a specific query made by this Court to him, he has
			<lb />
			admitted that this fact of flow of money was not reflected in the
			<lb />
			audit report, which was signed by him in the audited Balance
			<lb />
			Sheet, in spite of knowing the fact that money has flown out of the
			<lb />
			accounts of the Amrapali Group of Companies to aforesaid
			<lb />
			companies.&quot;
			<lb />
			About the creation of companies consisting of his nephew as Director
			<lb />
			on the request made by Mr. Chander Wadhwa, CFO for asking Ashish Jain,
			<lb />
			an employee of his client, to join as another Director. The Company agreed
			<lb />
			at the request of the CFO and Amrapali group of companies.
			<lb />
			21. Since the CFO did not reply to the questions put by the Forensic
			<lb />
			Auditors to him, his conduct has been noted by this Court thus:
			<lb />
			&quot;6. We regretfully also note the conduct of the CFO, who is
			<lb />
			personally present before us today. His questions and answers
			<lb />
			have been placed on record by Shri Pavan K. Aggarwal, Forensic
			<lb />
			Auditor, along with his report and today we find that Shri Chander
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			33
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Wadhwa has contradicted his version which he had made to the
			<lb />
			Forensic Auditor. He has apologized for making wrong statements
			<lb />
			to the Forensic Auditor and has assured us that in future he will
			<lb />
			render all cooperation to the Forensic Auditors rightly, honestly
			<lb />
			and diligently. He has admitted today that there was appointment
			<lb />
			order as CFO and there was an authorization in writing issued to
			<lb />
			him for dealing with the banks. He has virtually contradicted the
			<lb />
			entire statement which he had made and has feigned ignorance to
			<lb />
			the Forensic Auditors. Be that as it may. We give him the last
			<lb />
			opportunity to come out clean and live up to the reputation of a
			<lb />
			profession of a Chartered Accountant. Let him cooperate with the
			<lb />
			Forensic Auditors, supply entire information correctly, truly and
			<lb />
			diligently. In case any remiss is found, it is made clear not only to
			<lb />
			him but also to the statutory/internal auditors that we will be
			<lb />
			compelled to take appropriate action as against them in the
			<lb />
			aforesaid factual situation, including the one for the professional
			<lb />
			misconduct.&quot;
			<lb />
			22. It was further pointed out by the forensic auditors that there were 23
			<lb />
			more groups of companies to whom money had been diverted and these
			<lb />
			companies had been created by Amrapali group of companies. This Court
			<lb />
			directed disclosure of these companies in the order dated 26.10.2018 thus:
			<lb />
			&quot;7. Shri Pavan K. Aggarwal has also pointed out to us that there are 23
			<lb />
			groups of companies to whom the money has been diverted and these
			<lb />
			companies have been created. Let the names of the companies be
			<lb />
			disclosed to the Amrapali Group of Companies and we direct the police to
			<lb />
			seize all the documents of these 23 companies to which money has been
			<lb />
			diverted and be handed over to the Forensic Auditors.
			<lb />
			9. We also direct the Directors of other 23 companies, which have been
			<lb />
			identified so far by the Forensic Auditors, to file their detailed affidavits in
			<lb />
			this Court, disclosing the amount received by them, dates of receipt, for
			<lb />
			what purpose and how it is utilized and invested by them.&quot;
			<lb />
			23. We had also directed Mr. Chander Wadhwa, CFO to file affidavit
			<lb />
			pointing out appointment order, authorisation, authority to sign any
			<lb />
			voucher and his entire role in the organisation thus:
			<lb />
			&quot;13. Let Shri Chander Wadhwa, CFO, file his affidavit in this Court
			<lb />
			placing the appointment order; authorization made to him from time to
			<lb />
			time; his authorization letters; details of attendance, if any, at the Board
			<lb />
			meetings; authority to sign any voucher; and his entire role which he has
			<lb />
			performed in the organization. Besides, it was also stated by Shri
			<lb />
			Chander Wadhwa, CFO, that he was one of the Directors of the Amrapali
			<lb />
			Development UK Ltd. and Saffron LLP, Delhi. Let the details of the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			34
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Articles of Association of these companies be placed on record and the
			<lb />
			present composition of the Directors and the entire transactions be
			<lb />
			disclosed on affidavit, along with the documents of these companies and
			<lb />
			returns, if any, which have been filed, be also handed over to the Forensic
			<lb />
			Auditors and affidavit be filed in this Court in this regard.
			<lb />
			14. It was also stated by Shri Chander Wadhwa that his nephew is one of
			<lb />
			the Directors in M/s. Rinku Computech, one of the shareholders of the
			<lb />
			Amrapali Biotech India Pvt. Ltd. His disclosure on affidavit be also made
			<lb />
			by Shri Chander Wadhwa.&quot;
			<lb />
			24. We also issued other directions to ensure that laptops and computers
			<lb />
			were made available to forensic auditors. On 31.10.2018 this Court noted
			<lb />
			that certain transactions of Amrapali group to Zodiac/J.P. Morgan,
			<lb />
			Mauritius/Singapore by the creation of various companies. We directed the
			<lb />
			bank statement of J.P. Morgan from 2008 till date to be filed. With respect
			<lb />
			to the money received from the Indian companies and in particular from
			<lb />
			Amrapali group of companies, all monetary transactions of J.P. Morgan,
			<lb />
			Mauritius and Singapore with Amrapali group of companies be disclosed
			<lb />
			with details on affidavit. We directed the Amrapali group of
			<lb />
			companies/statutory auditors as well as Anil Mittal, Ravi Kapoor and S.N.
			<lb />
			Dhawan and CFO to disclose the names of all the companies in which their
			<lb />
			family members or acquaintance were included as Director and all the
			<lb />
			transactions inter alia family members and relatives. It was also pointed
			<lb />
			out by Mr. Chander Wadhwa, CFO that though his salary was Rs.15,000
			<lb />
			per month, a car worth Rs.43 lakhs was given to him by the company in
			<lb />
			lieu of his services. It was also pointed out that an amount of Rs.2 crores
			<lb />
			has been paid on account of Chander Wadhwa&apos;s tax liability by Amrapali
			<lb />
			group of companies. Further directions were also issued to make the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			35
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			disclosures. This Court has noted the conduct of non-compliance of the
			<lb />
			order vide order dated 13.11.2018 thus:
			<lb />
			&quot;4. This Court has drawn suo moto contempt on 12.10.2018 and that is
			<lb />
			listed on 20.11.2018. In spite of the aforesaid observation made in the
			<lb />
			order dated 26.10.2018, still there is gross disobedience of the directions
			<lb />
			issued by this Court and in the affidavit filed in compliance of the order
			<lb />
			dated 26.10.2018, the various disclosures as ordered have not been
			<lb />
			made. Besides that, there is a failure to hand over to the forensic
			<lb />
			auditors, the relevant material as pointed out by them.
			<lb />
			5. The names of all the related companies have also not been disclosed
			<lb />
			with which the transactions have taken place. No such statement has
			<lb />
			been made categorically in terms of the order passed by this Court on
			<lb />
			31.10.2018 and absolutely vague averments have been made. This
			<lb />
			tantamount to deliberate noncompliance of the orders of this Court
			<lb />
			despite several opportunities having been granted.
			<lb />
			7. An affidavit has also been filed by Mr. Anil Sharma of Amrapali Group
			<lb />
			of Companies in which names of the companies which were ordered to be
			<lb />
			disclosed have not been disclosed and no statement has been made as
			<lb />
			ordered on 31.10.2018. It is a gross violation of the orders passed by this
			<lb />
			Court. There are certain averments in the affidavit which shows that
			<lb />
			certain properties have been sub-leased, out of Dream Valley, Centurian
			<lb />
			Park, Amrapali Leisure Valley. The subleases have been created. Full
			<lb />
			disclosures have not been made as to subleasing since earlier affidavits
			<lb />
			were contrary to it, it was shown as unencumbered property. we direct
			<lb />
			the Directors of Amrapali Group of Companies to disclose entire
			<lb />
			transaction and relevant documents as well as Greater Noida Authorities
			<lb />
			to file the documents about sub-leases, who is holding the land as on
			<lb />
			today, its considerations, how it has been used, how much consideration
			<lb />
			was received and where the amount is lying, and the sub-lease deeds be
			<lb />
			also placed on record. We order that there shall not be any further
			<lb />
			alienation of the sub-leased property by anyone.
			<lb />
			8. Statements of various bank accounts have also not been furnished
			<lb />
			besides other particulars. Learned counsel has again surprisingly prayed
			<lb />
			for three weeks&apos; further time to furnish the details though sufficient time
			<lb />
			had been given. No direction is being complied with. The Directors are
			<lb />
			filing the affidavit on each and every date making improvement as the
			<lb />
			forensic audit progresses. They are not making full disclosures and
			<lb />
			concealing the facts and have not mentioned in the affidavit what they are
			<lb />
			ordered to do. It is clear that they are obstructing the course of justice to
			<lb />
			the best of their ability. This state of affairs cannot be continued any
			<lb />
			further. For non-compliance of the directions issued from time to time, we
			<lb />
			have already drawn suo moto contempt and as subsequent orders have
			<lb />
			also been violated. For the purpose of taking the contempt proceedings to
			<lb />
			further logical end, before this Court passes any further order, we give an
			<lb />
			opportunity to the Amrapali Group of Companies and Directors to furnish
			<lb />
			their reply as to why they should not be punished for the contempt and
			<lb />
			the violation of the order passed by this Court from time to time by
			<lb />
			November 19, 2018. The case will be taken up for considering non-
			<lb />
			compliance of the order and for filing the wrong affidavits before this
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			36
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Court, on 20.11.2018 along with the suo moto contempt that has been
			<lb />
			registered vide order dated 12.10.2018.
			<lb />
			9. We have two affidavits. One of Anil Mittal and another of Chander
			<lb />
			Wadhwa. Both are passing liability on each other for creating certain
			<lb />
			additional companies. None want to own the responsibility. We require
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group of Companies and their Directors to file a reply to the
			<lb />
			affidavit, filed by their CFO Chander Wadhwa and Anil Mittal. Let the
			<lb />
			copies of affidavits of Chander Wadhwa and Anil Mittal be furnished to
			<lb />
			the Advocate on Record, Amrapali Group of Companies. Let para-wise
			<lb />
			and point-wise reply be submitted as to what has transpired in the Court,
			<lb />
			as recorded in order-sheets, including what they have stated in their
			<lb />
			affidavits.
			<lb />
			12. It was also pointed out that Computech Pvt Ltd. is in possession of a
			<lb />
			substantial amount. The forensic auditors are in the process of examining
			<lb />
			the details. However, at this juncture pursuant to findings of forensic
			<lb />
			auditors, it was pointed out by Mr. Vikas Singh, learned counsel
			<lb />
			appearing on behalf of Chander Wadhwa, CFO that a sum of Rs.7.58
			<lb />
			crore from Rinku Computech Private Limited and Rs.4.1 crore is lying
			<lb />
			with Chander Wadhwa, said amount is out of the transactions with the
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group of Companies. He has volunteered to deposit the amount
			<lb />
			within three weeks from today. Let it be deposited in the account opened
			<lb />
			with the Registrar of this court, within three weeks.
			<lb />
			14. From the forensic auditors&apos; report, it is prima facie clear that
			<lb />
			Amrapali Healthcare Private Limited, as pointed out in Annexure 11 is
			<lb />
			created out of funds belonging to the Amrapali group. That is extracted
			<lb />
			hereunder:

			It has also been pointed out that this hospital is, in fact, owned to the
			<lb />
			extent of 99.89 percent by Ultra Home Constructions Pvt Ltd. and
			<lb />
			funding has been made by the said company. It is one of the companies
			<lb />
			out of the Amrapali Group of Companies involved in the case. Thus, it is
			<lb />
			apparent that this property has to be sold as it has been purchased out of
			<lb />
			money of buyers, in order to make available the money for the
			<lb />
			construction of the buildings.
			<lb />
			17. It is a case where we find ourselves in a situation that the money of
			<lb />
			Greater Noida and Noida Authorities has not been paid, buyers have also
			<lb />
			been duped. Other financial institutions have not been paid. Construction
			<lb />
			has not been completed. Money paid by buyers has been diverted for the
			<lb />
			creation of various companies and assets have been created. All these
			<lb />
			assets are accountable and have to be sold as it is not the independent
			<lb />
			investment made by these directors. It is a patent and blatant fraud
			<lb />
			which appears to have been played, the way in which the money has been
			<lb />
			transacted and creation of companies has taken place in connivance with
			<lb />
			the CFO, statutory auditors. It was also pointed out that there are various
			<lb />
			related companies in which money has been transferred. We restrain all
			<lb />
			monetary transactions out of bank accounts or any kind of alienation of
			<lb />
			the property held by the related group of companies where the money has
			<lb />
			been siphoned and has been used for the creation of the assets. Any
			<lb />
			transfer made in any manner shall be illegal, void and inoperative.
			<lb />
			20. It is also necessary in order to find out the actual amount invested in
			<lb />
			building activities, out of the funds collected. It also appears that certain
			<lb />
			companies were created only for the purpose of purchasing raw materials.
			<lb />
			Whether actual transactions of purchase have taken place is required to
			<lb />
			be ascertained. Let all the vouchers of the purchase, Bills, orders, etc.,
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			which are in possession of Amrapali Group of Companies and the
			<lb />
			estimates of various raw materials for each and every building without
			<lb />
			which construction of a building is not possible to be undertaken to be
			<lb />
			positively handed over to the forensic auditors within a week. We also
			<lb />
			request the forensic auditors to propose how the actual valuation of the
			<lb />
			buildings constructed so far by the Amrapali Group of Companies on the
			<lb />
			spot can be made so as to ascertain the actual investments made and
			<lb />
			extent of diversion. Let the estimate and quantities of the bills be also
			<lb />
			furnished by Amrapali Group to the forensic auditors along with the
			<lb />
			names of all the suppliers and mode of payment. They may also collect
			<lb />
			information/documents from suppliers.&quot;
			<lb />
			Certain directions were also issued to DRT to make the valuation to
			<lb />
			sell the property. Other facts were also noted.
			<lb />
			25. On 20.11.2018 this Court had noted non-compliance of various
			<lb />
			orders passed by this Court from time to time. Various sub-leases had also
			<lb />
			been created. We issued the directions vide order dated 20.11.2018 as
			<lb />
			under:
			<lb />
			&quot;3. It appears that various sub-lessees have been created. It was
			<lb />
			informed to us by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group of Companies that certain structures have been raised
			<lb />
			by the sub-lessees. We have asked them to disclose all the information
			<lb />
			on affidavit, but the order still remains uncomplied. Various directions in
			<lb />
			this regard have been issued in paragraph 7 of the order dated
			<lb />
			13.11.2018. There are various other directions issued time to time also
			<lb />
			and compliance thereof is still wanting, though time fixed is over.
			<lb />
			4. In the circumstances, we give one last opportunity to the Amrapali
			<lb />
			Group of Companies, particularly to all the Directors of the company and
			<lb />
			also those who have filed a reply in the Suo Motu Contempt. They have to
			<lb />
			file their further affidavits in compliance with the aforesaid directions as
			<lb />
			to what they have done and to make the disclosure as envisaged in
			<lb />
			various orders.&quot;
			<lb />
			We had also directed that any non-cooperation with the Forensic
			<lb />
			Auditors shall be viewed seriously. Statements of accounts of banks were
			<lb />
			also ordered to be issued by the banks. In order dated 5.12.2018 this
			<lb />
			Court observed that let the Amrapali group of companies and their
			<lb />
			Directors Mr. Chander Wadhwa, CFO and Mr. Anil Mittal to explain as to
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			39
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			why criminal action be not initiated against them on the basis of affidavits,
			<lb />
			various documents and the statements made in this Court on various dates
			<lb />
			and why their conduct as projected in the case be not reported to the ICAI
			<lb />
			to inquire. We directed the production of details of immovable properties as
			<lb />
			well as the movables etc. This Court also noted that DRT has pointed out
			<lb />
			that there was non-cooperation and non-compliance on the part of
			<lb />
			Amrapali group of companies. It was also pointed out to this Court that
			<lb />
			certain buyers/companies who have booked the flats by making payment
			<lb />
			of a paltry amount for the purchase of several flats/plots, did not appear to
			<lb />
			be genuine buyers. We have directed the Forensic Auditors to look into this
			<lb />
			issue. We also directed all the Directors of companies, their relatives, family
			<lb />
			members, Mr.Chander Wadhwa, CFO and statutory auditors who were in
			<lb />
			receipt of money of home buyers, to deposit the same in this Court. The
			<lb />
			last opportunity was given to do so.
			<lb />
			26. On 12.12.2018 in para 4 we have observed thus:
			<lb />
			&quot;4. Pursuant to our order dated 05.12.2018, Mr. Adhikari Devi Prasad,
			<lb />
			Mr. Bhuvan Pant, Mr. Prasanna Kumar Rout, Mr. Jagannath Sharma,
			<lb />
			Mr. Tarun Kumar Sharma, and Mr. Sunil Kumar and also Mr. Anil
			<lb />
			Sharma, Director, Amrapali Group of Companies are present in the
			<lb />
			Court. We generally asked them how the accounts for the period 2015 to
			<lb />
			2018 were prepared by them and submitted in the Court. They have
			<lb />
			stated that it was based on tally data which was given to them. In
			<lb />
			addition, Mr.Prasanna Kumar Rout, who worked as an Accountant with
			<lb />
			Amrapali Sapphire, stated that he made the entries up to August 2018 in
			<lb />
			the tally data on the basis of the documents/vouchers which were made
			<lb />
			available to him. Mr.Jagannath Sharma, who is a Chartered Accountant
			<lb />
			and partner in L.D.R. Company stated that they have prepared the
			<lb />
			balance sheet on the basis of the tally data provided to them for the years
			<lb />
			2015 to 2018. However, when cross-checked with the Forensic Auditors,
			<lb />
			the Court was informed that the data from 2015 to 2018 has not been
			<lb />
			made available fully to them. It was also pointed out that there should be
			<lb />
			supporting documents/material to make these entries other than the
			<lb />
			Bank statement when these statements have been prepared that should
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			40
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			also be clarified by Amrapali Group and supplied to the Forensic
			<lb />
			Auditors.&quot;
			<lb />
			We also directed details of unsold apartments and flats of the projects
			<lb />
			to be submitted in this Court. It was also pointed out that the methodology
			<lb />
			has been adopted by creating sub-leases as a mode of siphoning off the
			<lb />
			amount of the buyers. This Court noted the following facts and issued the
			<lb />
			requisite directions:
			<lb />
			&quot;8. Mr. Lahoty, the learned counsel, also pointed out that the
			<lb />
			methodology which has been adopted for creating the subleases was, by
			<lb />
			and large, a mode of siphoning the amount. He has given the following
			<lb />
			details as Annexure E, which is extracted below:-

			above-quoted details filed on behalf of the flat buyers.&quot;
			<lb />
			27. The directions were also issued to DRT to make a further valuation of
			<lb />
			Tech Park (Hotel) in Greater Noida. On 25.1.2019 we issued certain
			<lb />
			directions. On 11.2.2019 we directed M/s. J.P. Morgan to disclose the
			<lb />
			names of the investors and beneficiaries who invested in the Mauritius
			<lb />
			Fund which had invested in Amrapali INR Rs.85 crores. On 14.2.2019,
			<lb />
			dues were pointed out against individuals and Directors also. Against
			<lb />
			Directors there was a report of loans and advances to the extent of

			Rs.161.51 crores as noted in the order. We issued certain directions with

			respect to M/s. Golf Link City Projects Private Ltd. as well as M/s. Royal

			Golf Link City Projects Pvt. Ltd. We directed Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma to
			<lb />
			deposit an amount; whereas the non-compliance made by Amrapali was
			<lb />
			also pointed out by the buyers which had been noted. As inability was
			<lb />
			expressed on behalf of M/s. J.P. Morgan to explain valuation report dated
			<lb />
			23.10.2013 submitted by Mr. Sudit K. Parikh &amp; Co., Chartered
			<lb />
			Accountants, they were ordered to explain the valuation report on the basis
			<lb />
			of which Rs.140 crores had been withdrawn by M/s. J.P. Morgan. It was
			<lb />
			also pointed out in this connection that the shares of Amrapali Zodiac were
			<lb />
			ultimately purchased for Rs.140 crores by M/s. Neelkanth and M/s.
			<lb />
			Rudraksha Forensic auditors pointed out that two persons namely
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			43
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Chandan Kumar, is a peon of Mr. Anil Mittal, statutory auditor and was
			<lb />
			working in his office and one is Vivek Mittal, nephew of Mr. Anil Mittal, who
			<lb />
			was doing petty jobs of sub-contractors, getting a monthly income of
			<lb />
			Rs.15,000. They were stated to be Directors in the companies, i.e., M/s.
			<lb />
			Neelkanth and Rudraksha. They were not having any capacity to give
			<lb />
			Rs.140 crores to M/s. J.P. Morgan. This Court has noted the facts thus:
			<lb />
			&quot;As inability was expressed on behalf of M/s. J.P. Morgan as well as
			<lb />
			other counsel to explain the report dated 23.10.2013 submitted by
			<lb />
			Mr. Sudit K. Parikh &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants. In the
			<lb />
			circumstances, so as to find out the basis of the valuation, it is
			<lb />
			necessary to call Mr. Sudit K. Parikh [Address : Ballard House, 2 nd
			<lb />
			Floor, Adi Marzban Path, Ballard Pier, Fort, Mumbai -400 001] to
			<lb />
			explain the valuation report on the basis of which Rs. 140 crores
			<lb />
			had been withdrawn by M/s. J.P. Morgan. Let the Registry send a
			<lb />
			communication to Mr. Sudit K. Parikh to appear before this Court
			<lb />
			on the next date of hearing.
			<lb />
			It was pointed out that shares of Amrapali Zodiac were ultimately
			<lb />
			purchased for Rs.140 crores by M/s Neelkanth and M/s Rudraksha.
			<lb />
			It is pointed out by forensic auditors that there are two persons,
			<lb />
			namely, Chandan Kumar, who is a peon of Mr. Anil Mittal, Statutory
			<lb />
			Auditor, and working in his office and another one is Vivek Mittal,
			<lb />
			who is the nephew of Mr. Anil Mittal, and is doing petty jobs of sub-
			<lb />
			contractors and having a monthly income of Rs.15,000/-. It is
			<lb />
			stated by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of M/s J.P.
			<lb />
			Morgan that in one company, Chandan Kumar and Atul Mittal were
			<lb />
			Directors. M/s Neelkanth and M/s Rudraksha are the private
			<lb />
			limited companies in which the abovementioned persons are named
			<lb />
			as Directors. They are not having the capacity to give an amount of
			<lb />
			Rs,140 Crores to be paid to M/s J.P. Morgan.
			<lb />
			This is a serious kind of fraud apparent from the aforesaid facts. On
			<lb />
			being asked, Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma has shown reluctance to
			<lb />
			disclose about Atul Mittal, who was the Director of M/s Rudraksha
			<lb />
			along with Chandan Kumar. It is apparent that it was not a fair
			<lb />
			transaction of sale. That fact is required to be gone into. Let Mr. Anil
			<lb />
			Mittal and Directors of Amrapali Zodiac and Mr. Anil Sharma
			<lb />
			explain the situation by filing their personal affidavits from where
			<lb />
			the money came to be paid to M/s J.P. Morgan, who managed the
			<lb />
			money and how the companies were framed and for what purpose.&quot;
			<lb />
			28. On 28.2.2019, this Court considered IA No.35430/2019 filed by
			<lb />
			Deputy Commissioner of Police, EOW, Delhi Police, seeking permission to
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			44
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			take into custody various Directors namely Anil Kumar Sharma, Shiv Priya,
			<lb />
			and Ajay Kumar. This Court has passed the following order:
			<lb />
			&quot;I.A.No. 35430 of 2019
			<lb />
			This application has been filed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police,
			<lb />
			Economic Offences Wing, Delhi Police, seeking permission to arrest and
			<lb />
			take into custody various Directors, namely, Anil Kumar Sharma, Shiv
			<lb />
			Priya, and Ajay Kumar. They are presently in the custody of Noida Police
			<lb />
			vide our order dated 11.10.2018. We make it clear that the Delhi Police is
			<lb />
			free to arrest/take into custody any or all the other Directors of Amrapali
			<lb />
			group of companies. Any order passed by this Court, in this case, shall
			<lb />
			not come in their way to do so.
			<lb />
			Let the Police investigate the entire gamut of the scenario of the various
			<lb />
			projects, as projected in this case and various orders passed and
			<lb />
			investigate the entire matter. Prima facie, we find that the case requires
			<lb />
			serious investigation in the facts projected by the Directors, CFO, and the
			<lb />
			statutory auditors.
			<lb />
			The Police are directed to investigate the role of Mr. Anil Mittal, Statutory
			<lb />
			Auditor, and Mr. Chander Wadhwa, CFO as well. The Police may
			<lb />
			interrogate them and find out their criminality, if any, in the matter.
			<lb />
			Let various order sheets of this Court as well as the affidavits of Mr.
			<lb />
			Chander Wadhwa and Mr.Anil Mittal and Directors of Amrapali Group of
			<lb />
			Companies indicating the operational methods of diversion of funds and
			<lb />
			creation of companies be also furnished to the Deputy Commissioner
			<lb />
			forthwith.
			<lb />
			The application is allowed.&quot;
			<lb />
			This Court also issued other directions with respect to the persons
			<lb />
			who were called by the Forensic Auditors but did not report. Other
			<lb />
			directions were also issued.
			<lb />
			29. On 9.4.2019 we requested the parties to address this Court how to
			<lb />
			protect the interests of the buyers so that they can get a clear title after
			<lb />
			completion of the projects. In view of the dues of Noida and Greater Noida
			<lb />
			authorities and other secured creditors, such as banks, etc. how to work
			<lb />
			out equities in the circumstances and requested the parties to address this
			<lb />
			Court. Amrapali group of companies to address how much investment they
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			45
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			have made in the project and what they have done with the money of the
			<lb />
			buyers and to inform us as to diversion of the money of home-buyers, how
			<lb />
			to secure it and why they should not be suitably dealt with in accordance
			<lb />
			with law for what they have done. In view of the aforesaid facts projected in
			<lb />
			various affidavits of the Directors and the interim report of forensic
			<lb />
			auditors. This Court listed the case for hearing on various issues. We have
			<lb />
			heard Forensic Auditors, Mr. Krishnan Venugopal, learned senior counsel
			<lb />
			and Mr. M.L. Lahoty, learned counsel, on 30.4.2019. Thereafter, we further
			<lb />
			heard the matter on 1.5.2019. They concluded the arguments. Mr. C.A.
			<lb />
			Sundaram learned senior counsel was also heard and the learned counsel
			<lb />
			on behalf of Bank of Maharashtra and Bank of Baroda as well as Ms. Geeta
			<lb />
			Luthra and Mr. Gaurav Bhatia, learned senior counsel on behalf of
			<lb />
			Amrapali group. On 2.5.2019 and on 8.5.2019 certain directions were
			<lb />
			issued. On 10.5.2019 arguments were further heard and the case was
			<lb />
			reserved for orders.
			<lb />
			SUBMISSIONS
			<lb />
			30. Mr. M.L. Lahoty, learned counsel appearing on behalf of 49,575 home
			<lb />
			buyers submitted that under section 8 of the Real Estate Regulation and
			<lb />
			Development Act, 2016 (for short, &apos;the RERA&apos;) and also in view of the
			<lb />
			provisions contained in sections 13 and 14 of the U.P. Industrial Area
			<lb />
			Development Act, 1976 (for short, &apos;the Industrial Development Act&apos;), the
			<lb />
			lease deeds granted by Noida and Greater Noida authorities were ordered to
			<lb />
			be cancelled. In the lease deed also, there is a specific stipulation as to
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			46
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			cancellation clause in case of cancellation and imposing penalty and for
			<lb />
			such other actions against the builder in case of default. Home buyers
			<lb />
			further submitted that after payment of first 10% of the lease premium,
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group has not paid any of the 20 half-yearly instalments from
			<lb />
			2010 onwards. The Noida and Greater Noida authorities have been liberal,
			<lb />
			and not taking any stringent action against Amrapali Group which had
			<lb />
			been mandated by virtue of the provisions contained in the lease deed. The
			<lb />
			dues of Noida and Greater Noida authorities cannot be treated at par with
			<lb />
			the dues of home buyers. Home buyers further submitted that so far as the
			<lb />
			dues of the banks are concerned, they are not placed on any better footing
			<lb />
			and Forensic Auditors in their report have stated that but for the
			<lb />
			connivance of the bank officials, the act of money siphoning on such large
			<lb />
			scale would not have taken place. Banks have failed to monitor utilisation
			<lb />
			of the borrowed funds and they acted as mute spectators to the diversion of
			<lb />
			funds by Amrapali Group of Companies, its Directors and officials. Mr.
			<lb />
			Lahoty, on behalf of home buyers further submitted that the Reserve Bank
			<lb />
			of India has issued Master Circulars from time to time since 2014 onwards
			<lb />
			as to the obligations of the Banks and specifically directed that banks must
			<lb />
			necessarily monitor the &apos;end use&apos; of the loans granted by them and call for
			<lb />
			periodical reports thereof. In the case of diversion and siphoning of loan
			<lb />
			funds, banks must invariably take action against defaulters. Reliance has
			<lb />
			been placed on RBI&apos;s Master Circulars of July 2009, 2014 and 2015. In
			<lb />
			case after the cancellation of the leases, they are not able to construct, they
			<lb />
			may enter into an arrangement with any reputed builder like NBCC or L&amp;T,
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			47
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			etc. A roadmap thereof need be drawn to be monitored by a Monitoring
			<lb />
			Committee which duly represents the interest of the home buyers, may also
			<lb />
			be directed to be constituted which will not only oversee the work but also
			<lb />
			oversee the construction activities and also submit a report to this Court so
			<lb />
			that the needs of the home-buyers are finally achieved. A further audit of
			<lb />
			connected companies may be ordered. Bank accounts with Bank of
			<lb />
			Baroda are operationalised towards maintenance and electricity as families
			<lb />
			are residing in 21 Towers have been regularly depositing the electricity and
			<lb />
			other dues in their accounts which have become defunct after the
			<lb />
			discharge of IRP vide order dated 8.8.2018 passed by this Court. The
			<lb />
			amount be utilised for pending bills from August to October 2018 towards
			<lb />
			electricity and maintenance services by nominating a Joint Signatory in
			<lb />
			place of IRP.
			<lb />
			31. Mr. Krishnan Venugopal, learned senior counsel appearing for home-
			<lb />
			buyers has urged that there is the distinction between mortgage and
			<lb />
			charge as a mortgage involves the transfer of interest, whereas, in case of a
			<lb />
			charge, there is no transfer of interest. He has further urged that non-
			<lb />
			production of relevant documents despite the court order, leads to a
			<lb />
			presumption of an adverse inference. As Amrapali Group has failed to
			<lb />
			comply with the court&apos;s order, an adverse inference may be drawn against
			<lb />
			them. He has also pressed into service public trust doctrine and submitted
			<lb />
			that the State or the public authority which holds the property for the
			<lb />
			public or which has been assigned the duty of grant of largesse, etc. acts as
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			48
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			a trustee, and therefore, has to act fairly and reasonably, promote public
			<lb />
			good and public interest. Public trust doctrine is a part of the law of the
			<lb />
			land. The doctrine is a facet of Article 21 of the Constitution. The action
			<lb />
			has to be bona fide. Public property cannot be transferred to private
			<lb />
			property in case it affects the public interest. General welfare and common
			<lb />
			good are to be kept in view by the public authorities exercising public
			<lb />
			power and discharging public duty.
			<lb />
			32. Mr. Krishnan Venugopal, learned senior counsel further urged that in
			<lb />
			view of the findings recorded by the Forensic Auditors, section 8 of the
			<lb />
			RERA has to be invoked. He further submitted that even though Amrapali
			<lb />
			was defaulting on payments of lease rents, authorities continued to allot
			<lb />
			further plots to them. The first lease had been granted on 1.5.2007 and the
			<lb />
			last on 30.7.2010. Despite default, they continued to issue permission to
			<lb />
			mortgage/NOCs for that purpose between 24.12.2009 and 27.2.2013, in
			<lb />
			spite of the fact that there was no payment of premium and advance
			<lb />
			annual lease rent up to date. The authorities have acted in breach of clause
			<lb />
			7 of the conditions of the lease deed, they failed to monitor the progress of
			<lb />
			the project to protect the interest of the public.
			<lb />
			33. In reference to banks, Mr. Venugopal submitted that banks were
			<lb />
			giving loans to finance Amrapali, in spite of the fact that they were diverted
			<lb />
			to other accounts and not utilised for construction. Banks do not even have
			<lb />
			effective mortgages because of NOCs. clearly, state that they would become
			<lb />
			effective only when Amrapali makes up to date payment of the premium
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			49
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			and advance annual lease rent, and under the conditional NOCs., the
			<lb />
			banks were required to obtain confirmation from the authorities as to
			<lb />
			payment of premium and lease money for the mortgage to become effective.
			<lb />
			The banks have not handed over copies of mortgage deeds despite orders.
			<lb />
			Moreover, the banks have a second charge after all dues of the Noida and
			<lb />
			Greater Noida authorities are realised. The authority&apos;s ownership rights
			<lb />
			over the plots are paramount. The public sector banks are also subject to
			<lb />
			public trust doctrine to the extent that they are custodians of public funds
			<lb />
			and are beneficiaries of the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer
			<lb />
			of Undertaking) Act, 1970 and Banking Companies (Acquisition and
			<lb />
			Transfer of Undertaking) Act, 1980 passed in pursuance of the Directive
			<lb />
			Principles under Article 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution. The facts
			<lb />
			demonstrate the collusion between Amrapali Authorities and the banks.
			<lb />
			The home buyers who invested their hard-earned money, cannot be
			<lb />
			cheated and deprived of their money as well as their houses. Authorities
			<lb />
			cannot seek to recover any additional amount from the home buyers. They
			<lb />
			must be directed to complete the construction by realising only the
			<lb />
			remaining dues from home buyers under their agreements with Amrapali,
			<lb />
			by selling off unsold inventory of flats, etc. available with it and by selling
			<lb />
			off excess land allotted to Amrapali. The Committees of home buyers must
			<lb />
			be set up for each project to monitor the quality and progress of the
			<lb />
			construction as well as the costs involved so as to ensure that contractors
			<lb />
			do not engage in fraud or inflate construction costs in the course of
			<lb />
			completing the projects.

			34. On behalf of the home buyers Association, it was submitted that by
			<lb />
			promoters of the real estate sector in India from 2008-2009, home buyers
			<lb />
			have been promised the houses of which they have been deprived of on a
			<lb />
			large scale in spite of the fact that they have paid a substantial amount of
			<lb />
			money. Construction has not progressed and money has been diverted
			<lb />
			elsewhere. There is a charge of the money of the home buyers must be
			<lb />
			treated as the highest priority. They have paid towards dues of Authorities
			<lb />
			also which amount has been diverted. Banks and authorities have failed to
			<lb />
			discharge their duties. Banks have granted loans to the projects in some
			<lb />
			cases which were not sanctioned even on the date of grant of loan. For
			<lb />
			example, Phase III of Amrapali Adarsh Awas Yojana Project. Banks have
			<lb />
			released the complete payment amounts to the builder without the
			<lb />
			construction having been reached even 10 to 20%. As such lending was
			<lb />
			not permissible. The current scenario is that the construction of the
			<lb />
			various projects is stalled and the home buyers are without any hope of the
			<lb />
			promised homes. Certain incumbents who have taken loan are compelled
			<lb />
			to repay the loan and money has been siphoned out. As such appropriate
			<lb />
			relief be granted to home buyers in view of the facts found in the report of
			<lb />
			the Forensic Auditors.
			<lb />
			35. On behalf of the home buyers, reliance has been placed on the
			<lb />
			provisions contained in section 4(5) of the U.P. Apartments (Promotion of
			<lb />
			Construction, Ownership, and Maintenance) Act, 2010 (for short, the &apos;U.P.
			<lb />
			Apartments Act, 2010&apos;).
			<lb />
			It is provided that the completion of the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			51
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			construction works of a building as a whole or the completion of an
			<lb />
			independent block of such building, as the case may be. The completion
			<lb />
			certificate can be issued for the blocks which have been completed. Noida
			<lb />
			and Greater Noida authorities are not issuing NOC for the reason that
			<lb />
			payment of land dues has not been made by the builder, for which
			<lb />
			authorities are also responsible. The non-payment of dues by the builder
			<lb />
			should not come in the way as more than 9000 home buyers are already
			<lb />
			residing in the buildings. Most of them have paid the entire amount to the
			<lb />
			promoter. Others are waiting for the completion of buildings.
			<lb />
			36. On behalf of Noida Authority, learned senior counsel submitted that
			<lb />
			public trust doctrine is not attracted to the facts in the instant case as
			<lb />
			there is no breach of trust. The decision to transfer lease at 10% was the
			<lb />
			carefully thought out policy of Noida approved by the State Government. It
			<lb />
			was applied uniformly to all and not restricted only to the Amrapali Group.
			<lb />
			It was submitted that allotment of group housing plots is made by Noida
			<lb />
			authority in accordance with the prevailing policies and rates which have
			<lb />
			kept changing with times. In 2007, the allottees were required to pay 10%
			<lb />
			of the total premium of the plot as reservation money, before formal
			<lb />
			allotment letter was issued. Then, a further amount of 30% had to be paid
			<lb />
			within 60 days from the time of allotment. Thus, 40% premium was
			<lb />
			required to be paid. Balance 60% had to be paid in eight half-yearly
			<lb />
			instalments along with interest.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			52
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			37. It was further submitted on behalf of the Noida Authority that
			<lb />
			primarily on account of the global recession in the world economy, in the
			<lb />
			year 2008 a decision was taken to revise the rate of allotment money to
			<lb />
			10%. Thus, the total sum of 20% was to be paid before handing over
			<lb />
			possession. In the year 2009, the rate of allotment money along with
			<lb />
			registration money was revised to 10% of the total premium for the
			<lb />
			possession to be handed over. However, steps were taken to provide (i)
			<lb />
			facility of re-scheduling of payments in case the allottees intended to
			<lb />
			complete his project as per agreed policy; (ii) to exit the project; (iii)
			<lb />
			moratorium of two years on payment of balance premium; (iv) facility of
			<lb />
			sub-division of plots of area larger than 10 acres so as to make the larger
			<lb />
			projects financially viable.
			<lb />
			38. It was also submitted on behalf of Noida Authority that after 2005, a
			<lb />
			total of 114 plots had been allotted to various group housing societies. 81
			<lb />
			have been handed over the possession on payment of 10% of the total
			<lb />
			premium. 29 projects, out of these 81, have been completed. Out of other
			<lb />
			33 allotted earlier, 11 had been completed, and 7 have obtained part-
			<lb />
			completion certificates. Noida Authority, being a responsible public
			<lb />
			organisation, has been diligent in pursuing Amrapali Group, it has not
			<lb />
			taken the drastic recourse of terminating the lease deed as that would
			<lb />
			entail demolition of the existing structures as per the provisions of the
			<lb />
			lease deed. In terms of the lease, home buyers have no title or legal rights
			<lb />
			to possession of the flats they are occupying. As the projects have been
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			53
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			completed to some extent, it would have been unfair to leave the home
			<lb />
			buyers in the lurch. The occupancy certificate is issued in accordance with
			<lb />
			the provisions of the New Okhla Industrial Development Area Building
			<lb />
			Regulations, 2010 (for short, &apos;the Regulations of 2010&apos;). Clause 20.0 of the
			<lb />
			Building Regulations requires the allottee to submit a notice of completion
			<lb />
			of the building, inter alia, with a structural safety certificate, NOCs from
			<lb />
			the Fire Department, Explosives department and Environment department.
			<lb />
			No building erected, re-erected, can be occupied in whole or in part unless
			<lb />
			occupancy certificate is issued by the CEO of the Authority as per clause
			<lb />
			20.1.1 of the Regulations. The lessee/promoter is entitled to allot the
			<lb />
			dwelling unit on a sub-lease basis. However, he has to make the payment
			<lb />
			of premium of the plot to Noida authority when permission to transfer
			<lb />
			built-up flats or part with possession of the whole or any part of the
			<lb />
			building which has been constructed is granted. The physical possession of
			<lb />
			flats can be given to home buyers only after execution of sub-lease deed
			<lb />
			and sale deed has also to be registered before actual physical possession of
			<lb />
			the flat is handed over as required under the provisions of Registration Act,
			<lb />
			1908. The declaration required to be made under section 12 of the U.P.
			<lb />
			Apartments Act, 2010 is also to be filed.
			<lb />
			39. It was further urged on behalf of the Noida Authority that the Noida
			<lb />
			Authority had the first charge including those created in favour of banks
			<lb />
			and financial institutions. The mortgage could have been effected in favour
			<lb />
			of Banks/financial institutions recognised by the RBI, National Housing
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			54
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Bank, HUDCO, New Delhi and the charge of such institution shall be the
			<lb />
			second charge on the dwelling units, thus, being financed. The permission
			<lb />
			to mortgage shall be effective only on making full payment of premium and
			<lb />
			up to date annual lease rent of group housing society. An intimation shall
			<lb />
			be given to the Authority about the creation of the charge by way of
			<lb />
			mortgage. The mortgage permission shall be granted as per the terms of the
			<lb />
			lease only on payment of dues of authorities.
			<lb />
			40. It is submitted that it is open to the authority to cancel or terminate
			<lb />
			the lease. In the case of misrepresentation, suppression or violation of the
			<lb />
			conditions of lease and in the case of default and at the time of
			<lb />
			cancellation, an amount equivalent to 25% of the total premium of the plot
			<lb />
			shall have to be forfeited and possession of plot shall have to be resumed
			<lb />
			by Noida Authority with structure thereon. In the instant case, no dues
			<lb />
			certificate had not been issued by the Noida authority nor any sub-lease
			<lb />
			deed has been executed. The possession by various home buyers in respect
			<lb />
			of constructed flats is contrary to the provisions of the lease deed. The
			<lb />
			builder could not have handed over the possession. Any occupation of flats
			<lb />
			by the home buyers without compliance of mandatory provision of
			<lb />
			occupancy certificate and without payment of statutory dues, both to Noida
			<lb />
			Authority and to the Collector of Stamps and without execution of tripartite
			<lb />
			sub-lease deed may not be termed as legal and as such which could have
			<lb />
			resulted in their eventual eviction.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			41. It was further submitted on behalf of the Noida Authority that
			<lb />
			pursuant to order dated 27.11.2017 passed by this Court, on depositing
			<lb />
			10% of the dues to issue completion certificate such NOC could not be
			<lb />
			issued and the order passed by this Court has not been complied with by
			<lb />
			builder/promoter as such possession could not be handed over. In spite of
			<lb />
			reiterating the aforesaid direction of this Court on 31.1.2018, it has not
			<lb />
			been complied with by the promoter/leaseholder. It is submitted by the
			<lb />
			Noida Authority that its dues to Amrapali group exceed Rs.2191.38 crores
			<lb />
			till 30.4.2019. It is in public interest to ensure payment of premium/lease
			<lb />
			money with penal interest etc. so that the development of the various
			<lb />
			projects at Noida is not impeded. Prayer has been made that in whatever
			<lb />
			manner practicable and by whatever scheme this Court may think fit and
			<lb />
			proper, aforesaid dues of the authority may be secured and ordered to be
			<lb />
			recovered.
			<lb />
			42. On behalf of Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority, it was
			<lb />
			submitted that its dues were Rs.3,234.71 crores as on 15.1.2019 in respect
			<lb />
			of 5 group housing plots of Amrapali group. These dues inter alia comprise
			<lb />
			of the amounts payable against the premium plus the penal interest for
			<lb />
			default, additional compensation and interest thereon, the lease rent and
			<lb />
			interest thereon and time extension charges for each of the five plots. Title
			<lb />
			in the flats can pass only by way of execution of a registered instrument.
			<lb />
			However, before that procedural requirements pointed out on behalf of the
			<lb />
			Noida Authority have to be complied with. Once completion certificate is
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			56
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			issued, the rights in the flat will pass on to the flat buyers and then they
			<lb />
			would contend that the dues of the authority should be recovered from the
			<lb />
			builders who have defaulted in making payment and not the flat buyers.
			<lb />
			On the basis of that privity of contract, they would contend that the
			<lb />
			liability to make payment of the premium and other dues payable to
			<lb />
			Greater Noida authority, by lessee/builder is between them and they are
			<lb />
			not parties to the lease deed.
			<lb />
			43. It is further submitted on behalf of Greater Noida Authority that even
			<lb />
			with regard to the issuance of completion certificate for a part of the
			<lb />
			projects, the existing policy is that against the part-payment received,
			<lb />
			completion certificate would be issued in the same proportion minus 10%,
			<lb />
			so that the financial interest of the authority is protected. Therefore, sub-
			<lb />
			lease deeds too would be executed up to 90% of the proportion in which
			<lb />
			part-payment has been received. It was further submitted by the Greater
			<lb />
			Noida Authority that section 19(10) of RERA also provides for taking over of
			<lb />
			physical possession after issuance of completion certificate. The provisions
			<lb />
			of the U.P. Apartments Act, 2010 are also similar as well the provisions in
			<lb />
			the lease deed.
			<lb />
			44. It is further submitted on behalf of Greater Noida Authority that FAR
			<lb />
			admissible is 02.75 only and not 3.50. The differential FAR of 0.75 is not
			<lb />
			purchasable. The calculations made by Amrapali based on FAR of 3.50 is
			<lb />
			itself wrong. FAR has not yet been purchased by Amrapali group by
			<lb />
			depositing the charges and submission of consent of two-thirds of the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			57
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			apartment owners. Under section 4(2)(1)(D) of RERA, 70% of the amount
			<lb />
			received from home buyers is to be put in a separate account to be
			<lb />
			maintained in a scheduled bank and is to be used towards construction
			<lb />
			and land cost. The land dues payable to Greater Noida authority constitute
			<lb />
			an encumbrance as provided in section 4(1)(b) of the U.P. Apartments Act,
			<lb />
			2010. As per section 11(4)(c) of RERA, it is the duty of the promoters to
			<lb />
			certify that all dues and charges have been paid. Thus, it follows that
			<lb />
			money received from the flat buyers is to be spent on construction and
			<lb />
			payment of land dues. Therefore, payment of land dues cannot be denied to
			<lb />
			it. Land dues are in the nature of public money. Amrapali group is bound
			<lb />
			to pay it. The amount is payable in instalments as such same is interest
			<lb />
			bearing for availing the facility of payment in instalments as such the land
			<lb />
			cost payable increases. In case of default, penal interest follows. There was
			<lb />
			no order passed by the Allahabad High Court for staying construction on
			<lb />
			the leased plots. Amrapali Group was in possession of the allotted land and
			<lb />
			was proceeding with the construction. For 4 years, it has prayed for zero
			<lb />
			periods of interest to which the group is not entitled. It would lead to
			<lb />
			unjust enrichment by Amrapali as they have realised dues from home
			<lb />
			buyers and have not paid to the Authority. The order passed by the NGT
			<lb />
			with respect to Okhla Bird Sanctuary case was not applicable to the land in
			<lb />
			question. The dues payable to the authority are recoverable as the arrears
			<lb />
			of land revenue. The authority has the first charge. The permission to the
			<lb />
			mortgage was conditional one, it has not been complied with, in particular,
			<lb />
			conditions B, C and D. The mortgage had to be renewed every year and is
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			58
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			subject to the payment of land premium, etc. The Greater Noida authority
			<lb />
			has written numerous letters to Amrapali group of companies to make the
			<lb />
			payment of its dues. In the case of Unitech, yet another Group, the
			<lb />
			Authority has cancelled the allotment which was questioned in this Court.
			<lb />
			As the cancellation of the allotment in case of Amrapali could have led to
			<lb />
			greater complications as construction had commenced with third-party
			<lb />
			interest created. It would have opened floodgates to litigation. As such
			<lb />
			cancellation of lease deeds was not resorted to.
			<lb />
			45. Ms. Geeta Luthra and Mr. Gaurav Bhatia, learned senior counsel
			<lb />
			appearing on behalf of Amrapali group of companies, have urged that
			<lb />
			Amrapali group started its activities in the name of M/s. Ultra Home
			<lb />
			Construction Pvt. Ltd. in the year 2003 with the purpose of providing low-
			<lb />
			cost housing to projects in Indirapuram (Ghaziabad) Noida, Lucknow,
			<lb />
			Indore, Bhilai, and more than 15,000 flats were handed over by the
			<lb />
			developers to flat owners in 5 different housing projects in Indirapuram
			<lb />
			and Greater Noida. The balance sheets of Amrapali group of companies at
			<lb />
			2007-08 shows that it had carried forward the money earned by the
			<lb />
			company to launch the projects after 2009-10 upon allotment of plots by
			<lb />
			Noida and Greater Noida authorities in their respective areas. Immediately
			<lb />
			after the allotment of land, the work was started and the Allahabad High
			<lb />
			Court quashed acquisition. It had to be stopped as per the order passed by
			<lb />
			the Allahabad High Court. When in 2016 Amrapali group again started to
			<lb />
			infuse capital and manpower, proceedings were initiated in NCLT by Bank
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			59
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			of Baroda as against Amrapali Silicon City Pvt. Ltd. and M/s. Ultra-Home
			<lb />
			Constructions Pvt. Ltd. There were legal impediments/force majeure
			<lb />
			conditions in completing the projects within the period given in the flat
			<lb />
			buyer agreement. The Allahabad High Court finally decided the matter in
			<lb />
			Gajraj Singh &amp; Ors. v. State of U.P. on 21.10.2011. The Patwari Village issue
			<lb />
			was pending before this Court till 2015. On 14.5.2015 this Court finally
			<lb />
			decided the matter in the case of Savitri Devi v. State of U.P. It was an
			<lb />
			order passed by the National Green Tribunal with respect to Okhla Bird
			<lb />
			Sanctuary which also hindered the work. Higher compensation was
			<lb />
			ordered to be paid by the Allahabad High Court in 2011. The period of
			<lb />
			litigation ought to have been treated as zero periods for the purpose of
			<lb />
			payment of dues by Noida and Greater Noida authorities. Amrapali Silicon
			<lb />
			City was affected on account of litigation and land acquisition issues. The
			<lb />
			work of Leisure Valley, Dream Valley, and Leisure Park were also affected.
			<lb />
			There was an issue of the approach road with the farmers with respect to
			<lb />
			Sapphire Housing Project. Other projects were also affected due to farmers&apos;
			<lb />
			agitation, want of proper roads, etc. The authority was required to give
			<lb />
			electricity, sewer and water connections. Proper facilities were not extended
			<lb />
			timely.
			<lb />
			46. It was further submitted on behalf of Amrapali Group that a High-
			<lb />
			Power Committee has been constituted by the State of U.P. A sum of Rs.
			<lb />
			2,715 crores are to be paid to the authorities including the interest and
			<lb />
			purchasable FSI costs. The outstanding of banks is Rs.985 crores. It was
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			submitted that the projects are viable in case some relief is granted
			<lb />
			towards land dues of authorities and dues of the banks. The joint
			<lb />
			inspection indicated that substantial construction had been carried out.
			<lb />
			The cost of construction to complete the launched projects, as per NBCC is
			<lb />
			Rs.6827 crores; whereas the cost as per Amrapali group is Rs.5630 crores.
			<lb />
			Calculation of NBCC is wrong. The projects are divided into 3 categories: (i)
			<lb />
			where the allottees were living; (ii) advanced stage of construction; and (iii)
			<lb />
			work is at a nascent stage. The amount defaulted by buyers is Rs.511
			<lb />
			crores, total receivables from them are Rs.5,332 crores. The encumbered
			<lb />
			and unencumbered assets can be sold to complete the project. The
			<lb />
			valuation worked out by the DRT comes to Rs.7,353 crores considering the
			<lb />
			maximum permissible FAR of 3.50. The order may be passed in respect of
			<lb />
			amounts due from Raipur and Bhubaneswar Housing Board which are
			<lb />
			recoverable from them to deposit in Court. Certain suggestions have also
			<lb />
			been made on behalf of Amrapali group for arranging the required funds.
			<lb />
			That home buyer may be directed to pay the cost. Unsold inventory of the
			<lb />
			launched projects on sale would generate Rs.1,922 crores. In case of any
			<lb />
			shortfall, there can be a sale of unencumbered assets of the company.
			<lb />
			Reputed builders may be engaged for undertaking the construction of the
			<lb />
			various projects. Amrapali has spent Rs.10,630 crores as against
			<lb />
			Rs.11,652 crores received from home buyers. As per the affidavits dated
			<lb />
			16.5.2018 and 3.12.2018, the total cash outflow is Rs.395 crores utilised
			<lb />
			by the group in the creation of assets whose current valuation as per DRT
			<lb />
			is Rs.1200 crores. The Noida and Greater Noida authorities have partial
			<lb />
		</body>

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			registration policies as provided in Building Regulations and the Act and an
			<lb />
			appropriate Committee may be constituted for supervision. Amrapali group
			<lb />
			shall extend all help in the building of the projects.
			<lb />
			47. With respect to the report of the Forensic Auditors, it has been
			<lb />
			submitted that there is no undervaluation in booking the flats. The value of
			<lb />
			flats depends upon the situation etc. as the flats were booked at different
			<lb />
			times, they have different prices as per the prevailing market. In certain
			<lb />
			cases, the customers took possession of various Towers in partially
			<lb />
			unfinished conditions and managed the pending work by themselves. In
			<lb />
			some projects, lifts were installed by the customers&apos; associations. In some
			<lb />
			other cases, interiors of the flats were finalised by the customers
			<lb />
			themselves. Amrapali group reduced the value of such flats in their books
			<lb />
			accordingly.
			<lb />
			48.
			<lb />
			With
			<lb />
			respect
			<lb />
			to
			<lb />
			other
			<lb />
			amounts
			<lb />
			recoverable
			<lb />
			from
			<lb />
			KMPA/relatives/Directors, as per the affidavit submitted by Shiv Priya on
			<lb />
			20.11.2018, Rs.4.3 crores were paid towards his taxes. The same has been
			<lb />
			adjusted against the salary due of Rs.4.4 crores from various Amrapali
			<lb />
			group of companies. Salary of Rs.1.6 crores is recoverable by Shiv Priya
			<lb />
			from Amrapali group of companies. As per the affidavit of Mr. Ajay Kumar,
			<lb />
			Rs.1.21 crores were paid by the company towards his taxes out of his
			<lb />
			outstanding salary up to 31.3.2015. Though his salary for the financial
			<lb />
			years 2016-18 is still to be mentioned in the books of accounts on account
			<lb />
			of his due salary. A sum of Rs.25 lakhs has been paid by him to Ultra
			<lb />

		<body>
			Home Construction Pvt. Ltd.; in addition, a sum of Rs.25 lakhs paid to
			<lb />
			Yogesh Chand is duly debited in his ledger and as mentioned in his
			<lb />
			affidavit.
			<lb />
			49. With respect to Amrapali Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., it was submitted
			<lb />
			that an advance to Directors of Rs.113.54 crores was used by the Directors
			<lb />
			to purchase shares of Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. Ideally, the shares
			<lb />
			should have been issued in the name of Amrapali Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
			<lb />
			The money moved from Amrapali Infrastructures Pvt. Ltd. to Ultra Home
			<lb />
			Construction Pvt. Ltd. Precast Factory&apos;s valuation is Rs.179 crores. Mr.
			<lb />
			Anil Kumar Sharma has surrendered the shares in favour of Amrapali
			<lb />
			Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. to the extent of INR 73.2 crores. Mr. Shiv Priya has
			<lb />
			surrendered the shares in Amrapali Infrastructure Pt. Ltd. during 2018-19
			<lb />
			of Rs.35.1 crores.
			<lb />
			50. With respect to Amrapali Hospitality Services Pvt. Ltd., it was
			<lb />
			submitted that the company gave Rs.6.62 crores to Directors as advances
			<lb />
			out of which Rs.6.55 crores were given to Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma and his
			<lb />
			family. In the financial year 2017-18, Rs.2.25 crores were used by Mr. Anil
			<lb />
			Kumar Sharma for payment of housing loan of Jay Pee Green Property.
			<lb />
			Rs.1.25 crores were deposited with this Court by way of Demand Draft,
			<lb />
			Rs.0.85 crores were paid to settle the bank loan of Leisure Valley Villa and
			<lb />
			Rs.0.5 crores were transferred for payment of TDS liability of Amrapali
			<lb />
			hospital.

		<body>
			51. With respect to Hi-Tech City Developers Pvt. Ltd., the Auditor&apos;s report
			<lb />
			indicates that a sum of Rs.4.24 crores was given as an advance to Mr. Anil
			<lb />
			Kumar Sharma in 2009-10 which was used by him for purchasing shares
			<lb />
			of Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. Ideally, the shares should have been
			<lb />
			issued in the name of Amrapali group of companies. No transfer of money
			<lb />
			was there. Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma had surrendered shares in favour of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., during the year 2018-19 but this has not
			<lb />
			been reflected in the books of the company. With respect to cash in hand,
			<lb />
			there is no consistency in the report of the auditors. Only Rs.9 crores were
			<lb />
			available in cash in various group companies. The entire amount was spent
			<lb />
			on payment of wages due to various labours at different times. With respect
			<lb />
			to other recoverable advanced to various parties amounting to Rs.234.31
			<lb />
			crores, the details are not available in the report. These advances are
			<lb />
			against genuine business transactions. There is a possibility that such
			<lb />
			expenses have not been booked and squared off.
			<lb />
			52. With respect to the diversion of home buyers amount to the extent of
			<lb />
			Rs.3,500 crores and bogus billing of Rs.1500-1600 crores, out of the total
			<lb />
			amount received from home buyers of Rs.11,652 crores would leave INR
			<lb />
			6,652 crores for carrying out the existing construction at sites. The total
			<lb />
			sum available for construction purposes comes to Rs.4,352 crores, after
			<lb />
			deducting the amount of payment to the authorities and banks of Rs.1,000
			<lb />
			crores and Rs.1,300 crores respectively. With respect to non-genuine
			<lb />
			purchases from suppliers, though a sum of Rs.554 crores was given to the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			64
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			income-tax authorities, on appeal the error had been corrected by the
			<lb />
			income-tax authorities. There was an error in the report of the forensic
			<lb />
			auditors. The report of the forensic auditors as to non-existing companies
			<lb />
			is also not correct. It is further submitted that Gaurisuta Infrasolution Pvt.
			<lb />
			Ltd., which manufactures PVC doors and windows had business
			<lb />
			transactions with Amrapali group, payment/advances were made to them.
			<lb />
			It is a fact that parties are related. It does not mean that all transactions
			<lb />
			are dubious. Law does not prevent such transactions. The short term and
			<lb />
			long-term loans to third parties were not for diverting loan funds and home
			<lb />
			buyer funds to group companies.
			<lb />
			53. With respect to Auditors&apos; list of 27 companies formed for the purpose
			<lb />
			of routing the cash of the companies, were formed before demonetisation.
			<lb />
			With respect to J.P. Morgan Property Mauritius Company-II, Amrapali
			<lb />
			Zodiac Developers Pvt. Ltd. transferred money to another company to buy-
			<lb />
			back stake in J.P. Morgan but did not do it directly as share buy-back
			<lb />
			rules did not permit such transactions. It may be maximum violations of
			<lb />
			the Companies Act but is not a diversion of money. With respect to FEMA,
			<lb />
			it is submitted that again it is a violation of ECB guidelines but again it
			<lb />
			was not a case of diversion of money. Money was needed for construction,
			<lb />
			therefore, arrangement with J.P. Morgan was made.
			<lb />
			54. With respect to doubt of Forensic Auditors as to the genuineness of
			<lb />
			interest paid by Amrapali Silicon City Pvt. Ltd. to IPFFI and claiming
			<lb />
			interest @ 17% which is very high, it was submitted that rate of interest
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			65
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			depends upon the money lending transactions and is not illegal or
			<lb />
			prohibited in law.
			<lb />
			55. With respect to charging for professional services and fee by
			<lb />
			Directors, it was stated that a person rendering professional services
			<lb />
			should have a membership of professional bodies and have some certificate
			<lb />
			of practice. A lot of companies pay a professional/consulting fee to
			<lb />
			outsiders to assist them in their business. Amrapali group has also paid
			<lb />
			salaries and consultation fees to Directors as they were providing their
			<lb />
			expertise and skill. Ultimately prayer had been made to evolve some
			<lb />
			mechanism for completion of housing projects.
			<lb />
			56. On behalf of Royal Golf Link City Projects Pvt. Ltd., it is submitted
			<lb />
			that a loan of Rs.50 crores or Rs.48,52,05,100 was paid by Ultra Home
			<lb />
			Constructions Pvt. Ltd. to Royal Golf. Interest @ 9% amounting to
			<lb />
			Rs.5,83,42,977 has been paid to Ultra Home. Subsequently, the agreement
			<lb />
			has been entered into to repay Rs.50,46,78,022 by 31.3.2017 or in lieu
			<lb />
			thereof 30 Villas have to be allotted by Royal Golf to Ultra Homes. This
			<lb />
			Court has attached 30 Villas allotted to Ultra Home. It is ready to give 30
			<lb />
			Villas by 30.4.2021 or to refund the amount of Rs.48,46,78,022 in 4 equal
			<lb />
			quarterly instalments in full and final settlement of all claims of Amrapali
			<lb />
			group.
			<lb />
			57. On behalf of Bank of Baroda, it has been submitted that Forensic
			<lb />
			Auditors have made adverse comments without any basis. Bank of Baroda
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			66
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			had deployed suitable methods to monitor the utilisation of funds. No
			<lb />
			diversion of funds was permitted by Bank of Baroda. Monitoring of the loan
			<lb />
			was done and before sanction of the loan, the net worth of the
			<lb />
			promoters/Directors of ASCPL was ascertained. Bank of Baroda relied
			<lb />
			upon a letter dated 29.7.2010 from Noida to ASCPL. The term loan
			<lb />
			agreement was executed amongst ASCPL, Bank of Baroda, Bank of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra and Oriental Bank of Commerce &quot;Consortium&quot; for a term loan
			<lb />
			of Rs.300 crores. After execution of due documents and deeds of corporate
			<lb />
			guarantee issued in favour of Bank of Baroda, corporate guarantees were
			<lb />
			submitted by Ultra Homes Construction, Jotindra Steels and Tubes Ltd.
			<lb />
			along with Vidhyashree Buildcon. Pvt. Ltd. RoC search report of guarantors
			<lb />
			was also obtained. NOC of Noida dated 21.2.2012 for mortgaging the
			<lb />
			project site to procure a term loan from the consortium was also obtained.
			<lb />
			A detailed project report was issued by Solomon Consulting Pvt. Ltd. There
			<lb />
			was the appointment of independent lender&apos;s Engineer and thereafter
			<lb />
			accounting was done, post-disbursal of loan by Bank of Baroda. The money
			<lb />
			was released on the basis of lenders Engineers advice of Rs.49 crores out of
			<lb />
			Rs.55 crores. Thus, there was no lack of due diligence and considering the
			<lb />
			progress of construction, steps had been taken by the Bank of Baroda to
			<lb />
			protect its interests after the account became NPA. Active steps were taken
			<lb />
			to recover the amount. The similar mechanism had been adopted for
			<lb />
			Amrapali Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. With respect to Ultra Homes Construction
			<lb />
			Pvt. Ltd., also a loan of Rs.75 crores was sanctioned out of which Rs.65.84
			<lb />
			crores were disbursed for the construction and development of an

			<lb />
			Knowledge Park-V, Greater Noida, which were executed by Mr. Anil Kumar
			<lb />
			Sharma, Mr. Ajay Kumar, Mr. Shiv Priya and Mr. Madan Mohan Sharma.
			<lb />
			Amrapali Zodiac Developers Pvt. Ltd. was granted a loan of Rs.75 crores. It
			<lb />
			was not utilised for payment of the cost of land or for payment of
			<lb />
			construction cost. The amount has been repaid and the account has been
			<lb />
			closed. The money may have been routed through various suppliers and
			<lb />
			contractors. The remittance of money is nothing but an example of due
			<lb />
			conduct of business. With respect to the release of the corporate guarantee
			<lb />
			of M/s. Jotindra Steel and Tubes Pvt. Ltd., it is submitted that they were
			<lb />
			unable to infuse share capital as required and seemed unable to do so in
			<lb />
			the future as well. The shares due to M/s. Jotindra Steel and Tubes Pvt.
			<lb />
			Ltd. were also allotted to M/s. Ultra-Homes Construction Pvt. Ltd. Thus,
			<lb />
			the Bank of Baroda granted the request for release of the corporate
			<lb />
			guarantee in favour of M/s. Jotindra Steel and Tubes Pvt. Ltd. Amrapali
			<lb />
			group had the right to mortgage the property as per the mortgage deed.
			<lb />
			There was no bank charge on the property mortgaged by Amrapali group.
			<lb />
			As per clause 15 of the mortgage deed, the buyer shall have no right after
			<lb />
			paying all amounts. The developer shall continue to have full authority over
			<lb />
			the flat unless a registered deed is executed in favour of the allottee. It is
			<lb />
			also submitted that the home buyers are not secured creditors. The home
			<lb />
			buyers were to acquire the premises on sub-lease basis which was never
			<lb />
			intended or stated anywhere that a sale would take place. The allottee shall
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			68
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			not have any lien or interest on the flat unless sub-lease deed is executed.
			<lb />
			Therefore, they are not secured creditors, they have no right, title or
			<lb />
			interest or lien on the basis of allotment from flat buyer agreement. It is
			<lb />
			further submitted that the agreement does not create any rights in
			<lb />
			praesenti with a promise to enter into a future agreement. It does not
			<lb />
			create any right, title, interest or claim in the immovable property. In the
			<lb />
			absence of registration of document under the Registration Act, no rights
			<lb />
			are created in the immovable property in question under section 49 of the
			<lb />
			Registration Act.
			<lb />
			58. With respect to RERA provisions, it has been submitted by Bank of
			<lb />
			Baroda that section 11(4) of RERA deals with the interaction between
			<lb />
			repayment to secured creditors and rights of allottees. Sub-section (h) of
			<lb />
			section 11(4) states that the promoter shall not create a mortgage or charge
			<lb />
			after an agreement to sell has been executed. Therefore, the promoter is
			<lb />
			permitted to create such mortgage or charge prior to the execution of an
			<lb />
			agreement to sell. Section 4(2)(1) of RERA requires the promoter to disclose
			<lb />
			the prior encumbrance to the real estate authority. Under section 34(b) it is
			<lb />
			required to publish and maintain a website of records. Section 19(4)(1) of
			<lb />
			RERA provides that if the promoter fails to complete or is unable to give
			<lb />
			possession of an apartment, plot or building, the rights of allottees are
			<lb />
			restricted to receive the compensation from the promoter. The rights of
			<lb />
			allottees under section 19 of RERA can be contrasted with the right of the
			<lb />
			mortgagee who secured creditors under section 58 of the Transfer of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			69
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Property Act, 1882. The RERA is restricted to protect the rights and
			<lb />
			interests of the allottees from the promoters and developers. RERA
			<lb />
			recognises and protects the rights of the lenders and does not in any
			<lb />
			manner take away any right under the existing statutes like the T.P. Act,
			<lb />
			SARFAESI, etc. RERA has not brought any change in the nature of the
			<lb />
			rights of home buyers. The Bank is entitled to receive its money along with
			<lb />
			interest in the event of failure to repay by builder/ promoter.
			<lb />
			IN RE: FORENSIC AUDITORS
			<lb />
			59. The Forensic Auditors have submitted their report running into eight
			<lb />
			volumes. It has been observed that the Amrapali Group was started in
			<lb />
			2003 by Mr. Madan Mohan Sharma. Later on, it was managed by his son
			<lb />
			Mr. Anil Sharma. He gradually expanded his team and Mr. Shiv Priya, Mr.
			<lb />
			Ajay Kumar, Mr. Nishant Mukul, Mr. Chander Wadhwa, Mr. Mohit Gupta,
			<lb />
			Mr. Adhikari Das, and others joined in. By 2010, the Amrapali Group was
			<lb />
			leading real estate development firms, promising to offer luxury and
			<lb />
			comfort. In the beginning, the Amrapali Group has constructed and
			<lb />
			completed certain projects and earned the goodwill of the general public in
			<lb />
			the real estate business. The Amrapali Group used unfair means to
			<lb />
			promote themselves. It made false promises to lure the public to invest in
			<lb />
			its projects, purposefully delayed construction, cheated home-buyers for
			<lb />
			the title of flats and trapped home-buyers in rental returns. The Amrapali
			<lb />
			Group floated several companies. The public invested their hard earned
			<lb />
			money in Amrapali projects and the shareholders used these funds to
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			70
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			infuse capital in other companies/entities. Home buyers were cheated by
			<lb />
			making false promises/claims for example selling of flats which were not
			<lb />
			even part of the master plan of projects or unapproved in the master plan,
			<lb />
			double booking of the same flat by different customers. The homebuyers
			<lb />
			funds were diverted to other companies/directors through payment of
			<lb />
			professional fees, by way of booking of bogus bills of Rs.837 crores, by
			<lb />
			selling flats as undervalued prices in book and received differential market
			<lb />
			value in cash, by paying commission and brokerage on bogus booking of
			<lb />
			flats and by way of granting inter-corporate deposits of Rs.3,000 crores to
			<lb />
			related entities and Rs.500 crores to unrelated entities/trusted partners for
			<lb />
			ultimately diverting funds to unapproved uses.
			<lb />
			SUMMARY OF REPORT OF FORENSIC AUDIT
			<lb />
			60. The summary of report submitted by Forensic Auditors in the Court
			<lb />
			is as under:
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			Brief Introduction
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group started its operations in the year 2003 in Delhi. It was
			<lb />
			started by Mr. Madan Mohan Sharma who managed it for a brief period.
			<lb />
			Thereafter the operations of the Group were managed by his son -Mr. Anil
			<lb />
			Sharma. Gradually, he expanded his team and Mr. Shiv Priya, Mr. Ajay
			<lb />
			Kumar, Mr. Nishant Mukul, Mr. Chander Wadhwa, Mr. Mohit Gupta, Mr.
			<lb />
			Adhikari Das and other trusted partners/executives joined in. The Group
			<lb />
			was into the business of construction of residential complexes, townships,
			<lb />
			offices, commercial complexes. The Group built good reputation in the
			<lb />
			public and launched several projects in various cities in India. By 2010,
			<lb />
			the Group was a leading real estate development firms in India and
			<lb />
			particular in North India, promising to offer luxury and comfort in every
			<lb />
			project that it takes up. Subsequently, Mr. Mahender Singh Dhoni became
			<lb />
			brand ambassador of the Group.
			<lb />
			To achieve good standing in the eyes of public, the Group used unfair
			<lb />
			means to promote themselves. The Group made false promises to lure
			<lb />
			public to invest in its projects, purposefully delayed construction, cheated
			<lb />
			homebuyers over title of flats, trapped homebuyers in rental returns, sold
			<lb />
			flats at exorbitantly low prices and recovered market price in cash from
			<lb />
			them, among other unfair means adopted by them. The Group floated
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			71
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			several companies through its directors, staff, trusted partners which were
			<lb />
			incorporated solely to divert homebuyers funds. The Group collaborated
			<lb />
			with external parties like JP Morgan in contravention of FEMA and
			<lb />
			distributed returns along with principal amount, even though it did not
			<lb />
			book gains within the business of the company. Similarly, it collaborated
			<lb />
			with several other third parties and invested in other projects and built a
			<lb />
			cycle of returns in the form of unaccounted cash. The Group treated
			<lb />
			moneys received from home buyers as its own capital and used this money
			<lb />
			for investing in exclusively personal purposes, for example in constructing
			<lb />
			Amrapali hospital, hotels, malls, making movies etc. The Group booked
			<lb />
			bogus expenses and routed funds to trusted partners. The Group also
			<lb />
			used homebuyers funds for building personal properties, investment in
			<lb />
			mutual funds, expenses in daughter&apos;s wedding, purchase of luxury cars,
			<lb />
			watches, building luxurious houses for directors etc. The Promoters
			<lb />
			diversified to different verticals i.e. Education, Entertainment (in making
			<lb />
			movies), FMCG, infrastructure, Shopping Malls, technology parks, hotel
			<lb />
			etc. from the diverted Home Buyers funds. The Promoters didn&apos;t invest any
			<lb />
			paisa in such verticals and the whole empire was created out of the
			<lb />
			diversion.
			<lb />
			The Promoters created a web of more than 150 companies (Page No. 16-19
			<lb />
			Volume I) for routing the funds and creating assets. About 100 Companies
			<lb />
			were under the supervision and control of promoters used mainly for the
			<lb />
			purpose of diversion of funds. The Directors and Shareholders of these
			<lb />
			Companies were benami and were the trusted junior employees of
			<lb />
			promoters. CFO and the Statutory Auditors.
			<lb />
			It is observed that the Company, i.e. management, CFO, the Statutory
			<lb />
			Auditors and key managerial persons deliberately and for reasons best
			<lb />
			known to them did not prepare the accounts till 31st March, 2018 or
			<lb />
			thereafter as nobody wanted to let anybody know where the funds moved
			<lb />
			from 31.3.2015 onwards. In absence of Book of Accounts, we are
			<lb />
			constrained to report that the management deliberately withdrew the Bank
			<lb />
			Balances for making payments to some person and brought down the
			<lb />
			huge bank balance to negligible amount.
			<lb />
			The management has diverted the Home Buyers&apos; funds from one Company
			<lb />
			to another Company in a very clever, pre-planned and clandestine
			<lb />
			manner. The management could not have done this without the full
			<lb />
			support of its CFO and the Statutory Auditors. As per the submissions
			<lb />
			made, many companies were controlled by CFO and the Statutory
			<lb />
			Auditors to which huge funds have been transferred. It can therefore, be
			<lb />
			easily said that both CFO and the Statutory Auditor were Master Mind
			<lb />
			behind these types of planning for diversion and the misuse of funds. It
			<lb />
			may be important to mention here that funds were transferred from one
			<lb />
			Company to another and to third and to fourth and so on thereby
			<lb />
			absolutely confusing any person to find out the real trail where the money
			<lb />
			has gone, since there are more than 100 Companies through which these
			<lb />
			funds have been routed over the period.

			HISTORY OF ALLEGATIONS
			<lb />
			Bank of Baroda and several other banks filed a petition before NCLT under

			process in the matter of Amrapali Group Companies.
			<lb />
			Homebuyers filed petition seeking construction and possession of around
			<lb />
			42000 flats booked in Amrapali Group
			<lb />
			On 6th September 2018, Supreme Court appointed Mr. P K Aggarwal and
			<lb />
			Mr. Ravi Bhatia as joint forensic auditors to audit into the matter.
			<lb />
			ACCOUNTING PACKAGE
			<lb />
			The group was using Tally till March, 2015 for all of its group companies.
			<lb />
			In April 2015, it introduced Far Vision an ERP which was not implemented
			<lb />
			properly. The opening balances were not properly entered.
			<lb />
			In November 2016, the group left half way Far vision and started recording
			<lb />
			partial transaction in tally.
			<lb />
			To avoid the traceability, of the transactions, the Promoters and CFO and
			<lb />
			Adhikari (G.M Accounts) recorded the financial transactions up to March
			<lb />
			2015 in Accounting Package tally, then shifted to FARVISION from April
			<lb />
			2015 and continued till March 2016, and thereafter partially recorded
			<lb />
			transaction in tally and a for a few companies in FARVISION and
			<lb />
			thereafter in tally. This was intentionally plan. The companies of the group
			<lb />
			stopped getting the annual accounts prepared and filing returns to Roc
			<lb />
			and Income tax.

			<lb />
			Non genuine purchases from suppliers
			<lb />
			Purchase bills have been accounted for in the books of accounts
			<lb />
			without receipt of physical goods and purchase bills have been
			<lb />
			accounted for of suppliers who do not exist. There was an Income Tax
			<lb />
			search and seizure on 9 th September, 2010 and 7 th August, 2013.
			<lb />
			During the search held on 7 th August, 2013, it was held by the Income
			<lb />
			Tax Authorities that purchases are being made from bogus suppliers
			<lb />
			without receiving the goods physically. The total amount of purchases
			<lb />
			from such suppliers as observed by the Income Tax department
			<lb />
			amounted to Rs.842.42 Crores approximately..
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			73
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			In order to confirm the genuineness of these suppliers and a few other
			<lb />
			suppliers we have sent written communication/ letters by speed post to
			<lb />
			them in order to confirm the transactions with the Amrapali Group of
			<lb />
			Companies. Most of these letters have been received back with the
			<lb />
			remarks &quot;No such firm exists at the specified address&quot;.
			<lb />
			In addition to above, there is no system of calling quotations for
			<lb />
			purchases and there is no internal control with respect to inventory. We
			<lb />
			have spotted out further certain non-genuine supplies as per details
			<lb />
			given below:
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			M/s B S Promotors
			<lb />
			There have been sales to M/s B S Promoters amounting to Rs. 21.15
			<lb />
			Crores during the period 2013-16 from one Company of Amrapali
			<lb />
			Group and the same goods were re-purchased into another Company of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group at a margin of 5% approximately.
			<lb />
			These transactions seem to be mere accommodation entries, where all
			<lb />
			purchase/ sales are recorded on a single day only. Further, it was also
			<lb />
			explained that M/s B S Promotors have made the sales against Bank
			<lb />
			Letter of Credit which has been discounted by them from their bankers.
			<lb />
			This seems to be a case of manipulation with the banks also since there
			<lb />
			is no movement of goods but entries within the Amrapali Group only.
			<lb />
			Further, it is observed the balance outstanding of INR 5.11 Crores due
			<lb />
			to the B S Promotors as on 31 st March, 2016, has been adjusted against
			<lb />
			payment made by home buyers directly to the B S Promotors and by
			<lb />
			allotting a flat to M/s B S Promotors. However, the authorized
			<lb />
			representative of the B S Promotor has refuted this fact vehemently and
			<lb />
			asserted that it has not received any payment from the home buyers of
			<lb />
			the Amrapali Group, nor it has received any flat. Thus, the flat allotted
			<lb />
			to B S Promoters on paper needs to be attached and put to sale.
			<lb />
			Moreover, a sum of INR 1.06 crores as 5% of the margin earned by M/s
			<lb />
			B S Promoters needs to be recovered from him as they have neither
			<lb />
			received goods nor supplied any good and only acted as Billing agent for
			<lb />
			which they need not be claiming INR 1.06 crores as their margin.
			<lb />
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Kanodia Cements
			<lb />
			While scrutinizing the purchase bills of this supplier it was noted that
			<lb />
			the slips of Weigh Bridge in the case of purchase of Bajri trucks show
			<lb />
			time interval of 4-5 Minutes only. This doesn&apos;t seem to be possible that
			<lb />
			a full truck of Bajri takes only 4-5 minutes to enter into the site and
			<lb />
			come back on the weigh bridge again with empty truck in 4-5 minutes.
			<lb />
			No satisfactory explanation has been furnished by the management
			<lb />
			regarding this issue. Sample of such instances have been enclosed

			As these bills of Kanodia Cements are prima facie held to be bogus, the
			<lb />
			entire sum of INR 11.69 Crores booked as purchases from Kanodia
			<lb />
			Cements should be recovered from them or from the Management for
			<lb />
			inflating their purchase by debiting bogus invoices.
			<lb />
			Bogus expense and cash surrendered in income tax search
			<lb />
			Cash has been surrendered by the Amrapali group in the first Income
			<lb />
			Tax search conducted on 9 th September, 2010. No source of this cash
			<lb />
			has been explained by the management.
			<lb />
			According to the Balance sheet of Amrapali Sapphire Developers Private
			<lb />
			Limited examined by us, cash surrendered is shown as miscellaneous
			<lb />
			income in the profit and loss account during 2010-11 amounting to
			<lb />
			Rs.1.39 Crores.
			<lb />
			It is further submitted that in the second search conducted by Income
			<lb />
			tax Authorities on 7 th August, 2013, the Amrapali group had
			<lb />
			surrendered an additional income of Rs.125 crores.
			<lb />
			Both these facts clearly depict that Amrapali group was having inflow of
			<lb />
			unaccounted cash collected from either the Home Buyers or collected
			<lb />
			cash from Bogus purchases made or by advancing money to various
			<lb />
			parties and taking cash from them.
			<lb />
			While scrutinizing the Audited Financial Statements of the Companies
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			75
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			for the Financial Year 2013-14, it is observed that no additional income
			<lb />
			has been shown. There is only jugglery of accounting transactions
			<lb />
			where sales have been shown by way of part completion method and the
			<lb />
			relevant cost is also debited to this part completion sale by changing the
			<lb />
			Accounting Method which was being followed by the Amrapali Group of
			<lb />
			companies in the earlier years. This method of accounting was changed
			<lb />
			for 2 financial years only i.e. for Financial Year 2012-13 and Financial
			<lb />
			Year 2013-14. This method was changed just to make adjustment in
			<lb />
			accordance with the letter of surrender. In fact, there is no surrender of
			<lb />
			additional income, it only amounts to preponement of sale being shown
			<lb />
			in these years instead of it in the later years.
			<lb />
			Cash has also been surrendered in the first search conducted on 9th
			<lb />
			September, 2010 and no source of this cash has been explained by the
			<lb />
			management. This clearly explains that there was flow of un-accounted
			<lb />
			cash from various sources to the Amrapali Group of Companies.
			<lb />
			A note was also stated in the Audited Financial Statements for the
			<lb />
			financial year 2010-11 as follows:
			<lb />
			&quot;Note 6 (A) During the F.Y. 2010-11 Income Tax Search &amp; Seizure
			<lb />
			operation conducted by the Income Tax Department on the company and
			<lb />
			company has surrendered a total income of Rs. 13,893,500 i.e. Rs.
			<lb />
			10,043,500 for the F.Y. 2009-10 and Rs. 3,850,000 for the F.Y. 2010-11.
			<lb />
			Accordingly, the total income includes the above said income.&quot;
			<lb />
			Thus, it is can be easily inferred that the company has been regularly
			<lb />
			taking cash from its various home buyers but not recording these cash
			<lb />
			entries in the Books of Accounts. (Volume -I Page No. 205)
			<lb />
			It is unclear how the surrender of Rs.125 crore made during the
			<lb />
			Financial Year 2013-14 has been accepted by the Income Tax
			<lb />
			Authorities. In fact, no additional income has been shown on this
			<lb />
			search.
			<lb />
			Moreover, against the additions relating to Bogus Purchases made in
			<lb />
			the Assessment order for the Financial Year 2013-14, the Commissioner
			<lb />
			of Income Tax (Appeal), Central Circle has deleted all these additions.
			<lb />
			We are informed by the management that no further appeal has been
			<lb />
			preferred by the department before the Income tax Appellate Tribunal
			<lb />
			as they have no idea of the same so far.
			<lb />
			The bills booked and payments made were just accommodation entries.
			<lb />
			Many of the parties are not traceable and when we requested the
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group Management to produce the persons/entities to
			<lb />
			ascertain the veracities of the claims, they didn&apos;t co-operate.
			<lb />
			It appears Prima-Facie that the bogus invoices were booked and cash
			<lb />
			was taken from these parties. We are of the opinion that if we confront
			<lb />
			the recipient of the purported charges then last recipient would flatly
			<lb />
			deny.
			<lb />
			It is pertinent to note that Shri Ajay Kumar Aggarwal of BSBK Group in
			<lb />
			a statement recorded under section 132(4) of the Income Tax Act has
			<lb />
			admitted that he provided accommodation/bogus bills.

			Till the date of writing this report the amount so identified for bogus
			<lb />
			bills is Rs.837.2 crore. Further, the supplies by Jotindra Steel and
			<lb />
			Tubes and Mauria Udyog Ltd, having common directors with Amrapali
			<lb />
			Group Companies, are prima-facie bogus by nature and are under
			<lb />
			examination amounting to Rs.450 crore. (Refer Annexure No. S 4 Page
			<lb />
			no 2827 Supplementary report).
			<lb />
			Land Development Charges
			<lb />
			A sum of Rs.7.3 crore has been debited to this account on 31st March,
			<lb />
			2013 for which the supporting relevant documents are not made
			<lb />
			available to us for our verification. This amount needs to be recovered
			<lb />
			from the Directors as there is no supporting evidence or voucher and it
			<lb />
			is just a book entry.
			<lb />
			Total bogus expenses as on date of report have been ascertained to be
			<lb />
			Rs. 842.42 crore.
			<lb />
			Double booking of expense
			<lb />
			It has been observed that brokerage amounting to Rs 0.25 crore was
			<lb />
			paid twice; once to HDFC Realty and again to Mr. Alok Ranjan c/o SSS
			<lb />
			Enterprises on account of same flat bookings in Amrapali Sapphire
			<lb />
			Developers Private Limited during the FY 2019-10. Mr. Sanjay Kumar,
			<lb />
			proprietor of SSS Enterprises has already conveyed to GM Finance of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group by way of speed post that fake bill for brokerage has
			<lb />
			been raised under his name by Mr. Alok Ranjan. This amount of
			<lb />
			Rs.0.25 crore should be recovered from Alok Ranjan/ the Management
			<lb />
			for booking of double expense. (Volume 1 -Page no 213)
			<lb />
			Unsupported Cash Payments
			<lb />
			The Company has made unusual cash payments by transferring the
			<lb />
			cash to the site cash during the financial year 2016-17 by way of
			<lb />
			vouchers which are not supported/authenticated by the site cash in
			<lb />
			charge. It seems that all these entries have been manipulated to use the
			<lb />
			cash to decrease the balance as on 08/11/2016 being the date of
			<lb />
			demonetization. Some instances are as under:

			The above are only from one company which is tip of the iceberg and
			<lb />
			actual amounts may be much higher.
			<lb />
			Further cash payments are being made to number of parties amounting
			<lb />
			to Rs.20,000 or less which are not supported by payee&apos;s receipts on
			<lb />
			daily basis. Thus, these payments are not genuine. (Volume I-Page 223)
			<lb />
			It is observed that the cash balance available on 8 th November 2016 was
			<lb />
			partly deposited into bank and huge amounts were not deposited into
			<lb />
			bank and was used for payments to staff, suppliers, vendors etc. It is
			<lb />
			worthwhile to mention that it was not permitted to use Specified Bank
			<lb />
			Notes (SBN-500, 1000 denomination Notes) for making payments to
			<lb />
			these parties.
			<lb />
			Further there has been an Income tax Survey on 17/11/2016. We
			<lb />
			understand Income Tax Authorities have recorded the statement of
			<lb />
			Directors and also taken the Inventory of Cash in hand as on that date.
			<lb />
			A copy of the statement recorded and detail of inventory of Cash in
			<lb />
			hand is not made available to us.
			<lb />
			Gold bar purchased from Yashika Diamonds
			<lb />
			It has been observed that the Group Companies purchased Gold bar,
			<lb />
			other forms of gold worth Rs.5.88 crore. The same has been booked as
			<lb />
			festival expenses. This does not seem to be a normal business
			<lb />
			transaction but in the nature of personal expenses. Thus, this amount
			<lb />
			should be recovered from the management of the company.
			<lb />
			5.
			<lb />
			Negligence and non-monitoring by bankers
			<lb />
			In view of our detailed report attached, we wish to submit here that the
			<lb />
			whole process of transfer of funds from one Company to another
			<lb />
			Company to a third Company and so on and so forth on the same dates
			<lb />
			would not have been possible without active support by the Bankers.
			<lb />
			The Bankers, in our opinion, turned a Blind Eye to the various transfer
			<lb />
			of funds from one account to another for reasons best known to them.
			<lb />
			They didn&apos;t inquire the huge transfer of funds from various accounts
			<lb />
			which were being routed every day. Had they been slightly more vigilant
			<lb />
			to monitor and control transfer of funds, the Management would have
			<lb />
			not dared to launder the money from one Company to another
			<lb />
			according to their whims and fancies and the Bankers are solely
			<lb />
			responsible for the negligence on their part.
			<lb />
			Banks did not do any monitoring that whether the funds disbursed
			<lb />
			were used for approved purposes or not. The loan sanctioned as term
			<lb />
			loan were diverted on the very same day of receipt. The land payment
			<lb />
			were not paid etc.
			<lb />
			Bank of Maharashtra -Term Loan has been released by transferring the
			<lb />
			amount to the Current account during the financial year 2009-10 to
			<lb />
			2012-13. There has been no monitoring by the bank to ensure the end
			<lb />
			use of utilization of the funds.
			<lb />
			This amount was paid from the Current account for other than
			<lb />
			business activities of this Company.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			78
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			It is observed that there was no monitoring done by the officials of Bank
			<lb />
			of Maharashtra, Andhra Bank and other banks by releasing of term
			<lb />
			loan to the Company. Even basic checks as required by the Bank were
			<lb />
			forgone and not ensured by the Bank Officials regarding the end
			<lb />
			utilization of the term loan funds for the purpose for which they were
			<lb />
			granted. It seems that the Bank officials overlooked all these important
			<lb />
			aspects and granted these loans to them without going into any
			<lb />
			technical requirements as relating to release of Term Loan facilities to a
			<lb />
			borrower.
			<lb />
			The banks acted as mute spectator to unapproved
			<lb />
			diversion which was almost happening evidently in all banking
			<lb />
			transactions.
			<lb />
			Optionally Convertible Debentures
			<lb />
			ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company Limited had given a sum
			<lb />
			of INR 74 crores approximately on account of debentures issued by
			<lb />
			Amrapali Sapphire Developers Private Limited during the financial year
			<lb />
			2011-12. These debentures carried interest rate @ 17% Per annum.
			<lb />
			There has been a gross non-compliance of Investors cum-shareholders
			<lb />
			agreement dated 16th Day of December, 2010 with respect to following:
			<lb />
			a.
			<lb />
			Non appointment of directors

			Non operation of bank account by joint signatory of investor
			<lb />
			c.
			<lb />
			Non utilization of funds as per clause no. 7.5 of Investment cum
			<lb />
			Shareholders Agreement dated 16th December, 2010.
			<lb />
			d.
			<lb />
			Sale of flats at less than Rs 3,420 per square feet of saleable area
			<lb />
			and many other clauses of this agreement neither followed nor

			<lb />
			It is very clear that a Debenture Subscription Agreement and
			<lb />
			Investment cum Shareholders Agreement both dated 16 th day
			<lb />
			December, 2010 were merely sham documents which were never
			<lb />
			complied with and both i.e. Amrapali group of Companies and ICICI
			<lb />
			Prudential Asset Management Company Limited were in
			<lb />
			connivance with each other in diversion of funds for non-specified
			<lb />
			purposes.
			<lb />
			Foreign investment
			<lb />
			The company has received the sum of Rs. 140 Crores during the
			<lb />
			financial year 2012-13 from IPFFI Singapore PTE Limited under Foreign
			<lb />
			Direct Investment Scheme. As per FEMA rules this amount was to be
			<lb />
			invested in Real Estate construction projects only.
			<lb />
			The amount received in Axis Bank of Rs.85 Crores was transferred to
			<lb />
			Amrapali Centurian Park Pvt. Ltd. (ACPPL) as under:
			<lb />
			On 7.8.2012
			<lb />
			-
			<lb />
			Rs.5 Crores
			<lb />
			On 8.8.2012
			<lb />
			-
			<lb />
			Rs.50 Crores
			<lb />
			On 18.8.2012
			<lb />
			-
			<lb />
			Rs.30 Crores
			<lb />
			-------------------
			<lb />
			Total =
			<lb />
			Rs. 85 Crores
			<lb />
			------------------
			<lb />
			ACPPL on receiving Rs.85 Crores, allotted Equity Shares worth Rs. 85
			<lb />
			lakhs to ASCPL and balance Rs.84.15 Crores were treated as Share
			<lb />
			Premium Account. There is no Valuation Report available as to how
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			79
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			this share premium of Rs. 84.15 Crores has been calculated. This
			<lb />
			transfer of fund by ASCPL to ACPPL is absolutely violative of FDI Rules
			<lb />
			and Agreement.
			<lb />
			The Second amount received in BOB Escrow Account was transferred
			<lb />
			from 8.8.2012 to 28.9.2012 on various dates in the Account of BOB,
			<lb />
			Sansad Marg Branch, and New Delhi and also used for payment of
			<lb />
			Term Loan Instalments of OBC and Bank of Maharashtra for repayment
			<lb />
			of their Term Loan instalments.
			<lb />
			It will therefore, be observed from the above, that the Company
			<lb />
			(ASCPL) did not use money for the project for which it was received
			<lb />
			from IPFII Singapore but transferred Rs.85 Crores to Amrapali
			<lb />
			Centurian Park Pvt. Ltd. and Rs.55 Crores to repay Bank Loan
			<lb />
			Instalments and Repay the outstanding creditors provided for in
			<lb />
			the books and standing in the books. The said payments made by
			<lb />
			ASCPL are, therefore, in contravention of FDI norms and rules and
			<lb />
			for which the money was brought in India.
			<lb />
			Moreover, ASCPL has paid interest of Rs.58.81 Crores @ 17%
			<lb />
			(which is a highly abnormal rate) so far to IPFII, Singapore during
			<lb />
			the last 3 years.
			<lb />
			-
			<lb />
			Year 31.3.2013
			<lb />
			Rs.14.41 Crores Paid
			<lb />
			-
			<lb />
			Year 31.3.2014
			<lb />
			Rs.22.20 Crores Paid
			<lb />
			-
			<lb />
			Year 31.3.2015
			<lb />
			Rs.22.20 Crores Paid
			<lb />
			----------------
			<lb />
			Total = Rs.58.81 Crores
			<lb />
			----------------
			<lb />
			a) It is very clear that all such violations are being made with the
			<lb />
			knowledge of the IPFII Singapore and they are in Connivance with the
			<lb />
			ASCPL.
			<lb />
			b) As per Schedule 4 of the agreement CCD&apos;s (Compulsory Convertible
			<lb />
			Debenture) were subject to the following terms and conditions.
			<lb />
			1)
			<lb />
			On expiry of 5 years from the date of allotment, the CCD shell
			<lb />
			be fully monetarily and compulsorily converted into class B
			<lb />
			shares of the company
			<lb />
			2)
			<lb />
			The CCD&apos;s shall be converted into such number of class B
			<lb />
			shares arrived that by dividing the aggregate face value of
			<lb />
			CCD&apos;s by Rs.2,734.30.
			<lb />
			But these CCD&apos;s were not converted into class B shares as per
			<lb />
			agreement but entered into another agreement to extend the term
			<lb />
			of CCD&apos;s from 5 years to 7 years. By this way , The fund has
			<lb />
			continued to be a creditor otherwise after conversion to equity, it
			<lb />
			will not be eligible for interest and principal.
			<lb />
			Current liabilities not payable
			<lb />
			Security deposits from contractors and intercorporate deposits accepted
			<lb />
			from non group companies are in the nature of unsecured loans. There
			<lb />
			have been no business transactions with the company except movement
			<lb />
			of funds. The list of such liabilities is under preparation which are not
			<lb />
			payable.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			80
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Inter-corporate deposits accepted by the Group are Non-Interest-
			<lb />
			bearing unsecured loans. There are no business transactions with these
			<lb />
			companies. It is not understood as to why a person will give interest free
			<lb />
			loans without any considerations. Thus, we are of the view that these
			<lb />
			are accommodation entry only in lieu of consideration given to them
			<lb />
			indirectly by the management.
			<lb />
			Hence, we are of the view that all the aforesaid amounts are not
			<lb />
			payable.
			<lb />
			In our opinion, this is a case of Money Laundering as the generic term
			<lb />
			of Money Laundering is defined to describe the process by which
			<lb />
			Criminals disguise the original ownership and control the proceeds of
			<lb />
			the criminal conduct by making such proceeds to have derived from a
			<lb />
			legitimate source.
			<lb />
			Money Laundering is the process of concealing the origin of money
			<lb />
			obtained illegally by passing it through a complex sequence of Banking
			<lb />
			transfers or commercial transactions. The main process is accounting
			<lb />
			for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement
			<lb />
			agencies. In the instant case too, Amrapali Group of Companies have
			<lb />
			defied all laws to transfer small and big amounts from one account to
			<lb />
			another to a third and so on and so forth on a single day with the
			<lb />
			connivance of the Bank officials and financial institution officials and
			<lb />
			thereby Committed act of Money Laundering on a large scale.
			<lb />
			6.
			<lb />
			Lands allotted to consortium and flats sold to homebuyers
			<lb />
			Several companies were formed with consortium partners which were
			<lb />
			just dummy companies and were part and parcel of Amrapali group. To
			<lb />
			comply with the condition of minimum 3 partners, these companies
			<lb />
			were created in the names of office boys and peons. Technically the
			<lb />
			allotments at the initial stage itself were void ab-initio. In most of the
			<lb />
			companies, the amount received from homebuyers was sufficiently more
			<lb />
			than the amount spent on construction and for payment of land. Had
			<lb />
			the promoters paid amount received from homebuyers to the authorities
			<lb />
			on time there would not have been any liability of land dues. Further
			<lb />
			there was no need to avail any loan from banks, Private equity funds as
			<lb />
			well as from investors. The sole objective of taking loan was to divert
			<lb />
			the funds to other ventures to create assets in the name of family
			<lb />
			members, make movies, to satisfy the ambitious desires of family
			<lb />
			members and to build hospital. Villas were bought at tourist
			<lb />
			destinations for fun at the expense of middle class and low income
			<lb />
			group peoples abodes. Many parties joined them in the looting of hard
			<lb />
			earned money of homebuyers to take their share of the cake in the form
			<lb />
			of unbelievable return on investment, profits, land, FSI and flats and
			<lb />
			facilities at throwaway prices. Bogus expenses were booked and the
			<lb />
			promoters were having no fear of the law of the land. They could
			<lb />
			execute many transactions of transfer of properties, booking of
			<lb />
			expenses, funds transfer, even when the petition was accepted and was
			<lb />
			pending for disposal before the Honourable Supreme Court. Companies
			<lb />
			in which land was allotted to consortium partners are as under:

			<lb />
			The intention of Amrapali Group was to divert funds to other
			<lb />
			projects/income sources in the name of family members of the promoter
			<lb />
			and the trusted employees, friends of the promoters as well of the
			<lb />
			executives, auditors and their relatives. For this purpose, several
			<lb />
			companies were incorporated for routing funds. These companies did
			<lb />
			not have any material transaction as per the main object for which they
			<lb />
			were incorporated and did not have business since their incorporation.
			<lb />
			These companies did not have any employees also. These companies are

			Amrapali Spring Valley Pvt Ltd-the company is created for
			<lb />
			diversion of funds and Rs.186 crore was diverted from Amrapali Smart
			<lb />
			City Pvt Ltd to buy shares of Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd and
			<lb />
			shareholders are promoter directors without doing any investments.
			<lb />
			Most of the above companies will qualify to be NBFC, which was
			<lb />
			reported neither by the management nor by the statutory auditors
			<lb />
			(except Jhamb Finance &amp; Leasing Pvt Ltd). It is recommended that RBI
			<lb />
			shall investigate the affairs and compliances of the above companies.
			<lb />
			Amrapali Media Vision Pvt Ltd was also incorporated with a purpose
			<lb />
			to route funds for making movies to satisfy the ambitious desires of
			<lb />
			directors/family members. Most of the marketing and advertisement
			<lb />
			business of the group companies was given to the company with a profit
			<lb />
			margin on the cost. The group could have done this advertisement
			<lb />
			directly. But because there was need to make movies, the funds were
			<lb />
			diverted to the company directly in the form of loan as well by availing
			<lb />
			the services indirectly from these companies. The Company was freely
			<lb />
			availing funds of homebuyers from other group Companies in the form
			<lb />
			of ICD and spent it on making movies.
			<lb />
			Hawthrone Intellect Management Solutions Pvt Ltd -Company was
			<lb />
			providing Management Consultancy Services (Recruitment Services)
			<lb />
			and taking nominal professional fee. In turn, the Company has
			<lb />
			incurred more expenses in the last few years on account of Salary,
			<lb />
			Wages and other administrative expenses thereby resulting in net loss
			<lb />
			to the Company which has accumulated to INR 2.33 Crores as on
			<lb />
			31.03.2015.
			<lb />
			All these entries seem to be in nature of dubious entries and no voucher
			<lb />
			are available. This amount of loss of 2.33 Crores needs to be recovered
			<lb />
			from the Directors as they have wiped of the amount of the Home
			<lb />
			Buyers funds diverted as Home Buyers Money to the Company.
			<lb />
			Apart from the above companies, there were several companies which

			MannatBuildcraft Private Limited -bought shareholding from JP
			<lb />
			Morgan in Amrapali Zodiac developers Pvt Ltd.
			<lb />
			Serious Observation
			<lb />
			Our investigation reveals that this company has been used to
			<lb />
			perpetuate a fraud enabling JP Morgan Investments to sell its shares of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Zodiac Pvt. Ltd. to other Group Companies of Amrapali group
			<lb />
			namely, RudrakshInfracity Pvt. Ltd. and Neelkanth Buildcraft Pvt. Ltd.
			<lb />
			at a valuation amounting to INR 140 crores which is not justified. This
			<lb />
			company has been used as a tool to transfer the money to other
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group companies. The following persons seems to be involved
			<lb />
			in this organized fraud:
			<lb />
			i. Amrapali Zodiac Developers Pvt. Ltd.
			<lb />
			ii. RudrakshInfracity Pvt. Ltd.
			<lb />
			iii. Neelkanth Pvt. Ltd.
			<lb />
			iv. JP Morgan Investments
			<lb />
			v. MannatBuildcraft Private Limited
			<lb />
			vi. HDFC Bank
			<lb />
			Chander Wadhwa, Adhikari dash and Anil Mittal incorporated 27
			<lb />
			Additional companies identified so far, which may be many more, and
			<lb />
			became consortium partners from the funds of the home buyers. In the
			<lb />
			process, they appointed peons and junior employees of auditors office
			<lb />
			as directors who were totally unaware of the transactions. These
			<lb />
			companies were used for depositing cash during demonetisation. The
			<lb />
			companies were formed/acquired for routing funds and were not in any
			<lb />
			business. These were sham companies whose share capital was mostly
			<lb />
			subscribed in cash and the transfer of shares was also in cash leaving
			<lb />
			no audit trail.
			<lb />
			9.
			<lb />
			Misuse of funds by directors involved in scam
			<lb />
			The directors and executives colluded with each other and diverted
			<lb />
			homebuyers funds. Directors received huge amount of money in the
			<lb />
			form of salary as well as professional fee, both together. A person could
			<lb />
			have been either in whole time employment of the company or render
			<lb />
			services as consultant. However, a person cannot enjoy salary income
			<lb />
			and earn professional income at the same time and also both cannot be
			<lb />
			earned at the same time from same company. But directors of Amrapali
			<lb />
			group withdrew sums using all possible ways, be it salary, professional
			<lb />
			fee, reimbursement of expenses, use of luxury cars or loans and
			<lb />
			advances to self/relatives/self controlled entities/trusted partners or
			<lb />
			booking of bills of self controlled entities/trusted partners.
			<lb />
			Further professional fee was booked without any agreement or proof of
			<lb />
			service. It had no correlation with the amount of work done by
			<lb />
			the directors. Professional fee was booked as per wish and desire of
			<lb />
			directors and did not have any fair basis. There were standing
			<lb />
			instructions to transfer company funds to the individual directors bank
			<lb />
			accounts when the balance was reaching to the specified set minimum
			<lb />
			balance limit.
			<lb />
			The Professional fee paid to the directors, relatives of directors, and
			<lb />
			senior managers was a unique way of diverting money. Huge amounts
			<lb />
			were paid without any agreements at the whims and fancies of the
			<lb />
		</body>

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			directors and managers. Moreover it was tax free and the tax liability
			<lb />
			was discharged by another group company. The whole of professional
			<lb />
			fee received by the directors (as stated hereunder) is recoverable from
			<lb />
			them. (Volume -II, Page no 416-417).
			<lb />
			Professional fee was under disclosed to the tune of is Rs.33.4 crore
			<lb />
			(Anil Kumar Sharma 8.75 cr + Shiv Priya 24.65 cr) in affidavits filed on
			<lb />
			3 rd Dec 2018 (Volume -II, Page no 414-415). The Difference was found
			<lb />
			of from the affidavit file and the tax returns.
			<lb />
			It shall be noted that directors did not share company wise receipts in
			<lb />
			the affidavit and also books of accounts of directors were not provided.
			<lb />
			Directors along with their trusted partners and relatives cheated and
			<lb />
			did criminal breach of trust with the home buyers. They transferred the
			<lb />
			funds from the projects to the companies which were closely held by
			<lb />
			the directors, their family members and/or by their trusted associates.
			<lb />
			The objective was to create assets in the closely held companies and
			<lb />
			leave the home buyers on the road. For example, Eklavya Building
			<lb />
			Solutions Pvt Ltd acquired property in Goa amounting to is Rs.2 crore
			<lb />
			through funds received from Amrapali group, 27 other companies
			<lb />
			further invested Amrapali funds in Amrapali projects (For example
			<lb />
			Many Flats in IT Park at Greater Noida);
			<lb />
			The directors spent homebuyers funds on wedding of daughter of
			<lb />
			director, foreign travels, expensive watches, jewellery, purchasing
			<lb />
			luxury cars for use by directors. The homebuyers funds were also used
			<lb />
			for investment in mutual funds, creating personal properties , payment
			<lb />
			of housing loans, investment in shares &amp; securities. The directors
			<lb />
			created discreet projects for personal income for example In the name of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Hospitality a hotel at Deogarh was constructed out of funds
			<lb />
			received from homebuyers without their knowledge of it. They used
			<lb />
			homebuyers funds in the form of construction of assets for other
			<lb />
			projects, examples constructed mall at Muzzafarpur, Bareilly etc, Hotel
			<lb />
			at Deogarh, Bareilly, Hospital at Noida etc.

			Funds transferred from Amrapali group of companies was withdrawn in
			<lb />
			cash from personal accounts of directors and diverted to undisclosed
			<lb />
			people. In case of Anil Kumar Sharma, it is seen that an amount of is
			<lb />
			Rs.10.38 crore was withdrawn from June 2008 to May 2012 within a
			<lb />
			few days of transfer to bank account of Anil Kumar Sharma in Bank of
			<lb />
			Maharashtra. Several times, description of source of receipt or person to
			<lb />
			whom payment was made were not clear and such sources or
			<lb />
			application could not be identified.
			<lb />
			Several companies were incorporated to create assets or to hold
			<lb />
			investment in the group companies or outside the group companies
			<lb />
			having assets. The promoter directors or their family members became
			<lb />
			the shareholders in these companies without investing any paisa.
			<lb />
			Homebuyer funds were diverted to these companies and then these
			<lb />
			companies bought shares from the funds so diverted in the companies
			<lb />
			having assets for example Noida hospital in Amrapali Healthcare Pvt
			<lb />
			Ltd, 5 star hotel in Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd, Institute of hotel
			<lb />
			management in Noida Texfab Pvt Ltd etc.
			<lb />
			Investment from JP Morgan and other funds availed for the purpose of
			<lb />
			construction which were not required at all because the funds paid by
			<lb />
			homebuyer were in most of the cases were higher than the cost of
			<lb />
			construction and land payments, were diverted on the day of receipt
			<lb />
			itself to the closely held companies and to the companies created for the
			<lb />
			sole purpose for using them as a conduit for diversion and to the

			suppliers of bogus supplies. It is very surprising that when funds were
			<lb />
			borrowed a high rate of interest was paid ranging from 14 -18% to so
			<lb />
			called investors and the same investors were given loans to their group
			<lb />
			companies without charging any interest. In such a scenario, the
			<lb />
			possibility of taking cash in the form of interest cannot be ruled out.
			<lb />
			Directors sold number of flats at low prices as compared to the prices
			<lb />
			existing on or near to those dates and on which rates sales were made
			<lb />
			to other home buyers. It is further submitted that some of the flats have
			<lb />
			been sold even at rates as low as is Rs.1,000 -is Rs.1,400 per square
			<lb />
			feet which is even lower than the cost of construction. Possibility of
			<lb />
			taking cash outside the books of accounts cannot be ruled out.

			Sunil Kumar and Sunita Kumari (wife of Sunil Kumar)
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			While scrutinizing the Accounts of Gaurisuta Infrasolution Private
			<lb />
			Limited in which Mr. Sunil Kumar was the Director, it was observed by
			<lb />
			us that bogus commission of Rs.1.07 crore was booked. This amount
			<lb />
			of Rs.1.07 crore should be recovered from Mr. Sunil Kumar.
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			A sum of Rs.0.50 crore has also been paid as Salary to Mrs.
			<lb />
			Sunita Kumari in M/s Gaurisuta Infrasolution Private Limited which is
			<lb />
			not genuine as per detailed report given in the case of M/s Gaurisuta
			<lb />
			Infrasolution Private Limited. This Amount of Rs.0.50 crore should also
			<lb />
			be recovered from Mrs. Sunita Kumari.
			<lb />
			Mr. Sudhir Kumar Choudhary
			<lb />
			He is director in Amrapali Biotech India Private Limited &amp; Gaurisuta
			<lb />
			Infrasolution Private Limited. As per his statement recorded, he was
			<lb />
			forced to become the director in first week of august 2018 with effect
			<lb />
			from 06th July 2018.
			<lb />
			We are of the view that this planning has been done by the Amrapali
			<lb />
			Management after the order of the Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court to accept the
			<lb />
			resignation of Mrs. Seema Kumari Wife of Sunil Kumar from the
			<lb />
			Directorship and to appoint Mr. Sudhir Kumar Choudhary as the
			<lb />
			director of the company.
			<lb />
			It was further explained by him that he was a mere employee only and
			<lb />
			by virtue of threat by the Amrapali Group of Companies, he was forced
			<lb />
			to become the Director of Amrapali Infrasolution Private Limited.
			<lb />
			Apart from above specific points, it shall be noted that we had got
			<lb />
			access to the email of the Accounts department of Amrapali Group of
			<lb />
			Companies with Id accounts@amrapali.in for a short period after
			<lb />
			interrogation from an Ex-employee. We could download few instances of
			<lb />
			Cash transactions which are enclosed as a sample in Annexure 26-B.
			<lb />
			The access to this mail was stopped immediately. We requested the
			<lb />
			management to give the access to this mail to enquire into the further
			<lb />
			such mails related to the cash and other accounting adjustments
			<lb />
			contained in this Email Account. But this access was not made
			<lb />
			available to us.
			<lb />
			However, the access had been made available after the orders of the
			<lb />
			Honorable Supreme Court dated 28th February, 2019. Now, all the
			<lb />
			mails relating to receipt of cash from the various home buyers have
			<lb />
			been deleted. Thus, the management of the company has tempered with
			<lb />
			the evidence which were available earlier. (Page No. 205 Volume-I)
			<lb />
			Further an amount of Rs.113.5 crore paid by Amrapali Infrastructure
			<lb />
			Pvt Ltd to directors is recoverable as on 31 st March 2018 and this
			<lb />
			amount is on account of shares allotted of Ultra Home Construction
			<lb />
			Private Limited to the directors without receiving any money from the
			<lb />
			directors during the Financial Year 2010-11. This seems to be a
			<lb />
			dubious transaction by the directors of the company in manipulating
			<lb />
			the accounts in this manner by allotting the shares without actual
			<lb />
			consideration. These amounts are not disclosed by the Directors in their
			<lb />
			Affidavits. Hence, the Affidavits filed by the directors are incorrect to
			<lb />
			this extent.

			10. Executives who colluded with directors
			<lb />
			The executives of the Group colluded with the management to avoid
			<lb />
			proper recording of transactions in books of accounts. To avoid the
			<lb />
			traceability of the transactions, the executives recorded the financial
			<lb />
			transactions up to March 2015 in Accounting Package tally, then
			<lb />
			shifted to FARVISION from April 2015 and continued till March 2016,
			<lb />
			and thereafter partially recorded transaction in tally and a for a few
			<lb />
			companied in FARVISION. At the time of switchover, even the opening
			<lb />
			balances were not properly entered, thereby leading to a huge difference
			<lb />
			in the data provided to us. In November 2016, the Group left Farvision
			<lb />
			half way and started recording transactions for partial period in tally.
			<lb />
			The executives intentionally recorded transactions by switchover of
			<lb />
			accounting package improperly so that complete trail could not be
			<lb />
			established. Subsequently, the companies of the group even stopped
			<lb />
			getting the annual accounts prepared and filing returns to ROC and
			<lb />
			Income tax
			<lb />
			The Sales and Marketing head Mohit Gupta, CFO Chandar Wadhwa,
			<lb />
			Accounts head Adhikari Das, Company Secretary Pankaj Mehta and the
			<lb />
			Architect Vaibhav Jain along with their immediate coterie extended
			<lb />
			helping hand to the management in planning and execution of the
			<lb />
			scam.
			<lb />
			Mr. Mohit Gupta -Marketing Director
			<lb />
			He was responsible for the whole marketing department, Customer
			<lb />
			Relationship Management of the Amrapali Group and he did not
			<lb />
			cooperate during the entire process of forensic audit.
			<lb />
			It is pertinent to note that till now a list of flat wise possession has not
			<lb />
			been provided to us.
			<lb />
			At first he did not submit us the customer data inspite of number of
			<lb />
			reminders. Subsequently, the customer data submitted was not correct.
			<lb />
			We found the following-
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			The inventory of vacant flat submitted by him was incorrect.
			<lb />
			(ii) We found 401 flats (Refer Annexure S-5 page 2828-2836
			<lb />
			Supplementary report) which were either lying vacant and
			<lb />
			were available in inventory because the flat buyers were
			<lb />
			shifted out of Amrapali Group to the other project of other
			<lb />
			builders. Mr. Mohit Gupta also did not disclose the details of
			<lb />
			flats booked in the name of various parties without receipt of
			<lb />
			any amount from them just by passing journal entry.
			<lb />
			(iii) From the above it is clear that it defies the order of Honorable
			<lb />
			Supreme Court and has violated the order and is responsible
			<lb />
			for the gross contempt of the Honorable Court.
			<lb />
			Mr. Adhikari Debi Prasad Dash-GM/DGM Accounts
			<lb />
			It is found that Mr. Adhikari authorized (Refer Annexure S-6 page
			<lb />
			2837-2841 Supplementary report) most of the payments regarding
			<lb />
			payment of professional charges, raw materials, contractor dues and
			<lb />
			other direct/indirect expenses. It is pertinent to note that he was also
			<lb />
			involved in diversion of funds from Amrapali group and equally
			<lb />
			responsible in the conspiracy of cheating with home buyers and
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>

		<body>
			diversion of funds.
			<lb />
			He was responsible for the whole accounts department and he did not
			<lb />
			cooperate during the entire process of forensic audit. He was authorized
			<lb />
			to receive payments in cash and was submitting on day to day basis
			<lb />
			cash receipt status to Mr. Shiv Priya. After a clearance from him, a
			<lb />
			possession slip or no due certificate is issued.
			<lb />
			He continuously replied that he is not aware of anything and for
			<lb />
			everything there were Chartered Accountants for respective companies.
			<lb />
			This is not a correct statement and he contradicted his own statement
			<lb />
			many times. He was in possession of final accounts of group companies
			<lb />
			and did not share with us.
			<lb />
			Adhikari Dash also did not disclose the details of flats booked in the
			<lb />
			name of various parties without receipt of any amount from them just
			<lb />
			by passing journal entry.
			<lb />
			From the above it is clear that it defies the order of Honorable Supreme
			<lb />
			Court and has violated the order and is responsible for the gross
			<lb />
			contempt of the Honorable Court.
			<lb />
			He along with his brother exercised direct control over below
			<lb />
			companies:
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			Teks Tech Inspection India Private Limited
			<lb />
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Teks Tech IT Services India Private Limited
			<lb />
			(iii)
			<lb />
			Vinayaka Square Private Limited
			<lb />
			(iv)
			<lb />
			Shri Vinayaka Buildspace Private Limited
			<lb />
			(v)
			<lb />
			Milestone Highrise Private Limited
			<lb />
			Vinayaka Square Private Limited
			<lb />
			• The company has a commercial project named &quot;Beta Plaza&quot; at
			<lb />
			Greater Noida which received funds from Teks Tech Inspection India
			<lb />
			Private Limited (controlled by Mr. Adhikari), APJ Finmart Private
			<lb />
			Limited, Opulent Inn Private Limited, Tasty Feast Private Limited,
			<lb />
			Opulent Holidays and Travels (P) Limited. The chairman of four
			<lb />
			companies CA Pankaj Mittal appeared before us and could not
			<lb />
			explained the reasons for giving loans @ 6% p.a. to a real estate
			<lb />
			project whereas the bank rate on FDR is 7% and more.
			<lb />
			• The company has purchased this land for the project at Greater
			<lb />
			Noida in FY 2015-16 amounting to Rs.17.09 crore
			<lb />
			• Vinayaka Square received Rs 1 crore from Amrapali funds routed
			<lb />
			through Teks Tech Inspection India Private Limited and received
			<lb />
			Rs.2.56 crore from Shri Vinayaka Buildspace Private Limited.
			<lb />
			This is a project funded by Amrapali&apos;s Funds and shall be attached.
			<lb />
			Mr. Chander Wadhwa CFO Amrapali Group of Companies
			<lb />
			It has also been observed that a sum of Rs.5 crores was transferred by
			<lb />
			M/s Amrapali Homes Project Private Limited to Mr. Amit Wadhwa,
			<lb />
			nephew of Mr. Chander Prakash Wadhwa. As per the affidavit filled by
			<lb />
			Mr. Chander Prakash Wadhwa the said sum was invested by him in
			<lb />
			M/s Three Platinum Softech Private Limited. The Heartbeat city projects
			<lb />
			is partly owned by three Platinum and Amrapali group has invested in
			<lb />
			the projects in the name of Chander Wadhwa.

			As per Statement of Mr. Sanjeev Kumar Director of La Residentia
			<lb />
			Developers Private Limited recorded by us, he Informed that a sum of
			<lb />
			Rs.4 crores Approximately, was paid as fees for use of Amrapali Brand
			<lb />
			Name to Saffron Propmart Private Limited (This Company is controlled
			<lb />
			by Mr. Chander Wadhwa CFO). No Bills have been provided by him.
			<lb />
			Statutory Auditor CA Anil Mittal and Shri Chander Wadhwa CFO were
			<lb />
			in connivance with each other and payments were made by Shri Anil
			<lb />
			Mittal to Chander Wadhwa CFO for sharing fees received from Amrapali
			<lb />
			group for the work awarded to Anil Mittal Chander Wadhwa is one of
			<lb />
			the masterminds along with the other promoters directors behind the
			<lb />
			whole scam. He facilitated movement of funds by creating a web of
			<lb />
			companies within and outside the group. His relatives were made
			<lb />
			partner investor in LA Residentia and Heart beat city projects. Funds
			<lb />
			were invested in Patel Advance JV (Neo Town project Noida) and
			<lb />
			Euphoria Sports City.
			<lb />
			Furthermore, it is observed that the Company Management as well as
			<lb />
			Statutory Auditors and CFO have failed in their duty to follow the
			<lb />
			Accounting Standards relating to recording the valuation of Work in
			<lb />
			Progress as per ICAI guidelines applicable to Real Estate Companies. It
			<lb />
			is also pointed out that the CFO has not signed any Audited Financial
			<lb />
			Statements for reasons best known to them. But according to the
			<lb />
			statement recorded by us of various employees and suppliers as well as
			<lb />
			home buyers, we are informed that he was the main person handling
			<lb />
			Finance and every meeting was held with him only. (page no 209
			<lb />
			Volume 1)
			<lb />
			Mr. Pankaj Mehta -Company Secretary
			<lb />
			He was responsible for the secretarial compliances of the companies.
			<lb />
			He incorporated more than 50 additional companies to create a cobweb.
			<lb />
			He was a director in many of these companies and was an important
			<lb />
			link in the transfer of funds through various group companies.
			<lb />
			He was also signatory to the bank account of Stunning Construction
			<lb />
			Private Limited. He resigned from the services of the Company in
			<lb />
			December, 2016. However even after his resignation, on the
			<lb />
			instructions of Mr. Chander Wadhwa, CFO, he continued to operate the
			<lb />
			Bank Accounts of Stunning Construction Private Limited.
			<lb />
			After his resignation in the Amrapali Group, he started working as a
			<lb />
			partner of Saffron Consultants LLP with Mr. Chander Wadhwa. Also
			<lb />
			Mr. Anil Kumar is still working as an employee with Mr. Chander
			<lb />
			Wadhwa.
			<lb />
			On the instructions of Mr. Chander Wadhwa CFO manipulative entries
			<lb />
			were recorded for adjustment of payment dues of Mr. Pankaj Mehta
			<lb />
			against his Flat No. E-1502, Silicon City, Sector -76, Noida.
			<lb />
			11. Non compliance of statutory obligations
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			The group companies have not filed annual returns and Audited
			<lb />
			Financial Statements after 31 st March, 2015. The Registrar of
			<lb />
			Companies has already disqualified the Directors namely Mr. Anil
			<lb />
			Kumar Sharma, Mr. Amresh Kumar, Mr. Shiv Priya, Mr.Ajay Kumar
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			100
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			and Mr. Suvash Chandra Kumar for a period of 5 years from
			<lb />
			1/11/2017 to 31/10/2022 u/s 164(2) of The Companies Act, 2013.
			<lb />
			(ii) The company has not been regular in payment of TDS and Service
			<lb />
			tax and has also not filled relevant returns of TDS/Service tax after 31st
			<lb />
			March, 2015. There is also no follow up available from the Concerned
			<lb />
			departments.
			<lb />
			Latest information regarding status of default in respect of TDS/ Service
			<lb />
			tax is not made available to us. There may be huge demands
			<lb />
			outstanding against the company due to non-payment and non-filing of
			<lb />
			TDS/Service tax returns.
			<lb />
			(iii) No Statutory records have been maintained by the Amrapali group
			<lb />
			companies and produced before us relating to the following:
			<lb />
			i. Register of Directors and shareholders
			<lb />
			ii. Register of related party contracts
			<lb />
			iii. Minute book of Director and Shareholders
			<lb />
			iv. Fixed Assets Register
			<lb />
			v. Charges register in respect of loans taken from Banks and others
			<lb />
			(iv) Transfer entries are recorded in Inter Corporate Deposit accounts
			<lb />
			by transferring the amount from one Amrapali group company to
			<lb />
			another Amrapali group company in contravention of section
			<lb />
			269SS/269T of The Income Tax Act, 1961.
			<lb />
			(v) Depreciation has not been provided on the building in
			<lb />
			contravention of the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956, now
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 2013 in Navodaya Properties Private Limited.
			<lb />
			It is highly surprising that in spite of such glaring discrepancies
			<lb />
			regarding non-Compliance of statutory compliances, the Statutory
			<lb />
			Auditors have not pointed out any such discrepancies in their Statutory
			<lb />
			Audit Reports.
			<lb />
			There are many other glaring short comings in the Audited Balance
			<lb />
			Sheet &amp; Financial Statements
			<lb />
			a)
			<lb />
			I -Page 214)
			<lb />
			12. Anil Mittal -Statutory Auditor
			<lb />
			While scrutinizing the affidavit submitted by Shri Anil Mittal Date
			<lb />
			12/11/2018 before the Hon&apos;ble court we have noted the following:
			<lb />
			a) CA Anil Mittal was paid Rs.0.56 crore (Rs.0.66 crore less Rs.0.10
			<lb />
			crore recovered) during the period 2011 to 2018. These payments
			<lb />
			have been shown in the nature of cheques given /credit card
			<lb />
			payments which have been never been recovered.
			<lb />
			b) Statutory Auditor CA Anil Mittal and Shri Chander Wadhwa CFO
			<lb />
			were in connivance with each other and these payments have been
			<lb />
			made by Shri Anil Mittal to Chander Wadhwa CFO for sharing fees
			<lb />
			received from Amrapali group for the work awarded to CA Anil
			<lb />
			Mittal. CA Anil Mittal blindly signed all the accounts and is grossly
			<lb />
			involved along with Mr. Chander Wadhwa in making various
			<lb />
			manipulation in the accounts.
			<lb />
			c) Audit files handed over by Shri Anil Mittal Statutory Auditor are
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			101
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			grossly deficient and they do not contain the documents which are
			<lb />
			normally required in the statutory audit files as per guidelines and
			<lb />
			directions issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of
			<lb />
			India.
			<lb />
			d) Statutory Auditor CA Anil Mittal has received the payment on
			<lb />
			account of professional charges in the name of the companies in
			<lb />
			which his relatives are directors. This fact has not been disclosed
			<lb />
			in audited financial statements.
			<lb />
			e) A sum of Rs.52.07 crore was adjusted against the payment due on
			<lb />
			account of Flat number P-1203 in Amrapali Princely Estate on
			<lb />
			account of professional fees due and to be paid on account of
			<lb />
			Audit fees.
			<lb />
			f) Further a sum of Rs.16.36 crore was also adjusted against the flat
			<lb />
			number P-1104 in Amrapali Princely Estate on account of
			<lb />
			Professional fees due and to be paid on account of Audit fees.
			<lb />
			13. Diversion of homebuyers funds
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group was engaged in diversion of home buyer funds from
			<lb />
			one project to another project, other group companies, directors and
			<lb />
			senior executives of the group. There is also a diversion of funds to
			<lb />
			various suppliers where advances were made without any further
			<lb />
			adjustment/ transactions.
			<lb />
			There is not only diversion of funds, there is siphoning of funds also by
			<lb />
			way of booking undervalued transactions in respect of sale of flats, by
			<lb />
			way of booking of expenses, and making purchases from the bogus
			<lb />
			suppliers/service providers.
			<lb />
			In addition to this they adopted fraudulent practices also by way of
			<lb />
			double booking of flats. There are also instances of adjustment of
			<lb />
			amounts payable to suppliers/brokers with the amount due from the
			<lb />
			home buyers such trade creditors have denied having any knowledge of
			<lb />
			such transactions.
			<lb />
			We have traces of receiving of Cash from the home buyers/ others as
			<lb />
			shown by the email of the accounts department of the Amrapali Group
			<lb />
			of Companies which is not accounted for in the books of accounts.
			<lb />
			There is also allotment of shares without inward movement of funds by
			<lb />
			making manipulative entries in the books of accounts.
			<lb />
			The homebuyers funds were diverted Rs. 5,619.47 crore to other
			<lb />
			companies/directors:
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			through payment of professional fee to directors Rs.100.53
			<lb />
			crore;
			<lb />
			(ii) by way of booking of bogus bills including commission
			<lb />
			Rs.842.42 crore;
			<lb />
			(iii) by selling flats at undervalued prices in books and received
			<lb />
			differential market value in cash Rs.321.21 crore; (it is a tip
			<lb />
			of iceberg)
			<lb />
			(iv) by way of granting inter corporate deposits to related entities
			<lb />
			and unrelated entities / trusted partners for ultimately
			<lb />
			diverting funds to unapproved uses.
			<lb />
			Summary of diversion of funds is as under:

			<lb />
			Amrapali Zodiac Developers Private Limited has financed this
			<lb />
			transaction by its own shares through Group Companies by
			<lb />
			incorporating new Companies. These transactions enable Amrapali
			<lb />
			Zodiac Developers Private Limited to avoid the provisions of The
			<lb />
			Companies Act, 1956 applicable for buying its own shares.
			<lb />
			It is also relevant to point out that Shri Anil Mittal at any stage of time
			<lb />
			has not reported his interest or disclosed about his relatives of Director
			<lb />
			and Junior Employee. Both the directors and shareholders of the
			<lb />
			company i.e Mr. Atul Mittal (Relative) and Mr. Chandan Kumar (Junior
			<lb />
			Employee), are relatives/employee of Anil Mittal, the Statutory Auditor
			<lb />
			of the company.
			<lb />
			a)
			<lb />
			Rudraksh Infracity Private Limited-Shri Chandan Kumar, an
			<lb />
			employee of CA Anil Mittal, Statutory Auditor and Shri Atul Mittal,
			<lb />
			relative of CA Anil Mittal were inducted in the board. The basic purpose
			<lb />
			of this Company was only for money laundering and was incorporated
			<lb />
			to receive Funds from Mannat Buildcraft Private Limited which
			<lb />
			Company was incorporated by CFO Chander Wadhwa through his close
			<lb />
			associates. After receiving money from Mannat Buildcraft Private
			<lb />
			Limited, the same was transferred to J.P. Morgan Investments for
			<lb />
			purchase of Equity Shares of Amrapali Zodiac Private Limited at an
			<lb />
			exorbitant price. As per details furnished hereunder, the Valuation
			<lb />
			Report was also made to suit to the requirement of J.P. Morgan
			<lb />
			Investments as the M/s Sudit K. Parikh &amp; Company, Chartered
			<lb />
			Accountants were appointed by J.P. Morgan officials for the said
			<lb />
			valuation. They have admitted that valuation work was done on the
			<lb />
			basis of information provided by J.P. Morgan Investments after applying
			<lb />
			some basic checks.
			<lb />
			The whole racket of money laundering and receiving money from these
			<lb />
			Companies i.e. Mannat Buildcraft Private Limited and Rudraksh
			<lb />
			Infracity Private Limited are the brain child of Mr. Chander Wadhwa,
			<lb />
			CFO and Anil Mittal, Statutory Auditor of Amrapali Group of
			<lb />
			Companies. Both these Companies are controlled by both of these
			<lb />
			persons and had been formed only for this Money Laundering Business.

			<lb />
			Morgan &amp; the Investee i.e., Amrapali Group to share the profits from the
			<lb />
			project in the agreed ratio as per clause 7.3 &amp; Clause 7.5.1 Page No 19
			<lb />
			of Shareholder&apos;s Agreement.
			<lb />
			(C) Clause 7.1 -The Company agrees and undertakes that it shall,
			<lb />
			and the Investor and Developers agree that they shall cause the
			<lb />
			Company to first utilize the revenues (less the cost of construction
			<lb />
			of the project, provision for future consideration cost of the

			Project, payment of Project Land cost and interest thereon, annual
			<lb />
			lease rent payment to New Okhla Industrial Development Authority

			Clause 7.2 -Post the payment of taxes and interest to the lenders, as
			<lb />
			aforesaid, the Company shall make payments of all principal amounts

			<lb />
			agreed that the aggregate advances outstanding from the Amrapali
			<lb />
			Zodiac developers Private Limited to its affiliates will not exceed Rs
			<lb />
			25 crores excluding Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited. It was
			<lb />
			also in the knowledge of JP Morgan vide clause 2.14 of Page No 12 of
			<lb />
			Shareholder&apos;s Agreement that advances to Amrapali Infrastructure

			(E) Clause No 10.4.3 in page No 21 of Shareholder&apos;s Agreement
			<lb />
			mentions that no action can be taken without investor&apos;s approval in
			<lb />
			relation to 10.4.3(xi) any payments made to related parties.
			<lb />
			(F) It was also mentioned in the agreement that statutory auditor
			<lb />
			and internal auditor cannot be appointed and removed without the
			<lb />
			approval of JPMorgan.
			<lb />
			(G) The following points indicate very clearly that JP Morgan was
			<lb />
			having full control on Amrapali Zodiac Developers Private Limited
			<lb />
			project and no material decision could have been taken without JP
			<lb />
			Morgan approval.
			<lb />
			On Page No 60 of Shareholder&apos;s Agreement in Note 1 it was agreed
			<lb />
			&amp; accepted that any surplus cash flow from the project will be first
			<lb />
			utilized for payment of land cost to Noida Authority.
			<lb />
			Documents to be submitted by Amrapali Zodiac Developers Private
			<lb />
			Limited to JP Morgan:
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			Monthly progress report signed by director &amp; CFO.
			<lb />
			(ii)
			<lb />
			No delay report in specified format.
			<lb />
			JP Morgan insisted that the cost shall be restricted to Rs 425 crore and
			<lb />
			any additional cost over and above Rs 425 crore shall be brought in by
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group promoter. The additional cost considered was Rs
			<lb />
			125 crore to be brought in by promoters.
			<lb />
			(H) Zodiac has followed recognition of revenue on the basis of
			<lb />
			Project Completion Method -Accounting Standard -7
			<lb />
			(Construction Contracts). As per Project Completion Method as given
			<lb />
			in Accounting Standard -7, the profit cannot be recognized until the
			<lb />
			project is completed and as per Clause No 7.3 of Shareholder&apos;s
			<lb />
			Agreement the distributable amount is the balance amount
			<lb />
			representing the aggregate of all profits, after considering the payments
			<lb />
			referred to in clause 7.1 and 7.2 , including any amounts transferred to
			<lb />
			the reserves accounts of the Company shall for the purpose of this
			<lb />
			clause 7 are referred to as the &quot;Distributable Amount&quot;.
			<lb />
			(I)
			<lb />
			From the above it is clear that in absence of recognition of profit in
			<lb />
			the agreement there cannot be any distributable amount for
			<lb />
			distribution.
			<lb />
			(J) It was accepted by Mr Suraj Chhabria of JP Morgan (Apollo)
			<lb />
			that the money invested by them in Amrapali Zodiac Developers
			<lb />
			Private Limited was not utilized in the project. He also accepted
			<lb />
			that it was in their knowledge that money invested by them was
			<lb />
			not going to be utilized in Amrapali Zodiac Developers Private
			<lb />
			Limited project and it is contracted that Rs 60 crores to Amrapali
			<lb />
			Leisure Valley Developers Private Limited, Rs 8.5 crores to Ultra
			<lb />
			Home Construction Private Limited be transferred.
			<lb />
			(K) JP Morgan was in knowledge of that the Company Amrapali
			<lb />
			Zodiac Developers Private Limited has paid the money received
			<lb />
			from the Home buyers to tt he other Companies of Amrapali Group.

			(L) JP Morgan permitted a transfer of Rs 140 crore to Mannat
			<lb />
			Buildcraft Private Limited and from Mannat Buildcraft Private Limited
			<lb />
			to Neelkanth Buildcraft Private Limited and Rudraksh Infracity Private
			<lb />
			Limited for buying shares from JP Morgan of Amrapali Zodiac
			<lb />
			Developers Private Limited. There were always advances exceeded
			<lb />
			than the limits specified in Shareholder&apos;s Agreement but JP
			<lb />
			Morgan did not ensure bringing back the money from the affiliates
			<lb />
			though it was having its board representation in the ratio3:2.
			<lb />
			JP Morgan did not ensure that the funds for additional cost were
			<lb />
			brought in and in valuation it was assumed that additional cost of Rs
			<lb />
			125 crores will be brought in by the promoter for the last lag of the
			<lb />
			construction for its IRR (Internal Rate of Return) working.
			<lb />
			(M) JP Morgan was getting return at the rate of more than 20 %
			<lb />
			on its investment of Rs 85 crore &amp; was agreeing with Amrapali
			<lb />
			Zodiac Developers Private Limited to invest in Amrapali Leisure
			<lb />
			Valley Developers Private Limited a substantial part of its
			<lb />
			investment i.e., 60 crore out of Rs 85 crore at the rate 0.01%. It
			<lb />
			categorically demonstrates that JP Morgan invested Rs 60 crore in
			<lb />
			Amrapali Leisure Valley Developers Private Limited without
			<lb />
			complying FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) for its
			<lb />
			investment of Rs 60 crore in Amrapali Leisure Valley Developers
			<lb />
			Private Limited. It is not out of place to mention that Amrapali
			<lb />
			Zodiac Developers Private Limited was a project where home
			<lb />
			buyers were required to pay on the basis of progress of the
			<lb />
			construction of the project. Meaning it was construction linked
			<lb />
			payment project.
			<lb />
			(N) We found that most of the time customers have paid more
			<lb />
			than what was spent in the project. The Amrapali Zodiac Developers
			<lb />
			Private Limited diverted home buyer&apos;s money &amp; there was no need
			<lb />
			of any investment from JP Morgan. It was accepted by Mr Suraj
			<lb />
			Chhabria that there was no restriction on the Company to invest
			<lb />
			the money in the project &amp; it was in his knowledge &amp; the
			<lb />
			knowledge of JP Morgan that the money has been diverted,
			<lb />
			Transferred
			<lb />
			Valuation
			<lb />
			(A) The valuation did not follow the correct methodology of DCF
			<lb />
			(Discounted Cash Flow). The valuation is without any sanctity &amp;
			<lb />
			validity. The valuation was carried out to cause wrongful loss to the
			<lb />
			homebuyers of Amrapali Zodiac Developers Private Limited and to give
			<lb />
			advantage to JPMorgan.

			that JP Morgan, Mumbai office in Andheri/ Santacruise did not allow to
			<lb />
			take any of the details/ abstract from the share purchase agreement. It
			<lb />
			is to note that at the time of exit, it was predetermined that Zodiac
			<lb />
			Developers would not pay the lease rent as well as the installment due
			<lb />
			to Noida Authorities as clearly explained in the cash flow statement
			<lb />
			provided by the SKP&amp;Co in 4 no. of valuation certificates from2010-

			Misrepresentation of facts by investing the funds in the form of
			<lb />
			private equity in the project namely Zodiac and then diverting it
			<lb />
			from there to promoters and the promoters associated companies
			<lb />
			As ECBs were not permitted in real estate sector under automatic route,
			<lb />
			JP Morgan gave the said borrowings, the nomenclature of equity shares
			<lb />
			having different return on investment as compared to other equity
			<lb />
			shareholders. In fact JP Morgan remitted Rs.60 crore to Amrapali
			<lb />
			Leisure Valley Developers Pvt Ltd as ECB without obtaining approval
			<lb />
			from competent authority. Immediately on receipt of funds by Amrapali
			<lb />
			Leisure Valley Developers Pvt Ltd, the funds were transferred to
			<lb />
			promoters and associate companies of the group.
			<lb />
			Had JP Morgan invested in the form of ECB, following would have been
			<lb />
			the compliances to be fulfilled by recipient:
			<lb />
			a)
			<lb />
			obtaining Loan Registration Number from RBI;
			<lb />
			b)
			<lb />
			file ECB-2 returns every month to the RBI;
			<lb />
			c)
			<lb />

			<lb />
			of the ITA. As per Article 11 of the Avoidance of double taxation
			<lb />
			agreement between India and Mauritius tax shall be charged
			<lb />
			@7.5% of the gross amount of interest.
			<lb />
			d)

			<lb />
			The group started demerging and delinking the good projects from the
			<lb />

		<body>
			brand name &quot;Amrapali&quot; though these projects were initially launched as
			<lb />
			Amrapali projects. The said projects identified till the date of writing of
			<lb />
			the report are La Residentia, Vinayaka square, Heartbeat City, O2
			<lb />
			Habitat.
			<lb />
			La Residentia
			<lb />
			A big project having more than 3,200 dwelling units was launched in
			<lb />
			2010-11 having an equity shareholding of 19.75% in the name of
			<lb />
			Stunning Construction Pvt Ltd.
			<lb />
			•
			<lb />
			Stunning Construction Private Limited (&apos;Stunning&apos;), an Amrapali
			<lb />
			group company, holds 19.75% shares in the company. Stunning has
			<lb />
			been a consortium partner since beginning and land was allotted by
			<lb />
			Noida Authorities to the 5 members consortium including Stunning.
			<lb />
			The project was launched as an Amrapali group project and was
			<lb />
			marketed accordingly. As per the discussion with directors of La
			<lb />
			Residentia Developers Private Limited, they broke up with Amrapali
			<lb />
			group in 2017. 2017 is the year when writ petition was filed before the
			<lb />
			Honorable Supreme Court. It is informed to us that a marketing
			<lb />
			agreement was entered into between La Residentia Developers Private
			<lb />
			Limited and Amrapali group (name of the company not known) that
			<lb />
			Amrapali group would market its project for a consideration of Rs.16
			<lb />
			crore. It was informed by Mr. Sanjeev Kumar (director of La Residentia
			<lb />
			Developers Private Limited and a very old friend of Mr. Shiv Priya,
			<lb />
			director, Amrapali group) that though the agreement was signed but
			<lb />
			Amrapali group didn&apos;t provide a copy of the agreement. It proves that
			<lb />
			Amrapali director were having significant influence on La Residentia
			<lb />
			Developers Private Limited that they had an authority even not to give a
			<lb />
			copy of the agreement to a person/entity who has signed it.
			<lb />
			•
			<lb />
			Out of Rs.16 crore, which were to be paid to Amrapali group as per
			<lb />
			the agreement, Rs 4 crore were paid to Saffron Propmart Consultancy
			<lb />
			Private Limited Owned and controlled by CFO Chander Wadhwa) under
			<lb />
			a verbal instruction of Mr. Adikhari, GM/DG accounts of Amrapali
			<lb />
			group. It is to be noted that directors of La Residentia Developers
			<lb />
			Private Limited were acting and working under the supervision of Mr.
			<lb />
			Adhikari who was a middle level management officer. It indicates that
			<lb />
			the project was conceived by Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma &amp; Mr. Shiv Priya
			<lb />
			directors of Amrapali group and Mr. Sanjeev Kumar, Mr. Mukesh
			<lb />
			Kumar Roy and others were only a front.
			<lb />
			•
			<lb />
			it is very clear that there was no contribution of funds from the
			<lb />
			consortium partners whatever funds contributed by the consortium
			<lb />
			partners were not only withdrawn within a very short period but over
			<lb />
			and above that extra funds were given to them in the name of interest
			<lb />
			free loans and advances.
			<lb />
			•
			<lb />
			Amrapali group companies have transferred some of their buyers
			<lb />
			to the company. We found that the list of unsold inventory was sent to
			<lb />
			Mr. Anil Sharma and it was he who decided that the following buyers
			<lb />
			from Amrapali group companies be shifted to La Residentia this proves
			<lb />
			that La Residentia was under the direct control of Mr. Anil Sharma and
			<lb />
			Mr. Shiv Priya and is an entity of Amrapali group.

			17. Summary of amounts recoverable standing as debit balances
			<lb />
			in books of accounts
			<lb />
			Amrapali group of companies had several amounts lying in debit
			<lb />
			balances in the form of advances recoverable on account of long term
			<lb />
			loans to third parties, short term loans given to third parties, advances
			<lb />
			given for purchase of plots, advances given to creditors for
			<lb />
			materials/others etc.
			<lb />
			Amrapali group of companies were mostly diverting loan funds as well
			<lb />
			as home buyers funds to directors, key managerial personnel, relatives,
			<lb />
			group companies and third parties. They did construction activity only
			<lb />
			in part and created a circle for movements of funds vide bogus expenses
			<lb />
			or hollow transactions. Funds were given to several parties in the garb
			<lb />
			of advances against purchase of land or for purchasing material for
			<lb />
			construction and booked as sundry creditors with debit balances.
			<lb />
			However, in effect such amounts were neither returned nor any expense
			<lb />
			was booked against them. Such amounts are as old as 2006-07, which
			<lb />
			have not been returned or no expense has been booked till date. Total of
			<lb />
			such recoverable amounts to Rs.582 crore.

			19. Cars
			<lb />
			The Company has bought many luxury cars and other cars out of the
			<lb />
			funds of the homebuyers.
			<lb />
			Many of the cars were transferred in the name of the relatives /
			<lb />
			employees without passing any entries in the books of accounts and
			<lb />
			receiving any money from the transferees.
			<lb />
			Moreover, the cars were transferred in the name of the persons who was
			<lb />
			not associated with the company which originally bought the cars. We
			<lb />
			have already reported the matter in the court hearings and the
			<lb />
			honourable court has ordered for the sale of the said luxury cars.
			<lb />
			Out of the above 15 cars only 9 were made available for physical
			<lb />
			verification.
			<lb />
			20. HOMEBUYERS
			<lb />
			The group constructed and booked/sold residential and commercial
			<lb />
			units:
			<lb />
			a) before launch of the projects;
			<lb />
			b) at the launch of the projects; and
			<lb />
			c) Continued to book till any inventory was left over in the projects.
			<lb />
			The customers booked the flat for:
			<lb />
			a) Abode;
			<lb />
			b) Investment;
			<lb />
			c) barter in advance;
			<lb />
			d) adjusting their amounts in respect of work done in same project
			<lb />
			(creditors of same projects)
			<lb />
			e) adjusting their amounts in respect of work done in other projects
			<lb />
			(creditors of other projects)
			<lb />
			f) booked
			<lb />
			in
			<lb />
			the
			<lb />
			name
			<lb />
			of
			<lb />
			unidentifiable/untraceable
			<lb />
			persons/entities.
			<lb />
			During this procedure, we were informed that the data related to
			<lb />
			customers was maintained in the software FAR VISION as well as
			<lb />
			manually of some of the projects. The Data in such fashion is
			<lb />
			intentionally maintained to avoid findings in future the gaps.

			1)
			<lb />
			It is found that the promoters/directors/senior management of the
			<lb />
			company were treating the inventory of the projects as personal asset
			<lb />
			and started allotting the unsold inventory to various persons/entities by
			<lb />
			passing an accounting entry in the Accounting software tally.
			<lb />
			2)
			<lb />
			We found that 14 flats were booked in the name of Mr. Rajesh Viz
			<lb />
			in the project Amrapali Centurion Park, Terrace Homes. The customer
			<lb />
			data in FAR Vision provided, shows only Rs 10,000/-received for each
			<lb />
			flat from him as a booking amount. We did not find his name in the
			<lb />
			tally data of books of accounts of Amrapali Centurion Park Pvt. Ltd. We
			<lb />
			sent Emails to him to confirm the same but did not get any satisfactory
			<lb />
			response from him. He did not come and avoided meeting us for last 5
			<lb />
			months.
			<lb />
			3)
			<lb />
			We found differences in amount shown as per the records i.e.
			<lb />
			amount received as per Customer data base sheet extracted from
			<lb />
			software FAR VISION and the amount actually paid by the customer.
			<lb />
			We came to know about the differences in receivable after sending e
			<lb />
			mails/ speaking over the phone to the customers. A list of such
			<lb />
			differences is given on sample basis (Page No. 483)
			<lb />
			4)
			<lb />
			We found the following 2 customers who had been handed over the
			<lb />
			possession but still appearing in the Customer database as undelivered.
			<lb />
			Both have paid less than 50% as per company records.
			<lb />
			5)
			<lb />
			For amount received there is a mismatch in the tally records/ FV
			<lb />
			accounts and customer data in software Far Vision. Amount received
			<lb />
			from a customer with flat no. though shown in customer database but
			<lb />
			didn&apos;t account for in the tally. List on sample basis is given (Page No.
			<lb />
			486)
			<lb />
			6)
			<lb />
			We found a mismatch that the name of customer is different in
			<lb />
			accounting package (tally&amp; ERP FAR Vision) and customer data record
			<lb />
			in FAR VISION. We were not explained satisfactorily the reason for the
			<lb />
			same. (Page No. 489)
			<lb />
			7)
			<lb />
			We found a no. of customers/buyers whose know your customer
			<lb />
			(KYC) is not available (N/A).For example PAN, e-mail, phone and
			<lb />
			address (Page No. 490)
			<lb />
			8)
			<lb />
			The supplier of material and provider of services were
			<lb />
			unsecured creditors for the amount claimed by them. There are a
			<lb />
			number of flats booked against the amount claimed as due. All this
			<lb />
			was done in 2015-17. There are flats allotted to parties (unsecured
			<lb />
			creditors) in different projects irrespective of whether any service
			<lb />
			was provided/ material supplied to the same project or not.
			<lb />
			We propose the following order for allotment of flats to the persons/
			<lb />
			entity who have
			<lb />
			booked the flats subject to the verification of their
			<lb />
			claim:
			<lb />

			Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd allotted flats to buyers on false
			<lb />
			promises and forged documents. An instance being in the case of Mr.
			<lb />
			Mohammad Kaif where he was allotted 3 flats i.e G-2502, G 2501 and
			<lb />
			LG-1 vide agreements dated 22 nd August 2012, 19 th September 2012
			<lb />
			and 9 th January 2013, through their consortium-Amrapali Patel
			<lb />
			Platinum and UHCPL received INR 2 crore on assured return basis.
			<lb />
			However, subsequently, it came to the knowledge that flats mentioned
			<lb />
			in the buyer agreement never existed as 25 th floor did not exist in the
			<lb />
			approved building plan. Further, as per details provided by Mr. Kaif, as
			<lb />
			on 31 st March 2017, an amount of INR 1,40,00,000 was payable to him,
			<lb />
			however, as per books of accounts (in tally data), an amount of INR
			<lb />
			1,70,00,000 was payable to him by UHCPL.
			<lb />
			Hi Tech City Developers Pvt Ltd has huge amount of Trade Receivables

			<lb />
			Whereas , the project under this Company i.e. Amrapali Empire has

			been completed. Most of the flats have been handed over and registry
			<lb />
			has been done. We fail to understand as to why the aforesaid amount is
			<lb />
			still appearing as recoverable from various home buyers.
			<lb />
			This implies it was received in cash and not accounted for. The

			It is worth mentioning here that of the above 33 home buyers most of
			<lb />
			them are employees/ ex-employees of the Company. The management
			<lb />
			has done under-valued registry for all these cases. We are of the view
			<lb />
			that the management has under-valued these registries to evade the
			<lb />
			stamp duty to be paid to the government and has taken the money
			<lb />
			outside the books from these employees and these amounts
			<lb />
			outstanding in the books are only book entries and should be recovered
			<lb />
			from the management.

			As per the information provided and the records made available to us,

			Flat No C-704 in Amrapali Castle and Flat No D-702 in Amrapali Eden
			<lb />
			Park were shown as vacant flats and were provided to NBCC for the

			<lb />
			Park respectively along with many Annexures. (Payment receipts, NOC,
			<lb />
			possession letter).that the flats have been booked by them

			<lb />
			While scrutinizing the customer data, we found a case where the

			discount. There may be many more such cases.

			Valley

			LTD.
			<lb />
			We are informed that Mr.Adhikari Debi Prasad Das (GM/DGM
			<lb />
			Accounts) and Mr. Mohit Gupta (Director Marketing) were directly
			<lb />
			responsible for accounting and collection of receivables and marketing
			<lb />
			of flats.
			<lb />
			We interviewed both the persons several times. Both kept on changing
			<lb />
			their stand/answers and did not cooperate in answering our queries.
			<lb />
			Their answer to every question was that they are not aware. They did
			<lb />
			not provide many documents and the laptops which are in their
			<lb />
			possession. In spite of repeated reminders, Mr. Mohit Gupta has not
			<lb />
			made available the complete data with respect to home buyers/flat
			<lb />
			owners.
			<lb />
			We found Mr Mohit Gupta and Mr Adhikari Devi Prasad Das directly
			<lb />
			responsible for all the wrongdoings in booking of receivables, marketing
			<lb />
			of the flats and in handing over the possession of the flats.
			<lb />
			Utilities like Milk booth, Nursery schools, Senior secondary
			<lb />
			schools, Nursing homes allotted to various parties should be
			<lb />
			cancelled.

			<lb />

			<lb />
			between M/s LA Residentia and Amrapali Group of Companies against
			<lb />
			the aforesaid Branding Income. These home buyers have already been
			<lb />
			allotted flats in M/s LA Residentia. Hence, the 75 Flats booked by

			(Volume-I Page No. 200). The Complete List of all such flat has been

			<lb />
			22. Sureka group
			<lb />
			Amrapali and Sureka&apos;s have a very long and intricate association
			<lb />
			starting officially with the partnership venture &apos;Amrapali Homes&apos; in
			<lb />
			2006 wherein Ultra Home Construction Private Limited and Mauria
			<lb />
			Udyog Limited is partner and developed project in name of Amrapali
			<lb />
			Homes in Indirapuram then Amrapali Grand wherein Ultra Home
			<lb />
			Construction Private Limited and Bihariji Ispat Udyog Limited were
			<lb />
			partners, though the land was allotted to Bihariji Ispat Udyog Limited.
			<lb />
			Initially Amrapali Group ventured like these types of association as he
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			126
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			was independently not able to meet the net worth, turnover and other
			<lb />
			eligibility criteria for land allotment by Noida authorities. They then
			<lb />
			next associated in Sapphire Project wherein Sureka&apos;s family
			<lb />
			participated as shareholders and directors in the Company. Every Joint
			<lb />
			Venture used to have an unexecuted profit sharing and investment
			<lb />
			arrangement. Since the company didn&apos;t declared dividend ever, the
			<lb />
			profits were drawn by Sureka family in the nature of advances which
			<lb />
			has majorly been squared off against billing from Mauria Udyog
			<lb />
			Limited, Jotindra Steel and their other related companies. Some of the
			<lb />
			amount is still lying as advance in the books of accounts of Amrapali
			<lb />
			Group. In 2012 Amrapali Group invested in 25% stake in Sureka
			<lb />
			family&apos;s three projects Heart Beat City, Pebbles Prolease, Three
			<lb />
			Platinum Softech. Apart from subscribing to share capital, the further
			<lb />
			investment was made directly as advance or billing from Amrapali
			<lb />
			Group to these companies and some through shell companies as well.
			<lb />
			Further they did a project in Ultra Home Construction Private Limited
			<lb />
			with Mozambique. This project was planned, coordinated and managed
			<lb />
			by Mr Navneet Sureka in the name of Ultra Home Construction Private
			<lb />
			Limited and whatever advance was sanctioned and disbursed by the
			<lb />
			Government of Mozambique through EXIM bank to Ultra Home
			<lb />
			Construction Private Limited was eventually diverted to Sureka family
			<lb />
			through billing from Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited, Mauria Udyog
			<lb />
			Limited, etc. A separate bank account of Ultra Home Construction
			<lb />
			Private Limited was opened in State Bank of Patiala, Faridabad branch
			<lb />
			where signatory was Mr Akhil Sureka who used to operate the account
			<lb />
			from there. The entire transactions of LC and EXIM bank was routed
			<lb />
			from that account. Navneet Sureka visited more in the period of
			<lb />
			contract finalization to Mozambique
			<lb />
			Partner in the following projects:
			<lb />
			• Amrapali Sapphire Developers Pvt. Ltd. -10.52% of shareholding
			<lb />
			BihariJi Ispat Udyog Limited
			<lb />
			• Amrapali Smart City Pvt Ltd -10% shareholding held by Mauria
			<lb />
			Udyog Ltd
			<lb />
			• Amrapali Homes -5% -Mauria Udyog Ltd (Rs.20 crore given as an
			<lb />
			advance before 2008 and is recoverable)
			<lb />
			• Amrapali grand -10% BihariJi Ispat Udyog Limited -We were
			<lb />
			informed that the land was allotted in the name of Bihariji Ispat
			<lb />
			Udyog Ltd and construction and development work was done by
			<lb />
			Amrapali group.
			<lb />
			Directors in the following companies
			<lb />
			• Amrapali Leisure Valley Pvt Ltd -Akhil Sureka
			<lb />
			Cheque signatories in the following companies
			<lb />
			• Amrapali Leisure Valley Pvt Ltd
			<lb />
			• Amrapali Dream Valley Pvt Ltd
			<lb />
			• Amrapali Leisure Valley Developers pvt Ltd
			<lb />
			• Amrapali centurian Park Pvt Ltd
			<lb />
			From the above, it is clear that Sureka group directors namely Vishnu
			<lb />
			Sureka, Navneet Sureka and Akhil sureka were promoters in amrapali
			<lb />
			group. They were in equal control of affairs with other promoters (Anil
			<lb />
			Sharma Shiv Priya, etc.). They not only invested as a promoter heavy

			amount but also provided the land allotted to Bihariji Ispat a sureka
			<lb />
			group company. But the amount invested was withdrawn in a very
			<lb />
			short period by other associate companies in the form of interest,
			<lb />
			supplies, provision of services etc. it was found out that there were
			<lb />
			many other suppliers who never interacted with any of the
			<lb />
			directors/staff but supplied material to Amrapali through Akhil and
			<lb />
			Navneet Sureka. In our opinion, this was nothing but accommodation
			<lb />
			bills and a form of withdrawing funds from the group. None of the
			<lb />
			employess/ directors of the sureka companies knew that Sureka group
			<lb />
			has supplied ,material to Amrapali group. Though sureka group has a
			<lb />
			policy and procedure wthat for any item above Rs,. 5,000/-a purchase
			<lb />
			order would be issued but it was not followed in the case of supplies to
			<lb />
			Amrapali. Surprising all the transactions worth more than 500 crore
			<lb />
			has been handled single handedly by Navneet and akhil sureka without
			<lb />
			involving any of the directors and employees. All the cheques were also
			<lb />
			signed by Usreka family and not by any other directors.
			<lb />
			It is pertinent to note that the amount paid for FSI purchased by
			<lb />
			Suraka group companies was taken back on the same day by routing
			<lb />
			through a number of companies.All such cheques for money laundering
			<lb />
			were signed by Akhil Sureka Furthermore, it is found that the amount
			<lb />
			so paid ie Rs. 80 crore was also received from suppliers of the Amrapali
			<lb />
			group. Therefore in our opinion,not only FSi should be canceled but
			<lb />
			the amount os Rs. 80 crore is recovereable from them.
			<lb />
			They adopted the same methodoly. Formed various business entities,
			<lb />
			appointed small time employees the directors in these companies and
			<lb />
			routed fundsof 100s of crores and it may be in the range of 1000s
			<lb />
			crores.. None of the directors were knowing about any of the business
			<lb />
			transactions. Further more most of the directors never attended any
			<lb />
			board meetings,knew about nature of business the company does,
			<lb />
			name of other directors in the company and so on. We are not sure who
			<lb />
			was teacing the fraudlent practices to whom, whether Sureka to
			<lb />
			Amrapali or vice versa.
			<lb />
			It was observed Rs.13.44 crore paid to Sureka Public Charitable Trust
			<lb />
			were transferred to donation account subsequently. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			Sureka Public Charitable Trust is a group institution of Jotindra Steels
			<lb />
			&amp; Tubes Limited, which is also under the forensic audit. This should be
			<lb />
			recovered from the Jotindra Steels &amp; Tubes Limited.
			<lb />
			Sureka group used several companies to route funds from Amrapali
			<lb />
			group to Sureka group, an example being in the case of Amrapali
			<lb />
			Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, where the company received Rs.3.23 crore from
			<lb />
			&quot;Synergy Freightways Private Limited&quot; from 26th March 2015 to 30th
			<lb />
			March 2015. On 31st March 2015 an amount to Rs.4.18 crore was paid
			<lb />
			to the said party through 16 separate transactions and thereby leading
			<lb />
			to a debit balance recoverable from the party amounting to Rs.0.9,5
			<lb />
			crore as on 31st March 2015. This amount should be recovered from
			<lb />
			the Sureka Group.
			<lb />
			It is worthwhile to mention here that M/s Synergy Freightways Private
			<lb />
			Limited is an associate Company of M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes
			<lb />
			Limited. Further, there are no business transactions with the said party
			<lb />
			except routing of funds.
			<lb />

		<body>
			Another example being in the case of Shriv Buildmat Private Limited
			<lb />
			where one of the directors is common with MauriaUdyog Limited. On
			<lb />
			scrutiny of ledger accounts of Shriv Buildmat, it was observed that
			<lb />
			during FY 2014-15 and 2015-16, the said company had almost 100%
			<lb />
			sales to Amrapali group of companies. It was also observed that one flat
			<lb />
			was allotted to Mr. Atul Kumar, Director of ShrivBuildmat Private
			<lb />
			Limited in Verona Heights, against the amount due to the said
			<lb />
			company. This adjustment is not genuine and the relevant amount
			<lb />
			should be recovered from Mr. Atul Kumar or his flat may be attached.
			<lb />
			As per ledger account advance to Amrapali for flat, a sum of INR 34.05
			<lb />
			lakhs has been shown as recoverable as on 31st March, 2015. There is
			<lb />
			no name of the Company to which such advance has been given in the
			<lb />
			books of the Amrapali Group of Companies. Thus, this amount of INR
			<lb />
			34.05 Lakhs is shown as recoverable is not genuine.
			<lb />
			A sum of INR 53.21 Lakhs has been debited to Labour Charges
			<lb />
			Contractors on account of bill no. SBPL/Noida/010 dated 13/3/2013
			<lb />
			has been recorded in the books of Amrapali Infrastructure Private
			<lb />
			Limited on 16/03/2015.
			<lb />
			RN Traders
			<lb />
			During the financial year 2016-17 and 2017-18, a sum of INR 17.63

			Further, there is no Name, Pan or Address available in the records of
			<lb />
			M/s RN Traders. It was further observed that there are no business
			<lb />
			transactions with M/s RN Traders. It is possible that this amount of
			<lb />
			INR 2,714.02 Lakhs has been withdrawn by the management for their
			<lb />
			own personal use and should be recovered from the management.
			<lb />
			BiharijiIspat Udyog Limited being one of the partners of Amrapali Grand
			<lb />
			always had negative capital. They withdrew much more than what they
			<lb />
			brought into the business. There is no substance in them being called
			<lb />
			as capital contributors to the business of Amrapali Grand. As on 1st
			<lb />
			April 2008 they had withdrawn INR 12 crore and invested a capital
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>

			<lb />

		<body>
			contribution of INR 1.5 crore. As on 31st July 2018, they have debit
			<lb />
			balance of INR 1.67 crore and negative capital of INR 30,380. They
			<lb />
			always withdrew homebuyers funds for misusing for their own agendas
			<lb />
			apart from the business.
			<lb />
			Out of INR 12 crore given to BihariJiIspat Udyog Limited, they returned
			<lb />
			INR 6.45 crore through bank and the balance amount was adjusted
			<lb />
			against receivables from Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd and against
			<lb />
			capital contribution by BiharijiIspat Udyog Ltd.
			<lb />
			Amrapali Grand gave loans and advances to below parties, which are
			<lb />
			recoverable as on 31 st July 2018 amounting to INR 25.73 crore as per
			<lb />
			Tally data.
			<lb />

			a) Payment of Rs 2,74,68,000/-has been made to Mr Ajay Kumar
			<lb />
			from 2007-08 to 2010-11 as advance recoverable. Out of this, Rs
			<lb />
			77,00,000 was paid by him for purchase of property located at
			<lb />
			Jaypee Greens, Noida &amp; Rs 50,00,000 was paid by him to Quality
			<lb />
			Synthetics Industries Limited.
			<lb />
			b) Payment of Rs 10,03,55,900 has been made to Mr Anil Kumar
			<lb />
			Sharma from 2007-08 to July, 2018. Out of this, Rs 3,00,00,000
			<lb />
			was paid to Quality Synthetics Industries Limited.
			<lb />
			c) Payment of Rs 7,10,50,000 has been made to Mr Shiv Priya from
			<lb />
			2007-08 to September 2010. Out of this, Rs 1,00,00,000 was
			<lb />
			paid to Quality Synthetics Industries Limited.
			<lb />
			While reviewing the books of accounts of Amrapali Infrastructure
			<lb />
			Private Limited and M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited, it has been
			<lb />
			observed that Amrapali Infrastructure has made purchases from M/s
			<lb />
			Jotindra Steel against Letter of Credit. The letter of credit has been
			<lb />
			discounted by M/s Jotindra Steel with the banks. The discounting
			<lb />
			charges of INR 1.30 Crores have been debited by M/s Jotindra Steel to
			<lb />
			M/s Amrapali Infrastructure. We fail to understand the reason for this
			<lb />
			treatment. In normal course of business, the supplier is the person who
			<lb />
			bears the discounting charges in respect of the transactions as the
			<lb />
			margin when sold on Letter of Credit are generally higher. This amount
			<lb />
			of INR 1.30 Crores on account of discounting charges of Letter of
			<lb />
			Credit Should be recovered from M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited.
			<lb />
			i. It has also been observed that M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes
			<lb />
			Limited has issued service invoices for erection, shifting and
			<lb />
			transportation charges amounting to INR 96 lakhs approximately

			Further, on scrutiny of the invoices issued by the JSTB it appears that
			<lb />
			the invoices raised for the above services are completely different from
			<lb />
			the invoices issued regularly and are prima facie non-genuine. Hence,
			<lb />
			the same should be recovered from JSTB or the Company Management
			<lb />
			as both the parties have been partnering in various projects.
			<lb />
			ii. It is further observed that purchases amounting to INR 7.09 Crores,
			<lb />
			INR 59.53 Crores and INR 47.04 Crores has been made from this
			<lb />
			party in M/s Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited during the
			<lb />
			financial year 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively. While
			<lb />
			sample checking of the purchase bills, it was noted that the goods
			<lb />
			consignment notes enclosed with the purchase bill are issued by
			<lb />
			M/s Synergy Freightways Private Limited which is also a group
			<lb />
			Company of Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited. Goods consignment
			<lb />
			note enclosed with the purchase bills don&apos;t seem to be genuine in
			<lb />
			view of the undermentioned observations:
			<lb />
			1. We sent a letter to M/s Synergy Freightways Private Limited as
			<lb />
			per address on record which has been received back as
			<lb />
			undelivered.
			<lb />
			2. Statement of Mr. Akhil Sureka, Managing Director of M/s
			<lb />
			Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited was recorded and it was
			<lb />
			confirmed by him that most of the purchase/ sales transactions
			<lb />
			are back to back i.e. all such consignments are sent directly
			<lb />
			from their supplier to Amrapali Group of Companies. In these
			<lb />
			circumstances it is not understood by us that how the
			<lb />
			consignment notes of M/s Synergy Freightways Private Limited
			<lb />
			have been enclosed with most of the purchase bills, if the
			<lb />
			transactions were back to back for their supplies.
			<lb />
			3. On scrutiny of the tally data/documents of Amrapali
			<lb />
			Infrastructure Private Limited and JST, it has been
			<lb />
			observed that no freight has been paid to M/s Synergy
			<lb />
			Freightways
			<lb />
			Private
			<lb />
			Limited
			<lb />
			either
			<lb />
			by
			<lb />
			Amrapali
			<lb />
			Infrastructure Private Limited or by JST.
			<lb />
			This clearly establishes that all the GRs issued by M/s Synergy
			<lb />
			Freightways Private Limited are not genuine. Further, most of the
			<lb />
			purchase invoices of JST have been shown as sale on the same date
			<lb />
			with similar particulars/ quantity by raising the invoice on Amrapali
			<lb />
			Infrastructure Private Limited.
			<lb />
			We are of the view that these sales invoices raised by JST are also not
			<lb />
			genuine and are mere accommodation entries only.

			4. It has been further observed that there have been unaccounted
			<lb />
			cash transactions between the Amrapali Group of Companies
			<lb />
			and JSTB group of Companies as per documents seized during
			<lb />
			Income Tax Search in the premises of JSTB Group of
			<lb />
			Companies which are not accounted for in the Amrapali Group
			<lb />
			of Companies. Complete Copy of the Order of CIT (Appeals)
			<lb />
			where the observations regarding unaccounted cash were
			<lb />
			discussed is enclosed herewith as Annexure 34-C.
			<lb />
			II.
			<lb />
			M/s Mauria Udyog Limited Ghaziabad
			<lb />
			While scrutinizing the ledger of this party it was observed as follows:
			<lb />
			a) During the month of December 2015 there were 7 purchase
			<lb />
			invoices from this party amounting to INR 0.65 Crores all dated
			<lb />
			18/12/15.
			<lb />
			b) While scrutinizing the data called from M/s Mauria Udyog
			<lb />
			Limited it was noted that they have purchased these goods vide 7
			<lb />
			purchase invoices dated 17/12/15 for INR 0.63 Crores.
			<lb />
			c) There is no other purchase/Sale by M/s Mauria Udyog Limited.
			<lb />
			d) Similarly, in other months also 100% of the sale is made to
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group of Companies. Since M/s Mauria Udyog Limited
			<lb />
			is a group company of Jotindra Steels &amp; Tubes Limited, there is
			<lb />
			very high possibility of accommodation bills being issued and all
			<lb />
			their purchases being Non-Genuine amounting to INR 5.28
			<lb />
			Crores for financial year 2015-16.
			<lb />
			e) It is further observed that all the payments against these
			<lb />
			purchases&apos; bills have been made by issuing letter of credit. It
			<lb />
			seems that the Company is getting the LC&apos;s discounted from the
			<lb />
			bank against these non-genuine bills.

			When we questioned Mr. Navneet Sureka who approached Amrapali
			<lb />
			group from trust side and who was approached in Amrapali group. He
			<lb />
			answered &quot;he is not able to recollect&quot;.
			<lb />
			He didn&apos;t cooperate otherwise how it is possible that such a huge
			<lb />
			amount donated by Amrapali group companies and he is not able to
			<lb />
			remember the basic question. We recommend the amount donated
			<lb />
			should be recovered from the Sureka group.
			<lb />
			We are of the opinion that the supplies and services provided by
			<lb />
			Jotindra Steel &amp; Tubes Limited (Rs 321 crore) and Mauria Udyog
			<lb />
			Limited (Rs 128 crore) are prima facie bogus in nature.
			<lb />
			1. The 2 directors namely Mr. Akhil Sureka and Mr. Navneet Sureka are
			<lb />
			equally
			<lb />
			responsible
			<lb />
			for
			<lb />
			companies
			<lb />
			having
			<lb />
			shareholding/capital/profitsharing and should be held responsible for
			<lb />
			shortfall in cost of construction and land dues to Noida authorities.
			<lb />
			(Refer annexure S-11 page 2960 Supplementary report)
			<lb />
			2. Mr. Akhil Sureka opened bank account in SBI, Patiala, Faridabad in
			<lb />
			the name of Amrapali group companies and became a signatory.
			<lb />
			Amrapali did not have any base at Faridabad but Akhil sureka operates
			<lb />
			from Faridabad.
			<lb />
			3. Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited agreed to buy used construction
			<lb />
			equipments from Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited and paid Rs 8
			<lb />
			crore on 13 th December, 2016 and immediately transferred that funds
			<lb />
			to group companies of Sureka group namely Jotindra Steel and Tubes
			<lb />
			Limited and others by routing the funds from Amrapali Infrastructure
			<lb />
			Private Limited to Ultra Home Construction Private Limited.
			<lb />
			4. The FSI&apos;s bought by Sureka group (details given in Chart D) without
			<lb />
			making any payment. The modus operandi was funds were paid from
			<lb />
			one company and on the same day were transferred to other Sureka
			<lb />
			group company by routing in 2-3 Amrapali Group companies. This
			<lb />
			would not have been possible without active involvement of Mr. Akhil
			<lb />
			Sureka, who is bank signatory. We found on sample basis that the
			<lb />
			amount of Rs. 80 crore so routed was originally started from Amrapali.
			<lb />
			The amount so claimed of Rs 80 crore has been routed through various
			<lb />
			companies. this amount has been paid out of Amrapali group against
			<lb />
			purchases and payment made to various vendors namely Bhagirathi
			<lb />
			Tubes (Prop Mr. SHiv Kumar)etc. It was confirmed by supplier that he
			<lb />
			did not have any knowledge of any of the transactions and stated that
			<lb />
			all transactions were carried out in good faith under the advice &amp;
			<lb />
			instruction of Mr. Akhil Sureka. He further submitted that he never
			<lb />
			visited any of the Amrapali group office, he or his staff including
			<lb />
			employees has never visited any of the offices or site of Amrapali group.
			<lb />
			When questioned on supplies of scaffolding material and steel to and
			<lb />
			purchase sales reconciliation of supplies along with purchase orders
			<lb />
			and sales orders, he confirmed that it is not available. The amount so
			<lb />
			paid should be recovered from the SUREKA group companies. It was
			<lb />
			further confirmed that funds movement were also on behalf of Akhil
			<lb />
			Sureka carried out under good faith.
			<lb />
			5. An amount of Rs 55 crore was received from EXIM bank under line of
			<lb />
		</body>

			<lb />

		<body>
			credit for a project was to be done in Mozambique. The group submitted
			<lb />
			a bogus bank guarantee for the said advance to Mozambique client
			<lb />
			from a bank namely International Trade Bank Limited. Out of the
			<lb />
			funds of RS 55crore, major amount was transferred to Companies of
			<lb />
			Sureka group.
			<lb />
			On enquiry from the Amrapali Group we came to know that the bank
			<lb />
			guarantee was made available by Mr. Navneet Sureka, Managing
			<lb />
			Director of Mauria Udyog Limited and that no bank exist/existed by
			<lb />
			the name International Trade Bank Limited. It was also informed
			<lb />
			that the project was under direct control and supervision of Mr. Navneet
			<lb />
			Sureka. It shows active involvement of Mr. Navneet Sureka in the
			<lb />
			project. Mr. Prashant Kumar and Mr. Ram Kumar are the persons who
			<lb />
			were travelling to Mozambique and know about the project but we could
			<lb />
			not get the contact details of these 2 persons
			<lb />
			6. Quality Synthetics (Sureka Group) had given a loan to Amrapali
			<lb />
			Sapphire of RS 3 crore in March, 2009 at the rate of interest of 14% p.a.
			<lb />
			The company kept on paying to Quality Synthetics when it was having
			<lb />
			no funds for construction. The Amrapali Group was giving advances to
			<lb />
			various vendors/parties interest free and taking loan from Quality
			<lb />
			Synthetics, at the rate of 14% p.a. It is pertinent to note that the
			<lb />
			said amount of RS 3 crore along with all interest due totaling to RS
			<lb />
			3,86 crore was repaid in March, 2018 when there were no funds
			<lb />
			available for construction of flat and the case was pending before
			<lb />
			Honorable Supreme Court. The amount should be recovered
			<lb />
			immediately. It is pertinent to note that the company is not doing any
			<lb />
			business and are used just for the purpose of money laundering.
			<lb />
			7. Sureka group was a promoter and was providing the net worth
			<lb />
			certificate at the time of allotment of land to Noida/ Greater Noida
			<lb />
			authorities. At the time of making payment to the authorities for
			<lb />
			land funds were arranged by them.
			<lb />
			8. The directors other than the family have come and informed that they
			<lb />
			were not knowing about the operations of the company and not
			<lb />
			attended any board meeting and papers were send to their residence for
			<lb />
			signatures.
			<lb />
			9. There are many other high value transactions which we are in
			<lb />
			process of examination.
			<lb />
			10. Further to our supplementary report dated 30th April 2019. The
			<lb />
			directors of four companies of Sureka Group appeared before us from
			<lb />
			9th May 2019 to 18th May 2019, the directors gave their statement On
			<lb />
			the basis of interaction in the statement given by them. We found as
			<lb />
			follows.
			<lb />
			The four companies which bought FSI for the sham companies created
			<lb />
			for the purpose of money laundering. Neither the shareholders nor the
			<lb />
			directors of the companies were aware of any transactions carried out
			<lb />
			by these companies. It is worthwhile to note that Mr. Vishnu Sureka,
			<lb />
			Mr. Navneet Sureka and Mr. Akhil Sureka were neither the
			<lb />
			shareholders nor the directors as well didn&apos;t attend any board meeting
			<lb />
			including AGM/EGM. However, out of three who were signatory to the
			<lb />
			bank in all the companies. Directors were not aware of who have been
			<lb />
			the signatories. When questioned . Vishnu, navneet and akhil Sureka
			<lb />

			could not reply why they were the signatories when they were neither
			<lb />
			shareholders, directors, employees.
			<lb />
			Mauria Udyog Limited
			<lb />
			It was submitted in affidavit of Mauria Udyog Limited that Mauria
			<lb />
			Udyog Limited is a manufacturer and traders. It is stated that in
			<lb />
			addition, to manufacturing of LPG Cylinders, MUL also manufactures
			<lb />
			world class &quot;Terry Towel&quot; and &quot;Apparels&quot;. Further MUL also trades
			<lb />
			internationally &amp; domestically in Steel Products in addition to Ferrous &amp;
			<lb />
			Non Ferrous metals. MUL also deals in agro commodities such as soya
			<lb />
			bean, refined oil &amp; deoiled cake used as fodder for the cattle feed/poultry
			<lb />
			industry.(from affidavit of MUL para 5 page 2) We scrutinized the
			<lb />
			annual accounts of Mauria Udyog Limited and found that the
			<lb />
			product that is TMT bars are supplied only to Amrapali Group
			<lb />
			companies and a very minuscule quantity to other companies.
			<lb />
			In the 2010-11, TMT bar supplied for Rs. 52.97 crore and the payment
			<lb />
			received Rs 29 crore and that is also a major part of the payment of Rs
			<lb />
			16.5 crore was received in March.
			<lb />
			Similarly, in the year 2012-13, supplies were made of TMT bar and the
			<lb />
			payment was received in the month of March 2012 just before closing of
			<lb />
			the year.
			<lb />
			Suddenly in the year 2012-13, trend is changed and Ultra Home
			<lb />
			Construction Pvt Ltd gave an advance of Rs 33 crore on various dates
			<lb />
			which was returned subsequently in the month of February and March.
			<lb />
			The above transactions are dubious in nature because we scrutinized
			<lb />
			the supply bills of Mauria Udyog Limited and found that Mauria Udyog
			<lb />
			Limited has supplied TMT bars only to Amrapali group of companies. It
			<lb />
			is not an item in which Mauria Udyog Limited has dealt with any other
			<lb />
			party except a miniscule quantity of 2-3 customers who in turn has also
			<lb />
			supplied to Amrapali group. There was no purchase order from
			<lb />
			Amrapali group to Mauria Udyog Limited even the size of TMT bar
			<lb />
			was not mentioned on the invoice of Mauria Udyog Limited. The
			<lb />
			rate charged by Mauria Udyog Limited are higher in the range of
			<lb />
			15-20% then the market rate for which no satisfactory explanation
			<lb />
			was provided to us. In year 2013-14, Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd
			<lb />
			gave Rs 2.45 crore to Mauria Udyog Ltd which was returned on 29th
			<lb />
			March. It is surprising to find out that in the year 2014-15 in the
			<lb />
			month of May and June, Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd has
			<lb />
			accepted LCs from banks without booking of any purchase of
			<lb />
			material. The company&apos;s bank account is used for accommodation bills
			<lb />
			and Mauria Udyog Ltd was paid an excess of Rs 1.16 crore over and
			<lb />
			above an accommodation bill. In the year 2015-16, in the month of
			<lb />
			May Amrapali group started supplying TMT bars to Mauria Udyog
			<lb />
			Ltd, the purpose of supplies of TMT bars by Ultra Home
			<lb />
			Construction Pvt Ltd was not explained to us. In the year 2015-16,
			<lb />
			total supplies are to the extent of Rs 15.79 crore and in the year 2016-
			<lb />
			17 amounting to Rs 5.36 crore. In the year 2015-16, payments were
			<lb />
			made to Mauria Udyog Ltd on behalf of Shri Satguru Metalloys Pvt Ltd
			<lb />
			and Bhagirathi Tubes of Rs 8 crore and Rs 6.50 crore respectively. We
			<lb />
			were not explained any reasons for making such payments.
			<lb />
			It is pertinent to note that the company is not doing any business and
			<lb />

			are used just for the purpose of money laundering.
			<lb />
			Shri Narayan Rajkumar Merchants Ltd
			<lb />
			A group company of Sureka group paid Rs 1 crore to Amrapali Sapphire
			<lb />
			Developers Pvt Ltd. The entire amount along with interest payment of
			<lb />
			Rs 1.11 crore was paid to Shri Narayan Rajkumar Merchants Ltd,
			<lb />
			surprisingly Amrapali group didn&apos;t charge any interest on payments
			<lb />
			made to Sureka group of companies but it had paid without fail interest
			<lb />
			@ 13.45% to Shri Narayan Rajkumar Merchants Ltd. Further an
			<lb />
			amount of Rs 2 crore was paid to Shri Narayan Rajkumar
			<lb />
			Merchants Ltd on 31st March 2018, when the matter was pending
			<lb />
			before the Honourable Supreme Court. The amount of Rs 2 crore
			<lb />
			should immediately be recovered from Shri Narayan Rajkumar
			<lb />
			Merchants Ltd and Sureka family.
			<lb />
			It is pertinent to note that the company is not doing any business and
			<lb />
			are used just for the purpose of money laundering.
			<lb />
			Conclusion
			<lb />
			We are of the opinion that this company floated/formed for the purpose
			<lb />
			of money laundering and FSI sold to these companies were merely
			<lb />
			accounting and adjustment entries done by them transferring funds
			<lb />
			from one account to another as reported earlier in our supplementary
			<lb />
			report. The modus operandi adopted by Sureka family was the same as
			<lb />
			adopted by Amrapali Group i.e. they formed the companies, their
			<lb />
			employees who were paid salaries in the range of Rs 20,000-Rs 60,000
			<lb />
			the shareholders and directors in these companies. It is pertinent to
			<lb />
			note that their signatory to the bank are family members.
			<lb />
			Mr. Navneet Sureka and Mr. Akhil Sureka used these companies for the
			<lb />
			purpose of money laundering of funds of Amrapali Group.
			<lb />
			The bank guarantee was bogus and we couldn&apos;t find the bank name
			<lb />
			which issued the bank guarantee, it appears that there was a criminal
			<lb />
			conspiracy and the bank was not in existence.
			<lb />
			Mr. Navneet Sureka was in full control of Amrapali group companies
			<lb />
			which is very clear and can be understood from the transactions of
			<lb />
			donation. On the instructions of Mr. Navneet Sureka, GM/DGM
			<lb />
			accounts Mr. Adhikari was transferring funds to the trust from various
			<lb />
			group companies of Amrapali as and when desired by him and
			<lb />
			instructed by him.
			<lb />
			None of the directors ever attended a board meeting it was informed
			<lb />
			that the directors signed the paper under the instructions and
			<lb />
			directions of Mr. Akhil Sureka. The fact was accepted by Mr. Akhil
			<lb />
			Sureka. This proves that there was non compliances of holding board
			<lb />
			meetings and AGM as required u/s 174 of Companies Act, 2013.
			<lb />
			Further, the bank signatories to the bank are Mr. Vishnu Sureka and
			<lb />
			Mr. Navneet Sureka as an authorized signatory. In what capacity they
			<lb />
			were the signatory, they could not explain and it was told by Mr. Akhil
			<lb />
			Sureka and Mr. Vishnu Sureka that the directors were having full faith
			<lb />
			upon them therefore authorized them as bank signatory surprisingly,
			<lb />
			directors were not the signatory this is an unique case which is difficult
			<lb />
			to found in the corporate history.

			24. Misuse of Bank Loan funds (Volume II Page No. 426-457)
			<lb />
			Diversion of loan funds for unapproved purposes
			<lb />
			Amrapali group of companies obtained funds primarily from following
			<lb />
			sources:
			<lb />
			a)
			<lb />
			Home buyers funds against construction linked progress;
			<lb />
			b)
			<lb />
			In the form of loans (term loan, working capital/cash credit limits)
			<lb />
			from banks against construction linked progress; and
			<lb />
			c)
			<lb />
			Homebuyers also availed housing loans from banks for purchasing
			<lb />
			flats in Amrapali projects
			<lb />
			Banks granted loans to Amrapali group under certain terms and
			<lb />
			conditions which included utilisation of loan funds for:
			<lb />
			a)
			<lb />
			Payment of cost of land and lease rental to Noida authorities;
			<lb />
			b)
			<lb />
			Payment of construction cost of projects.
			<lb />
			Observation
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			The amounts disbursed were not utilised for payment of cost of
			<lb />
			land or for payment of lease rentals or for payment of construction cost.
			<lb />
			The banks did not monitor utilisation of funds granted by them. In
			<lb />
			fact, these funds were diverted as loans to related and/or unrelated
			<lb />
			entities which was ultimately utilised in building assets/purposes
			<lb />
			which were unapproved by the banks. The banks acted as mute
			<lb />
			spectator to unapproved diversion which was almost happening
			<lb />
			evidently in all banking transactions.
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			While obtaining loan funds, Amrapali group hypothecated land on
			<lb />
			which project was being undertaken as well as building under
			<lb />
			construction as well as material lying at project, leaving nothing with
			<lb />
			home buyers for recovery of their payments.
			<lb />
			3.
			<lb />
			It is also observed that the loan funds were routed through several
			<lb />
			bank accounts of the same company and thereafter routed to third
			<lb />
			parties whereby trying to misguide the flow of funds. It clearly means
			<lb />
			these transactions had no substance and were made only to mislead.

			3. Investor Clinic Infratech Private Limited
			<lb />
			It is evident from the books of accounts that loan funds were utilized for
			<lb />
			payment of RS. 2 crore who had invoiced the company for brokerage
			<lb />
			expense which is not construction linked payment. Brokerage is an
			<lb />
			indirect expense, incurred for the sale of flat. The banks had granted
			<lb />
			funds for construction activity and not for sale activity. This is clearly
			<lb />
			diversion of loan funds to unapproved means.

			RS. 2 crore was paid as advance on 9 th October 2010 against which

			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			Cozy Habitat Builders Pvt. Ltd.
			<lb />
			It is holding 25% shareholding in Heart Beat City Project Controlled by
			<lb />
			three Companies namely Three Platinum, Softtech Pvt. Ltd., Pebbles
			<lb />
			Prolease Pvt. Ltd. and baseline Infra Developers Pvt. Ltd.
			<lb />
			Cozy Habitat Builders Pvt. Ltd. Received Rs. 30,00,000 from
			<lb />
			Amrapaliand Paid Rs. 15,00,000 to Mr. Shiv Priya. We are therefore the
			<lb />
			opinion thatthat Rs. 15,00,000 should be recovered from Cozy Habitat
			<lb />
			Builders Pvt. Ltd. and be deposited to the treasury of the Honourable
			<lb />
			Supreme court.
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			DFC Projects Private Limited
			<lb />
			The management of DFC Projects Pvt. Ltd. as informed were providing
			<lb />
			services to Amrapali Group for arranging funds. We found that there
			<lb />
			invoices were paid within a period of 2-3 days from the date of raising
			<lb />
			the invoices which raises a doubt whether there were the invoices raised
			<lb />
			for services rendered or were adjustments. The properties/flats were
			<lb />
			booked in the name of DFC group about which the directors
			<lb />
			Mr.Pankaj Sharma and Mr.VinayRai showed total ignorance.
			<lb />
			Consequent to the questioning they agreed to surrender the flats.
			<lb />
			(Refer ANNEXURE XIII.6)
			<lb />
			3.
			<lb />
			Chaudhary ENT Udyog (Supplier of Bricks)
			<lb />
			As per the copy of the receipts issued by Amrapali Group of Companies,
			<lb />
			it has been observed that the party had paid INR 500,000 in cash on
			<lb />
			24 th February, 2017 vide receipt number 3074 Dated 24.02.2017 (Copy
			<lb />
			enclosed) on account of flat Number T6-G06 that was allotted to the
			<lb />
			said party in Amrapali Grand on account of outstanding amounts due
			<lb />
			from Amrapali Group of Companies. The Company has not recorded the
			<lb />
			receipt of the aforesaid amount of INR 500,000 in their books of
			<lb />
			account.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			157
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			This shows that this money has been taken away by the Management
			<lb />
			and hence should be recovered from them.
			<lb />
			It was further informed by the supplier, that Amrapali Group of
			<lb />
			Companies committed a fraud since this flat is already sold to Mr.
			<lb />
			Nikhil Kumar Datta. The party came to know of this on 31 st August,
			<lb />
			2018, when he received a letter dated 18 th August, 2018 from IDBI
			<lb />
			Bank seeking payment for overdue amount in the name of Mr. Nikhil
			<lb />
			Kumar Datta.
			<lb />
			This a serious kind of fraud done by the Amrapali Group of Companies.
			<lb />
			The party has even written a letter to Police, Uttar Pradesh against the
			<lb />
			aforesaid fraud. Copy of the said letter to police along with the letter
			<lb />
			issued by IDBI Bank to Mr. Nikhil Kumar Datta has been enclosed as
			<lb />
			Annexure 34-D.
			<lb />
			4.
			<lb />
			Closing Inventory as per Audited Financial Statement as on
			<lb />
			31 st March, 2015
			<lb />
			There is no stock list, valuation certificate or any documentary evidence
			<lb />
			regarding physical verification with the company or in the Statutory
			<lb />
			Auditors file. We are of the view that these are only arbitrary figures
			<lb />
			shown in the Audited Financial Statements.
			<lb />
			5.
			<lb />
			Fixed Assets
			<lb />
			a)
			<lb />
			Building Account
			<lb />
			During the financial year 2013-14 a sum of INR 80.34 crores has been
			<lb />
			capitalized to Building A/c by crediting various purchase/expense
			<lb />
			account as per journal voucher passed on 31/03/14 as per the copy of
			<lb />
			the voucher given below.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			158
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			This entry seems to be a mere adjustment entry since there is no
			<lb />
			Valuation report on the basis of which these expenses are capitalized to
			<lb />
			Building account and no working sheet of the same is available.
			<lb />
			We are of the view that this amount has been taken away by the
			<lb />
			Management of the Company and this amount should be recovered
			<lb />
			from them.
			<lb />
			6.
			<lb />
			Royalgolf Link City Projects Private Limited
			<lb />
			It has been observed that a sum of INR 4 Crores approximately is
			<lb />
			recoverable from M/s Royalgolf Link City Projects Private Limited
			<lb />
			(Royalgolf) in the books of Amrapali Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. on account
			<lb />
			of supply of precast materials.
			<lb />
			Mr. Shiv Priya was the Director of this Company from 26.9.2014 (Date
			<lb />
			of Incorporation of
			<lb />
			the company) to 3.4.2017. This Company was
			<lb />
			formed as SPV for Cozy/Bagadiya Group of Companies with Mr. Shiv
			<lb />
			Priya as the Director of Royalgolf launched for project &quot;Hemisphere&quot; .
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group of Companies through Ultra Home Construction Private
			<lb />
			Limited and Amrapali Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. had given loan to
			<lb />
			Royalgolf mainly for purchase of land and its registration thereof. A
			<lb />
			dispute arose amongst the Company in six months of its operations and
			<lb />
			on 1 st April, 2015 a Loan Settlement Agreement was signed between
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group, Cozy/ Bagadiya Group vide which 30 Villas valuing
			<lb />
			approximately INR 50.47 cr. were earmarked for Amrapali Group.
			<lb />
			Amrapali Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Infra) was the Supplier of Precast
			<lb />
			Building material and they were to supply these materials for
			<lb />
			&quot;Hemisphere&quot; project worth INR 67 crores approximately. However,
			<lb />
			Infra could supply only 24% of the contract value and due to difference
			<lb />
			between Amrapali Group and Royalgolf, the contract was terminated in
			<lb />
			June, 2017.
			<lb />
			Proceedings under IBC 2016 were initiated by Royalgolf against Infra
			<lb />
			and they filed a claim for INR 17.50 crores with the IRP appointed by
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			159
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			NCLT. The matter is still in dispute at NCLT for the claimed loan of
			<lb />
			17.50 crores lodged by Royalgolf on Amrapali Infra.
			<lb />
			7.
			<lb />
			Hire Charges Received
			<lb />
			The Group companies had paid hire/erection charges from the various
			<lb />
			group companies for example Amrapali Infrastructure received
			<lb />
			Rs.170.15 crores during the period 2008-15. (Volume II -Page 306) It
			<lb />
			was further observed that there have been no details regarding the
			<lb />
			equipment given on hire to each company and the basis of raising bills
			<lb />
			on account of hire charges. It seems that bills for hire charges have
			<lb />
			been raised on arbitrary basis and there are no comparative quotations
			<lb />
			for the same available.
			<lb />
			26. STATUS OF DATA AVAILABILITY
			<lb />
			There is overlapping in accounting data from April 2016 to September
			<lb />
			2016 and we found that few entries were entered in FARVISION and few
			<lb />
			in the tally for the said period.
			<lb />
			Due to scarcity of time audit not completed of following
			<lb />
			companies/entities/persons:
			<lb />
			•
			<lb />
			Amrapali Princely Estate Pvt. Ltd.
			<lb />
			•
			<lb />
			Jotindra steels &amp; tubes Ltd.
			<lb />
			The following companies were carved out by Amrapali Group, which are
			<lb />
			being audited and a report on these companies will be submitted.
			<lb />
			1)
			<lb />
			Prem Mishra Indore.
			<lb />
			2)
			<lb />
			O2 Valley Noida
			<lb />
			3)
			<lb />
			Heart beat city projects Noida.
			<lb />
			27. M.S. Dhoni
			<lb />
			It is observed that the Company Amrapali Sapphire Developers Private
			<lb />
			Limited has paid a sum of Rs. 6.52 Crores out of the total amount of Rs.
			<lb />
			42.22 Crores paid from the Amrapali group of Companies to Rhiti
			<lb />
			Sports Management Private Limited during the years 2009 -2015.
			<lb />
			This sum has been paid on account of Agreements executed by Shri
			<lb />
			Anil Kumar Sharma, CMD for and on behalf of Amrapali Group of
			<lb />
			Companies with Rhiti Sports Management Private Limited. There is no
			<lb />
			resolution on record authorizing Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma, CMD to enter
			<lb />
			into an agreement on behalf of all Amrapali group of Companies.
			<lb />
			There were various agreements as per details given below:
			<lb />
			a) Endorsement Agreement dated 22 nd November, 2009
			<lb />
			According to this agreement Mr. Mahendra Singh Dhoni will make
			<lb />
			himself available to the Chairmen for three days along with one
			<lb />
			representative of Rhiti Sports. There are no documents held on record
			<lb />
			for compliance of this condition.
			<lb />
			b) According to the Agreement for sponsorship dated 20 th March, 2015,
			<lb />
		</body>

			<lb />

		<body>
			Amrapali Group of Companies got right to advertise as Logo Space at
			<lb />
			various places in the IPL 2015 for Chennai Super Kings. It is observed
			<lb />
			that this Agreement is on plain paper and executed only between
			<lb />
			Amrapali and Rhiti Sports Management Private Limited and there are
			<lb />
			no signatories on behalf of Chennai Super Kings to this Agreement. No
			<lb />
			Resolution in favour of Shri Arun Pandey, Signatory of Rhiti Sports
			<lb />
			Management Private Limited is attached with the said Agreement.
			<lb />
			This clearly shows that these Agreements have just been made for
			<lb />
			payment of amounts to Rhiti Sports Management Private Limited
			<lb />
			Company are Sham Agreements and made just for making payments to
			<lb />
			Rhiti Sports Management Private Limited. We feel that Home Buyers
			<lb />
			money has been diverted illegally and wrongly to Rhiti Sports
			<lb />
			Management Private Limited and should be recovered from them as the
			<lb />
			said Agreement in our opinion do not stand the test of Law.
			<lb />
			Amrapali Mahi Developers Pvt Ltd
			<lb />
			• Mr. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, husband of Ms. Sakshi Singh
			<lb />
			Dhoni (director of company) was the brand ambassador of
			<lb />
			Amrapali group and have carried out a number of transactions
			<lb />
			with respect to endorsement of Amrapali group&apos;s projects. He
			<lb />
			has entered in agreements with other group company.
			<lb />
			• We are informed verbally that this company was incorporated
			<lb />
			for development of a project in Ranchi. An MOU was also
			<lb />
			entered between the parties though we were not provided a copy
			<lb />
			of that. We understand that copy of MOU is available with Mr.
			<lb />
			Adhikari.
			<lb />
			In Amrapali Sapphire Developers Private Limited a Flat (Flat No -TC-
			<lb />
			P04) has been booked in the name of Rhiti Sports Management Private
			<lb />
			Limited by passing an adjustment entry. However Mr Sanjay Pandey of
			<lb />
			Rhiti Sports Management Pvt Ltd denied booking of any such flat. He
			<lb />
			also confirmed that neither the company nor any individual has any flat
			<lb />
			in Amrapli Group. Mr Pandey confirmed that no due diligence was
			<lb />
			carried out before accepting the brand endorsement though he informed
			<lb />
			that brand value and paying capacity was seen. No Agreement was
			<lb />
			provided though it was agreed that it would be provided by 11 th March,
			<lb />
			2019. Expenses were reimbursed to Rhiti Entertainment Private Limited
			<lb />
			a group company, without any agreement.
			<lb />
			28. Properties alienated
			<lb />
			Chart D
			<lb />
			The group started alienated the properties starting from 2015-16 , and
			<lb />
			many properties were transferred when the case was pending before the
			<lb />
			Honourable Court with a criminal mind to alienate the assets. The
			<lb />
			funds were routed from one account to another and properties were
			<lb />
			registered in benami names.
			<lb />
			For the assets sold up to 31/3/2015, we didn&apos;t generally find anything

			Gandhi are the directors of the company M/s Surbhaee Advertising
			<lb />
			Private Limited.

			<lb />
			Limited (a company owned by him &amp; his family) for Rs 1.59 crore for
			<lb />
			which no agreement was provided by them.
			<lb />
			(ii) It was informed that principal business of the company is
			<lb />
			Advertising of Projects. However no income has been earned from its
			<lb />
			principal business activity or any other source.
			<lb />
			(iii) The company is holding an immovable property at A3A Maharani
			<lb />
			Bagh, New Delhi admeasuring approximately 800 sq yards.
			<lb />
			It is also stated that the family of Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma is residing in
			<lb />
			the same house against which no rent deed is agreed between Mr. Anil
			<lb />
			Kumar Sharma &amp; Mr. Paramjit Gandhi (Surbhaee Advertising Private
			<lb />
			Limited)
			<lb />
			(iv) When asked to Mr. Paramjit Gandhi who resides in Ghaziabad that
			<lb />
			why he purchased the property in New Delhi 4-5 years back, he replied
			<lb />
			that he wanted to shift to this property.
			<lb />
			However the fact is that he has never shifted to Delhi &amp; all the
			<lb />
			renovation &amp; maintenance work was overlooked by Mr. Anil Kumar
			<lb />
			Sharma.
			<lb />
			(v) The company has also taken loan of Rs. 25 crores from Aditya
			<lb />
			Birla Finance Limited in the FY 2016-17 against the hypothecation of

			(vii) The company has also received Rs. 2.35 crores &amp; Rs. 3.55 crores
			<lb />
			from Mr. Ritik Kumar Sinha &amp; Miss Swapnil Shikha respectively, also
			<lb />
			directors in M/s Surbhaee Advertising Private Limited in the FY 2016-
			<lb />
			17 out of funds received from Amrapali group of companies enrouted
			<lb />
			via the account of Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma.
			<lb />
			(viii) It implies that the property which was bought for Rs 1.59 crore,
			<lb />
			the amount has been funded out of Amrapali Group funds routed by
			<lb />
			Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma who is family member and from them to
			<lb />
			Surbhaee Advertising Private Limited. Two of his family members were
			<lb />
			made director to have a control on the property of a value of Rs 50 Cr. It
			<lb />
			further proves that the difference between the value of property and the
			<lb />
			price at which it was transferred to Mr. Paramjit Gandhi was paid in
			<lb />
			cash out of cash amount received in Amrapali Group by booking of
			<lb />
			bogus expenditure and selling the flats undervalued.
			<lb />
			Opinion
			<lb />
			Based on the facts stated above, in our opinion the property at A3A
			<lb />
			Maharani Bagh, New Delhi is a &quot;Property&quot; belongs to Mr. Anil Kumar
			<lb />
			Sharma/Amrapali group held in the name of the company M/s
			<lb />
			Surbhaee Advertising Private Limited.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			Chart M of Affidavit submitted on 3 Rd December, 2018 are mere
			<lb />
			adjustment entries (Refer Annexure S-10 of supplementary report
			<lb />
			page no. 2958-2959).
			<lb />
			We found that the buyer is not aware of that he has purchased any land
			<lb />
			for the mentioned facility. We further found that there is no account in
			<lb />
			the name of the said buyers in many cases to whom the facilities were
			<lb />
			sold. It is recommended that the facilities sold so far should be
			<lb />
			attached.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			sources that the group diverted funds in the range of 500-600 crore in

			the said party along with interest of Rs.7.24 Crores (computed at
			<lb />
			12% p.a. simple interest) in view of the undermentioned
			<lb />
			observations:
			<lb />
			• The clause 12 of MOU dated 11 th November, 2006 clearly states that
			<lb />
			the profit would be divided amongst the partners in the profit-sharing
			<lb />
			ratio.
			<lb />
			• The Audited Financial Statements of the firm for the financial year
			<lb />
			2013-14 reflect the firms Reserve and Surplus as Rs.35,433 only.
			<lb />
			• No other clause in the MOU states regarding payment of Interest on
			<lb />
			Capital.
			<lb />
			• It is not understood that how the said Company has withdrawn
			<lb />
			Rs.10.10 Crores on an investment of Rs.3 Crores invested for only a
			<lb />
			period of 1.5 years from this partnership firm. No satisfactory
			<lb />
			explanation has been given to us by the Management.
			<lb />
			Even the ledger account sent by the said Company confirms that they
			<lb />
			owe Rs.7.10 Crores to this firm as on 31 st March, 2018 after which an
			<lb />
			entry has been passed in the books of accounts.
			<lb />
			As per supplementary partnership cum deed of retirement dated 31 st
			<lb />
			Day of March, 2014, 2 partners namely M/s Patel Engineering Limited
			<lb />
			and M/s Advance Construction Company Private Limited have retired
			<lb />
			from the partnership and M/s Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited
			<lb />
			has joined as a partner with M/s Ultra Home Construction Private
			<lb />
			Limited. However, the amount of Rs.7.10 Crores was not adjusted and
			<lb />
			was shown as payable to Amrapali Patel Platinum by Advance
			<lb />
			Construction Company Private Limited since 2014 till 2018. Further,
			<lb />
			The Audited Financial Statements of Amrapali Infrastructure Private
			<lb />
			Limited for the financial year 2013-14 and thereafter don&apos;t reflect any
			<lb />
			investment in Amrapali Patel Platinum.
			<lb />
			All the aforesaid facts clearly depict that the aforesaid supplementary
			<lb />
			partnership cum deed of retirement, ledger of Amrapali Patel Platinum
			<lb />
			in the books of Advance Construction Company Private Limited are
			<lb />
			contradictory and fabricated.

			The aforesaid amount of Rs.10.52 crores should be recovered from
			<lb />
			the said party along with interest of Rs.17.78 croresupto 31 st
			<lb />
			March 2018 (computed at 12% p.a. simple interest) in view of the
			<lb />
			undermentioned observations:
			<lb />
			a. It is not understood that how the said Company has withdrawn
			<lb />
			Rs.14.82 crores on an investment of Rs.4.30 crores. No satisfactory
			<lb />
			explanation has been given to us by the Management.
			<lb />
			b. As informed to us by Advance Construction vide their mail dated
			<lb />
			6 th March, 2019, the Company had effectively retired from the said
			<lb />
			partnership and all the project related responsibilities were handed over
			<lb />
			to Mr. Sharma, (of Ultra Home) and the same was evidenced by an MOU
			<lb />
			dated 17 th January, 2006.
			<lb />
			This explanation given by Advance Construction is not satisfactory
			<lb />
			since the Company is continuing as a partner and the subsequent
			<lb />
			Audited Financial Statements have also been signed by Advance
			<lb />
			Construction as a Partner sharing profit/ loss. This shows that MOU as
			<lb />
			referred by Advance Construction is bogus/ legally not enforceable.
			<lb />
			c. Further, Partnership firm has been legally dissolved as per
			<lb />
			dissolution deed dated 2 nd Day of April, 2018. This shows that Advance
			<lb />
			Construction is continuing as a partner in this firm till this date. It has
			<lb />
			also been mentioned in the dissolution deed that the accounts of the
			<lb />
			firm have been made upto 31 st March, 2014 to the mutual satisfaction
			<lb />
			of all the parties here to. Even this dissolution deed is dated 2 nd April,
			<lb />
			2018 doesn&apos;t seem to be genuine in view of the following observations:
			<lb />
			i. It refers to the Audited Financial Statements for the financial year
			<lb />
			2013-14, whereas the Audited Financial Statements are available
			<lb />
			upto financial year 2014-15.
			<lb />
			ii. The deed of dissolution has not been notarized.
			<lb />
			iii. The Witnesses to this Dissolution Deed are incomplete in so far,
			<lb />
			name and address of witness number 1 is not there and signature
			<lb />
			of witness number 2 is not there.
			<lb />
			iv. There is no copy of the resolution available authorizing Mr. Shiv
			<lb />
			Priya to sign the deed of dissolution.
			<lb />
			The Company has made cash payments to various parties exceeding INR
			<lb />
			20,000 in contravention to The Income Tax Act 1961, to the tune of INR
			<lb />
			45,768,482 in just one company namely Amrapali Sapphire Developers
			<lb />
			Pvt Ltd. This is just tip of the iceberg and actual amount may be much
			<lb />
			much higher. Most of these payments are not supported by evidence. It
			<lb />
			was further observed that neither the Statutory auditor has mentioned
			<lb />
			these cash payments exceedingRs.20,000 in his report and nor any
			<lb />
			addition has been made by the Income Tax department in framing the
			<lb />

			10. Balance due to Noida Authority and Greater Noida Authority as
			<lb />
			per affidavits submitted by them before Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court of India
			<lb />
			The Group paid only 1 st installment to Noida and Greater Noida
			<lb />
			authorities and did not pay in almost all the cases the installment due,
			<lb />
			lease rent and interest under one pretext or another. The Group has not
			<lb />
			made any provision for additional interest due to delay in payments of
			<lb />
			installments. We had issued a letter dated 30 th January, 2019 to Noida
			<lb />
			Authority to send us the complete information/ documents regarding
			<lb />
			the amounts due from Amrapali Group of Companies. But we have not
			<lb />
			received any such details from the Noida Authority. In these
			<lb />
			circumstances balance due to Noida Authority Couldn&apos;t be verified by
			<lb />
			us.
			<lb />
			It was further informed to us by the management of Amrapali that
			<lb />
			Noida and Greater Noida authorities have submitted three claims before
			<lb />
			the Honourable Supreme court. We were produced one of the annexure
			<lb />
			of the affidavit and the same is reproduced below.
			<lb />
			We found that Noida/Greater Noida authority administration was non
			<lb />
			active for reasons best known to them. Amrapali group never paid the
			<lb />
			2nd installment but Noida and Greater Noida authorities continued to
			<lb />
			allot large size land to them without fail. They never bothered to issue
			<lb />
			even a notice to be pasted at site for the information of home buyers
			<lb />
			that the land dues had not been paid so that home buyers could be
			<lb />
			cautious and on alert. In spite of non receipt of any installment, lease
			<lb />
			rent, interest they were very trumped in giving no objection certificate
			<lb />
			for the borrowings to Amrapali group from different sources like JP
			<lb />
			Morgan, ICICI and Aditya Birla Pvt equity funds and/or various banks.

			(b). The report also reveals various disturbing features that no accounts
			<lb />
			were prepared from 2015 to 2018 and money was withdrawn out of it and
			<lb />
			diverted from one company to another. The entire transactions were not
			<lb />
			being entered into Tally. The opening balances were not entered properly.
			<lb />
			In April 2015, the Amrapali Group introduced Far Vision an ERP, which

			was also not implemented properly.
			<lb />
			(c). There was no information about purchases from the supplier. During

			a search in 2013, it was held by Income Tax Authorities that purchases are

			<lb />
			Bogus expenses and cash has been surrendered by Amrapali Group in the

			<lb />

			<lb />
			towards brokerage.
			<lb />
			(e). The company has also made unusual cash payments in the financial
			<lb />
			year 2016-2017 by transferring cash to the Site, but the same is not
			<lb />
			supported/authenticated by the Site Cash In-charge. Certain payments
			<lb />
			have not been found to be genuine.
			<lb />
			(f). The Group Companies purchased gold bar worth Rs.5.88 crore, which
			<lb />
			is a personal expense and it should be recovered from the management of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<body>
			the company.
			<lb />
			(g). The amount disbursed by Banks was not utilised for constructions of
			<lb />
			projects and the funds of homebuyers as well as the amount disbursed
			<lb />
			from the Banks were diverted to unapproved uses, namely, creation of
			<lb />
			personal assets of Directors; creation of assets in closely held companies by
			<lb />
			Directors along with their partners and relatives; funds were used for
			<lb />
			personal expenses of Directors; funds were advanced to unrelated entities
			<lb />
			for several years without levying interest on unrealized amount, the
			<lb />
			recoverable amount from third parties has amounted to Rs.326 crores;
			<lb />
			creation of discreet projects for personal income; and construction of assets
			<lb />
			for other projects.
			<lb />
			(h). There were negligence and non-monitoring by Bankers. There was a
			<lb />
			transfer of funds from one company to another company to a third
			<lb />
			company and so on and so forth on the same dates would not have been
			<lb />
			possible without the active support of the Bankers. They turned blind eye
			<lb />
			to all the transfers and did not inquire, which were being routed every day.
			<lb />
			If they had been alive to the situation, the Management would not have
			<lb />
			dared to launder the money from one company to another according to
			<lb />
			their whims and fancies and the Bankers are solely responsible for the
			<lb />
			negligence on their part. The Bankers did not do any monitoring. The
			<lb />
			Bank of Maharashtra and Andhra Bank also failed to do the monitoring.
			<lb />
			Even the basic checks were foregone. The Banks acted as a mute spectator
			<lb />
			to unapproved diversion which was happening evidently in all banking
			<lb />
		</body>

		<body>
			transactions. Even, Noida and Greater Noida Authorities were grossly
			<lb />
			negligent in reviewing and monitoring the progress of projects and did not
			<lb />
			take any action for non-payment of land dues and continued to allot land
			<lb />
			to Amrapali Group for the reasons best known to them.
			<lb />
			(i).
			<lb />
			The Directors along with trust partners discreetly divided the projects
			<lb />
			into two parts:
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			Projects in which home buyers funds were received and funds
			<lb />
			were diverted from these projects;
			<lb />
			(ii)
			<lb />
			Projects to which home funds were diverted. These projects
			<lb />
			were subsequently separated/demerged from Amrapali Group,
			<lb />
			e.g., Heartbeat City, La Residentia, Vinayaka Square.
			<lb />
			(j).
			<lb />
			Several dummy companies were formed in the names of office boys
			<lb />
			and peons. Technically, the allotments at the initial stage were void ab-
			<lb />
			initio. The amount received by the Companies from home-buyers was more
			<lb />
			than the amount spent on construction and for payment of the land. The
			<lb />
			sole objective of taking a loan was to divert the funds to other ventures to
			<lb />
			create assets in the name of family members and to make movies. Villas
			<lb />
			were bought at tourist destination for fun at the expenses of the middle
			<lb />
			class and low-income group people.
			<lb />
			(k). Several companies were created solely for the purpose of routing
			<lb />
			funds. These companies did not have any material transaction as per the
			<lb />
			main object for which they were incorporated and did not have a business
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			189
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			since their incorporation.
			<lb />
			62. As is apparent from the report, several companies were created only
			<lb />
			to route the funds and transactions consisting of office boys, persons with
			<lb />
			no income and dummy companies in which family members and relatives
			<lb />
			were inducted as members only for few transactions, which are as under:
			<lb />
			(1)
			<lb />
			Jhamb Finance &amp; Leasing Private Limited.
			<lb />
			It was under the control of Mr. Chander Wadhwa, CFO. It has
			<lb />
			advanced loans amounting to Rs.875 crores to related and unrelated
			<lb />
			entities, which are recoverable.
			<lb />
			(2)

			Gaurisuta Infrastructure Private Limited
			<lb />
			It was also created for diverted funds.
			<lb />
			(3)
			<lb />
			Neelkanth Buildcraft Private Limited
			<lb />
			Similarly it was formed for the purpose of buying shares from J.P.
			<lb />
			Morgan at exorbitant rates, consisiting of office boys and relatives of Mr.

			Anil Mittal, Statutory Auditor.
			<lb />
			(4)

			used for money laundering.
			<lb />
			(6) Rudraksha Infracity Private Limited
			<lb />
			It was consisting of office boys and relative of Anil Mittal, Statutory
			<lb />
			Auditor, which was created to receive money from Mannat Buildcraft
			<lb />
			Private Limited and to transfer it to J.P. Morgan Investments by purchasing
			<lb />
			it at exorbitant rates and for no other transaction.
			<lb />
			(7)
			<lb />
			Mannat Buidcraft Private Limited
			<lb />
			It was created for money laundering of Rs.120 crores, only for few
			<lb />
			transactions.
			<lb />
			(8)
			<lb />
			Amrapali Magadh Developers Private Limited
			<lb />
			It did not carry out any principal business activity. The purpose of its
			<lb />

			<lb />
			cash.
			<lb />
			(9)
			<lb />

			<lb />
			It received share capital in cash and all the expenses were paid in

			<lb />
			(12) Hawthrone Intellect Management Solutions Private Limited
			<lb />
			It had paid up capital of Rs.1 lakh and incurred losses of Rs.2.33
			<lb />
			crores. The expenses are inflated to wipe off the various loans and
			<lb />
			advances received from sister concerns. The entries have found to be
			<lb />
			dubious and the amount of loss of Rs.2.33 crores to be recovered from the
			<lb />
			Directors as it was wiping off the amount of the homebuyers.
			<lb />
			(13) Amrapali Smart City Private Limited
			<lb />
			It is stated in the report that plot allotted to Amrapali Smart City
			<lb />
			Private Limited was cancelled, therefore, money receivable from Greater
			<lb />
			Noida is Rs.18.35 crores.
			<lb />
			(14) Amrapali Biotech India Private Limited
			<lb />
			It was created for routing funds. The ICD&apos;s are either from the group

			adjustment entries.
			<lb />
			(15) Amrapali Healthcare Private Limited
			<lb />
			It formed the property by funds of Ultra Home Construction Private

			(16) Amrapali Centurian Park Private Limited
			<lb />
			The Forensic Auditors have found bogus booking of expenditure and
			<lb />
			certain adjustments against bogus billings of River Sand for an amount of
			<lb />
			Rs.3.60 crores.
			<lb />
			(17) Amrapali Leisure Valley Private Limited
			<lb />
			Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha became the Director and thereafter most
			<lb />
			diversions of funds took place through the current account. The funds of
			<lb />
			the company were transferred to and fro with companies in which Surekha
			<lb />
			family had control. FSI was sold without taking approval from Great Noida
			<lb />
			Authority. The money received from Bihari High Rise Private Limited was
			<lb />
			diverted to Jotindra Steel &amp; Tubes Limited and Ozone GSP Infratech by
			<lb />
			routing it through Ultra Home Construction Private Limited. Bihariji High
			<lb />
			Rise Private Limited, Jotindra Steel &amp; Tubes Limited and Mauria Udyog
			<lb />
			Limited are owned by Surekha family. There was bogus booking of
			<lb />
			expenditure since March 2018 also of Rs.2.86 crores and other bogus
			<lb />
			entries of huge amounts.
			<lb />
			(18) Amrapali Homes
			<lb />

			<lb />
			and the same be recovered.
			<lb />
			(19) La Residentia Developers Private Limited
			<lb />
			The consortium of five members was created, which was controlled by
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group. The shareholders and directors were just acting faces for
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			193
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			outsiders. There was diversion of funds since beginning of the project
			<lb />
			itself. The company purchased raw material from Amrapali Infrastructure
			<lb />
			Private Limited amounting to Rs.67.45 lakhs, but not even a single penny
			<lb />
			was paid since then. The loan amount of Rs. 49 crores were taken. On the
			<lb />
			other hand, there was withdrawal by Directors and advances given to the
			<lb />
			related parties and entities. Amrapali Group transferred some of their
			<lb />
			buyers to La Residentia Developers Private Limited and the payment for the
			<lb />
			same was received by Amrapali Group. They were reflected as customers
			<lb />
			in the customer data of Amrapali Group. The company is using the brand
			<lb />
			name/trademark of Amrapali Group on its letterheads.
			<lb />
			(20) Amrapali Homes Projects Limited
			<lb />
			Mr. Prem Mishra was given Rs.12.40 crores for purchase of land since
			<lb />
			1 st April 2008, out of which Rs.10 crores are still receivable from him.
			<lb />
			Rs.55.87 crores are recoverable amounts and out of which Rs.20.75 crores
			<lb />
			pertain to advances against land which has not been charged to cost of
			<lb />
			construction.
			<lb />
			(21) Ultra Home Construction Private Limited
			<lb />
			The flats were allotted on false promises, forged documents and
			<lb />
			certain allotted flats did not exist in the approved building plan.
			<lb />
			Shareholders used the money of home buyers for allotment of shares in the
			<lb />
			company.
			<lb />
			The records of certain lands purchased by the company
			<lb />
			disappeared, the details of which have been given. The company has
			<lb />
			advances recoverable amounting to Rs.111 crores.

		<listBibl>
			(22) Amrapali Grand
			<lb />
			Bihariji Ispat Udyog Limited always had negative capital. Loans and
			<lb />
			advances amounting to Rs.25.73 crores have been diverted. The other
			<lb />
			diversions have also been noticed in the report.
			<lb />
			(23) Amrapali Eden Park Developers Private Limited
			<lb />
			There is no substance in the nature of transactions of the company.
			<lb />
			It was for routing funds form one entity to another to hidden objective.
			<lb />
			Banks loans were diverted as advances to third parties. The funds were
			<lb />
			diverted for purposes other than development.
			<lb />
			63. Several companies were created for building assets. There was no
			<lb />
			compliance of the statutory obligations by the companies. The annual
			<lb />
			returns and audited financial statements have not been filed after
			<lb />
			31.3.2015. The Registrar of Companies has disqualified the Directors,
			<lb />
			namely, Mr. Anil Kumar Sharma, Mr. Amresh Kumar, Mr. Shiv Priya, Mr.
			<lb />
			Ajay Kumar and Mr. Suvash Chandra Kumar for a period of 5 years under
			<lb />
			Section 164(2) of the Companies Act, 2013. The Company has not been
			<lb />
			regular in payment of TDS and service tax and has also not filed relevant
			<lb />
			returns after 31.3.2015. Mr. Anil Mittal, CA (Statutory Auditor) and Mr.
			<lb />
			Chander Wadhwa, CFO were in connivance with each other. Mr. Anil
			<lb />
			Mittal, CA blindly signed the accounts and along with Mr. Chander
			<lb />
			Wadhwa, CFO is grossly involved in making manipulation in the accounts.
			<lb />
			He has received payment on account of professional charges in the name of
			<lb />
			companies in which his relatives were Directors and this fact has not been

			disclosed in the audited financial statement. A sum of Rs.52.07 crore was
			<lb />
			adjusted on account of professional fees due and to be paid on account of
			<lb />
			audit fees. Further, a sum of Rs.16.36 crore was adjusted against a flat in
			<lb />
			Amrapali Princely Estate on account of audit fees. They incorporated 27
			<lb />
			additional companies identified. They were shell companies, whose share
			<lb />
			capital was mostly subscribed in cash and the transfer of shares was also
			<lb />
			in cash leaving no audit trail. The home-buyers funds to the extent of
			<lb />
			Rs.5,619.47 crores have been diverted. There was diversion of funds to
			<lb />
			various suppliers, fake purchases and advances without any adjustment.
			<lb />
			Siphoning off funds had also taken place by way of booking under-valued
			<lb />
			transactions in respect of the sale of flats. The Forensic Auditors have also
			<lb />
			traces of receiving cash from home-buyers, which is not accounted for in
			<lb />
			the books of accounts. The home-buyers funds were diverted to the tune of
			<lb />
			Rs.5,619.47 crores to the other companies through (i) payment of
			<lb />
			professional fee to Directors for Rs.100.53 crores; (ii) bogus billing for
			<lb />
			Rs.842.42 crores; (iii) under-valuing of flats to the tune of Rs.321.21
			<lb />
			crores; (iv) brokerage was paid against flats which were not sold by the
			<lb />
			company; and (v) inter-corporate deposits were given to related entities.
			<lb />
			64. In J.P. Morgan, had also been found to routing money and in
			<lb />
			violation of FEMA by the Forensic Auditors. As pointed out, the equity
			<lb />
			shares were purchased at an exorbitant price to suit the requirements of
			<lb />
			J.P. Morgan. Sudit K. Parikh &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants and the
			<lb />
			Auditors made the valuation on the basis of information provided by J.P.

			Morgan Investments. Amrapali Zodiac Developers Pvt. Ltd. has diverted
			<lb />
			home buyers fund and there was no need for any investment from J.P.
			<lb />
			Morgan. It was in the knowledge of Mr. Suraj Chhabria and also in the
			<lb />
			knowledge of J.P. Morgan that money had been diverted.
			<lb />
			65. Rule 4 of FEMA Rules has been referred by the Forensic Auditors
			<lb />
			pointing out that External Commerical Borrowings (ECB) can be accessed
			<lb />
			under two routes namely Automatic Route and Approval Route. Under
			<lb />
			Automatic Route, the ECB is not permitted to be utilized for real estate
			<lb />
			sector, whereas under Approval Route the ECB are not permitted to be
			<lb />
			utilized for real estate. Rs.60 crores were remitted to Amrapali Leisure
			<lb />
			Vally Developers Pvt. Ltd. by J.P. Morgan without obtaining approval from
			<lb />
			the competent authority so as to make investment in the form of ECB. It is
			<lb />
			necessary to comply with the following :
			<lb />
			(a)
			<lb />
			obtaining Loan Registration Number from R.B.I.;
			<lb />
			(b)
			<lb />
			file ECB-2 returns every month to the R.B.I.;
			<lb />
			(c)
			<lb />
			withhold tax on interest payment to J.P. Morgan under Section
			<lb />
			195 of the Income Tax Act. As per Article 11 of the Avoidance of
			<lb />
			Double Taxation Agreement between India and Mauritius, the
			<lb />
			tax shall be charged @ 7.5 percent of the gross amount of
			<lb />
			interest;
			<lb />
			(d)
			<lb />
			J.P. Morgan would have to file its income tax return under
			<lb />
			Section 139 of the Income Tax Act in India due to withholding
			<lb />
			tax on its interest income borrower.

			66. The Forensic Auditors have also reported duplicate allotment of flats.
			<lb />
			They have provided the details of flats. Flats were alloted (residential and

			commercial) to the brokers and suppliers of which list has been given.
			<lb />
			Utilities like Milk Booth, nursery schools, senior secondary schools,

			nursing homes alloted to various parties should be cancelled.
			<lb />
			67. With respect to Sureka Group, it is pointed out in the Forensic Audit
			<lb />
			Report that they have been a partner in various projects and were
			<lb />
			authorised cheque signatories in various companies. It is observed that
			<lb />
			Rs.13.44 crores were paid to Surekha Public Charitable Trust, which is a
			<lb />
			group institution of Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited, which amount
			<lb />
			should be recovered from Jotindra Steel &amp; Tubes Limited. An amount of
			<lb />
			Rs.9,506,120 should also be recovered from Surekha Group. Funds were
			<lb />
			routed through Synergy Freightways Pvt. Ltd. Mr. Atul Kumar was alloted
			<lb />
			a flat which was not by way of adjustment. The amount should be
			<lb />
			recovered or his flat may be attached.
			<lb />
			68. With respect to R.N. Traders, an amount of Rs.2,714.02 lakhs have
			<lb />
			been withdrawn by the management for the purpose of their own use and

			should be recovered from the management. There is a billing of Rs.5.28
			<lb />
			crores for the financial year 2015-16 in the name of Mauria Udyog Limited.
			<lb />
			Forfeiture of the investments has also been suggested in the group

			CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS
			<lb />
			69. In the instant matter, the question of larger public importance is
			<lb />
			involved. It is a shocking and surprising state of affairs that such large-
			<lb />
			scale cheating has taken place and middle and poor class home buyers
			<lb />
			have been duped and deprived of their hard-earned money and lifetime
			<lb />
			savings and some of them had taken a loan from the bank and they are not
			<lb />
			getting houses. Bank has made payment to the builder, owners have the
			<lb />
			liability of making payment of amount with interest, home buyers are still
			<lb />
			waiting for their dream houses to be completed. This is not only with
			<lb />
			respect to the Amrapali builders that projects have not been completed as
			<lb />
			reflected in the affidavits of Noida and Greater Noida Authorities. More
			<lb />
			than 70% of the projects have not been completed which were initiated
			<lb />
			way-back in the year 2008-09 and were supposed to be completed within 3
			<lb />
			years. By the Amrapali Group, the buyers&apos; money which has been obtained
			<lb />
			has not been invested in the construction activities, rather it has been
			<lb />
			diverted to a great extent. Money obtained from the banks has also not
			<lb />
			been invested in the projects and has been diverted elsewhere to acquire
			<lb />
			other assets.
			<lb />
			70. There are huge liabilities of Noida and Greater Noida Authorities and
			<lb />
			though builders were asked way back on 17.11.2017 to deposit 10% of the
			<lb />
			amount with the Noida and Greater Noida authorities, that order was
			<lb />
			repeated again on 18.1.2018 but still that has not been complied with.
			<lb />
			Thereafter on the basis of joint note, this Court directed Amrapali group of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			199
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			companies to complete the projects but the order was not complied with.
			<lb />
			Various wrong representations were made in this Court. Developers backed
			<lb />
			out and an application was filed to waive the condition of deposit of Rs.250
			<lb />
			crores to start work by the Amrapali group that shows that its action was
			<lb />
			mala fide and it never intended to complete various projects as rightly
			<lb />
			found by the forensic auditors and that their intention was to divert the
			<lb />
			funds and this they had done at a large scale as is borne out from their
			<lb />
			report.
			<lb />
			71. The question involved in the case is whether the builders and
			<lb />
			promoters can be permitted to usurp and divert the money of home buyers
			<lb />
			and home buyers can be left in the lurch as a silent spectator. As per the
			<lb />
			Noida and Greater Noida authorities, in case the lease-deed is snapped, the
			<lb />
			entire constructed buildings shall have to be demolished within 3 months.
			<lb />
			As per the bankers, they have a charge on the property as the land has
			<lb />
			been mortgaged to them and until and unless their amount is paid, the
			<lb />
			builder will have no right on the property which has been constructed by
			<lb />
			their money, and the buyers have also to wait for the satisfaction of the
			<lb />
			dues.
			<lb />
			72. In our opinion, if the real estate business has to survive in India, it
			<lb />
			has to be answerable to the public and has necessarily to uphold the trust
			<lb />
			reposed in builders/promoters. They have been paid huge amounts not
			<lb />
			only by the home buyers but also, they have to pay a huge amount for the
			<lb />
			public land given to them on lease by Noida and Greater Noida Authorities
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			200
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			for construction of houses. The land has been given to them by the
			<lb />
			authorities on a concessional basis by making payment of 10% amount at
			<lb />
			the time of allotment. The builders have to be accountable to public/home
			<lb />
			buyers as well as the authorities and bankers. It is a matter relating to
			<lb />
			housing needs dealing with shelter place, such an activity is of the public
			<lb />
			importance as the real estate sector plays a pivotal role in the fulfilment of
			<lb />
			needs of housing infrastructure.
			<lb />
			IN RE: PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE
			<lb />
			73. The public trust doctrine imposes on the State and its functionaries a
			<lb />
			mandate to take affirmative action for effective management, and the
			<lb />
			citizens are empowered to question its ineffectiveness. The land of the
			<lb />
			farmers had been acquired for the purpose of housing and infrastructure
			<lb />
			needs by the State Government and handed over to the concerned
			<lb />
			authorities for construction. They are bound to ensure that builders act in
			<lb />
			accordance with the objective behind the acquisition of land and the
			<lb />
			conditions on which allotment had been made. It was a duty of concerned
			<lb />
			officials; they are not only enjoined to ensure that the rights of the home
			<lb />
			buyers are protected but also the interests of the authorities; and bankers.
			<lb />
			The public authorities are duty-bound to observe that the leased property
			<lb />
			is not frittered away along with the money of the home buyers. Affirmative
			<lb />
			action was clearly enjoined upon them not only under the statutory
			<lb />
			provisions of various enactments but also under the public trust doctrine
			<lb />
		</body>

		<body>
			that has evolved over the years by this Court. In Noida Entrepreneurs
			<lb />
			Association v. Noida &amp; Ors. (2011) 6 SCC 508, this Court has observed:
			<lb />
			&quot;38. The State or the public authority which holds the property for the
			<lb />
			public or which has been assigned the duty of grant of largesse, etc.
			<lb />
			acts as a trustee and, therefore, has to act fairly and reasonably. Every
			<lb />
			holder of a public office by virtue of which he acts on behalf of the
			<lb />
			State or public body is ultimately accountable to the people in whom
			<lb />
			the sovereignty vests. As such, all powers so vested in him are meant
			<lb />
			to be exercised for public good and promoting the public interest.
			<lb />
			Every holder of a public office is a trustee.

			40. The Public Trust Doctrine is a part of the law of the land. The
			<lb />
			doctrine has grown from Article 21 of the Constitution. In essence, the
			<lb />
			action/order of the State or State instrumentality would stand vitiated
			<lb />
			if it lacks bona fides, as it would only be a case of colorable exercise of
			<lb />
			power. The Rule of Law is the foundation of a democratic society. (Vide
			<lb />
			Erusian Equipment &amp; Chemicals Ltd. v. State of W.B., AIR 1975 SC
			<lb />
			266, Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of
			<lb />
			India, AIR 1979 SC 1628, Haji T.M. Hassan Rawther v. Kerala

			41. Power vested by the State in a Public Authority should be viewed
			<lb />
			as a trust coupled with duty to be exercised in larger public and social
			<lb />
			interest. Power is to be exercised strictly adhering to the statutory
			<lb />
			provisions and fact-situation of a case. &quot;Public Authorities cannot play
			<lb />
			fast and loose with the powers vested in them&quot;. A decision taken in an
			<lb />
			arbitrary manner contradicts the principle of legitimate expectation.
			<lb />
			An Authority is under a legal obligation to exercise the power
			<lb />
			reasonably and in good faith to effectuate the purpose for which power
			<lb />
			stood conferred. In this context, &quot;in good faith&quot; means &quot;for legitimate
			<lb />
			reasons&quot;. It must be exercised bona fide for the purpose and for none
			<lb />
			other. (Vide Commr. of Police v. Gordhandas Bhanji, AIR 1952 SC 16,
			<lb />
			Sirsi Municipality v. Ceceila Kom Francis Tellis, AIR 1973 SC 855, State
			<lb />
			of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh, AIR 1980 SC 319, Collector (District
			<lb />
			Magistrate) v. Raja Ram Jaiswal, AIR 1985 SC 1622, Delhi Admn. v.
			<lb />
			Manohar Lal, (2002) 7 SCC 222 and N.D. Jayal v. Union of India, AIR
			<lb />
			2004 SC 867).&quot;
			<lb />
			74. In Natural Resources Allocation, In re, Special Reference No.1 of 2012,
			<lb />
			(2012) 10 SCC 1, the Court observed:
			<lb />
			&quot;172. The judgment in LDA v. M.K. Gupta, (1994) 1 SCC 243, brings
			<lb />
			out the foundational principle of executive governance. The said
			<lb />
			foundational principle is based on the realization that sovereignty
			<lb />
			vests in the people. The judgment, therefore, records that every limb of
			<lb />
			the constitutional machinery is obliged to be people oriented. The
			<lb />
			fundamental principle brought out by the judgment is, that a public
			<lb />
			authority exercising public power discharges a public duty, and
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			202
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			therefore, has to sub-serve general welfare and common good. All
			<lb />
			power should be exercised for the sake of society. The issue which was
			<lb />
			the subject matter of consideration, and has been noticed along with
			<lb />
			the citation, was decided by concluding that compensation shall be
			<lb />
			payable by the State (or its instrumentality) where inappropriate
			<lb />
			deprivation on account of improper exercise of discretion has resulted
			<lb />
			in a loss, compensation is payable by the State (or its instrumentality).
			<lb />
			But where the public functionary exercises his discretion capriciously,
			<lb />
			or for considerations which are malafide, the public functionary
			<lb />
			himself must shoulder the burden of compensation held as payable.
			<lb />
			The reason for shifting the onus to the public functionary deserves
			<lb />
			notice. This Court felt, that when a court directs payment of damages
			<lb />
			or compensation against the State, the ultimate sufferer is the
			<lb />
			common man because it is tax-payers money out of which damages
			<lb />
			and costs are paid.&quot;
			<lb />
			75. In Association of Unified Tele Services Providers &amp; Ors. v. Union of
			<lb />
			India &amp; Ors. (2014) 6 SCC 110, the Court observed:
			<lb />
			&quot;4. We have indicated, the worth of spectrum to impress upon the fact
			<lb />
			that the State actions and actions of its agencies/ instrumentalities/
			<lb />
			licensees must be for the public good to achieve the object for which it
			<lb />
			exists, the object being to serve public good by resorting to fair and
			<lb />
			reasonable methods. State is also bound to protect the resources for
			<lb />
			the enjoyment of general public rather than permit their use for purely
			<lb />
			commercial purposes. Public trust doctrine, it is well established, puts
			<lb />
			an implicit embargo on the right of the State to transfer public
			<lb />
			properties to private party if such transfer affects public interest.
			<lb />
			Further, it mandates affirmative State action for effective management
			<lb />
			of natural resources and empowers the citizens to question ineffective
			<lb />
			management.&quot;
			<lb />
			76. In the instant case, it is apparent that there are colossal dues of
			<lb />
			Noida and Greater Noida Authorities. The dues of Noida Authorities as on
			<lb />
			30.4.2019 are Rs.2191.38 crores and dues of Greater Noida authority are
			<lb />
			stated to be Rs.3234.71 crores as on 15.1.2019. Thus, the total dues of
			<lb />
			Noida and Greater Noida authorities are more than Rs.5426.09 crores; by
			<lb />
			now more than Rs.5500 crores. Payments were made to Noida authorities
			<lb />
			in 2010 and some amount in 2013; in-between or thereafter, except one or
			<lb />
			two payments no other amount has been paid. There were several defaults
			<lb />
			in making the payment of the premium amount, lease money, even the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			203
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			money payable to the farmers as compensation for land acquisition has not
			<lb />
			been paid by the builders, as is apparent from the account statement filed
			<lb />
			on behalf of the Noida authority. Though the builder has realised from
			<lb />
			home buyers the amount payable to authorities of Noida and Greater Noida
			<lb />
			as a component of the price payable by them.
			<lb />
			77. Once the Noida and Greater Noida Authorities knew very well that
			<lb />
			there were defaults, they could not have allotted further land to the
			<lb />
			Amrapali group without insisting for payment of its dues. Secondly, it was
			<lb />
			not open to the authorities to permit the sub-leases of plot of land executed
			<lb />
			by builders, thereby allowing the leaseholder to earn a huge amount
			<lb />
			without making payment of the amount due to them. The officials of the
			<lb />
			authorities have acted in clear breach of public trust. They have permitted
			<lb />
			the defaulting leaseholders to earn the amount by sub-leasing its land of
			<lb />
			which dues had not been cleared. Thus, apparently, the officials of the
			<lb />
			authorities acted clearly in collusion with the builders and overlooked the
			<lb />
			interest of the Authorities and home buyers while permitting the sub-leases
			<lb />
			of plot of land to be granted. It passes comprehension how the officials of
			<lb />
			the authorities could have permitted such sub-leases in the factual
			<lb />
			scenario of the case when even the basic obligation to raise the
			<lb />
			construction was not being fulfilled by the builders and they were not
			<lb />
			paying the dues of premium, lease money etc. The action of the officials of
			<lb />
			the authorities has the effect of causing unjust enrichment of builder from
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>

			<lb />

		<div type="annex">
			the land held by the concerned authorities. It was wholly an illegal exercise
			<lb />
			permitted.
			<lb />
			78. We are of the considered opinion that the officials of the Noida and
			<lb />
			Greater Noida authorities have acted clearly in a breach of public trust and
			<lb />
			apart from that, they have failed to act as per the statutory mandate, the
			<lb />
			regulations and the terms of the lease deed. The transfer of the plot by the
			<lb />
			lessee was only on fulfilment of certain conditions. The dues of lessor
			<lb />
			towards the cost of land were to be cleared in accordance with the schedule
			<lb />
			of payment. Following provision is contained in lease deed dated 3.8.2010
			<lb />
			entered into between Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority and
			<lb />
			M/s. Amrapali Leisure Valley Developers Pvt. Ltd. The relevant provision
			<lb />
			with respect to the transfer of the plot is extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;TRANSFER OF PLOT
			<lb />
			. Without obtaining the completion certificate the Lessee shall have the
			<lb />
			right to sub-divide the allotted plot into suitable smaller plots as per
			<lb />
			planning norms and to transfer the same to the interested parties up
			<lb />
			to 30.0.2010, or as decided by the Lessor, with the prior approval of
			<lb />
			LESSOR on payment of transfer charges @ 2% of allotment rate.
			<lb />
			However, the area of each of such sub-divided plots should not be less
			<lb />
			than 20,000 sq. mtrs. However, the individual flat/plot will be
			<lb />
			transferable with prior approval of the LESSOR as per the following
			<lb />
			conditions:-
			<lb />
			(i) The dues of LESSOR towards the cost of the land shall be paid in
			<lb />
			accordance with the payment schedule specified in the Lease Deed
			<lb />
			before executing of sub-lease deed of the flat.
			<lb />
			(ii) The lease deed has been executed.
			<lb />
			(iii) Transfer of flat will be allowed only after obtaining completion
			<lb />
			certificate for the respective phase by the Lessee.
			<lb />
			(iv) The sub-Lessee undertakes to put to use the premises for the
			<lb />
			residential use only.
			<lb />
			(v) The Lessee has obtained building occupancy certificate from the
			<lb />
			Building Cell/Planning Department, GREATER NOIDA.
			<lb />
			(vi) First sale/transfer of a flat/plot to an allottee shall be through a

			Sub-lease/Lease Deed to be executed on the request of the Lessee to
			<lb />
			the LESSOR in writing.

			above. However, on a subsequent sale, transfer charges shall be
			<lb />
			applicable on the prevailing rates as fixed by the LESSOR.
			<lb />
			(viii) Rs. 1000/-shall be paid as processing fee in each case of transfer
			<lb />
			of flat in addition to transfer charges.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			79. In the lease deed, the schedule of payment was fixed. Two years was
			<lb />
			the period of the moratorium and thereafter payment was to be made on
			<lb />
			expiry of 23.10.2012, onwards up to 23.4.2020. In case of default in
			<lb />
			depositing the amount, the interest @ 15% compounded half yearly shall be
			<lb />
			leviable. With respect to the extension of time, it is provided that in
			<lb />
			exceptional circumstances, time to deposit for payment of balance due
			<lb />
			amount may be extended by the CEO for 15% interest compounded half
			<lb />
			yearly. The extension of time, in any case, cannot be allowed for more than
			<lb />
			60 days for each instalment to be deposited, subject to a maximum of 3
			<lb />
			such extensions during the entire payment schedule. The provision relating
			<lb />
			to the extension of time is extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;A. EXTENSION OF TIME
			<lb />
			1. In exceptional circumstances, the time of deposit for the payment of
			<lb />
			balance due amount may be extended by the Chief Executive Officer of
			<lb />
			the Lessor.
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			However, in such cases of time extension, interest @ 15% per
			<lb />
			annum compounded half yearly shall be charged on the outstanding
			<lb />
			amount for such extended period.
			<lb />
			3.
			<lb />
			Extension of time, in any case, shall not be allowed for more than
			<lb />
			60 days for each instalment to be deposited, subject to maximum of

			three (3) such extensions during the entire payment schedule.
			<lb />
			4.
			<lb />
			For the purpose of arriving at the due date, the date of issuance
			<lb />
			of allotment letter will be reckoned as the date of allotment.&quot;
			<lb />
			80. The lease was granted for a term of 90 years. It is specifically provided
			<lb />
			in lease deed condition No.(ii)(c) that the lessee shall use the allotted plot
			<lb />
			for construction of group housing/flats/plots. Condition No.(ii)(c)(iii) deals

			with the part transfer of the plot. It lays down normally the permission for
			<lb />
			part-transfer of the plot shall not be granted under any circumstances. The
			<lb />
			lessee shall not be entitled to complete the transaction for sale, transfer,
			<lb />
			assign or otherwise part with possession of the whole or any part of the
			<lb />
			building constructed thereon before making payment according to the
			<lb />
			schedule specified in the lease deed of the plot to the lessor. Relevant
			<lb />
			condition No.2(c)(iii) is extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;(c) The Lessee shall use the allotted plot for construction of Group
			<lb />
			Housing/flats/plots. However, the Lessee shall be entitled to allot the

			dwelling units on a sub-lease basis to its allottee and also provide
			<lb />
			space for facilities like Roads, Parks, etc. as per their requirements,
			<lb />
			convenience with the allotted plot, fulfilling requirements or building
			<lb />
			bye-laws and prevailing and under mentioned terms and conditions to

			the Lessor. Further transfer/sublease shall be governed by the transfer
			<lb />
			policy of the Lessor.
			<lb />
			i)
			<lb />
			Such allottee/sub Lessee should be a citizen of India and
			<lb />
			competent to contract.
			<lb />
			ii)
			<lb />
			Husband/wife and their dependent children will not be separately
			<lb />
			eligible for the purpose of allotment and shall be treated as single
			<lb />
			entity.
			<lb />
			iii) Normally, the permission for the part transfer of plot shall not be
			<lb />
			granted under any circumstances. The Lessee shall not be
			<lb />
			entitled to complete transaction for sale, transfer, assign or
			<lb />
			otherwise part with possession of the whole or any part of the
			<lb />
			building constructed thereon before making payment according to
			<lb />
			the schedule specified in the lease deed of the plot to the Lessor.
			<lb />
			However, after making payment of premium of the plot to the
			<lb />
			Lessor as per schedule specified in the lease deed, permission for
			<lb />
			transfer of built-up flats or to part with possession of the whole or
			<lb />
			any part of the building constructed on the Group Housing Plot,
			<lb />
			shall be granted and subject to payment of transfer charges as
			<lb />
			per policy prevailing at the time of granting such permission of
			<lb />
			transfer. However, the Lessor reserves the right to reject any
			<lb />
			transfer application without assigning any reason. The Lessee will
			<lb />
			also be required to pay transfer charges as per the policy
			<lb />
			prevailing at the time of such permission of transfer.
			<lb />
			The permission to transfer the part of the built-up space will be
			<lb />
			granted subject to execution of tripartite sub-lease deed which shall be
			<lb />
			executed in a form and format as prescribed by the lessor. On the
			<lb />
			fulfilment of the following conditions: -
			<lb />
			a) The lease deed of the plot has been executed and the Lessee has

			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			81. In view of the aforesaid clause, by way of sub-lease of the plot, the
			<lb />
			transfer of plots could not have been made by the lessee. The lessee was
			<lb />
			required to start construction within 12 months from the date of
			<lb />
			possession. The date of execution of lease deed shall be treated as the date
			<lb />
			of possession. The lessee shall be required to complete the construction of

			provided in the case of violation of directions, or rules, regulations or in
			<lb />
			case of the default on the part of the lessee for breach or violation of terms
			<lb />
			and conditions of the registration/allotment/lease and/or non-deposit of

			cancellation is extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;CANCELLATION OF LEASE DEED
			<lb />
			In addition to the other specific clauses relating to cancellation, the
			<lb />
			Lessor, as the case may be, will be free to exercise its right of
			<lb />
			cancellation of the lease in the case of:-
			<lb />
			1.
			<lb />
			Allotment being obtained through misrepresentation/suppression
			<lb />
			of material facts, misstatement and/or fraud.
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			Any violation of directions issued or rules and regulation framed
			<lb />
			by Lessor or by any other statutory body.
			<lb />
			3.
			<lb />
			Default on the part of the Lessee for breach/violation of terms
			<lb />
			and conditions of registration/allotment/lease and/or non-deposit of
			<lb />
			allotment amount.
			<lb />
			4.
			<lb />
			If at the same time of cancellation, the plot is occupied by the

			Lessee thereon, the amount equivalent to 25% of the total premium of
			<lb />
			the plot shall be forfeited and possession of the plot will be resumed by
			<lb />
			the Lessor with structure thereon, if any, and the Lessee will have no
			<lb />
			right to claim compensation thereof. The balance, if any, shall be
			<lb />
			refunded without any interest. The forfeited amount shall not exceed
			<lb />
			the deposited amount with the Lessor and no separate notice shall be
			<lb />
			given in this regard.
			<lb />
			5.
			<lb />
			If the allotment is cancelled on the ground mention in sub-clause
			<lb />
			1 above, then the entire amount deposited by the lessee till the date of
			<lb />
			cancellation shall be forfeited by the Lessor and no claim whatsoever
			<lb />
			shall be entertained in this regard.&quot;
			<lb />
			82. As provided by clause 6, the lease deed/allotment shall be governed
			<lb />
			by the provisions of the U.P. Industrial Area Development Act, 1976 and by
			<lb />
			the rules and/or regulations made or directions issued under the Act.
			<lb />
			Clause 7 requires the lessor to monitor the implementation of the project.
			<lb />
			The applicants who do not have a firm commitment to implement the
			<lb />
			project within the time limits prescribed are advised not to avail the
			<lb />
			allotment. In larger public interest the lessor under clause 13 is also given
			<lb />
			a right to take back possession of the land/building by making payment at
			<lb />
			the prevailing rate. Condition Nos.6, 7 and 13 are extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;6. The Lease Deed/allotment will be governed by the provisions of the
			<lb />
			U.P. Industrial Area Development Act, 1976 (U.P. Act No.6 of 1976)
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>

		<body>
			and by the rules and/or regulations made or directions issues, under
			<lb />
			this Act.
			<lb />
			7.
			<lb />
			The Lessor will monitor the implementation of the project.
			<lb />
			Applicants who do not have a firm commitment to implement the
			<lb />
			project within the time limits prescribed are advised not to avail the
			<lb />
			allotment.
			<lb />
			13. The Lessor in larger public interest may take back the possession
			<lb />
			of the land/building by making payment at the prevailing rate.&quot;
			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			Thus, it is apparent that the officials of the concerned authorities
			<lb />
			have not discharged their duty in accordance with the trust enjoined upon
			<lb />
			them under aforesaid terms and conditions of lease deed, thus, by their
			<lb />
			inaction, enabled cheating of the home buyers at a large scale. They were
			<lb />
			well aware of what was happening on the spot.
			<lb />
			IN RE: MORTGAGE
			<lb />
			83. With respect to the creation of mortgage deed in favour of bankers
			<lb />
			etc., Noida Authority has submitted that every mortgage permission is
			<lb />
			granted by the Noida Authority to the individual company of Amrapali
			<lb />
			group wherein a provision is made that Noida Authority has first

		<body>
			(i) That the financial institution in whose favour mortgage permission
			<lb />
			is required should be recognised by the Reserve Bank of India/National

			<lb />
			(emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
			84. The permissions to mortgage containing aforesaid clauses have been
			<lb />
			placed on record along with affidavit dated 22.11.2018. It is apparent from

			<lb />
			in favour of the allottee of the dwelling unit, the allottee/sub-lessee shall be
			<lb />
			governed by the terms and conditions of allotment/lease deed of the plot to
			<lb />
			be executed and sub-lease deed to be executed in favour of the
			<lb />
			allottee/sub-lessee. Since at no point of time, payment of premium due had
			<lb />
			been made and up to date annual lease rent had not been paid, no
			<lb />
			mortgage could have been created in favour of the bank in view of specific
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			211
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			condition No.2 extracted above. Thus, when the conditional permission
			<lb />
			granted by the authority was furnished to the bank for obtaining the loan
			<lb />
			by promoters/builders, it was incumbent upon Bank officials to ascertain
			<lb />
			from the concerned authorities that the premium due under the leases has
			<lb />
			been paid and lease rent due up to date has also been paid. In order to
			<lb />
			create a mortgage, it was necessary to obtain clear NOC in order to create
			<lb />
			effective mortgage deed. As that has not been done so far, no mortgage in
			<lb />
			the eye of law has been created in favour of the bank. It was not open to
			<lb />
			the bankers to mortgage the land in view of the conditional permission to
			<lb />
			create mortgage, the mortgage created in violation of condition cannot be
			<lb />
			said to be effective in accordance with law as the land was owned by the
			<lb />
			concerned authorities and the lessees had right to mortgage only subject to
			<lb />
			fulfilment of conditions imposed by the lessor/authorities.
			<lb />
			85. On behalf of Noida and Greater Noida authorities, it was pointed out
			<lb />
			that they had taken steps reminding the lessees to pay dues by issuing
			<lb />
			notices w.e.f. 2007 to 2017. In our opinion, in spite of no payment made by
			<lb />
			lessees, failure to take action, makes their position further worse. As no
			<lb />
			effective action had been taken and officials have permitted wilfully
			<lb />
			contumacious violations of conditions of the lease. Right under their nose
			<lb />
			and to their knowledge serious kind of fraud had been taking place and
			<lb />
			officials have clearly connived with builders. In spite of construction
			<lb />
			activity lying stand still for years together dues not being paid. As a matter
			<lb />
			of fact, issuance of conditional NOC was with ulterior motive, there was no
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			212
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			reason to issue such a conditional permission, subject to which mortgage
			<lb />
			could have been made. They could not have issued any conditional
			<lb />
			permission for creation of a mortgage also without payment of amount due,
			<lb />
			permission has been issued obviously for being misused, in collusion with
			<lb />
			the officials of the bank and Authorities. It was incumbent upon the
			<lb />
			concerned authorities not to issue such an NOC for a mortgage and it was
			<lb />
			incumbent upon the bank officials in order to create a valid mortgage to
			<lb />
			ascertain from the Noida and Greater Noida Authorities that the condition
			<lb />
			imposed by them as condition precedent to create a mortgage had been
			<lb />
			fulfilled and to obtain clear NOC. But that is how in illegal manner the
			<lb />
			public money is obtained from banks for the purpose of construction
			<lb />
			activity and then it was not used for that purpose, as found in the forensic
			<lb />
			audit report in which it is rightly pointed out that there was a diversion of
			<lb />
			money. The amount of loan advanced by banks was not used for the
			<lb />
			purpose it had been obtained for a particular project and it was diverted to
			<lb />
			other companies. It was happening not only under the nose of Noida and
			<lb />
			Greater Noida authorities, but was directly in the knowledge and
			<lb />
			connivance of the bankers as day-to-day transactions in the bank accounts
			<lb />
			were pointing out that the money was being siphoned and diverted for
			<lb />
			other purposes routinely, not being utilised for the purpose it was given.
			<lb />
			Thus, all of them have helped in perpetuating the fraud on the home
			<lb />
			buyers by Amrapali group of companies, its various Directors, officials and
			<lb />
			others who have been specified in minute details in the forensic audit
			<lb />
			reports. The case also indicates that not only the banks have failed to
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			213
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			ensure that mortgage was effected in accordance with the law, but also
			<lb />
			they have failed to check whether money was in fact, required for the
			<lb />
			projects and was used for purpose it was lent. By the collusion, the money
			<lb />
			paid by home buyers to builders which included money payable to the
			<lb />
			Authorities could be diverted, had the deposit made by home buyers been
			<lb />
			unutilised, money due under lease would have been paid to authorities
			<lb />
			before the creation of the mortgage. Money borrowed from bank, in fact,
			<lb />
			was not required for completion of these projects as the money paid by the
			<lb />
			buyers was enough for that purpose, but that was also diverted and the
			<lb />
			money obtained from the banks was also not utilised for the purpose it was
			<lb />
			taken and it was well within the knowledge of the bankers and Authorities
			<lb />
			that the funds were being diverted, but they remained mute spectators.
			<lb />
			DIVERSION OF FUNDS
			<lb />
			86. It has been observed in extensive detail in the forensic audit report
			<lb />
			that the Bank of Baroda, Syndicate Bank, Bank of India, Corporation Bank
			<lb />
			did not monitor utilisation of funds and acted as a mute spectator to
			<lb />
			diversion which was almost happening evidently in all banking
			<lb />
			transactions. In the case of Amrapali Zodiac Developers, Bank of Baroda
			<lb />
			has advanced an amount which was diverted immediately on receipt. The
			<lb />
			details have been given in the forensic auditors&apos; report extracted above.
			<lb />
			There was no amount due as on the date of the transfer. In the case of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Princely Estate Pvt. Ltd., the details have been given with respect
			<lb />
			to the Syndicate Bank and Bank of India as to how immediately on receipt,
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			214
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the funds were diverted to several parties. In the case of Amrapali Eden
			<lb />
			Park Developers Pvt. Ltd., there was a receipt from the Corporation Bank,
			<lb />
			and similar is the position. Immediately the funds were diverted to the
			<lb />
			third parties as detailed in the forensic report. Details of diversion of loan
			<lb />
			funds have been given in a tabular form in Section XII from pages 426 to
			<lb />
			457 of the report. The submissions which have been raised on behalf of
			<lb />
			Bank of Baroda that due observance of norms was observed before
			<lb />
			sanctioning the loan, before disbursal and an independent Lenders&apos;
			<lb />
			Engineer had been appointed in order to monitor the contract. Monitoring
			<lb />
			was done during and post disbursal of loan by Bank of Baroda. As a matter
			<lb />
			of fact, the bank has not been able to show what steps it has taken to stop
			<lb />
			the diversion of funds to third parties on the same date of disbursal of the
			<lb />
			amount. The aforesaid stand of the Bank is falsified by the Forensic
			<lb />
			Auditors&apos; report.
			<lb />
			87. The transactions of Amrapali Zodiac Developers Pvt. Ltd. with J.P.
			<lb />
			Morgan were clearly in order to avoid the provisions of the Companies Act.
			<lb />
			It is apparent that Mr. Anil Mittal, Statutory Auditor, did not report his
			<lb />
			interest and disclosed about his relatives and junior employee as Director
			<lb />
			and shareholders. Mr. Chandan Kumar was a junior employee and Mr.
			<lb />
			Atul Mittal was his relative. Thus, it is apparent that Rudraksha Infracity
			<lb />
			Pvt. Ltd. was created for money laundering as aforesaid two Directors and
			<lb />
			shareholders had no income, Rudraksha Infracity Pvt. Ltd. was
			<lb />
			incorporated to receive funds from Mannat Buildcraft which was also
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			215
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			created by Mr. Chander Wadhwa, CFO through his close associates. After
			<lb />
			receiving money from Mannat Buildcraft Pvt. Ltd., the same was
			<lb />
			transferred to J.P. Morgan Investments for purchasing equity shares of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Zodiac Pvt. Ltd. at an exorbitant price. There was no transaction
			<lb />
			before or after these transfers of monies in the aforesaid dummy
			<lb />
			companies. To suit the requirement of J.P. Morgan Investments, in
			<lb />
			entirety incorrect valuation report was prepared by M/s. Sudit K. Parikh &amp;
			<lb />
			Co., Chartered Accountants. The methodology and procedures defined of
			<lb />
			computation of fair market value were not followed at the time of exit. J.P.
			<lb />
			Morgan was having full control on Amrapali Zodiac Developers and no
			<lb />
			action could have taken as per clause 10.4.3 without investors&apos; approval.
			<lb />
			The profit cannot be recognised until the project is completed. Thus, there
			<lb />
			cannot be any distributable amount as profit for distribution to J.P.
			<lb />
			Morgan. It has also been found by the Forensic Auditors that J.P. Morgan
			<lb />
			was in the knowledge of the fact that Amrapali Zodiac Developers had paid
			<lb />
			the money received to other companies of Amrapali group. Advances
			<lb />
			exceeded the limits specified in the shareholders&apos; agreement, but J.P.
			<lb />
			Morgan did not ensure bringing back the money. It was accepted by Mr.
			<lb />
			Suraj Chhabria that it was in his knowledge and that of J.P. Morgan that
			<lb />
			the money has been diverted from shareholder&apos;s agreement and share
			<lb />
			subscription agreement. The valuation of the shares did not follow the
			<lb />
			correct methodology of discounted cash flow as detailed out by the forensic
			<lb />
			auditors. The valuation exercise was done backwardly in order to inflate
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			216
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the value of share to siphon out the money of home buyers through J.P.
			<lb />
			Morgan.
			<lb />
			88. The FEMA rules prohibited the kind of transactions which were
			<lb />
			entered into with J.P. Morgan. Rule 4 of FEMA has been clearly violated.
			<lb />
			Master Circular No.8/2010-2011 of July 1, 2010, dealing with external
			<lb />
			commercial borrowings and trade credits clearly provides that external
			<lb />
			commercial borrowings are not permitted to be utilised for real estate
			<lb />
			business under the automatic route. The term real estate excludes the
			<lb />
			development of the integrated township. It was not a case of development of
			<lb />
			the integrated township. Even if it is taken to be a case of integrated
			<lb />
			township as submitted on behalf of J.P. Morgan, then also for approval
			<lb />
			route, hedging is required as pointed out by the Forensic Auditors in their
			<lb />
			report and borrowers had to submit their report about the signing of loan
			<lb />
			agreement with the lender for obtaining Loan Registration Number. In case
			<lb />
			J.P. Morgan had invested in the form of ECB, following would have been
			<lb />
			the requirements: (i) obtaining Loan Registration Number from the RBI; (ii)
			<lb />
			file ECB-2 returns every month to the RBI, (iii) to pay tax on interest
			<lb />
			payment to J.P. Morgan; and (iv) to file income tax return. We are in
			<lb />
			agreement with the findings of the forensic auditors in this regard. It is
			<lb />
			clear that it was a methodology adopted by the group to siphon out the
			<lb />
			funds of the home buyers in violation of the FEMA rules and the
			<lb />
			notifications and by the creation of dubious companies for which
			<lb />
			appropriate action is warranted by the concerned authorities.

			89. The report of Forensic Audit also indicates that the Company has
			<lb />
			received a sum of Rs.140 crores during the financial year 2012-13 from
			<lb />
			IPFFI Singapore PTE Limited under Foreign Direct Investment Scheme. As
			<lb />
			per FEMA Rules, this amount was to be invested in real estate construction
			<lb />
			projects only.
			<lb />
			90. The IPFFI Singapore PTE Limited which was incorporated on
			<lb />
			20.5.2011, entered into a Share Subscription Agreement with ASCPL on
			<lb />
			23.8.2012 and paid a sum of Rs.140 crores to ASCPL in the following
			<lb />
			manner on 7.8.2012:
			<lb />
			(a)
			<lb />
			INR 85 crores received in Axis Bank, Indirapuram Branch on
			<lb />
			7.8.2012.
			<lb />
			(b)
			<lb />
			INR 55 crores received in BOB Escrow Account on 7.8.2012.
			<lb />
			Thus, a total sum of Rs.140 crores was received in Axis Bank. The
			<lb />
			amount was received in Axis Bank of INR 85 crores was transferred to
			<lb />
			Amrapali Centurian Park Pvt. Ltd. in three proportion. On 7.8.2012, Rs.5
			<lb />
			crores were transferred. On 8.8.2012, an amount of Rs.50 crores was
			<lb />
			transferred and on 18.8.2012, Rs.30 crores were transferred. The ACPPL
			<lb />
			on receiving Rs.85 crores allotted equity shares worth INR 85 lakhs to
			<lb />
			ASCPL and balance INR 84.15 crores were treated as share premium
			<lb />
			account. There is no valuation report available as to how the share
			<lb />
			premium of INR 84.15 crores had been calculated. This transfer of fund by
			<lb />
			ASCPL to ACPPL is termed as absolutely violative of FDI Rules and
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			218
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			agreement. With respect to Rs.55 crores routed from IPFFI Singapore in
			<lb />
			the Escrow Account of Bank of Baroda, Escrow Account was transferred
			<lb />
			from 8.8.2012 to 28.9.2012 in the account of Bank of Baroda and used for
			<lb />
			payment of term loan instalments of OBC and Bank of Maharashtra for
			<lb />
			repayment of their term loan instalment. This money was not meant for
			<lb />
			payment of term loan instalment as per FDI Rules. It was to be used in the
			<lb />
			construction.
			<lb />
			91. The ASCPL did not use the money for the project which was received
			<lb />
			from IPFII Singapore but transferred Rs.85 crores to ACPPL and Rs.55
			<lb />
			crores to repay bank loan instalments and repay the outstanding creditors
			<lb />
			provided for in the books and standing in the books. The said payments
			<lb />
			have rightly been held by Auditors to be in contravention of the FDI norms
			<lb />
			and rules and for which the money was brought in India.
			<lb />
			92. From 2013 to 2015, ASCPL has paid interest of Rs.58.81 crores @ 17
			<lb />
			percent, which is a highly abnormal rate. A sum of Rs.14.41 crores was
			<lb />
			paid on 31.3.2013. Likewise, on 31.3.2014, Rs.22.20 crores were paid and
			<lb />
			on 31.3.2015, another amount of Rs.22.20 crores was paid. The violations
			<lb />
			were made with the knowledge of the IPFII Singapore and they were in
			<lb />
			connivance with the ASCPL.
			<lb />
			93. The stand of the Bank of Baroda that they have independently
			<lb />
			appointed Lender&apos;s Engineer is of no avail. There was negligence on the
			<lb />
			part of Bank of Baroda and merely proceeding before the Court in 2017 to
			<lb />
			recover the amount is not going to serve the purpose. More so, in view of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			219
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the finding of the Forensic Audit that there was no necessity of obtaining
			<lb />
			the loan from the Bankers as Amrapali Group had sufficient money from
			<lb />
			the home buyers, which has also been diverted and has not been utilised in
			<lb />
			the construction activities. Other assets have been created with the help of
			<lb />
			the same and the borrowings have been used in order to siphon off the
			<lb />
			money by making payment of some unusual amount not only to J.P.
			<lb />
			Morgan, but also to IPFII Singapore in violation of the FEMA Rules and FDI
			<lb />
			Rules as found by the Auditors in the respective cases.
			<lb />
			94. It was submitted that the Bank of Baroda has obtained the deed of
			<lb />
			corporate guarantee inter alia from Ultra Homes Construction Ltd, Rinku
			<lb />
			Clothing Creations Pvt. Ltd., Jotindra Steels and Tube Limited and
			<lb />
			Vidyashree Buildcon Pvt. Ltd. RoC search report and CA certificate had
			<lb />
			also been obtained.
			<lb />
			Lender&apos;s Legal Counsel Report dated 2.3.2012
			<lb />
			verifying the validity and enforceability of financing documents and
			<lb />
			creation of securing on assets of ASCPL is also on record. Jotindra Steels
			<lb />
			and Tubes Limited issued a corporate guarantee, it was absolutely
			<lb />
			improper for the Bank of Baroda to discharge the bank guarantee without
			<lb />
			payment of amount in view of the fact that Jotindra Steels and Tubes
			<lb />
			Limited was not ready to subscribe to the capital was no ground for Bank
			<lb />
			of Baroda to discharge Jotindra Steels and Tubes Limited. Once guarantee
			<lb />
			has been given and in view of the finding recorded by the Forensic Auditors
			<lb />
			as to the nature of bid by the Jotindra Steels and Tubes Limited and other
			<lb />
			persons, it is apparent that action was illegal.

			95. The leases had been granted by Noida and Greater Noida Authorities
			<lb />
			subject to the provisions contained in U.P. Industrial Area Development
			<lb />
			Act, 1976. Section 13 of the U.P. Industrial Area Development Act, 1976
			<lb />
			deals with imposition of penalty and mode of recovery of arrears, which
			<lb />
			states that where any transferee makes any default in the payment of any
			<lb />
			consideration money or instalment thereof or any other amount due on
			<lb />
			account of the transfer of any site or building by the Authority or any rent
			<lb />
			due to the Authority in respect of any lease or where any transferee or
			<lb />
			occupier makes any default in payment of any amount of fee or tax levied
			<lb />
			under the Act, in addition to the amount of arrears, a further sum not
			<lb />
			exceeding that amount shall be recovered from the transferee or occupier
			<lb />
			by way of penalty. Under Section 13-A, any amount payable to the
			<lb />
			Authority under Section 13 shall constitute a charge over the property and
			<lb />
			may be recovered as arrears of land revenue or by attachment and sale of
			<lb />
			property in the manner provided under the provisions of Uttar Pradesh
			<lb />
			Municipal Corporations Act, 1959 (Act no.2 of 1959). Section 14 provides
			<lb />
			for the resumption of any site or building and forfeiture of whole or any
			<lb />
			part of the money if any paid in respect thereof.
			<lb />
			&quot;14. (1) In the case of non-payment of consideration money or any
			<lb />
			instalment thereof on account of the transfer by the Authority or
			<lb />
			any site or building or in case of any breach of any condition of
			<lb />
			such transfer or breach of any rules or regulations made under this
			<lb />
			Act, the Chief Executive Officer may resume the site or building so

			transferred and may further forfeit the whole or any part of the

			money if any paid in respect thereof.
			<lb />
			(2) Where the Chief Executive Officer order resumption of any site or

			96. The Authorities have failed to take action under the aforesaid
			<lb />
			provisions. The Authorities have also failed to perform the statutory duty
			<lb />
			cast upon them to take prompt action. Merely filing of the case against
			<lb />
			Unitech Builders by way of petition in this Court did not furnish any
			<lb />
			grounds to the Authorities to remain silent spectator on the perpetration of
			<lb />
			fraud committed on the home buyers by Amrapali Group of Companies.
			<lb />
			Public trust doctrine requires an affirmative action, which was envisaged
			<lb />
			not only statutorily but under the Scheme also. They were required to
			<lb />
			ensure that projects were completed within the stipulated period,
			<lb />
			otherwise, the very purpose of the grant would stand frustrated and
			<lb />
			colossal loss of public money. Amrapali Group did not pay even the
			<lb />
			amount due to be paid to the landowners on the part of land acquisition, it
			<lb />
			did not pay premium annual lease amount interest to Authorities. They
			<lb />
			have violated every condition, but still, Authorities were bent upon to
			<lb />
			condone everything. This reflects absolute dereliction of duty cast upon
			<lb />
			the Authorities.
			<lb />
			97. The Noida and Greater Noida Authorities and the Bankers have
			<lb />
			permitted diversion of funds of home-buyers and the possession of other
			<lb />
			assets by Amrapali Group. The buyers&apos; money had been diverted, which
			<lb />
			was meant for construction on payment of dues of Authorities in case they
			<lb />
			were paid timely by the Amrapali Group to the Authorities and to the
			<lb />
			Banks substantively liability would have been cleared. But by their
			<lb />
			inaction and rather conniving, the buyers were cheated by the Amrapali
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			222
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Group. Authorities did not object when mortgages were effected in favour
			<lb />
			of Banks in violation of conditions. Bankers could not have violated
			<lb />
			conditions. Now, whatever complete/incomplete structures are there, the
			<lb />
			Authorities are claiming that buyers have no right and they have the first
			<lb />
			charge on the structure as they have to recover the amount, only thereafter
			<lb />
			if anything is left out, can be paid to the buyers. In case the submission is
			<lb />
			accepted, it would amount to playing further fraud upon the fraud. It was
			<lb />
			incumbent upon the Authorities as well as the Banks to prevent the fraud.
			<lb />
			Now, if Banks, as well as the Authorities, are permitted to recover the
			<lb />
			amount from the home-buyers&apos; investment, in that case, it would be
			<lb />
			equally unjust and would be against the conscience of the law and nothing
			<lb />
			would be left for buyers not even a brick and the structures have come up
			<lb />
			by investing their money. Law never permits unjust gain based upon
			<lb />
			fraud. The principle &quot;fraud vitiates&quot; is clearly attracted and such a
			<lb />
			transaction would become unenforceable and would be against the public
			<lb />
			trust doctrine. Real estate business can never prosper in case of breach of
			<lb />
			trust, bankers, Authorities in connivance and the builders are permitted to
			<lb />
			take away the innocent home-buyers&apos; money without being accountable to
			<lb />
			their action/inaction. From tomorrow huge money will be collected from
			<lb />
			home buyers by the builder, banks would act in connivance and the
			<lb />
			Authorities sleep in slumber, permitting diversion of money of
			<lb />
			buyers/bankers, etc., and the home-buyers will be paying the dues of all
			<lb />
			concerned without investment of a penny by builder and rather they are
			<lb />
			diverting the money of the home-buyers in connivance with Authorities and
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			223
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Bankers and they are left without dream homes. If that is a factual
			<lb />
			scenario, no Court can permit such fraud to be perpetrated. Since &quot;fraud
			<lb />
			vitiates&quot;, the bounden duty of the Court is to act as parens patria not only
			<lb />
			to save the home-buyers but also to ensure that they are not cheated.
			<lb />
			98. Authorities and Bankers have not acted in furtherance of public
			<lb />
			interest and failed to perform duties enjoined upon them. The kind of
			<lb />
			fraud that has taken place not only in Amrapali Group of Companies but at
			<lb />
			large as more than 70 percent of the various projects have not come up, is
			<lb />
			alarming to the Courts to take affirmative steps with the direction to
			<lb />
			prevent such frauds, restore the money of home-buyers and to punish
			<lb />
			incumbents responsible for such act. At the same time to ensure that
			<lb />
			buildings are completed. It cannot be denied that lifetime savings of home-
			<lb />
			buyers have been invested for purchase of a house with the faith and trust
			<lb />
			they have given the money. The scheme of the Government is to promote
			<lb />
			the real estate for which land had been acquired, even poor farmers have
			<lb />
			not been paid the compensation. The land allotted at throw away prices of
			<lb />
			10%, the allotment premium has not been paid and in an illegal manner
			<lb />
			plots have been allotted on huge amount by builders is another fraud in
			<lb />
			collusion with Authorities.
			<lb />
			99. How buyers get their houses and can be suitably compensated for the
			<lb />
			delay that has taken place in the matter and they are left at the juncture
			<lb />
			where the builder has diverted the funds for the last several years and no
			<lb />
			construction activities have taken place. For several years, no accounts
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			224
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			were maintained from 2015 till date and a lot of money had been
			<lb />
			withdrawn from the Banks.
			<lb />
			The orders passed by this Court on
			<lb />
			22.11.2017 to deposit 10 percent of the amount was not complied with by
			<lb />
			the Amrapali Group. Thereafter again on 17.5.2018, this Court permitted
			<lb />
			them to carry forward the project, but they did not do so and were not
			<lb />
			ready to deposit the amount of Rs.250 crores to show their bona fide to
			<lb />
			undertake construction activity and efforts had been made to wriggle out of
			<lb />
			assurances on which basis this Court had passed the orders.
			<lb />
			100. On behalf of Authorities provisions contained in Section 13 of the
			<lb />
			Uttar Pradesh Apartment (Promotion of Construction, Ownership, and
			<lb />
			Maintenance) Act, 2010 has been pressed into service. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			transfer cannot be made in favour of home-buyer without executing the
			<lb />
			Transfer Deed. As per Section 5 of Act of 2010, flat buyers become entitled
			<lb />
			to ownership and possession of the Apartment and undivided interest in
			<lb />
			the common areas as specified in the deed of the Apartment. It is further
			<lb />
			submitted that tripartite sub-lease deed has to be entered into in order to
			<lb />
			transfer ownership to the home-buyers, consisting of Authorities, builders
			<lb />
			and home-buyers and before that is done, it is necessary for builder to
			<lb />
			obtain the completion certificate on fulfilment of certain conditions. The
			<lb />
			main objection raised by the counsel is with respect to the issuance of
			<lb />
			completion certificate is default of the payment of amount with interest to
			<lb />
			be made under lease and relating to fire safety. It is also pointed out that
			<lb />
			completion certificate is necessary to be issued, the issuance of the same
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			225
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			would depend upon payment of the dues and the Authorities, later on, will
			<lb />
			have no mechanism to recover the dues, once registered conveyance deed
			<lb />
			is executed in favour of home-buyers. According to Authorities, the buyers
			<lb />
			may contend that they have paid the entire consideration to the builder,
			<lb />
			who has defaulted in making the payment for the flat and the privity of
			<lb />
			making the payment is between the concerned Authorities and the builder.
			<lb />
			It is also submitted on behalf of Authorities that in part completion also,
			<lb />
			the certificate can be issued against the part payment received, however,
			<lb />
			the completion certificate would be issued in the same proportion minus 10
			<lb />
			percent so that financial interest of the Authorities is protected. Sub-lease
			<lb />
			deed would be executed as per the present policy up to 90 percent of the
			<lb />
			proportion in which part payment has been received.
			<lb />
			101. In our opinion, in the ordinary course, there cannot be any dispute
			<lb />
			with respect to the aforesaid propositions. However, in the instant case,
			<lb />
			the facts indicate that 9000 families are residing for the last several years
			<lb />
			out of the sheer necessity of shelter place and they have not been provided
			<lb />
			with electricity connections and other facilities due to non-issuance of
			<lb />
			occupancy certificate by the concerned authorities. Most of them have paid
			<lb />
			the entire amount to the builders. The amount outstanding as against
			<lb />
			home buyers have to be used in completion of building. The payment to be
			<lb />
			made to concerned Authorities had also been collected by the builder from
			<lb />
			home buyers as component of price of flat, but has not been deposited with
			<lb />
			the concerned Authorities and the home buyers&apos; money had been diverted,
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			226
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			which was more than the dues of the Authorities and the Banks taken
			<lb />
			together. Had timely action been taken by them no amount could have
			<lb />
			been diverted and the position would have been different as it stands
			<lb />
			today. However, since we have attached various other properties where
			<lb />
			home buyers&apos; money has been invested, the rights of the Authorities as well
			<lb />
			as bankers to get the money recovered from the other properties of the
			<lb />
			builder Amrapali Group/Directors and where they have invested money
			<lb />
			and belonging to the guarantors in the various transactions. However, at
			<lb />
			the same time for want of payment to Authorities and Bankers by the
			<lb />
			builder under these facts and circumstances, it would be absolutely
			<lb />
			improper for the Authorities to deny issuance of occupancy or completion
			<lb />
			certificate, especially on the ground of non-payment of dues. As per the
			<lb />
			interim orders, we have ensured that fire safety devices are fitted in
			<lb />
			buildings at appropriate places wherever necessary and in case it is lacking
			<lb />
			at any place we have to ensure that they are fitted and there are no other
			<lb />
			violations pointed out in the construction so far made.
			<lb />
			Thus, the
			<lb />
			concerned Authorities have to issue occupancy certificate as well as
			<lb />
			completion certificate with respect to the projects in which home buyers
			<lb />
			residing without insisting for the payment of their dues. This Court has to
			<lb />
			monitor the payment of the dues to the Authorities as well as the Bankers,
			<lb />
			from guarantors and other proprietors. The innocent buyers cannot be
			<lb />
			made to suffer for no fault on their part.

			102. Once Authorities have allowed 9000 home-buyers to occupy the
			<lb />
			premises without terminating the lease on the ground that occupation is
			<lb />
			illegal. Obviously, builders have put them in possession, they are not the
			<lb />
			encroachers and they have invested their valuable saving and have no
			<lb />
			other shelter place to live. They cannot be deprived of their houses and
			<lb />
			cannot be left without basic necessities of life like water, electricity, etc.
			<lb />
			The concerned Authorities are responsible to provide electricity, water, and
			<lb />
			all other basic amenities to buyers as they have the right to occupy the
			<lb />
			premises.
			<lb />
			In the peculiar facts of the case, we have directed the
			<lb />
			Authorities to provide basic necessities forthwith. We also direct the
			<lb />
			Central Government and Government of Uttar Pradesh to ensure that
			<lb />
			everything is done to protect the interest of the home-buyers obviously
			<lb />
			without obliging the builders. Wherever we seek any favour for home-
			<lb />
			buyers, we see that defrauding parties i.e., promoters/builders are further
			<lb />
			obliged by making certain concessions by the Government that would
			<lb />
			amount to perpetrating further fraud and unjust enrichment of builder.
			<lb />
			The case poses challenge to the law enforcement agencies to act in tandem
			<lb />
			to book such culprits.
			<lb />
			103. When there are defaults galore, creation of fake and dummy
			<lb />
			companies in an unbridled manner, it passes comprehension that how the
			<lb />
			Statutory Auditor has failed to discharge the duty cast upon him and the
			<lb />
			officials of the Amrapali Group also shared hard earned money of home-
			<lb />
			buyers in an illegal manner by siphoning it off. Directors had obtained
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			228
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			salaries without doing anything. Money is diverted and siphoned off in
			<lb />
			other projects. Office junior employees, peons and relatives etc. were
			<lb />
			inducted as Directors just to defraud the home-buyers of their money and
			<lb />
			to siphon it out. Without material being supplied, a large amount of money
			<lb />
			had been paid by way of forge purchases as a method to divert money even
			<lb />
			through authorised signatories and the Companies of the relatives, family
			<lb />
			members and relations of the Directors and Guarantors also. In the case
			<lb />
			fraud is to such large extent, it is difficult to capsulise the facts in a narrow
			<lb />
			compass, for that when we see the report and good job done by the
			<lb />
			Forensic Auditors to unearthed the fraud. They have gone into minute
			<lb />
			details forensically and done their job extremely well, due to which serious
			<lb />
			kind of fraud has been unearthed with the involvement of so many persons
			<lb />
			as referred to by them. We direct the concerned Authorities to look into the
			<lb />
			violation of the FEMA and FDI norms as projected by the Forensic Auditors
			<lb />
			in their report and to submit progress report in this Court.

			IN RE: RERA
			<lb />
			104. The Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha on 10.3.2016 and in the Lok
			<lb />
			Sabha on 15.3.2016. The Bill intended to standardise business practices
			<lb />
			and transactions in the real estate sector. It intends to ensure consumer
			<lb />
			protection. It intends to regulate transaction related to both residential
			<lb />
			and commercial projects. The Statement of Objects and Reasons are as
			<lb />
			under:
			<lb />
			&quot;STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			229
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			The real estate sector plays a catalytic role in fulfilling the need and
			<lb />
			demand for housing and infrastructure in the country. While this
			<lb />
			sector as grown significantly in recent years, it has been largely
			<lb />
			unregulated, with absence of professionalism and standardisation
			<lb />
			and lack of adequate consumer protection. Though the Consumer
			<lb />
			Protection Act, 1986 is available as a forum to the buyers in the real
			<lb />
			estate market, the recourse is only curative and is not adequate to
			<lb />
			address all the concerns of buyers and promoters in that sector.
			<lb />
			The lack of standardisation has been a constraint to the healthy
			<lb />
			and orderly growth of industry. Therefore, the need for regulating
			<lb />
			the sector has been emphasised in various forums.
			<lb />
			2. In view of the above, it becomes necessary to have a Central
			<lb />
			legislation, namely, the Real Estate (Regulation and Development)
			<lb />
			Bill, 2013 in the interests of effective consumer protection,
			<lb />
			uniformity, and standardisation of business practices and
			<lb />
			transactions in the real estate sector. The proposed Bill provides
			<lb />
			for the establishment of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (the
			<lb />
			Authority) for regulation and promotion of real estate sector and to
			<lb />
			ensure sale of plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in an
			<lb />
			efficient and transparent manner and to protect the interest of
			<lb />
			consumers in real estate sector and establish the Real Estate
			<lb />
			Appellate Tribunal to hear appeals from the decisions, directions or
			<lb />
			orders of the Authority.
			<lb />
			3. The proposed Bill will ensure greater accountability towards
			<lb />
			consumers, and significantly reduce frauds and delays as also the
			<lb />
			current high transaction costs. It attempts to balance the interests
			<lb />
			of consumers and promoters by imposing certain responsibilities on
			<lb />
			both. It seeks to establish symmetry of information between the
			<lb />
			promoter and purchaser, transparency of contractual conditions,
			<lb />
			set minimum standards of accountability and a fast-track dispute
			<lb />
			resolution mechanism.
			<lb />
			The proposed Bill will induct
			<lb />
			professionalism and standardisation in the sector, thus paving the
			<lb />
			way for accelerated growth and investments in the long run.
			<lb />
			4.
			<lb />
			The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill, 2013 inter
			<lb />
			alia provides for the following, namely:-
			<lb />
			(a) to impose an obligation upon the promoter not to book, sell
			<lb />
			or offer for sale, or invite persons to purchase any plot,
			<lb />
			apartment or building, as the case may be, in any real
			<lb />
			estate project without registering the real estate project
			<lb />
			with the Authority;
			<lb />
			(b) to make the registration of real estate project compulsory in
			<lb />
			case where the area of land proposed to be developed
			<lb />
			exceed one thousand square meters or number of
			<lb />
			apartments proposed to be developed exceed twelve;
			<lb />
			(c) to impose an obligation upon the real estate agent not to
			<lb />
			facilitate sale or purchase of any plot, apartment or
			<lb />
			building, as the case may be, without registering himself
			<lb />
			with the Authority;
			<lb />
			(d) to impose liability upon the promoter to pay such
			<lb />
			compensation to the allottees, in the manner as provided
			<lb />
			under the proposed legislation, in case if he fails to
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			230
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			discharge any obligations imposed on him under the
			<lb />
			proposed legislation;
			<lb />
			(e) to establish an Authority to be known as the Real Estate
			<lb />
			Regulatory Authority by the appropriate Government, to
			<lb />
			exercise the powers conferred on it and to perform the
			<lb />
			functions assigned to it under the proposed legislation;
			<lb />
			(f) the functions of the Authority shall, inter alia, include -(i)
			<lb />
			to render advice to the appropriate Government in matters
			<lb />
			relating to the development of real estate sector; (ii) to
			<lb />
			publish and maintain a website of records of all real estate
			<lb />
			projects for which registration has been given, with such
			<lb />
			details as may be prescribed; (iii) to ensure compliance of
			<lb />
			the obligation cast upon the promoters, the allottees and
			<lb />
			the real estate agents under the proposed legislation;
			<lb />
			(g) to establish an Advisory Council by the Central
			<lb />
			Government to advice and recommend the Central
			<lb />
			Government on -(i) matters concerning the implementation
			<lb />
			of the proposed legislation; (ii) major questions of policy;
			<lb />
			(iii) protection of consumer interest; (iv) growth and
			<lb />
			development of the real estate sector;
			<lb />
			(h) to establish the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal by the
			<lb />
			appropriate Government to hear appeals from the direction,
			<lb />
			decision or order of the Authority or the adjudicating
			<lb />
			officer;
			<lb />
			(i) to appoint an adjudicating officer by the Authority for
			<lb />
			adjudging compensation under sections 12, 14 and 16 of
			<lb />
			the proposed legislation;
			<lb />
			(j) to make provision for punishment and penalties for
			<lb />
			contravention of the provisions of the proposed legislation
			<lb />
			and for non-compliance of orders of Authority or Appellate
			<lb />
			Tribunal;
			<lb />
			(k) to empower the appropriate Government to supersede the
			<lb />
			Authority on certain circumstances specified in the
			<lb />
			proposed legislation;
			<lb />
			(l) to empower the appropriate Government to issue directions
			<lb />
			to the Authority and obtain reports and returns from it.
			<lb />
			(5) The Notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions
			<lb />
			contained in the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill,
			<lb />
			2013.
			<lb />
			(6) The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.&quot;
			<lb />
			105. It is apparent from the aims and objectives that Act ensures greater
			<lb />
			accountability towards consumers and significantly reduce fraud and
			<lb />
			delays. Accountability standards have been laid down where duties cast
			<lb />
			upon promotors as well as the effort has been made to make consumer also
			<lb />
			responsible.

		<body>
			106. Before coming to the rival submission with respect to RERA, we deem
			<lb />
			it appropriate to note certain provisions. Common areas have been defined
			<lb />
			under Section 2(n). The apartment has been defined under Section 2(e).
			<lb />
			Section 2(k) defines carpet area, whereas Section 2(q) defines completion
			<lb />
			certificate.
			<lb />
			Completion certificate to mean that certificate issued by
			<lb />
			competent authority certifying that the project has been developed
			<lb />
			according to the sanctioned plan, layout plan and specifications as
			<lb />
			approved by the competent authority. Occupancy certificate has been
			<lb />
			defined in Section 2(zf) which states that certificate issued by the
			<lb />
			competent authority permitting occupation of any building which has
			<lb />
			provision for civic infrastructures such as water, sanitation, and electricity.
			<lb />
			Section 2(zk) defines promoter as a person who constructs or causes to be
			<lb />
			constructed an independent building or a building consisting of
			<lb />
			apartments or converts an existing building for the purpose of selling to
			<lb />
			other persons; a person who develops land into a project; any development
			<lb />
			authority or any other public body; an apex State level co-operative
			<lb />
			housing society etc.; any other person who acts himself as a builder,
			<lb />
			coloniser, contractor, developer, estate developer or by any other name;
			<lb />
			and such other person who constructed any building or apartment for sale
			<lb />
			to general public.
			<lb />
			107. It is provided under Section 3 that no promoter shall advertise,
			<lb />
			market, book, sell or offer for sale any plot, apartment or building in any
			<lb />
			real estate project or part of it without registration with the Real Estate
			<lb />
		</body>

		<body>
			Regulatory Authority established under the Act. The provisions of the Act
			<lb />
			have also been made applicable to the ongoing projects on the date of
			<lb />
			commencement of the Act and for which completion certificate has not
			<lb />
			been issued, the promoter shall make an application to the Authority for
			<lb />
			registration of said project within three months from the date of
			<lb />
			commencement of the Act.
			<lb />
			The projects of Amrapali Group have registration under the RERA is
			<lb />
			an admitted fact. The provisions of the RERA are applicable is also not in
			<lb />
			dispute.
			<lb />
			108. Section 4 requires the application to be filed with specified documents
			<lb />
			for the purpose of registration. As per Section 4(2)(l)(D), 70 percent of the
			<lb />
			amount realised for the real estate project from the allottees, from time to
			<lb />
			time, shall be deposited in a separate account to be maintained in a
			<lb />
			scheduled bank to cover the cost of construction and the land cost and
			<lb />
			shall be used only for that purpose and the promotor shall withdraw only
			<lb />
			to the proportion of the percentage of completion of the project. The
			<lb />
			accounts have to be audited in every six months and chartered accountant
			<lb />
			has to certify that amounts collected for a particular project have been
			<lb />
			utilised for that project and the withdrawal has been in compliance with
			<lb />
			the proportion of the percentage of the completion of the project. The
			<lb />
			provisions of Section 4(2)(l)(D) is extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;4. Application for registration of real estate projects.-(1)**
			<lb />
			(2) The promoter shall enclose the following documents along with
			<lb />
			the application referred to in sub-section (1), namely: -
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			233
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			(l) a declaration, supported by an affidavit, which shall be signed by
			<lb />
			the promoter or any person authorised by the promoter, stating:-
			<lb />
			(A)**
			<lb />
			(B)**
			<lb />
			(C)**
			<lb />
			(D) that seventy per cent of the amounts realised for the real estate
			<lb />
			project from the allottees, from time to time, shall be deposited in a
			<lb />
			separate account to be maintained in a scheduled bank to cover the
			<lb />
			cost of construction and the land cost and shall be used only for
			<lb />
			that purpose:
			<lb />
			Provided that the promoter shall withdraw the amounts from the
			<lb />
			separate account, to cover the cost of the project, in proportion to
			<lb />
			the percentage of completion of the project:
			<lb />
			Provided further that the amounts from the separate account shall
			<lb />
			be withdrawn by the promoter after it is certified by an engineer, an
			<lb />
			architect and a chartered accountant in practice that the
			<lb />
			withdrawal is in proportion to the percentage of completion of the
			<lb />
			project:
			<lb />
			Provided also that the promoter shall get his accounts audited
			<lb />
			within six months after the end of every financial year by a
			<lb />
			chartered accountant in practice, and shall produce a statement of
			<lb />
			accounts duly certified and signed by such chartered accountant
			<lb />
			and it shall be verified during the audit that the amounts collected
			<lb />
			for a particular project have been utilised for that project and the
			<lb />
			withdrawal has been in compliance with the proportion to the
			<lb />
			percentage of completion of the project.
			<lb />
			Explanation.-For the purpose of this clause, the term &quot;schedule
			<lb />
			bank&quot; means a bank included in the Second Schedule to the
			<lb />
			Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934);&quot;
			<lb />
			109. When we consider the provisions in the instant case, it was necessary
			<lb />
			to deposit the amount in the account. In the year 2015, the RERA was in
			<lb />
			contemplation and certain provisions came into force on 1.5.2016 and
			<lb />
			some more Sections i.e., 3 to 19, 40, 59 to 70 and 79 and 80 came into
			<lb />
			force with effect from 1.5.2017.
			<lb />
			110. A blatant violation of the provisions of RERA has been done by the
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group. Since RERA contemplates timely completion of projects
			<lb />
			once registration has been granted under Section 5 and extension of
			<lb />
			registration under Section 6, it is only in the event of force majeure in case
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			234
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			there is no default on the part of the promoter, registration can be extended
			<lb />
			in aggregate for the period not exceeding one year. Force majeure shall
			<lb />
			mean a case of war, flood, drought, fire, cyclone, earthquake or any other
			<lb />
			calamity caused by nature. The registration granted under Section 5 is
			<lb />
			valid for a period declared by the promoter. Section 7 provides that the
			<lb />
			Authority may on receipt of a complaint or suo motu or on the
			<lb />
			recommendation of the competent authority revoke the registration granted
			<lb />
			under Section 5 in case promoter makes default in doing anything required
			<lb />
			by or under the Act or the rules or the regulation made thereunder; the
			<lb />
			promoter violates any of the terms of approval given by the competent
			<lb />
			authority; the promoter is involved in any kind of unfair practice or
			<lb />
			irregularities. It is also independently provided that in case the promoter
			<lb />
			indulges in any fraudulent practices, the registration can be revoked.
			<lb />
			Upon revocation of the registration, the promoter shall be debarred from
			<lb />
			accessing the website in relation to that project under Section 7(4)(a).
			<lb />
			Under Section 7(4)(b), the Authority shall facilitate the remaining
			<lb />
			development works to be carried out in accordance with provisions of
			<lb />
			Section 8. Provisions of Section 7 is extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;7. Revocation of registration. -(1) The Authority may, on receipt
			<lb />
			of a complaint or suo motu in this behalf or on the recommendation
			<lb />
			of the competent authority, revoke the registration granted under
			<lb />
			section 5, after being satisfied that-
			<lb />
			(a) the promoter makes default in doing anything required by
			<lb />
			or under this Act or the rules or the regulations made
			<lb />
			thereunder;
			<lb />
			(b) the promoter violates any of the terms or conditions of the
			<lb />
			approval given by the competent authority;
			<lb />
			(c) the promoter is involved in any kind of unfair practice or
			<lb />
			irregularities.

		<body>
			Explanation.-For the purposes of this clause, the term
			<lb />
			&quot;unfair practice means&quot; a practice which, for the purpose of
			<lb />
			promoting the sale or development of any real estate project
			<lb />
			adopts any unfair method or unfair or deceptive practice
			<lb />
			including any of the following practices, namely:-
			<lb />
			(A) the practice of making any statement, whether in
			<lb />
			writing or the visible representation which,-
			<lb />
			(i) falsely represents that the services are of a
			<lb />
			particular standard or grade;
			<lb />
			(ii) represents that the promoter has approval or
			<lb />
			affiliation which such promoter does not have;
			<lb />
			(iii) makes a false or misleading representation
			<lb />
			concerning the services;
			<lb />
			(B) the promoter permits the publication of any
			<lb />
			advertisement or prospectus whether in any newspaper
			<lb />
			or otherwise of services that are not intended to be
			<lb />
			offered;
			<lb />
			(d) the promoter indulges in any fraudulent practices.
			<lb />
			(2) The registration granted to the promoter under section 5 shall
			<lb />
			not be revoked unless the Authority has given to the promoter not
			<lb />
			less than thirty days notice, in writing, stating the grounds on
			<lb />
			which it is proposed to revoke the registration, and has considered
			<lb />
			any cause shown by the promoter within the period of that notice
			<lb />
			against the proposed revocation.
			<lb />
			(3) The Authority may, instead of revoking the registration under
			<lb />
			sub-section (1), permit it to remain in force subject to such further
			<lb />
			terms and conditions as it thinks fit to impose in the interest of the
			<lb />
			allottees, and any such terms and conditions so imposed shall be
			<lb />
			binding upon the promoter.
			<lb />
			(4) The Authority, upon the revocation of the registration,-
			<lb />
			(a) shall debar the promoter from accessing its website in
			<lb />
			relation to that project and specify his name in the list of
			<lb />
			defaulters and display his photograph on its website and also
			<lb />
			inform the other Real Estate Regulatory Authority in other
			<lb />
			States and Union territories about such revocation or
			<lb />
			registration;
			<lb />
			(b) shall facilitate the remaining development works to be
			<lb />
			carried out in accordance with the provisions of section 8;
			<lb />
			(c) shall direct the bank holding the project back account,
			<lb />
			specified under subclause (D) of clause (I) of sub-section (2) of
			<lb />
			section 4, to freeze the account, and thereafter take such
			<lb />
			further necessary actions, including consequent de-freezing of
			<lb />
			the said account, towards facilitating the remaining
			<lb />

			(d) may, to protect the interest of allottees or in the public
			<lb />
			interest, issue such directions as it may deem necessary.&quot;
			<lb />
			111. It is clear that RERA intends for completion of the project in case any
			<lb />
			fraud is committed by the promoter and the activity is not completed, the
			<lb />
			home-buyers cannot be left in lurch, allowing the prayer on behalf of
			<lb />
			Bankers as well as by the Authorities would amount to unfair treatment of
			<lb />
			home buyers in the facts of this case. It is too late for them to submit that
			<lb />
			home buyer has no rights in the teeth of the provisions contained in the
			<lb />
			RERA, which intends to prevent fraud.
			<lb />
			112. Once registration lapses on non-completion of project within the time
			<lb />
			stipulated or it is revoked the consequence ensue as enumerated in Section
			<lb />
			8 of RERA, the Authority is enjoined upon the duty to consult with the
			<lb />
			appropriate Government to take such action as it may deem including the
			<lb />
			carrying out of the remaining development works by competent authority
			<lb />
			or by the association of allottees or any other manner as may be
			<lb />
			determined by the Authority. The development work has to be completed
			<lb />
			and cannot be left in between. Section 8 reads thus;
			<lb />
			&quot;8. Obligation of Authority consequent upon lapse of or on
			<lb />
			revocation of registration.-Upon lapse of the registration or on
			<lb />
			revocation of the registration under this Act, the Authority, may
			<lb />
			consult the appropriate Government to take such action as it may
			<lb />
			deem fit including the carrying out of the remaining development
			<lb />
			works by competent authority or by the association of allottees or in
			<lb />
			any other manner, as may be determined by the Authority:
			<lb />
			Provided that no direction, decision or order of the Authority under
			<lb />
			this section shall take effect until the expiry of the period of appeal
			<lb />
			provided under the provisions of this Act:
			<lb />
		</body>

			<lb />

		<body>
			Provided further that in case of revocation of registration of a project
			<lb />
			under this Act, the association of allottees shall have the first right
			<lb />
			of refusal for carrying out of the remaining development works.&quot;
			<lb />
			113. Functions and duties of the promoter are specified in Section 11. As
			<lb />
			per the provisions of this Section, the promoter shall be responsible to
			<lb />
			obtain the completion certificate or the occupancy certificate. He shall also
			<lb />
			be responsible for providing and maintaining the essential services on
			<lb />
			reasonable charges, till taking over of the maintenance by the association
			<lb />
			of the allottees. The promoter shall enable the formation of an association
			<lb />
			or society or co-operative society or federation of allottees. He shall pay all
			<lb />
			outgoings until he transfers the physical possession to the allottee. After
			<lb />
			he has executed an agreement for sale for any apartment, plot or building,
			<lb />
			he may not mortgage or create a charge on such an apartment, plot or
			<lb />
			building and if any such mortgage or charge is made or created then
			<lb />
			notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in
			<lb />
			force, it shall not affect the right and interest of the allottee. It is clearly
			<lb />
			provided under Section 11(4)(h), which is extracted hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;11. Functions and duties of promoter.-
			<lb />
			(4) The promoter shall-
			<lb />
			(h) after he executes an agreement for sale for any apartment, plot
			<lb />
			or building, as the case may be, not mortgage or create a charge on
			<lb />
			such apartment, plot or building, as the case may be, and if any
			<lb />
			such mortgage or charge is made or created then notwithstanding
			<lb />
			anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, it
			<lb />
			shall not affect the right and interest of the allottee who has taken
			<lb />
			or agreed to take such apartment, plot or building, as the case may
			<lb />
			be;&quot;
			<lb />
			114. It is clear that is the duty of the promoter to abide by the time
			<lb />
			schedule of the completion of the project of the allottee. The time of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			238
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			completion of the project is fixed from the date of the agreement. Though
			<lb />
			the RERA has come into force after the mortgage had been created, the
			<lb />
			intendment of RERA is that after the execution of the agreement no such
			<lb />
			mortgage or charge should be created.
			<lb />
			115. Section 14 provides adherence to sanctioned plans and project
			<lb />
			specifications by the promoter. Section 15 deals with the obligations of the
			<lb />
			promoter in case of transfer of a real estate project to a third party. The
			<lb />
			promoter shall not transfer or assign his majority rights and liabilities to a
			<lb />
			third party without obtaining the prior written consent of two-thirds
			<lb />
			allottees and without the prior written approval of the Authority. Section
			<lb />
			16 deals with obligations of promoter regarding the insurance of real estate
			<lb />
			project. Section 17 provides for the transfer of title. It is incumbent upon
			<lb />
			the promoter to execute a registered conveyance deed in favour of the
			<lb />
			allottee along with undivided proportionate title in the common areas to the
			<lb />
			association of the allottees or the competent authority and the possession
			<lb />
			of the plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, shall be handed over
			<lb />
			to the allottees and the common areas to the association of the allottees or
			<lb />
			the competent authority, as the case may be. Section 17(1) is extracted
			<lb />
			hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;17. Transfer of title.-(1) The promoter shall execute a registered
			<lb />
			conveyance deed in favour of the allottee along with the undivided
			<lb />
			proportionate title in the common areas to the association of the
			<lb />
			allottees or the competent authority, as the case may be, and hand
			<lb />
			over the physical possession of the plot, apartment of building, as
			<lb />
			the case may be, to the allottees and the common areas to the
			<lb />
			association of the allottees or the competent authority, as the case
			<lb />
			may be, in a real estate project, and the other title documents
			<lb />
			pertaining thereto within specified period as per sanctioned plans as
			<lb />
			provided under the local laws:
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			239
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Provided that, in the absence of any local law, conveyance deed in
			<lb />
			favour of the allottee or the association of the allottees or the
			<lb />
			competent authority, as the case may be, under this section shall
			<lb />
			be carried out by the promoter within three months from date of
			<lb />
			issue of occupancy certificate.&quot;
			<lb />
			116. It is apparent that after the transfer of conveyance deed, the title
			<lb />
			vests in the allottee and of the common area in the association of the
			<lb />
			allottees or the competent authority as the case may be. No title remains
			<lb />
			with the promoter.
			<lb />
			117. Section 18 deals with the return of amount and compensation. In
			<lb />
			case promoter fails to complete or is unable to give possession of an
			<lb />
			apartment, plot or building, he shall be liable on demand to the allottees.
			<lb />
			In case the allottee wants to withdraw from the project, without prejudice
			<lb />
			to any other remedy available, the promoter has to return the amount
			<lb />
			received in respect of that apartment, plot, building with interest in this
			<lb />
			behalf including compensation in the manner as provided under the Act.
			<lb />
			118. The rights and liabilities of allottees are provided in Section 19, which
			<lb />
			is reproduced hereunder:
			<lb />
			&quot;19. Rights and duties of allottees.-(1) The allottee shall be
			<lb />
			entitled to obtain the information relating to sanctioned plans,
			<lb />
			layout plans along with the specifications, approved by the
			<lb />
			competent authority and such other information as provided in this
			<lb />
			Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder or the agreement
			<lb />
			for sale signed with the promoter.
			<lb />
			(2) The allottee shall be entitled to know stage-wise time schedule of
			<lb />
			completion of the project, including the provisions for water,
			<lb />
			sanitation, electricity and other amenities and services as agreed to
			<lb />
			between the promoter and the allottee in accordance with the terms
			<lb />
			and conditions of the agreement for sale.
			<lb />
			(3) The allottee shall be entitled to claim the possession of
			<lb />
			apartment, plot or building, as the case may be, and the association
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			240
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			of allottees shall be entitled to claim the possession of the common
			<lb />
			areas, as per the declaration given by the promoter under sub-
			<lb />
			clause (C) of clause (I) of sub-section (2) of section 4.
			<lb />
			(4) The allottee shall be entitled to claim the refund of amount paid
			<lb />
			along with interest at such rate as may be prescribed and
			<lb />
			compensation in the manner as provided under this Act, from the
			<lb />
			promoter, if the promoter fails to comply or is unable to give
			<lb />
			possession of the apartment, plot or building, as the case may be, in
			<lb />
			accordance with the terms of agreement for sale or due to
			<lb />
			discontinuance of his business as a developer on account of
			<lb />
			suspension or revocation of his registration under the provisions of
			<lb />
			this Act or the rules or regulations made thereunder.
			<lb />
			(5) The allottee shall be entitled to have the necessary documents
			<lb />
			and plans, including that of common areas, after handing over the
			<lb />
			physical possession of the apartment or plot or building as the case
			<lb />
			may be, by the promoter.
			<lb />
			(6) Every allottee, who has entered into an agreement for sale to
			<lb />
			take an apartment, plot or building as the case may be, under
			<lb />
			section 13, shall be responsible to make necessary payments in the
			<lb />
			manner and within the time as specified in the said agreement for
			<lb />
			sale and shall pay at the proper time and place, the share of the
			<lb />
			registration charges, municipal taxes, water and electricity charges,
			<lb />
			maintenance charges, ground rent, and other charges, if any.
			<lb />
			(7) The allottee shall be liable to pay interest, at such rate as may be
			<lb />
			prescribed, for any delay in payment towards any amount or
			<lb />
			charges to be paid under sub-section (6).
			<lb />
			(8) The obligations of the allottee under sub-section (6) and the
			<lb />
			liability towards interest under sub-section (7) may be reduced
			<lb />
			when mutually agreed to between the promoter and such allottee.
			<lb />
			(9) Every allottee of the apartment, plot or building as the case may
			<lb />
			be, shall participate towards the formation of an association or
			<lb />
			society or cooperative society of the allottees, or a federation of the
			<lb />
			same.
			<lb />
			(10) Every allottee shall take physical possession of the apartment,
			<lb />
			plot or building as the case may be, within a period of two months
			<lb />
			of the occupancy certificate issued for the said apartment, plot or
			<lb />
			building, as the case may be.
			<lb />
			(11) Every allottee shall participate towards registration of the
			<lb />
			conveyance deed of the apartment, plot or building, as the case may
			<lb />
			be, as provided under sub-section (1) of section 17 of this Act.&quot;
			<lb />
			119. Certain rights and duties as well as the liabilities to pay interest in
			<lb />
			case of default on the part of allottees are also provided in the provisions
			<lb />
			contained in Section 19. Chapter V provides for Real Estate Regulatory
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			241
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Authority, whereas Chapter VI deals with the Central Advisory Council.
			<lb />
			The provisions relating to Real Estate Appellate Tribunal are provided in
			<lb />
			Chapter VII.
			<lb />
			Chapter VIII contains provisions relating to offences,
			<lb />
			penalties, and adjudication and Chapter IX deals with finance, accounts,
			<lb />
			audits, and reports.
			<lb />
			120. It is apparent that RERA intends protection of home-buyers and aims
			<lb />
			at completion of the buildings. The buildings have to be completed, for
			<lb />
			that, we are required to pass orders. We have already assigned the task to
			<lb />
			NBCC for completion of buildings as the promoters/builders have failed to
			<lb />
			complete the building within the time fixed and the time which could have
			<lb />
			been extended. Now, more than 10 years have passed and buyers were
			<lb />
			given the assurances that they would get flats within three years period by
			<lb />
			the promoter/builder. The maximum time fixed in RERA has also expired
			<lb />
			and extension could not have been beyond 1 year.
			<lb />
			121. It is clear that common areas as provided under Section 17 have to be
			<lb />
			ultimately handed over to the Association of Allottees or the Competent
			<lb />
			Authority as the case may be. Thus, any sub-lease, alienation or transfer
			<lb />
			affected by the promoter of the common areas as defined in the RERA and
			<lb />
			otherwise reserved under the plan shall be void and inoperative.
			<lb />
			122. As the basic obligations have not been complied with by the
			<lb />
			promoters, they cannot also be entitled to FAR. It was pointed out on
			<lb />
			behalf of Authorities that permissible FAR is 2.75, whereas it has been
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			242
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			wrongly mentioned and worked out at 3.50 by the Amrapali Group. In the
			<lb />
			instant case, we find that there is serious kind of fraud by the promotors as
			<lb />
			such they cannot be said to be entitled to avail the FAR to utilise it or to
			<lb />
			alienate and more so when they have failed to complete the projects and
			<lb />
			pay the dues.
			<lb />
			123. It is also apparent from the provisions of the Act of 1976 as well as
			<lb />
			RERA and also the case set up by the Authorities that partial occupation
			<lb />
			certificate can also be issued. The completion certificate can be issued
			<lb />
			partially also as per the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Apartment (Promotion
			<lb />
			of Construction, Ownership, and Maintenance) Act, 2010. The main
			<lb />
			obstacle is said to be non-deposit of the amount which may be ordered to
			<lb />
			be paid, for that we may clarify in the peculiar facts and circumstances of
			<lb />
			the case, it has to be secured and recovered by way of selling other
			<lb />
			attached properties and the one, which have been created out of the
			<lb />
			diverted funds of the home-buyers and property of guarantors etc. The
			<lb />
			banks&apos; borrowings have to be taken care of in a similar manner. The
			<lb />
			money payable to the Authorities had been diverted and huge amount of
			<lb />
			buyers&apos; money had not been invested in the projects neither any part of the
			<lb />
			money of bank borrowings, in fact, were spent in the construction as found
			<lb />
			by the Forensic Auditors. The promoters are held accountable for the
			<lb />
			diversion of the money paid by the buyers as component of price of flats
			<lb />
			even on account of payment to Authorities.
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			124. There appears to be non-issuance of the completion certificate,
			<lb />
			whereas the buildings are being occupied, we direct issue of completion
			<lb />
			certificate.
			<lb />
			This Court has to monitor the payment of dues of the
			<lb />
			Authorities and Banks and that outstanding are not going to create hurdle
			<lb />
			in the execution of the registered document/conveyance deed in favour of
			<lb />
			home buyers. It has to be executed by the concerned Authorities as well as
			<lb />
			by the Court Receiver and by the home buyers. The amount which is due
			<lb />
			on the part of home buyers has to be deposited in the account, which has
			<lb />
			been opened, in the UCO Bank by this Court. It has to be utilised firstly
			<lb />
			for the purpose of completion of the buildings and for providing other
			<lb />
			facilities and the home buyers of incomplete projects also have to deposit
			<lb />
			the outstanding amount on their part in the aforesaid account opened in
			<lb />
			the UCO Bank and out of that amount, it has to be disbursed as per the
			<lb />
			orders to be passed by this Court for the purpose of construction and
			<lb />
			outstanding if any, shall be used for the purpose of payment of
			<lb />
			compensation to home buyers for the period of delay as per the agreement
			<lb />
			or as may be determined ultimately and other dues.
			<lb />
			125. With respect to percentage of profit of NBCC, we fix it at 8 percent.
			<lb />
			As it is a Government Undertaking, NBCC has to ensure that DPR is
			<lb />
			prepared reasonably and the work to be completed as expeditiously as
			<lb />
			possible.
			<lb />
			126. Learned senior counsel on behalf of Bank of Baroda submitted that
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group as per the conditions of the lease deed executed by the
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			244
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			Noida Authority had the right to mortgage the land with the prior
			<lb />
			permission of the authority for raising loans for the purpose of financing
			<lb />
			investment in the project. No doubt the lease deed contained a stipulation
			<lb />
			as to mortgage with prior permission but no clear-cut permission had been
			<lb />
			obtained from Noida authority. Noida authority has clearly stated as rider
			<lb />
			that until and unless the entire due premium is paid along with lease
			<lb />
			money due, no mortgage can be effected. The stand of the authority is clear
			<lb />
			that without payment of land dues no mortgage could be effected. Thus, in
			<lb />
			fact in the eye of the law no mortgage could be created as there was no
			<lb />
			permission to mortgage unless the dues were paid and thus the bank could
			<lb />
			not have mortgaged the property before clearance of the dues of the Noida
			<lb />
			Authority, and secondly, the mortgage was permissible for the purpose of
			<lb />
			financing the investment in the project. As a matter of fact, when this was
			<lb />
			the stipulation, it was the banker&apos;s duty to ensure that money made
			<lb />
			available was invested in the project.
			<lb />
			127. The Forensic Auditors&apos; report makes it apparent that Bankers have
			<lb />
			failed to ensure and oversee that the money was invested in the projects. It
			<lb />
			was diverted elsewhere as rightly found by the Forensic Auditors. Thus, no
			<lb />
			charge can be said to have been created by bank loans on the projects as
			<lb />
			the money, in fact, it has not been used in the projects as such home
			<lb />
			buyers cannot be saddled with liability and also the projects. Even what
			<lb />
			was paid by the home buyers, had not been used in the projects and
			<lb />
			stands diverted. There was, in fact, no necessity for raising the loans from
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			245
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the bank. The money borrowed from banks was used to create other assets
			<lb />
			worth thousands of crores. Thus, the banks can realise their money from
			<lb />
			those assets and from guarantors and not from the investment of home
			<lb />
			buyers, not from the buildings in which loans granted by banks have not
			<lb />
			been invested, which have been erected partially or some are at the nascent
			<lb />
			stage, for which hard-earned money has been paid by the home buyers.
			<lb />
			Home buyers are not direct party to the bank loan, thus it was the duty of
			<lb />
			the bankers and Noida authorities, if they wanted to impose their charge,
			<lb />
			to ensure that no fraud takes place and money is invested in the projects
			<lb />
			for the purpose for which it has been taken not only the money paid by the
			<lb />
			home buyers but obtained from the banks and due to be paid to Noida
			<lb />
			authorities, is not usurped illegally by promoter/builder. Though it was
			<lb />
			realised as part of the component of the price of flat from the home buyers,
			<lb />
			by the promoters/builders its illegal diversion was permitted by Amrapali
			<lb />
			Group in connivance with the officers of the authorities and the bank.
			<lb />
			Thus, the very condition of investment in the project by bankers, subject to
			<lb />
			which the mortgage was permissible, had been violated. Thus, it cannot be
			<lb />
			said that any charge of the banks has been created on the projects. The
			<lb />
			charge would be on the property which has been purchased/created by
			<lb />
			dubious methods. It would be inequitable to fasten the charge against the
			<lb />
			investment made by the home buyers whereas they have not been
			<lb />
			benefited and rather have been cheated by the promoters for which
			<lb />
			bankers, as well as authorities, have to share the blame. We cannot
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			246
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			perpetuate another fraud on the innocent home buyers in facts of the case
			<lb />
			of fastening liability of amounts payable to Authorities and Bankers.
			<lb />
			128. Learned senior counsel on behalf of the Bank of Baroda, also
			<lb />
			submitted that the home buyers are not secured creditors, as such they
			<lb />
			have no right over secured creditors. While making the aforesaid
			<lb />
			submissions the provisions of RERA have been ignored. Though they may
			<lb />
			not be a secured creditor, they have a right to be treated in accordance
			<lb />
			with the law, fairly and they cannot be subjected to a fraudulent action by
			<lb />
			the promoters, that too in connivance with the bankers and officials of the
			<lb />
			Noida and Greater Noida authorities. Even otherwise, in such a situation
			<lb />
			the court has to come to their rescue and protect their interests, and it is
			<lb />
			the duty of the court to ensure that buyers get flats and development work
			<lb />
			is completed as intended under the RERA and the flats are handed over to
			<lb />
			home buyers after completion. In case the fraud is permitted to be
			<lb />
			perpetrated on the home buyers, the very purpose of enactment of RERA
			<lb />
			would stand defeated.
			<lb />
			129. No doubt about it as submitted on behalf of Amrapali group of
			<lb />
			companies, that the provisions of RERA are for protecting the interests of
			<lb />
			promoters also. No doubt about it that the RERA intends to protect the
			<lb />
			interests of the promoters and home buyers both. However, in the instant
			<lb />
			case, we have given the opportunity to the promoters to deposit the 10% of
			<lb />
			the amount in December 2017 and January 2018 but orders have met with
			<lb />
			non-compliance with all impunity. Thereafter on the assurance of the

			Amrapali Group that it would undertake the construction work and a joint
			<lb />
			plan was submitted after great wastage of time and energy and then order
			<lb />
			dated 17.5.2018 was passed that was also not complied with. It was passed
			<lb />
			on a condition that a sum of Rs.250 crores to be deposited which was also
			<lb />
			not deposited by the Amrapali group to show its bona fide. The Group
			<lb />
			never intended right from the beginning to complete the construction work,
			<lb />
			has been rightly observed by Forensic Auditors. Thereafter, we have
			<lb />
			assigned the work to the NBCC. But at the same time, the effort has been
			<lb />
			made by Amrapali Group/ its Directors to sell the property which has been
			<lb />
			created by diversion of home buyers&apos; funds. Incorrect facts have been
			<lb />
			stated and suppressions have been made in various affidavits filed in this
			<lb />
			Court that the certain properties are not encumbered. Various applications
			<lb />
			are being filed one after the other by the encumbered holders with respect
			<lb />
			to several properties that they have the charge over the said property.
			<lb />
			130. That apart, several attached properties have been put to sale by DRT
			<lb />
			under the orders of this Court. In most of the cases, no buyers have turned
			<lb />
			up and/or the price offered by forming a cartel are too low. The property
			<lb />
			cannot be sold at throw away price. For example, in the case of a hospital
			<lb />
			situated at Noida, the very group of doctors wanted to purchase, it who are
			<lb />
			running it, at a paltry sum by forming a cartel. Aforesaid is one of the
			<lb />
			examples of cartel formation that is how Amrapali group is instrumental in
			<lb />
			not allowing the properties to be sold. There appears to be some invisible
			<lb />
			hand holding buyers out and even the bankers are not coming up to

			finance the purchasers, is the genuine grievance pointed out at the Bar. Be
			<lb />
			that as it may. Entire gamut of facts indicates the contumacious conduct of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group, proper and correct disclosures on oath have not been
			<lb />
			made, even encumbrances are not being specified clearly in spite of
			<lb />
			repeated orders passed by us. They have sold several valuable properties
			<lb />
			during pendency of petitions as pointed out by the Forensic Audit Report.
			<lb />
			In the aforesaid circumstances, the submission raised on behalf of
			<lb />
			Amrapali group that under the provisions of the RERA their interest should
			<lb />
			be protected. In our opinion, considering the serious kind of fraud
			<lb />
			unearthed on the forensic audit, formation of dummy companies, violation
			<lb />
			of norms of foreign investment, violation of FEMA, siphoning off the money
			<lb />
			of home buyers, making payment of dividend without profits and a
			<lb />
			methodology had been devised of valuing the shares on an unreasonable
			<lb />
			higher basis so as to siphon out the money of the home buyers to J.P.
			<lb />
			Morgan etc. The creation of a large number of assets with the help of
			<lb />
			money of the home buyers. The Forensic Audit unfolds the true story of
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group. Right from 2015, no construction activity has taken
			<lb />
			place. Account books had not been maintained and money has been
			<lb />
			transferred continuously. No audit was made. Money was taken out from
			<lb />
			banks, and fake purchases have been made. Thus, they are not at all
			<lb />
			entitled for any indulgence under the provisions of the RERA. In view of
			<lb />
			their unholy conduct, defying description, their contumacious fraudulent
			<lb />
			conduct totally disentitles them and they are required to be dealt with as
			<lb />
			sternly as possible so as to make it exemplary one that such fraudulent
			<lb />

		<body>
			actions do not recur in future, in real estate business in India. We are not
			<lb />
			a country in which Courts will permit such action and permit a person to
			<lb />
			go scot-free.
			<lb />
			131. The agreement initially executed in favour of home buyers to
			<lb />
			purchase flats may not create any right in the property in praesenti, it will
			<lb />
			be only on the execution of the registered document that title is going to be
			<lb />
			perfected, but investment in project is only of home buyers. In this case,
			<lb />
			as they have paid money invested in projects, it is for the courts to do
			<lb />
			complete justice between the parties and to protect the investment so made
			<lb />
			and interests of home buyers and to ensure that they get the perfect title
			<lb />
			and the fruits of their hard earned money and lifetime savings invested in
			<lb />
			the projects.
			<lb />
			132. On behalf of Bank of Baroda, learned senior counsel submitted that
			<lb />
			the agreement of promoter/builder with home buyers is unregistered as
			<lb />
			such, no right has been created in the immovable property in view of the
			<lb />
			provisions contained in section 49 of the Registration Act. The submission
			<lb />
			ignores and overlooks the provisions of RERA which intends to prevent
			<lb />
			such frauds on home buyers and ensure completion of projects and that of
			<lb />
			the agreement between promoters and buyers. There are various rights
			<lb />
			under the agreement as well as under the RERA. The agreement entered
			<lb />
			into at the time of allotment is the basis of the investment in the projects
			<lb />
			made by home buyers, it cannot be said to be a scrap of paper. It is their
			<lb />
			valuable investment which is required to be protected and cannot be
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			250
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			permitted to be taken away by builder or secured creditors in an illegal
			<lb />
			manner. The provisions of section 17 of the Registration Act no doubt
			<lb />
			provide that a document of title requires compulsory registration, no doubt
			<lb />
			registered document has to be executed that also has to be taken care of by
			<lb />
			the Court so as to protect the interest of home buyers.
			<lb />
			133. Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Bank of Baroda
			<lb />
			urged that by virtue of the provisions contained in section 11(4)(g) of the
			<lb />
			RERA Act, it is the duty of the promoter to pay all outgoings until he
			<lb />
			transfers the physical possession of the real estate project to the allottee or
			<lb />
			the association of allottees, which he has collected from the allottees, for
			<lb />
			the payment of outgoings, including the land cost, ground rent, municipal
			<lb />
			or other legal taxes, charges for water or electricity, maintenance charges,
			<lb />
			including the mortgage loan and interest on mortgages or other
			<lb />
			encumbrances and such other liabilities payable to competent authorities,
			<lb />
			banks and financial institutions, which are related to the project. The two
			<lb />
			expressions of the provisions of Section 11(4)(g) are significant. Firstly,
			<lb />
			which the promoter has collected from the allottees. Secondly &quot;which are
			<lb />
			related to the project&quot;. In the instant case dues of the Noida/Greater Noida
			<lb />
			authorities have been collected from the allottees by the promoters but the
			<lb />
			authorities have permitted diversion of said amount by not taking any
			<lb />
			action in view of the chronic default right from the beginning. Though they
			<lb />
			knew that the promoter had booked the flats, even the permission to grant
			<lb />
			sub-lease of the plot had been granted in totally illegal manner without
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			251
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			payment of dues of premium and lease rent etc. Conditional permission to
			<lb />
			the mortgage was issued without payment of the premium lease money etc.
			<lb />
			so as to perpetuate the fraud being done by the promoters. The mortgage
			<lb />
			created ought to have been objected in view of the conditions subject to
			<lb />
			which it could have been done. Obviously, it was done by Amrapali Group
			<lb />
			in connivance with officials of Authorities including the bankers. Thus
			<lb />
			when the authorities have themselves permitted fraudulent action money
			<lb />
			has been diverted, which has been paid by home buyers for payment to
			<lb />
			Authorities also, as premium was component of price and as bankers have
			<lb />
			also permitted diversion of loan amount, mostly on same day, it cannot be
			<lb />
			said in the facts of the case, that any amount of the bankers or that of
			<lb />
			authorities remains invested in the project. The sine qua non is the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;which are related to the project&quot; would mean that that amount
			<lb />
			recoverable from the allottee is the one which has been invested in the
			<lb />
			project. A third person can be held liable for the money payable to secured
			<lb />
			creditors in case it has been invested in the project, in case it has not been
			<lb />
			spent in constructions, same cannot be permitted to be realised from the
			<lb />
			project/home buyers, the investment of home buyers cannot be frittered
			<lb />
			away and to fasten liability upon the innocent buyers/allottees in that
			<lb />
			event would tantamount to perpetrating yet another fraud on them.
			<lb />
			Accountability, as per law, has to be fastened on promoters/builders and
			<lb />
			all concerned. It would amount to total deprivation of money of home
			<lb />
			buyers without any fault on their part or legal liability. It would amount to
			<lb />
			fastening liability upon them once over again by misuse of the process of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			252
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			law. The factual matrix unfolded on forensic audit indicates serious kind of
			<lb />
			fraud that has taken place which would shut the enforcement of liability
			<lb />
			clause as against the home buyers. The provisions of the first and second
			<lb />
			charge cannot come to the rescue of Authorities/Bankers. Under Section
			<lb />
			11(4)(g) the promoter has to pay all outgoings which he has collected from
			<lb />
			the allottees, the payment of outgoings includes land cost, ground rent,
			<lb />
			charges for water or electricity, maintenance charges etc. As per the proviso
			<lb />
			to Section 11(4)(g), the promoter shall continue to be liable, even after the
			<lb />
			transfer of the property, to pay such outgoings and penal charges, if any, to
			<lb />
			the authorities. Outgoings which have been collected by the promoter can
			<lb />
			be and have to be recovered in the facts and circumstance of the case from
			<lb />
			them as intended by section 11(4)(g) of RERA.
			<lb />
			134. Learned senior counsel on behalf of the Bank of Baroda submitted
			<lb />
			that the provisions of section 11(4)(h) of RERA provides that the promoter,
			<lb />
			after he executes an agreement for sale for any apartment, plot or building,
			<lb />
			cannot mortgage or create a charge on such an apartment, plot or building,
			<lb />
			as the case may be, and if any such mortgage or charge is made or created
			<lb />
			then it shall not affect the right and interest of the allottee who has taken
			<lb />
			or agreed to take such apartment, plot or building, as the case may be. The
			<lb />
			provision has a non-obstante clause. As the provision has given an
			<lb />
			overriding effect by non-obstante clause, the provision is no help to the
			<lb />
			banks as the agreement had been by promoters with home buyers entered
			<lb />
			into earlier in point of time to the creation of the mortgage. There could not
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			253
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			have been any mortgage created subsequently and even if validly created, it
			<lb />
			would not affect the right and interest of the allottee as intended by RERA.
			<lb />
			Thus, the right and interest of the allottee are safeguarded by virtue of the
			<lb />
			provisions contained in section 11(4)(h). As the project was pending, the
			<lb />
			provision intends to confer a right on the allottee and save the allottees and
			<lb />
			also their interests from such liability. Even if the provision is held not
			<lb />
			applicable on the ground that RERA came into force later, since there was
			<lb />
			no valid mortgage as held by us, it was incapable of affecting the right or
			<lb />
			interest of the allottee. Had it been ensured that the money due to Noida
			<lb />
			and Greater Noida authorities was paid by the promoters to the authorities,
			<lb />
			the fraud of siphoning of money would not have taken place to the extent it
			<lb />
			has been done. Moreover, the money borrowed from banks has not been
			<lb />
			invested in the projects. In fact, projects required no funding. It would be
			<lb />
			iniquitous to charge the allottees with the bankers&apos; money. Thus, in the
			<lb />
			peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, we hold that rights or
			<lb />
			interests of the allottees are not at all affected by the mortgage created by
			<lb />
			the bankers or by the dues of the Noida or Greater Noida authorities.
			<lb />
			135. On behalf of the Bank of Baroda, Shri Maninder Singh learned senior
			<lb />
			counsel has submitted that section 4(2)(1) of the RERA requires the
			<lb />
			promoter to disclose the prior encumbrance. Therefore, the RERA
			<lb />
			contemplates the creation of encumbrance even before the project is
			<lb />
			registered and such a plot can be offered to allottees. Basically, a
			<lb />
			declaration is required under section 4(2)(l)(A) that the land is free from all
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			254
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			encumbrances or as the case may be, details of the encumbrances, if any,
			<lb />
			on such land, should be disclosed. The intention is that the allottee should
			<lb />
			know about the encumbrance if any. The provision does not espouse the
			<lb />
			cause of the bank in any manner whatsoever.
			<lb />
			136. On the strength of the provision of section 19(4) of RERA, learned
			<lb />
			senior counsel has submitted that the allottee should be entitled to claim
			<lb />
			the refund and compensation, if the promoter fails to comply or is unable
			<lb />
			to give possession of the apartment, plot or building in accordance with the
			<lb />
			terms of the agreement for sale or due to discontinuance of his business as
			<lb />
			a developer on account of suspension or revocation of his registration
			<lb />
			under the provision of the RERA or the rules and regulations made
			<lb />
			thereunder. He submitted that the right of the allottees is restricted to only
			<lb />
			receiving the compensation from the promoters. We wholly disagree with
			<lb />
			the submission. It is made in oblivion of the provisions of Section 8 of the
			<lb />
			RERA which provides for completion of the development projects by the
			<lb />
			competent authority or by the association of allottees or in any other
			<lb />
			manner, as may be determined and the association of allottees shall have
			<lb />
			the first right of refusal for carrying out the remaining development work is
			<lb />
			the wholesome provision contained in the second proviso to section 8. To
			<lb />
			claim compensation is at the option of the allottee if the allottee wants to go
			<lb />
			out. That is an additional right, not the only right conferred under the
			<lb />
			RERA. He cannot be left in lurch but is entitled to claim the refund if he so
			<lb />
			desires. It is his option to claim the refund along with interest and
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			255
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			compensation which is to be determined under the RERA. The rights of the
			<lb />
			allottees are not restricted to only receiving the compensation as
			<lb />
			submitted. The submission is too tenuous to be accepted.
			<lb />
			137. A submission has also been raised that the RERA recognises and
			<lb />
			protects interests of the lenders and does not in any manner take away
			<lb />
			rights under any of the existing statutes such as T.P. Act, Debt Recovery
			<lb />
			Tribunal Act, SARFAESI Act. It is apparent from a perusal of RERA, which
			<lb />
			is a special Act, that certain rights have been created in favour of the
			<lb />
			buyers. The provisions of RERA have to prevail. When we come to the
			<lb />
			question of protection of rights of buyers even if RERA had not been
			<lb />
			enacted, under aforesaid laws in the facts of the case, a different view could
			<lb />
			not have been taken. However, there is no dispute that the bankers would
			<lb />
			have the right to recover their dues from whom and in what manner is the
			<lb />
			question which we have already answered. The provisions of RERA are
			<lb />
			beneficial to the home buyers and are intended to insulate them from
			<lb />
			fraudulent action, ensures completion of the building and it is the duty of
			<lb />
			the court to protect and ensure the home buyers&apos; interest and at the same
			<lb />
			time to hold them responsible for the duties enjoined upon them under the
			<lb />
			said statute. We are not absolving the home buyers from the discharge of
			<lb />
			their liability if any. At the same time, they have the right of enforcement of
			<lb />
			their right for compensation due to undue delay in completion of the
			<lb />
			project.

		<body>
			138. It was submitted by learned senior counsel on behalf of the Greater
			<lb />
			Noida authority that title has to pass in home buyers by way of registered
			<lb />
			document as provided in section 17(1)(b) of the Registration Act and section
			<lb />
			13 of the U.P. Apartments Act, 2010 and also the provisions of the lease
			<lb />
			deed. The deed of transfer will be a tripartite sub-lease deed. Completion
			<lb />
			certificate has to be obtained, for that it has to be applied for. Dues of the
			<lb />
			authorities have to be paid before a completion certificate is issued. The
			<lb />
			charge of Noida and Greater Noida authority has priority over other
			<lb />
			charges. None of the aforesaid submissions impress us so as to defeat the
			<lb />
			rights of home buyers. We have already dealt with that the dues have to be
			<lb />
			recovered in accordance with law from the properties which have been
			<lb />
			created by the funds which have been diverted and the property of the
			<lb />
			directors etc. In order to do complete justice between the parties so that the
			<lb />
			faith of public is not shaken in the real estate sector and such frauds are
			<lb />
			prevented in the future. We cannot permit the authorities in the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the case to deal with the rights of the home buyers in
			<lb />
			arbitrary and in an unjust manner.
			<lb />
			139. In case the authorities are making allotment of plots at a paltry sum
			<lb />
			of 10% and giving the builders 8 years period to make payment of premium
			<lb />
			with a moratorium of 2 years then the period runs to 10 years and the
			<lb />
			project is to be completed within 3 years. It is clear that the authorities
			<lb />
			have to be very vigilant for securing their interests otherwise in every case
			<lb />
			even if the promoter has completed the project and realised the charges
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			257
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			from the home buyers and has not deposited the amount due to the
			<lb />
			authorities, in case no action is taken by the Authorities, can it be taken
			<lb />
			after 10 years against home buyers. The question arises whether innocent
			<lb />
			home buyers would have to pay the amount to authorities which they have
			<lb />
			already paid to promoters as part of the component of cost of flats or plots
			<lb />
			as the case may be, whether they are to be saddled once over again with
			<lb />
			the liability to pay, though the amount paid by them has been illegally
			<lb />
			usurped and diverted elsewhere and not paid to the authorities and they
			<lb />
			have acted in connivance of officials. The authorities have to be vigilant in
			<lb />
			such cases and not to tolerate the default. They have to blame themselves
			<lb />
			for their inaction and have to wait for the realisation of dues by sale of
			<lb />
			other properties and as against guarantors etc. The projects have to be
			<lb />
			completed as mandated by Section 8 of RERA
			<lb />
			140. It was submitted that the authorities on cancellation of the lease have
			<lb />
			to forfeit 25% of the amount and have to resume the lands along with the
			<lb />
			structure. It cannot be done in view of the provisions of RERA, particularly
			<lb />
			in view of the provisions of section 8 and other beneficial provisions
			<lb />
			contained in the said Act. Under section 14 of the Act of 1976, there can be
			<lb />
			forfeiture of the entire amount also, in case of breach of condition or
			<lb />
			breach of rules, etc. by the promoters/ builders. Be that as it may. We hold
			<lb />
			and direct no action under any provisions derogatory to the interest of
			<lb />
			home buyers can be taken either by the authorities or the bankers in the
			<lb />
			peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, that is to say, that no part of
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			258
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			the building can be demolished. Buildings have to come up and completed
			<lb />
			even the ones which are at the nascent stage as mandated by RERA. No
			<lb />
			doubt about it that in case of failure to pay the dues the onus of payment
			<lb />
			of land dues has to be passed on to the buyers on pro-rata basis but in the
			<lb />
			instant case they have already paid the substantial amounts, huge amount
			<lb />
			has been permitted to be diverted by the authorities and bankers as such
			<lb />
			they have to wait for recovery and cannot act in a manner further
			<lb />
			detrimental to the interests of the home buyers.
			<lb />
			141. On behalf of Amrapali group, learned senior counsel submitted that
			<lb />
			there were force majeure conditions in completing the projects. There were
			<lb />
			legal impediments in the completion of projects within the period given in
			<lb />
			the flat-buyers agreement during the period from 2011-15.
			<lb />
			The
			<lb />
			submission is baseless. It is apparent that the Full Bench of the High
			<lb />
			Court though held that the land acquisition was vitiated but still it was
			<lb />
			upheld. The High Court did not quash it for the reason that development
			<lb />
			has taken place. Higher compensation was ordered to be paid. That order
			<lb />
			was affirmed by this Court in 2015 in Savitri Devi v. State of U.P. (2015) 7
			<lb />
			SCC 21. There was no interim stay granted by the High Court on
			<lb />
			construction work, is made clear by the Noida and Greater Noida
			<lb />
			authorities. There was no room to entertain any doubt as to the fact
			<lb />
			whether for a particular village the acquisition had been quashed. There
			<lb />
			was no quashing of land acquisition and moreover, there was no stay. Only
			<lb />
			higher compensation was ordered to be paid. There was no force majeure
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			259
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			condition or any legal impediment as such the period from 2011 to 2015
			<lb />
			cannot be treated as a moratorium period vis-à-vis the dues of Noida and
			<lb />
			Greater Noida authorities. The submission made as to the farmers&apos;
			<lb />
			agitation etc. is too vague and 30% of the projects have come up; whereas
			<lb />
			70% have not yet come up, out of the projects in Noida and Greater Noida
			<lb />
			alone. It goes to indicate how at large-scale middle-class home buyers have
			<lb />
			been defrauded of their hard-earned money, taken away by the affluents
			<lb />
			and the officials in connivance with each other. Law has to book all of
			<lb />
			them. We are hopeful that law will spread its tentacular octave to catch all
			<lb />
			culprits responsible for such kind of fraud causing deprivation to home
			<lb />
			buyers. It is shocking and surprising that so many projects have remained
			<lb />
			incomplete. Several lakhs of home buyers have been cheated. As if there is
			<lb />
			no machinery of law left to take care of such situation and no fear left with
			<lb />
			the promoters/builders that such acts are not perceivable in a civilised
			<lb />
			society. Accountability is must on the part of everybody, every institution
			<lb />
			and in every activity. We fail to understand the standard of observance of
			<lb />
			the duties by public authorities has gone so down that such frauds take
			<lb />
			place openly, blatantly, and whatever legal rights exist only on papers and
			<lb />
			people can be cheated on such wide scale openly, brazenly and with the
			<lb />
			knowledge of all concerned. There is duty enjoined under the RERA, there
			<lb />
			has to be a Central Advisory Council as well as the role of the State
			<lb />
			Government is not ousted in order to protect against such frauds. We
			<lb />
			direct the Central Government and the State Government to take
			<lb />
			appropriate steps on the time-bound basis to do the needful, all other such
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>
			260
			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			cases where the projects have remained incomplete and home buyers have
			<lb />
			been cheated in an aforesaid manner, it should be ensured that they are
			<lb />
			provided houses. The home buyers cannot be made to suffer when we are
			<lb />
			governed by law and have protective machinery. Question is of will power
			<lb />
			to extend the clutches of law to do the needful. We hope and trust that
			<lb />
			hope and expectation of home buyers are not going to be belied.
			<lb />
			142. We are not impressed by the submission that Amrapali Group had
			<lb />
			taken the lands and had paid a part of dues and has invested a certain
			<lb />
			amount. The statement of the expenditure of the money of the home
			<lb />
			buyers, in the construction activity that has been filed in the Court, is not
			<lb />
			supported by documents and is prima facie a scrap of paper. We have
			<lb />
			called the concerned incumbents who have prepared it and cross-checked
			<lb />
			from them and we are satisfied that the statement filed on the expenditure
			<lb />
			of Rs.10,000 crores is nothing but a scrap of paper not supported by the
			<lb />
			books of account, supporting documents. It has to be outrightly rejected as
			<lb />
			there is an attempt made on siphoning off, apparent from the report of the
			<lb />
			Forensic Auditors also.
			<lb />
			143. In his affidavit, Anil Kumar Sharma has given details of companies
			<lb />
			from which funds were transferred to the extent of Rs.2,996.20 crores to
			<lb />
			different group companies, mainly from following nine companies:

			<lb />
			back as it belongs to home buyers. The finding as to the diversion of home
			<lb />
			buyers&apos; funds is based on the figures worked on the basis of minute
			<lb />
			accounting as reflected in the auditors&apos; report. There is no proper answer to
			<lb />
			each and every entry which have been gone into by the Auditors. General
			<lb />
			and broad submissions have been made which are flimsy and have no legs
			<lb />
			to stand. Thus, the objections are rejected. The professional fee could not
			<lb />
			have been realised by the Directors. They were not the employees. They
			<lb />
			have not rendered any professional services. They along with other
			<lb />
			employees, statutory auditors, CFO, etc. have formed a cartel to defraud
			<lb />
			the home buyers for siphoning off their money. Dummy companies were
			<lb />
			created in the names of peons, boys of office, the relation of statutory
			<lb />
			auditor, CFO, etc. and several companies were created only for the purpose
			<lb />
			of few transactions. The fact discloses how the fraud has been perpetrated
			<lb />
			upon the home buyers which defies description which could not have been
			<lb />
			unearthed except by skilful exercise done by the Forensic Auditors. Thus,
			<lb />

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			we have no word to specify the extent of fraud played. Least said is better
			<lb />
			as to the entire gamut of the facts and entire scenario of the case.
			<lb />
			146. It is apparent from the report of the forensic audit submitted by
			<lb />
			Forensic Auditors that there is a serious kind of fraud played upon the
			<lb />
			buyers in active connivance with the officials of the Noida and Greater
			<lb />
			Noida Authorities and that of the banks. The money of the home buyers
			<lb />
			has been diverted. The Directors diverted the money by the creation of
			<lb />
			dummy companies, realizing professional fees, creating bogus bills, selling
			<lb />
			flats at undervalue price, payment of excessive brokerage, etc. They have
			<lb />
			obtained investment from J.P. Morgan in violation of FEMA and FDI norms.
			<lb />
			The shares were overvalued for making payment to J.P. Morgan. It was
			<lb />
			adopted as a device for siphoning off the money of the home buyers to
			<lb />
			foreign countries. In view of the huge money collected from the buyers and
			<lb />
			comparable investments made in the projects, there was no necessity to
			<lb />
			obtain a loan from banks. The amount so obtained was not used in the
			<lb />
			projects. The mortgage deeds in favour of the banks were not permissible
			<lb />
			due to non-payment of dues of the Noida and Greater Noida Authorities.
			<lb />
			The Noida and Greater Noida Authorities issued conditional NOCs. to
			<lb />
			create mortgages subject to payment of dues which were not paid. They
			<lb />
			issued such NOCs in collusion with builders. It was incumbent upon the
			<lb />
			bankers also to obtain clear unconditional NOCs. which were not obtained
			<lb />
			and to ensure that the dues were paid to Noida and Greater Noida
			<lb />
			authorities. They permitted diversion of money immediately after
			<lb />

		<page>

			<lb />
		</page>

		<body>
			sanctioning of the loan and also in day to day transactions of Amrapali
			<lb />
			group of companies.
			<lb />
			147. No accounts were prepared w.e.f. the years 2015-2018 and money
			<lb />
			withdrawn was diverted during the said period. The Statutory Auditor,
			<lb />
			Mr.Mittal failed in duty and was part of fraudulent activities as found in
			<lb />
			the Forensic Report. The money obtained from banks was diverted to
			<lb />
			unapproved uses such as for the creation of personal assets of Directors,
			<lb />
			creation of assets in closely held companies by the Directors along with
			<lb />
			their partners and relatives, for personal expenses of Directors, to give
			<lb />
			advances without carrying interest for several years. There was total non-
			<lb />
			monitoring by the bankers. The money laundering was resorted to by
			<lb />
			Amrapali Group/ Directors. The Noida and Greater Noida Authorities were
			<lb />
			grossly negligent in reviewing and monitoring the progress of the projects
			<lb />
			and in collusion with leaseholders failed to take action concerning non-
			<lb />
			payment of dues and illegally permitted the group to sub-lease the land
			<lb />
			without payment of dues. Bogus allotments of flats were made. There were
			<lb />
			other irregularities galore.
			<lb />
			148. Because of their failure to fulfil the obligations towards the buyers
			<lb />
			and the serious kind of fraud which has been played by them upon the
			<lb />
			home buyers, the registration of Amrapali group of companies under the
			<lb />
			Real Estate Regulation and Development Act, 2016 deserves to be
			<lb />
			cancelled.
			<lb />
		</body>

		<page>

		<body>
			149. Because of the gross violations of the conditions of lease deeds
			<lb />
			executed by the Noida and Greater Noida Authorities in favour of Amrapali
			<lb />
			group of companies with respect to various projects, are liable to be
			<lb />
			cancelled and the rights thereupon shall vest in the Court Receiver.
			<lb />
			150. There was no valid mortgage created in favour of Banks and there
			<lb />
			was a huge diversion of money paid by homebuyers which were more than
			<lb />
			required for payment of dues of the Noida/ Greater Noida Authorities and
			<lb />
			banks. The buyers have paid the dues of Noida and Greater Noida
			<lb />
			authorities as a component of the price for flats. Thus, the premium and
			<lb />
			other dues payable under the lease deeds to the Noida and Greater Noida
			<lb />
			Authorities, cannot be recovered from the home buyers or the projects in
			<lb />
			question. The dues as may be ordered shall be recovered by sale of other
			<lb />
			properties which have been created by the diversion of funds and have
			<lb />
			been attached by this Court. The banks have also failed to ensure that the
			<lb />
			money was used in the projects. As found in the forensic audit, there was
			<lb />
			no necessity of obtaining loans from the banks and it has not been used for
			<lb />
			the purpose it was obtained. The Authorities and Bankers have violated the
			<lb />
			doctrine of public trust and their officials, unfortunately, acted in collusion
			<lb />
			with builders. The dues of the banks are also to be recovered from the
			<lb />
			other attached properties as observed by us.
			<lb />
			151. The criminal cases have also been registered by the police, we
			<lb />
			propose to monitor the progress of the investigation. For violations of FEMA
			<lb />
			and FDI norms, we direct the Enforcement Directorate to make
			<lb />

			investigation in accordance with the law and submit reports quarterly to
			<lb />
			this Court. Money laundering aspect is also to be looked into by concerned
			<lb />
			authorities.
			<lb />
			152. It has been found in the Forensic Audit Report that there are several
			<lb />
			recoverable from various companies as well as from individuals, Directors
			<lb />
			and other incumbents. We direct that as per the findings recorded by the
			<lb />
			Forensic Auditors, the money be deposited in this Court on a time-bound
			<lb />
			basis and other needful be done as observed by the Auditors. As we have
			<lb />
			approved the report, let the concerned companies/ Directors/ individuals
			<lb />
			take steps in compliance with the observations and findings made by
			<lb />
			Auditors to refund the amount and or to do needful as suggested within
			<lb />
			one month.
			<lb />
			153. We have also found that non-payment of dues of the Noida and
			<lb />
			Greater Noida Authorities and the banks cannot come in the way of
			<lb />
			occupation of flats by home buyers as money of home buyers has been
			<lb />
			diverted due to the inaction of Officials of Noida/ Greater Noida Authorities.
			<lb />
			They cannot sell the buildings or demolish them nor can enforce the charge
			<lb />
			against homebuyers/ leased land/ projects in the facts of the case.
			<lb />
			Similarly, the banks cannot recover money from projects as it has not been
			<lb />
			invested in projects. Homebuyers money has been diverted fraudulently,
			<lb />
			thus, fraud cannot be perpetuated against them by selling the flats and
			<lb />
			depriving them of hard-earned money and savings of entire life. They
			<lb />
			cannot be cheated once over again by sale of the projects raised by their

			funds. The Noida and Greater Noida Authorities have to issue the
			<lb />
			Completion/ Part Completion Certificate, as the case may be, to execute
			<lb />
			tripartite agreement and registered deeds in favour of the buyers on part-
			<lb />
			completion or completion of the buildings, as the case may be or where the
			<lb />
			inhabitants are residing, within a period of one month.
			<lb />
			154. Resultantly, we order as follows:
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			The registration of Amrapali Group of Companies under RERA
			<lb />
			shall stand cancelled;
			<lb />
			(ii)
			<lb />
			The various lease deeds granted in favour of Amrapali Group of
			<lb />
			Companies by Noida and Greater Noida Authorities for projects

			Court Receiver;
			<lb />
			(iii) We hold that Noida and Greater Noida Authorities shall have no
			<lb />
			right to sell the flats of the home buyers or the land leased out

			recovered from the sale of other properties which have been
			<lb />
			attached. The direction holds good for the recovery of the dues
			<lb />
			of the various Banks also.
			<lb />

			<lb />
