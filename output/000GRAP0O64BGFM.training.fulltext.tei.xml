			<p>Crl.M.Cs. 6444/2018 &amp; 6459/2018<lb/> Page 2 of 4<lb/></p>

			<head>O R D E R<lb/> (ORAL)<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> In the above captioned first petition, quashing of FIR No.150/2012,<lb/> whereas in the above captioned second petition, quashing of FIR<lb/> No.131/2012, both registered at police station Sarojini Nagar, New Delhi<lb/> is sought. Both the FIRs arise out of one common incident. In FIR<lb/> No.150/2012, petitioners Om Prakash and others have been put on trial<lb/> for the offence under Section 325/34 IPC and in FIR No. 131/2012,<lb/> petitioners Rakesh @ Banti and others have been put on trial for offences<lb/> under Sections 325/506/34 IPC. Quashing of these FIRs is sought on the<lb/> ground that the misunderstanding which led to this incident, now stands<lb/> cleared between the parties.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> Mr.M.P.Singh, Additional Public Prosecutor for respondent-State,<lb/> accepts notice in FIR No.131/2012 and submits that Om Prakash Lamba,<lb/> who is complainant of this FIR, is present in the Court. Ms. Neelam<lb/> Sharma, Additional Public Prosecutor for respondent-State in FIR<lb/> No.150/2012 accepts notice and submits that Rachit Kansal and Mr.<lb/> Rakesh @ Bunti, who are complaints of this FIR, are present in the Court.<lb/> SI Shiv Kumar, who is the Investigating Officer of these FIRs, has<lb/> identified the private respondents present in the Court as complainants of<lb/> these two FIRs.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> With the consent of learned counsel for the parties, both these<lb/> petitions have been heard together and are being disposed of by this<lb/> common order.<lb/></p>

			<p>4.<lb/> Complainants of these cross FIRs submit that the<lb/> misunderstanding, which led to registration of cross FIRs, now stands<lb/> cleared and they stand by the affidavits filed in support of these petitions.<lb/> They submit both the sides are neighbours and to restore harmony<lb/> between the parties, proceedings arising out of these two FIRs be brought<lb/> to an end.<lb/></p>

			<p>5.<lb/> In &quot;Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab&quot; (2012) 10 SCC 303 Apex<lb/> Court has recognized the need of amicable resolution of disputes in cases<lb/> like the instant one, by observing as under:-<lb/>&quot;61. In other words, the High Court must consider<lb/> whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice<lb/> to continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation of<lb/> criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of<lb/> law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and<lb/> the wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is<lb/> appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the<lb/> answer to the above question(s) is in the affirmative, the High<lb/> Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal<lb/> proceedings.&quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> The aforesaid dictum stands reiterated by the Apex Court in a<lb/> recent judgment in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC 466.<lb/></p>

			<p>8.<lb/> In view of the fact that the incident in question, which led to<lb/> lodging of these two FIRs, took place on a trivial issue and the<lb/> misunderstanding amongst the parties now stands cleared, this Court<lb/> finds that continuance of proceedings arising out of these cross FIRs<lb/> would be an exercise in futility.<lb/></p>

			<p>9.<lb/> Accordingly, the proceedings arising out of FIR No.150/2012 and<lb/> FIR No.131/2012, both registered at police station Sarojini Nagar, New<lb/> Delhi shall stand quashed, subject to deposit of cost of â‚¹10,000/-each in<lb/> the above captioned two petitions with the Prime Minister&quot;s National<lb/> Relief Fund within four weeks and after placing on record receipt of<lb/> deposit of cost within two weeks thereafter.<lb/></p>

			<p>10. The above captioned two petitions and applications are disposed of<lb/> in aforesaid terms.<lb/> Dasti.<lb/></p>
