		<p>
			1. Counter affidavits have been handed over in Court by learned counsels
			<lb />
			for the DDA and LAC. The same are taken on record. Copies of the
			<lb />
			same have been supplied to the counsel for the petitioner.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2. With the consent of the parties, the present writ petition is set down
			<lb />
			for final hearing and disposal.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3. This is a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The
			<lb />
			petitioner seeks a declaration that the acquisition proceedings in
			<lb />
			respect of the land bearing Khasra No.98 min (2-14) and 99 (2-13)
			<lb />
			total admeasuring 5 bighas and 7 biswas situated in the revenue estate
			<lb />
			of Village Haiderpur, New Delhi are deemed to have lapsed in view of
			<lb />
			the fact that neither possession of the land has been taken nor
			<lb />
			compensation has been paid.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4. The necessary facts to be noticed for disposal of this writ petition are
			<lb />
			that Section 4 notification of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
			<lb />
			(hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Act&quot;) was issued on 24.10.1961.
			<lb />
			Sections 6 notification was issued on 06.12.1966. An Award was
			<lb />
			pronounced on 18.07.1980. It is the case of the petitioner that neither
			<lb />
			the possession has been taken nor compensation has been paid. Hence,
			<lb />
			the case of the petitioner would be fully covered by the decision
			<lb />
			rendered by the Apex Court in Pune Municipal Corporation &amp; Anr.
			<lb />
			v. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki &amp; ors., reported at (2014) 3 SCC
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			183.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6. The counsel for the petitioners submits that since the compensation
			<lb />
			has not been tendered nor possession of the land has been taken over,
			<lb />
			the petitioner would be entitled to a declaration and compensation
			<lb />
			under Section 24 (2) of the Fair Compensation and Transparency in
			<lb />
			Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013
			<lb />
			(hereinafter referred to as &quot;the New Act&quot;). In support of the aforesaid
			<lb />
			submission learned counsel has relied on para 4 of the counter
			<lb />
			affidavit filed by the LAC, which reads as under:
			<lb /></p>
		   
			<item>
			&quot;4. That it is submitted that for purpose of planned
			<lb />
			development of Delhi, the answering respondent issued a
			<lb />
			Notification u/s 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 on
			<lb />
			24.10.1961 which was followed by Notification u/s 6 of
			<lb />
			the said Act dated 6.12.1966 in village Haiderpur. That
			<lb />
			an Award No.50/80-81 was also passed however
			<lb />
			possession of the subject land could neither be taken nor
			<lb />
			the compensation be paid as per revenue records.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>
		   

		<p>
			7. The reading of the abovesaid paragraph of the counter-affidavit clearly
			<lb />
			shows that possession of the land in question has not been taken nor
			<lb />
			compensation has been tendered to the petitioners. As far as the
			<lb />
			present Khasra number is concerned, counsel for the DDA also
			<lb />
			submits that possession has not been handed over to them.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			8. Having regard to the statement made and stand taken by the
			<lb />
			respondents in their counter affidavits, we are of the view that the case
			<lb />
			of the petitioner is fully covered by the decision rendered by the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court of India in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation
			<lb />
			(supra). Paras 14 to 20 read as under:
			<lb />
			&quot;14. Section 31(1) of the 1894 Act enjoins upon the
			<lb />
			Collector, on making an award under Section 11, to tender
			<lb />
			payment of compensation to persons interested entitled thereto
			<lb />
			according to award. It further mandates the Collector to make
			<lb />
			payment of compensation to them unless prevented by one of
			<lb />
			the contingencies contemplated in sub-section (2). The
			<lb />
			contingencies contemplated in Section 31(2) are: (i) the persons
			<lb />
			interested entitled to compensation do not consent to receive it
			<lb />
			(ii) there is no person competent to alienate the land and (iii)
			<lb />
			there is dispute as to the title to receive compensation or as to
			<lb />
			the apportionment of it. If due to any of the contingencies
			<lb />
			contemplated in Section 31(2), the Collector is prevented from
			<lb />
			making payment of compensation to the persons interested who
			<lb />
			are entitled to compensation, then the Collector is required to
			<lb />
			deposit the compensation in the court to which reference
			<lb />
			under Section 18 may be made.
			<lb />
			15. Simply put, Section 31 of the 1894 Act makes provision
			<lb />
			for payment of compensation or deposit of the same in the
			<lb />
			court. This provision requires that the Collector should tender
			<lb />
			payment of compensation as awarded by him to the persons
			<lb />
			interested who are entitled to compensation. If due to happening
			<lb />
			of any contingency as contemplated in Section 31(2), the
			<lb />
			compensation has not been paid, the Collector should deposit
			<lb />
			the amount of compensation in the court to which reference can
			<lb />
			be made under Section 18.
			<lb />
			16. The mandatory nature of the provision in Section
			<lb />
			31(2) with regard to deposit of the compensation in the court is
			<lb />
			further fortified by the provisions contained in Sections 32, 33
			<lb />
			and 34. As a matter of fact, Section 33 gives power to the court,
			<lb />
			on an application by a person interested or claiming an interest
			<lb />
			in such money, to pass an order to invest the amount so
			<lb />
			deposited in such government or other approved securities and
			<lb />
			may direct the interest or other proceeds of any such investment
			<lb />
			to be accumulated and paid in such manner as it may consider
			<lb />
			proper so that the parties interested therein may have the benefit
			<lb />
			therefrom as they might have had from the land in respect
			<lb />
			whereof such money shall have been deposited or as near
			<lb />
			thereto as may be.
			<lb />
			17. While enacting Section 24(2), Parliament definitely had
			<lb />
			in its view Section 31 of the 1894 Act. From that one thing is
			<lb />
			clear that it did not intend to equate the word &quot;paid&quot; to
			<lb />
			&quot;offered&quot; or &quot;tendered&quot;. But at the same time, we do not think
			<lb />
			that by use of the word &quot;paid&quot;, Parliament intended receipt of
			<lb />
			compensation by the landowners/persons interested. In our
			<lb />
			view, it is not appropriate to give a literal construction to the
			<lb />
			expression &quot;paid&quot; used in this sub-section (sub-section (2)
			<lb />
			of Section 24). If a literal construction were to be given, then it
			<lb />
			would amount to ignoring procedure, mode and manner of
			<lb />
			deposit provided in Section 31(2) of the 1894 Act in the event
			<lb />
			of happening of any of the contingencies contemplated therein
			<lb />
			which may prevent the Collector from making actual payment
			<lb />
			of compensation. We are of the view, therefore, that for the
			<lb />
			purposes of Section 24(2), the compensation shall be regarded
			<lb />
			as &quot;paid&quot; if the compensation has been offered to the person
			<lb />
			interested and such compensation has been deposited in the
			<lb />
			court where reference under Section 18 can be made on
			<lb />
			happening of any of the contingencies contemplated
			<lb />
			under Section 31(2) of the 1894 Act. In other words, the
			<lb />
			compensation may be said to have been &quot;paid&quot; within the
			<lb />
			meaning of Section 24(2) when the Collector (or for that matter
			<lb />
			Land Acquisition Officer) has discharged his obligation and
			<lb />
			deposited the amount of compensation in court and made that
			<lb />
			amount available to the interested person to be dealt with as
			<lb />
			provided in Sections 32 and 33.
			<lb />
			18. 1894 Act being an expropriatory legislation has to be
			<lb />
			strictly followed. The procedure, mode and manner for payment
			<lb />
			of compensation are prescribed in Part V (Sections 31-34) of
			<lb />
			the 1894 Act. The Collector, with regard to the payment of
			<lb />
			compensation, can only act in the manner so provided. It is
			<lb />
			settled proposition of law (classic statement of Lord Roche in
			<lb />
			Nazir Ahmad[1]) that where a power is given to do a certain
			<lb />
			thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not
			<lb />
			at all. Other methods of performance are necessarily forbidden.
			<lb />
			19. Now, this is admitted position that award was made on
			<lb />
			31.01.2008. Notices were issued to the landowners to receive
			<lb />
			the compensation and since they did not receive the
			<lb />
			compensation, the amount (Rs.27 crores) was deposited in the
			<lb />
			government treasury. Can it be said that deposit of the amount
			<lb />
			of compensation in the government treasury is equivalent to the
			<lb />
			amount of compensation paid to the landowners/persons
			<lb />
			interested? We do not think so. In a comparatively recent
			<lb />
			decision, this Court in Agnelo Santimano Fernandes[2], relying
			<lb />
			upon the earlier decision in Prem Nath Kapur[3], has held that
			<lb />
			the deposit of the amount of the compensation in the state&quot;s
			<lb />
			revenue account is of no avail and the liability of the state to
			<lb />
			pay interest subsists till the amount has not been deposited in
			<lb />
			court.
			<lb />
			20. From the above, it is clear that the award pertaining to
			<lb />
			the subject land has been made by the Special Land Acquisition
			<lb />
			Officer more than five years prior to the commencement of the
			<lb />
			2013 Act. It is also admitted position that compensation so
			<lb />
			awarded has neither been paid to the landowners/persons
			<lb />
			interested nor deposited in the court. The deposit of
			<lb />
			compensation amount in the government treasury is of no avail
			<lb />
			and cannot be held to be equivalent to compensation paid to the
			<lb />
			landowners/persons interested. We have, therefore, no
			<lb />
			hesitation in holding that the subject land acquisition
			<lb />
			proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed under Section
			<lb />
			24(2) of the 2013 Act.&quot;
			<lb />

		</p>
		<p>
			9.We are of the considered view that the necessary ingredients for the
			<lb />
			application of Section 24(2) of the New Act as has been interpreted by
			<lb />
			the Supreme Court of India and this Court in the following cases stand
			<lb />
			satisfied:
			<lb />
		</p>
		   
			<item>
			(1) Pune Municipal Corporation &amp; Anr. v. Harakchand
			<lb />
			Misirimal Solanki &amp; ors., reported at (2014) 3 SCC 183;
			<lb />
		</item>
			<item>
			(2) Union of India and Ors v. Shiv Raj and Ors., reported at
			<lb />
			(2014) 6 SCC 564;
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(3) Sree Balaji Nagar Residential Association v. State of
			<lb />
			Tamil Nadu and Ors, Civil Appeal no.8700/2013 decided on
			<lb />
			10.09.2014;
			<lb />
		</item>
			<item>
			(4) Surender Singh v. Union of India &amp; Others,
			<lb />
			W.P.(C).2294/2014 decided on 12.09.2014 by this Court; and
			<lb />
		</item>
		<item>
			(5) Girish Chhabra v. Lt. Governor of Delhi and Ors;
			<lb />
			W.P.(C).2759/2014 decided on 12.09.2014 by this Court.
			<lb />
		</item>
	   

		<p>
			10. In view of the discussion above, the petitioner is entitled to a
			<lb />
			declaration that the acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land
			<lb />
			Acquisition Act, 1894 with regard to the subject land are deemed to
			<lb />
			have lapsed. It is so declared.
			<lb />
			11. The writ petition stands disposed of. No orders as to costs.
