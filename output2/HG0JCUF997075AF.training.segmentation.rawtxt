JUDGMENT 

GITA MITTAL, J 

1. 
By way of the instant appeal under Section 19 of the Family 

Court Act, 1984, the appellant wife assails the order dated 28 th 

January, 2016 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Courts, New 

Delhi in HMA No.223/2015 whereby the trial court allowed an 

application under Section 151 of the CPC moved by the respondent 

no.1 husband seeking a DNA test of the appellant and the minor 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 2 of 95 

child. 

2. 
Before examining the impugned order, we propose to notice 

the essential facts which emerge from the family court record and 

give rise to the present appeal. Marriage between the appellant and 

the respondent no.1 was solemnised on 3 rd December, 2007 in 

accordance with Hindu rites and ceremonies at the Ashoka Hotel, 

Chanakyapuri, New Delhi. 

3. 
At the time of the marriage, H-respondent no. 1 was serving 

as an officer of the Indian Administrative Services (IAS) in the 

Nagaland Cadre and was posted at District Mokokchung, Nagaland 

while the appellant was residing with her parents, continuing her 

studies, and preparing for the civil services examination. The 

appellant also qualified the IAS examination in the year 2009 and 

was allotted the U.P. Cadre of the Indian Administrative Services. 

On this basis, the respondent no.1 applied for change of cadre and, 

in the middle of June, 2011, was relieved of his charge in Nagaland 

and was posted as District Magistrate in Lakhimpur, Kheri District 

in U.P. 

4. 
In July, 2012, the respondent was transferred as a District 

Magistrate, Bareilly while the appellant was appointed as a Chief 

Development Officer of District Lucknow. In February, 2013, the 

appellant was transferred as a District Magistrate, Pilibhit. 

5. 
It appears that a decision was taken by the H & W to seek 

dissolution of their marriage. On the 1 st of October 2014, a joint 

petition was filed by H-the respondent no.1 (as petitioner no.1) and 

W-the appellant (as petitioner no.2) under Section 13B(1) of the 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 3 of 95 

Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 seeking dissolution of marriage of the 

parties by a decree of divorce by mutual consent which was 

registered as HMA No.1099/2014 at the court of the Principal 

Judge, Family Courts, Saket, New Delhi. We extract hereunder 

certain material averments made in this joint petition : 

"6. However, while there have been, because of 
temperamental difference and incompatibility, reduced 
time of cohabitation and living together and also 
occupational placements, the parties, for the last one 
year, have been residing separately. 
7. 
That a child named (Baby X) was born on 
6.10.2013 at Lucknow and the child is in custody of the 
mother at Sultanpur. 
8. 
That the petitioner no.1 (sic. husband) is 
presently posted as District Magistrate in Aligarh and 
the petitioner no.2 (sic. wife) is posted as District 
Magistrate, Sultanpur. Both the petitioners are well 
settled in life. 
9. 
That due to temperamental differences, parties 
to the present petition have not been able to live in 
cordial atmosphere at the matrimonial home. 
10. That the parties are living separately from each 
other for more than a year and there has been no 
resumption of any cohabitation between them, nor 
there is any chance for the same. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
13. That the parties have resolved their disputes and 
differences and it has been specifically agreed by the 
petitioner no.1 and petitioner no. 2 that petitioner no.2 
or her relatives shall not claim anything from petitioner 
no.1 (or his relatives) in any court of law in India and 
outside India. Likewise, petitioner no.1 shall make no 
claim from petitioner no.2 (or her relatives). 
14. That it is agreed between both the parties that 
petitioner no.2 neither be entitled to any amount from 
petitioner no.1 (as she has voluntarily relinquished all 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 4 of 95 

her claims against petitioner no.1) nor shall claim any 
right in any of his assets, movable or immovable, in any 
manner whatsoever in India or outside India, past, 
present and future. Similarly, petitioner no.1 has 
relinquished all his claims, past, present and future 
against petitioner no.2. 
15. Considering the welfare of the child, she would 
grow up exclusively in the custody of mother, i.e., 
petitioner no.2 (Baby X). Petitioner no.1 gives up all 
claims to custody even access. He shall not be liable 
for maintenance and education of the child in present 
or future, which shall be borne by petitioner no.2 
solely. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
17. That the present petition is not being presented in 
collusion with each other. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
20. That the parties to the present petition are not 
accessory to nor have connived with each other in 
presenting the present petition." 

6. 
This petition was verified on solemn affirmation. It was 

supported by an affidavit of both the parties. In para 1 of his 

affidavit, the respondent no.1 husband clearly stated that the 

petition "has been drafted by my counsel at my instructions. I have 

read and understood the contents thereof and hereby state that the 

same are true and correct". The affidavit also contained 

unequivocal declarations of non-collusion; voluntariness of the 

mutual consent and that he was not an accessory to or have 

connived at with petitioner no.2 in presenting or prosecuting the 

present petition. 

7. 
The above petition contains an absolute admission that a 

child named Baby 'X' was born to the parties on 6 th of October 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 5 of 95 

2013 who was in custody of the mother who was posted at 

Sultanpur. There is a further admission of fatherhood by the 

respondent no.1 in para 15 of the petition when he unequivocally 

gives up all claims to custody, even to access to the child, and 

abandons responsibility for her maintenance and education which 

was agreed to be borne by the mother alone. The parties clearly 

mentioned that the child would grow up exclusively in the "custody 

of the mother" endorsing the abandonment of custody rights by the 

other party. 

8. 
In the joint statement recorded of the appellant and the 

respondent no.1 on the 1 st of October 2014 by the Principal Judge 

(South-East), Family Courts, Saket, H-the respondent no.1 once 

again declared that "a child named Baby X was born on 6.10.2013 

at Lucknow and the child is in custody of the mother at Sultanpur". 

In this statement on oath, H-the respondent no.1 again referred to 

the agreement that the "permanent custody of the minor child baby 

shall remain with the petitioner no.2/wife". 

9. 
The Family Court had raised an objection with regard to the 

maintainability of the petition in the Family Court at Saket on 

account of territorial jurisdiction. In view of this objection, on the 

22 nd October, 2014, the parties agreed to withdraw the petition with 

opportunity to file a fresh petition before the court having 

competent jurisdiction. The Family Court recorded the statement 

of counsels for the parties and permitted the petition to be 

withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh petition before the court of 

competent jurisdiction. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 6 of 95 

10. On the 31 st of October 2014, the appellant and respondent 

no.1 jointly filed a second petition before the Family Court, Patiala 

House under Section 13B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, 

registered as HMA No.783/2014, for dissolution of their marriage 

by way of decree of divorce by mutual consent which was 

containing the identical averments as paras 6 to 10 and 13 to 15 of 

the first petition, as extracted above. In para 25, the parties 

disclosed the filing of the previous petition being HMA 

No.1099/2014 in the Saket Family Courts. The petition was again 

supported by separate affidavits of the appellant as well as 

respondent no.1. 

In para 13, the respondent no.1 had again declared that the 

parties have resolved their disputes and differences. 

11. It appears that thereafter, the respondent no.1 filed an 

application for withdrawal of the above petition urging that there 

were certain unwritten conditions also, agreed upon between the 

parties, and that he would continue with a criminal complaint 

which stood filed by him against the appellant and the respondent 

no.2 on grounds of adultery and that he was not prepared to 

withdraw the said complaint. The respondent no.1 claimed that he 

had agreed to file a petition by mutual consent purely in the interest 

of the child involved in the case and to bring to an end the 

relationship of the parties which was non-existent on account of 

certain acts attributed to the appellant. In view thereof, the 

respondent no.1 stated that he was withdrawing from the joint 

petition and prayed for its dismissal. As a result, on 9 th January, 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 7 of 95 

2015, the Principal Judge, Patiala House, Delhi dismissed the joint 

petition as withdrawn with liberty to the respondent no.1 to file a 

fresh petition for dissolution of marriage under appropriate 

provisions of law. The learned Family Court noted the absence of 

the appellant wife. 

12. It is only thereafter that on or about the 29 th January, 2015, 

the respondent no.1 filed HMA No.3329/2014 before the Principal 

Judge, Family Court, Lucknow under Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu 

Marriage Act for dissolution of marriage of the appellant and 

respondent no.1 by a decree of divorce. In this petition, H-the 

respondent no. 1 levelled allegations of adultery on the part of the 

appellant with a person who was impleaded as a respondent no.2 

and for the first time denied paternity of the child of the parties 

born on 6 th October, 2013. 

13. This petition was transferred by the Supreme Court of India 

from Lucknow to Delhi vide order dated 23 rd February, 2015 

passed in Transfer Petition (Civil) No.1886/2014. The appellant 

filed a detailed written statement contesting allegations of the 

appellant and vehemently denying the allegations of adultery. 

14. The appellant has set-up a case that she was subjected to 

grave torture and abuse, both mental and physical, at the hands of 

the respondent no.1; that the parties were cohabiting as husband 

and wife at their postings and that the respondent no.1 husband 

would come and stay at Lucknow or she would go and stay with 

him on leave or whenever visiting his place of posting. The 

appellant has asserted that she conceived from their wedlock and 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 8 of 95 

cohabitation and in February, 2013 told the respondent no.1 that 

she was expecting their child. 

The respondent no.1 urges that this information was received 

from her only in April, 2013. 

15. On 6 th of October 2013, the appellant gave birth to a girl 

child at Lucknow. On 18 th October, 2013, a lunch and pooja 

ceremony was organized at the house of the appellant's parents 

which was attended by the parents of the respondent no.1 and large 

number of his guests. The priest who performed the pooja is stated 

to be an old acquaintance of the respondent no.1 and his parents 

from the time of his posting at Lakhimpur, Kheri District. 

16. The appellant submits that between 9 th and 29 th November, 

2013, the appellant visited Bareilly and stayed with the respondent. 

However, thereafter, the parties could not cohabit with each other. 

17. Replication thereto was filed by the respondent husband 

disputing the allegations of the wife. 

18. Issues were framed in the matter on 24 th August, 2015 and 

the matter proceeded to evidence of the appellant. 

19. The respondent no. 1 thereafter filed his list of witnesses. 

He also filed his examination in chief by way of affidavit dated 29 th 

July, 2015 which was tendered in evidence and he was examined 

extensively on 14 th ; 24 th ; 28 th ; and 29 th September, 2015 when his 

cross examination was concluded. 

20. On the next date of hearing i.e. 16 th October, 2015, the 

evidence of PW-2 Sh. Vikas Verma was recorded and he was 

discharged. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 9 of 95 

21. The matter was posted for the remaining evidence of the 

respondent no.1 on 29 th October, 2015 and 9 th November, 2015. 

22. The next witness was Inspector Vijaymal Singh Yadav who 

was examined as PW-3 on 8 th December, 2015 and discharged. 

23. On the 14 th of October 2015, the husband-respondent no.1 

filed an application under Section 151 C.P.C. seeking a direction 

for conducting the DNA test of the respondent no.1 and the child to 

ascertain as to whether he was the biological father of the child and 

for a further direction to the appellant to produce the child either in 

court or elsewhere to enable her blood samples to be taken. This 

application was also listed on the above dates. The appellant had 

filed a note dated 4 th of January 2016 opposing the application on 

merits and in law. 

24. This application was allowed by the Family Court by the 

order dated 28 th of January 2016 inter alia directing the appellant to 

bring the child to the office of the Director, CFSL in the CGO 

Complex, Lodhi Road when the respondent no.1 was also directed 

to remain present so that the blood samples could be taken in the 

presence of the parties. 

This order has been assailed by way of the present appeal. 

25. Before examining the rival contentions, we summarise the 

headings under which this matter has been considered : 

I. 
Direction for compelling a medical examination or a 
DNA test to establish any fact -when to be made?

XVI. Result (para 185) 

We now propose to discuss the above in seriatim. 

I. 
Direction for compelling a medical examination or a DNA 
test to establish any fact -when to be made? 

26. In the present case, it is an admitted position that the prayer 

for the DNA examination is made qua a child born during the 

subsistence of a marriage. Such prayer has been judicially 

examined on principles which apply to a prayer for a medical 

examination of a party in a case. Directions for such examinations, 

which are akin to a DNA testing, may be made for a variety of 

reasons. Say for instance, it may be necessary for the court to 

satisfy itself as to whether a party before it suffers from mental 

illness or not either for the purposes of appointment of a guardian 

ad litem in terms of Order XXXII Rule 15 of the Code of Civil 

Procedure or Section 41 of the Mental Health Act,1987 as also for 

the determination under Section 118 of the Indian Evidence Act of 

a person's competency as a witness. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 12 of 95 

27. DNA testing has come into existence by scientific evolution 

as yet another test utilised for establishing relationships in the 

nature of paternity or shared parentage between parties in litigation. 

Applications for directions to the other party to appear or produce 

off springs or siblings for DNA testing are made by parties seeking 

to establish, either, the factum of the relationship, or, their 

challenge to the relationship. It could be by a person claiming 

parentage or by a person challenging paternity of another. 

28. So far as a challenge to paternity is concerned, it is well 

settled that a rebuttable presumption lies under Section 112 of the 

Indian Evidence Act, 1872 in favour of the paternity of the 

legitimacy of a child born during marriage. For expediency, we 

extract Section 112 which reads as follows : 

"Section 112 in The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 
112. Birth during marriage, conclusive proof of 
legitimacy.-The fact that any person was born during 
the continuance of a valid marriage between his 
mother and any man, or within two hundred and 
eighty days after its dissolution, the mother remaining 
unmarried, shall be conclusive proof that he is the 
legitimate son of that man, unless it can be shown that 
the parties to the marriage had no access to each other at 
any time when he could have been begotten." 
(Emphasis by us) 

29. The question which has to be answered in the present case is 

as to the permissibility of a DNA test? On this issue, the 

observations in paras 82 to 85 of the pronouncement in the three 

Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court in AIR 2003 SC 3450, 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 13 of 95 

Sharda v. Dharampal in the context of a medical examination are 

topical and read thus : 

"80. The matter may be considered from another angle. In 
all such matrimonial cases where divorce is sought, say on 
the ground of impotency, schizophrenia etc. normally 
without there being medical examination, it would be 
difficult to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the 
allegation made by a spouse against the other spouse 
seeking divorce on such a ground, is correct or not. In order 
to substantiate such allegation, the petitioner would always 
insist on medical examination. If the respondent avoids 
such medical examination on the ground that it violates 
his/her right to privacy or for that matter right to personal 
liberty as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of 
India, then it may in most of such cases become impossible 
to arrive at a conclusion. It may render the very grounds on 
which divorce is permissible nugatory. Therefore, when 
there is no right to privacy specifically conferred by Article 
21 of the Constitution of India and with the extensive 
interpretation of the phrase "personal liberty" this right has 
been read into Article 21, it cannot be treated as an absolute 
right. What is emphasized is that some limitations on this 
right have to be imposed and particularly where two 
competing interests clash. In matters of the aforesaid 
nature where the legislature has conferred a right upon 
his spouse to seek divorce on such grounds, it would be 
the right of that spouse which comes in conflict with the 
so-called right to privacy of the respondent. Thus the court 
has to reconcile these competing interests by balancing 
the interests involved. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
82.It is, however, axiomatic that a court shall not order a 
roving inquiry. It must have sufficient materials before it 
to enable it to exercise its discretion. Exercise of such 
discretion would be subjected to the supervisory 
jurisdiction of the High Court in terms of Section 115 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure and/or Article 227 of the 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 14 of 95 

Constitution of India. Abuse of the discretionary power at 
the hands of a court is not expected. The court must arrive 
at a finding that the applicant has established a strong 
prima facie case before passing such an order. 
83. If despite an order passed by the court, a person refuses 
to submit himself to such medical examination, a strong 
case for drawing an adverse inference would be made out. 
Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act also enables a court 
to draw an adverse inference if the party does not produce 
the relevant evidences in his power and possession. 
84. So viewed, the implicit power of a court to direct 
medical examination of a party to a matrimonial litigation 
in a case of this nature cannot be held to be violative of 
one's right of privacy. 
85. To sum up, our conclusions are: 
1. A matrimonial court has the power to order a person to 
undergo medical test. 
2. Passing of such an order by the court would not be in 
violation of the right to personal liberty under Article 21 of 
the Indian Constitution. 
3. However, the court should exercise such a power if the 
applicant has a strong prima facie case and there is 
sufficient material before the court. If despite the order of 
the court, the respondent refuses to submit himself to 
medical examination, the court will be entitled to draw an 
adverse inference against him." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

It is therefore, well settled that the court in an appropriate 

case, can direct medical examination of a party to matrimonial 

litigation as well provided that the applicant seeking such 

examination has a "strong prima facie" case and has placed 

"substantial material" on the court record in support of his/her 

case. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 15 of 95 

30. On the same aspect, we may usefully refer to the 

pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (2005) 4 SCC 

449 Sh. Banarasi Dass v. Mrs. Teeku Datta. This case arose in 

the context of succession where a challenge was laid to the 

paternity of the petitioner who claimed to be the daughter of 

deceased who was alleged to have died intestate leaving behind 

five brothers. Originally, only four of the brothers were impleaded, 

out of which two passed away. The petition was filed only against 

two brothers and subsequently, the third brother was also 

impleaded. One of the brothers objected to the grant of the 

succession certificate disputing Mrs. Teeku Datta's claim of 

paternity. As both the objector's brother and his wife were dead, 

he sought a DNA examination of the petitioner with the DNA of 

the other respondents. We note hereunder the consideration and 

discussion by the courts in paras 10, 11, 12 and 13 which read thus: 

"10. In matters of this kind the court must have regard 
to Section 112 of the Evidence Act. This section is 
based on the well-known maxim pater is est quem 
nuptiae demonstrant (he is the father whom the 
marriage indicates). The presumption of legitimacy is 
this, that a child born of a married woman is deemed 
to be legitimate, it throws on the person who is 
interested in making out the illegitimacy, the whole 
burden of proving it. The law presumes both that a 
marriage ceremony is valid, and that every person is 
legitimate. Marriage or filiation (parentage) may be 
presumed, the law in general presuming against vice and 
immorality. 
11. It is rebuttable presumption of law that a child born 
during lawful wedlock is legitimate, and that access 
occurred between the parents. This presumption can 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 16 of 95 

only be displaced by a strong preponderance of 
evidence, and not by a mere balance of probabilities. 
12. In Dukhtar Jahan v. Mohd. Farooq [(1987) 1 SCC 
624 : 1987 SCC (Cri) 237] this Court held: (SCC p. 629, 
para 12) 
"Section 112 lays down that if a person was born 
during the continuance of a valid marriage between 
his mother and any man or within two hundred and 
eighty days after its dissolution and the mother 
remains unmarried, it shall be taken as conclusive 
proof that he is the legitimate son of that man, unless 
it can be shown that the parties to the marriage had 
no access to each other at any time when he could 
have been begotten. This rule of law based on the 
dictates of justice has always made the courts 
incline towards upholding the legitimacy of a child 
unless the facts are so compulsive and clinching as 
to necessarily warrant a finding that the child could 
not at all have been begotten to the father and as 
such a legitimation of the child would result in rank 
injustice to the father. Courts have always desisted 
from lightly or hastily rendering a verdict and that 
too, on the basis of slender materials, which will 
have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and 
its mother an unchaste woman." 
The view has been reiterated by this Court in many later 
cases e.g. Amarjit Kaur v.Harbhajan Singh [(2003) 10 
SCC 228]." 
(Emphasis by us) 

The presumption of legitimacy thus cannot be disturbed by 

"slender" materials under "compulsive and clinching" facts are 

brought to shake the presumption and call for a DNA examination. 

Proof of non-access was essential. 

31. So far as the facts of the case were concerned, in para 14, the 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 17 of 95 

court observed thus : 

"14. .... In order to succeed in the succession application the 
applicant has to adduce cogent and credible evidence in 
support of the application. The respondents, if they so 
choose, can also adduce evidence to oppose grant of 
succession certificate. The trial court erroneously held that 
the documents produced by the respondents were not 
sufficient or relevant for the purpose of adjudication and 
DNA test was conclusive. This is not a correct view. It is 
for the parties to place evidence in support of their 
respective claims and establish their stands. DNA test is 
not to be directed as a matter of routine and only in 
deserving cases such a direction can be given, as was 
noted in Goutam Kundu case [(1993) 3 SCC 418 : 1993 
SCC (Cri) 928] . Present case does not fall in that category. 
The High Court's judgment does not suffer from any 
infirmity. We, therefore, uphold it. It is made clear that we 
have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case 
relating to succession application." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

32. The observations of the court in paras 12 and 13 of the 

judgment reported at AIR 2010 SC 2851, Bhabani Prasad Jena v. 

Convenor Secretary, Orissa State Commission for Women & Anr. 

shed valuable light on the issue under consideration and are 

therefore set down in extenso : 

"12. Recently, in Ramkanya Bai v. Bharatram [(2010) 1 
SCC 85] decided by the Bench of which one of us, R.M. 
Lodha, J. was the member, the order of the High Court 
directing DNA test of the child at the instance of the 
husband was set aside and it was held that the High Court 
was not justified in allowing the application for grant of 
DNA test of the child on the ground that there will be 
possibility of reunion of the parties if such DNA test was 
conducted and if it was found from the outcome of the 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 18 of 95 

DNA test that the son was born from the wedlock of the 
parties. 
13. In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue before 
the court, the use of DNA test is an extremely delicate and 
sensitive aspect. One view is that when modern science 
gives the means of ascertaining the paternity of a child, 
there should not be any hesitation to use those means 
whenever the occasion requires. The other view is that the 
court must be reluctant in the use of such scientific 
advances and tools which result in invasion of right to 
privacy of an individual and may not only be prejudicial to 
the rights of the parties but may have devastating effect on 
the child. Sometimes the result of such scientific test may 
bastardise an innocent child even though his mother and her 
spouse were living together during the time of conception. 
In our view, when there is apparent conflict between the 
right to privacy of a person not to submit himself forcibly 
to medical examination and duty of the court to reach the 
truth, the court must exercise its discretion only after 
balancing the interests of the parties and on due 
consideration whether for a just decision in the matter, 
DNA test is eminently needed. DNA test in a matter 
relating to paternity of a child should not be directed by 
the court as a matter of course or in a routine manner, 
whenever such a request is made. The court has to 
consider diverse aspects including presumption under 
Section 112 of the Evidence Act; pros and cons of such 
order and the test of "eminent need" whether it is not 
possible for the court to reach the truth without use of 
such test." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

33. The conclusiveness of the presumption under Section 112 of 

the Indian Evidence Act, therefore, cannot be disturbed lightly. 

These principles bound the Family Court in the present case 

while considering the application which was filed by the present 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 19 of 95 

respondent no.1. 

II. 
Displacement of the conclusive presumption under Section 
112 of the Indian Evidence Act -Standard of proof to do 
so? 

34. Given the weight attached to the presumption of paternity of 

a child born during the subsistence of a marriage under Section 

112, what would be the standards on which such a presumption 

under Section 112 would be rebutted? This issue is also no longer 

res integra and has been discussed by the Supreme Court in the 

judgments reported at AIR 2001 SC 2226 Kamti Devi v. Poshi 

Ram as well as (2009) 12 SCC 454 : AIR 2009 SC 3115 Sham 

Lal alias Kuldeep v. Sanjeev Kumar & Ors. We borrow the words 

of the Supreme Court on this very important aspect. 

35. In AIR 2001 SC 2226 Kamti Devi (Smt.) & Anr. v. Poshi 

Ram, the husband filed a civil suit for decree declaring that he is 

not the father of a child born on 4 th September, 1996 i.e. 15 years 

after the marriage of the parties (in 1975) on the ground that he had 

no access to the appellant during the period when the child would 

have been begotten. The trial court relied on the conclusive 

presumption in Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act and holding 

that the husband had failed to prove that he had no access to his 

wife during the relevant period, dismissed the suit. The first 

appellate court, however, re-evaluated the entire evidence and held 

that the husband had succeeded in discharging the burden of 

rebutting the presumption by proving that he had no access to the 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 20 of 95 

mother of the child during a very long stretch of time covering the 

relevant period and consequently allowed the appeal and decreed 

the suit. The High Court also refused to interfere with this finding 

on the ground that it was pure question of fact calling for no 

interference by the court in the second appeal under Section 100 of 

the Code of Civil Procedure. Kamti Devi filed a special leave 

petition before the Supreme Court assailing the orders against her. 

36. In its judgment, the Supreme Court has authoritatively laid 

down the impact of presumption of Section 112 of the Indian 

Evidence Act and the manner in which the same can be rebutted in 

paras 9 to 12 of the pronouncement which read in Kamti Devi as 

follows : 

"9. When the legislature chose to employ the expression 
that a certain fact "shall be conclusive proof" of another 
fact, normally the parties are disabled from disrupting such 
proof. This can be discerned from the definition of the 
expression "conclusive proof" in Section 4 of the Act: 
"4. 'Conclusive proof'.-When one fact is declared 
by this Act to be conclusive proof of another, the court 
shall, on proof of the one fact, regard the other as 
proved, and shall not allow evidence to be given for the 
purpose of disproving it." 
10. But Section 112 itself provides an outlet to the party 
who wants to escape from the rigour of that conclusiveness. 
The said outlet is, if it can be shown that the parties had no 
access to each other at the time when the child could have 
been begotten the presumption could be rebutted. In other 
words, the party who wants to dislodge the conclusiveness 
has the burden to show a negative, not merely that he did 
not have the opportunity to approach his wife but that she 
too did not have the opportunity of approaching him 
during the relevant time. Normally, the rule of evidence in 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 21 of 95 

other instances is that the burden is on the party who 
asserts the positive, but in this instance the burden is cast 
on the party who pleads the negative. The raison d'être is 
the legislative concern against illegitimatizing a child. It is 
a sublime public policy that children should not suffer 
social disability on account of the laches or lapses of 
parents." 
11. We may remember that Section 112 of the Evidence 
Act was enacted at a time when the modern scientific 
advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well as 
ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not even in 
contemplation of the legislature. The result of a genuine 
DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. But even 
that is not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of 
Section 112 of the Act e.g. if a husband and wife were 
living together during the time of conception but the DNA 
test revealed that the child was not born to the husband, 
the conclusiveness in law would remain irrebuttable. This 
may look hard from the point of view of the husband who 
would be compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of 
which he may be innocent. But even in such a case the 
law leans in favour of the innocent child from being 
bastardised if his mother and her spouse were living 
together during the time of conception. Hence the 
question regarding the degree of proof of non-access for 
rebutting the conclusiveness must be answered in the light 
of what is meant by access or non-access as delineated 
above. 
12. Whether the burden on the husband is as hard as the 
prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused in a trial 
deserves consideration in the above background. The 
standard of proof of prosecution to prove the guilt beyond 
any reasonable doubt belongs to criminal jurisprudence 
whereas the test of preponderance of probabilities belongs 
to civil cases. The reason for insisting on proof beyond 
reasonable doubt in criminal cases is to guard against the 
innocent being convicted and sent to jail if not to extreme 
penalty of death. It would be too hard if that standard is 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 22 of 95 

imported in a civil case for a husband to prove non-access 
as the very concept of non-access is negative in nature. 
But at the same time the test of preponderance of 
probability is too light as that might expose many children 
to the peril of being illegitimatized. If a court declares that 
the husband is not the father of his wife's child, without 
tracing out its real father the fallout on the child is 
ruinous apart from all the ignominy visiting his mother. 
The bastardised child, when grows up would be socially 
ostracised and can easily fall into wayward life. Hence, by 
way of abundant caution and as a matter of public policy, 
law cannot afford to allow such consequence befalling an 
innocent child on the strength of a mere tilting of 
probability. Its corollary is that the burden of the plaintiff 
husband should be higher than the standard of 
preponderance of probabilities. The standard of proof in 
such cases must at least be of a degree in between the two 
as to ensure that there was no possibility of the child 
being conceived through the plaintiff husband." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

37. In para 11, the Supreme Court has clearly laid down that if 

the husband and wife were living together during the time of 

conception but the DNA test stated that the child was not born to 

the husband, the conclusiveness in law by virtue of Section 112 of 

the Indian Evidence Act would remain irrebuttable. 

38. Some indication of the nature and extent of the scrutiny to be 

conducted by the court, is to be found in paras 14 and 15 of Kamti 

Devi v. Poshi Ram which read thus : 

"14. In the present case the first appellate court, which is 
the final fact-finding court, after evaluating the entire 
evidence, came to the following conclusion: 
"In the present case the plaintiff has examined all the 
evidence which he possibly could do in the 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 23 of 95 

circumstances. He has proved by convincing 
evidence, that he did not visit his village or house 
where the defendant was allotted one room. He has 
further proved that the defendant also never visited 
him at Mandi where he had been living for more than 
2 years before the child was born to Kamti Devi. In 
other words he has proved that he had no access or 
opportunity for sexual intercourse with Defendant 1 
for more than 280 days before Roshan Lal (Defendant 
2) was begotten by Defendant 1. 
15. The said conclusion was reached on the strength of the 
evidence adduced by both sides and the first appellate court 
was satisfied in full measure that the plaintiff husband had 
no opportunity whatsoever to have liaison with the 
defendant mother. The finding thus reached by the first 
appellate court cannot be interfered with in a second appeal 
as no substantial question of law would have flowed out of 
such a finding." 
(Emphasis by us) 

The reference is to "convincing evidence"; "proved that he 

had no access or opportunity" and the entirety of evidence stood 

placed before the court. 

39. The above principles were reiterated by the Supreme Court 

in Banarsi Dass in the following terms : 

13. We may remember that Section 112 of the Evidence 
Act was enacted at a time when the modern scientific 
advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as 
well as ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not even in 
contemplation of the legislature. The result of a 
genuine DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. 
But even that is not enough to escape from the 
conclusiveness of Section 112 of the Evidence Act e.g. 
if a husband and wife were living together during the 
time of conception but the DNA test revealed that the 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 24 of 95 

child was not born to the husband, the conclusiveness 
in law would remain irrebuttable. This may look hard 
from the point of view of the husband who would be 
compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of which 
he may be innocent. But even in such a case the law 
leans in favour of the innocent child from being 
bastardised if his mother and her spouse were living 
together during the time of conception. Hence the 
question regarding the degree of proof of non-access 
for rebutting the conclusiveness must be answered in 
the light of what is meant by access or non-access as 
delineated 
above. 
(See 
Kamti 
Devi v. Poshi 
Ram [(2001) 5 SCC 311 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 892] .)" 

40. In this judgment, the court had reiterated that even the result 

of a genuine DNA test (which revealed that the child was not born 

to the husband) said to be scientifically accurate, is not sufficient to 

displace the conclusiveness of Section 112, if a husband and wife 

were living together at the time of the conception. 

41. We may also advert to the pronouncement of the Supreme 

Court reported at (2009) 12 SCC 454 : AIR 2009 SC 3115 Sham 

Lal alias Kuldeep v. Sanjeev Kumar & Ors., "....once the validity 

of marriage is proved then there is strong presumption about the 

legitimacy of children born from that wedlock.....". In para 22 of 

the precedent, the Supreme Court has observed that "the 

presumption of legitimacy arises from birth in wedlock and not 

from conception". 

It was observed that there was no evidence on record in this 

case that Balak Ram at any point of time did not have access to 

Smt. Durgi (mother of the plaintiff and defendant no.4). 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 25 of 95 

42. The further observations of the Supreme Court in paras 39, 

40 and 42 of the pronouncement, on the manner in which the 

presumption under Section 112 can be reubutted, are important and 

read as follows : 

"39.The findings of the High Court on the interpretation 
of Section 112 of the Evidence Act are based on correct 
analysis of Indian and English cases for the last more 
than a century. According to the legislative intention 
and spirit behind Section 112 of the Evidence Act it is 
abundantly clear that once the validity of marriage is 
proved then there is strong presumption about the 
legitimacy of children born from that wedlock. The 
presumption can only be rebutted by a strong, clear, 
satisfying and conclusive evidence. The presumption 
cannot be displaced by mere balance of probabilities or 
any circumstance creating doubt. 
40. In the instant case, admittedly the plaintiff and 
Defendant 4 were born to Smt Durgi during the 
continuance of her valid marriage with the deceased 
Balak Ram. Their marriage was in fact never dissolved. 
There is no evidence on record that the deceased Balak 
Ram at any point of time did not have access to Smt 
Durgi. According to the clear interpretation of Section 
112 of the Evidence Act, there is strong presumption 
about the legitimacy of children born out of 
continuation of the valid marriage. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
42. It is well-settled principle of law that odiosa et 
inhonesta non sunt in lege praesumenda (nothing odious 
or dishonourable will be presumed by the law). The law 
presumes against vice and immorality. In a civilised 
society it is imperative to presume the legitimacy of a 
child born during continuation of a valid marriage and 
whose parents had "access" to each other. It is 
undesirable to enquire into the paternity of a child 
whose parents "have access" to each other. Section 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 26 of 95 

112 of the Evidence Act is based on presumption of 
public morality and public policy." 
(Emphasis by us) 

43. The presumption under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence 

Act can be displaced only by such evidence which meets a standard 

higher than preponderance of probabilities, and not by a mere 

preponderance of probabilities. The strong presumption under 

Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act of legitimacy of a child 

born during marriage therefore can only be rebutted by "strong, 

clear, satisfying and conclusive" evidence of "non access". 

III. What is the meaning of "access"and "non-access" 

44. The present case raises issues which are really first 

principles and fundamentals for consideration of an application 

seeking DNA examination of a sample of a child wherein issue of 

his or her paternity is raised. It is trite that the party seeking the 

test, has to first and foremost make out a prima facie case that the 

alleged father had no access to the mother of the child at the time 

when the child could reasonably have been conceived. 

45. Before examining any other aspect, it becomes necessary to 

examine what would be the meaning of "access" in the context of 

examination of the paternity of the child. 

46. Earlier, the High Courts had held that "access" in an 

examination of a paternity action means actual sexual intercourse 

between the parties. This controversy came to a rest by three Judge 

Bench pronouncement of the Privy Council reported at AIR 1934 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 27 of 95 

PC 49, Karapaya Servai v. Mayandi wherein it was held that the 

word "access" means "no more than opportunity of intercourse". 

47. The factual matrix deemed sufficient by the Privy Council to 

presume legitimacy of birth sheds valuable light on the facts before 

us. The same reads thus : 

"The materiality of these facts, however, is that in 
December 1911, the parties were admittedly in touch with 
each other, were residing at all events for a short period 
in reasonable proximity, the wife being in the house of a 
relative of the husband, and that there is nothing in the 
agreement to suggest that she was unfaithful or that the 
parties were on terms of personal hostility, though no 
doubt the presence of the second wife would make an open 
reconciliation difficult. If, therefore, the respondent could 
have been begotton during this period his legitimacy was 
undeniable." 
(Emphasis by us) 

48. The above legal principle was approved by a three Judge 

Bench of the Supreme Court in the decision reported at AIR 1954 

SC 176 : 1954 SCR 424 Chilukuri Venkateswarlu v. Chilukuri 

Venkatanarayan. In this case, a suit was filed by Chilukuri 

Venkateswarlu, an infant represented by his maternal uncle as his 

next friend for recovery of possession, on partition of ½ share of 

certain properties, on the allegation that they were joint family 

properties of his father, the defendant nos. 1 and himself. The 

plaintiff was admittedly the son of defendant no.2, a legally 

wedded wife of defendant no.1. The defence put forward by 

defendant no.1 to the plaintiff's claim, was a denial of his paternity. 

The Supreme Court observed thus : 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 28 of 95 

"On the admitted facts of the case, there could be no 
question that the operation of Section 112 of the Indian 
Evidence Act would be attracted and the plaintiff being 
born during the continuance of a lawful wedlock between 
his mother and his alleged father, a conclusive presumption 
of legitimacy would arise, unless it was proved that the 
parties to the marriage had no access to each other at any 
time when he could have been begotten. The point for 
determination, therefore, was whether on the evidence 
adduced-in the case Defendant 1, upon whom the burden of 
proving non-access admittedly lay, had succeeded in 
discharging that burden. xxxx 
It may be stated at the outset that the presumption which 
Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act contemplates is a 
conclusive presumption of law which can be displaced 
only by proof of the particular fact mentioned in the 
section, namely, non-access between the parties to the 
marriage at a time when according to the ordinary course 
of nature the husband could have been the father of the 
child. Access and non-access again connote, as has been 
held by the Privy Council [ Vide Karapaya v. Mayandy, 12 
Rang 243] , existence and non-existence of opportunities 
for marital intercourse. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
There is no evidence of any unnatural conduct on the part 
of Defendant 1 towards the plaintiff's mother at about the 
time when the plaintiff was conceived. 
Apparently for some reason or other, the husband took up 
an unnatural attitude, but this was a subsequent event and 
whether he had really any grievance against his wife, or his 
unnatural behaviour was due to the instigation of his third 
wife, it is not necessary for us to investigate. On the 
evidence, as it stands, we are clearly of opinion that 
Defendant 1 did not succeed in proving that there was no 
opportunity for intercourse between him and Defendant 2 
at the time when the plaintiff was conceived. He rested his 
whole case upon the allegation of unchastity of the 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 29 of 95 

plaintiff's mother and of the plaintiff being born as the 
result of fornication. 

While rejecting that story, the High Court, in our opinion, 
erred in holding that there was no opportunity for access 
between the parties at the material period, relying mainly 
upon what the husband himself said and did much after the 
estrangement of feelings took place between the parties, no 
matter whatever that was due to." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

49. Mr. Gupta, learned senior counsel for the respondent no.1 

has submitted that this aspect of the matter has also been 

considered by the Supreme Court in two later judicial precedents 

relied upon by the other side. Our attention is drawn also to the 

pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (1993) 3 SCC 

418:AIR 1993 SC 2295 Goutam Kundu v. State of West Bengal & 

Anr. We extract hereunder the observations of the Supreme Court 

which bind the present consideration : 

"24. This section requires the party disputing the 
paternity to prove non-access in order to dispel the 
presumption. "Access" and "non-access" mean the 
existence or non-existence of opportunities for sexual 
intercourse; it does not mean actual "cohabitation". 

50. After detailed discussion, the court concluded thus : 

"26. From the above discussion it emerges-
(1) that courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter 
of course; 
(2) wherever applications are made for such prayers in 
order to have roving inquiry, the prayer for blood test 
cannot be entertained. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 30 of 95 

(3) There must be a strong prima facie case in that the 
husband must establish non-access in order to dispel the 
presumption arising under Section 112 of the Evidence Act. 
(4) The court must carefully examine as to what would be 
the consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it will 
have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and the 
mother as an unchaste woman. 
(5) No one can be compelled to give sample of blood for 
analysis." 
(Emphasis by us) 

51. This aspect and the effect of the evidence of access have 

been considered in some detail in another pronouncement of the 

Supreme Court reported at AIR 2001 SC 2226:(2001) 5 SCC 311, 

Kamti Devi (Smt.) & Anr. v. Poshi Ram, relevant portion whereof 

is extracted hereunder : 

"8. Earlier there was a controversy as to what is the true 
import of the word "access" in Section 112 of the Act. 
Some High Courts held that access means actual sexual 
intercourse between the spouses. However, the controversy 
came to a rest when the Privy Council held in Karapaya 
Servai v. Mayandi [AIR 1934 PC 49 : 1934 All LJ 250] 
that the word "access" connotes only existence of 
opportunity for marital intercourse. The said legal 
principle gained approval of this Court when a three-Judge 
Bench held in Chilukuri Venkateswarlu v. Chilukuri 
Venkatanarayana [AIR 1954 SC 176 : 1954 SCR 424] 
that the law has been correctly laid down therein." 
(Emphasis by us) 

52. It is therefore, settled law that cohabitation of the parties is 

not an essential or only concomitant to establish "access"; that 

"unnatural conduct" of the party or the conduct at the time the 

child was conceived, personal hostility would be pertinent 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 31 of 95 

circumstances. Parties being "in touch with each other", "residing 

for a short period in reasonable proximity" during the period when 

the child was conceived are also material circumstances. 

In fact, at the final consideration, the husband has to 

conclusively establish that there was no access or opportunity at all 

for a liaison with or sexual intercourse between the parties. As 

delineated in Kamti Devi, the husband who challenges paternity of 

a child born during the subsistence of the marriage, has to establish 

with convincing evidence "not merely that he did not have the 

opportunity to approach his wife but that she too did not have the 

opportunity of approaching him during the relevant time". 

53. Mr. V.K. Gupta, Senior Advocate for the respondent no.1 

herein has also urged that "access" therefore, actually refers to 

merely opportunity to engage in sexual intercourse. 

54. Let us examine the circumstances on record before the 

Family Court, simply put, "whether there was any opportunity 

available to them for coitus" or had access to each other, as 

required by law. 

IV. Summation of the principles laid down by judicial 
precedents on consideration of an application for an 
examination 

55. So far as the court's discretion to direct a DNA test is 

concerned, the following principles can be summed out from the 

above enunciation of law placed by both sides which have to guide 

the court's consideration : 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 32 of 95 

(i) 
A rebuttable presumption of legitimacy is attached to a child 
born of a married woman during a subsistence of marriage 
or within 280 days of its severance (Ref.: Section 112 of the 
Indian Evidence Act; AIR 2001 SC 2226, Kamti Devi v. 
Poshi Ram -para 11; (2005) 4 SCC 449, Banarsi Dass v. 
Teeku Datta -para 10; AIR 2009 SC 3115, Sham Lal alias 
Kuldeep v. Sanjeev Kumar & Ors. -para 10) 

(ii) The DNA test is not to be directed as a matter of routine. 
Such direction can be given only in deserving cases (Ref.: 
(2005) 4 SCC 449, Banarsi Dass v. Teeku Datta -para 14). 

(iii) The court must exercise its discretion only after balancing 
the interests of the parties and on due consideration whether 
for a just decision in the matter, DNA test is eminently 
needed. (Ref.: AIR 2003 SC 3450, Sharda v. Dharampal -
para 80 ; AIR 2010 SC 2851, Bhabani Prasad Jena v. 
Convenor Secretary, Orissa State Commission for Women 
& Anr. -Para 13) 

(iv)(a) There must be a strong prima facie case in that the husband 
must establish non-access in order to dispel the presumption 
arising under Section 112 of the Evidence Act. (Ref.: (1993) 
3 SCC 418:AIR 1993 SC 2295 Goutam Kundu v. State of 
West Bengal & Anr.) 

(iv)(b) The court would exercise discretion, only after balancing the 
interests of the parties and on consideration as to whether 
for a just decision in the matter the DNA test is imminently 
needed i.e. as to whether it is not possible for the court to 
reach the truth without use of such test. For so concluding, 
the court has to consider materials placed by both parties 
and the test shall not be ordered in routine for a roving 
enquiry. 

(v) "Access" and "non-access" mean the existence or non-
existence of opportunities for sexual intercourse; it does not 
mean actual "cohabitation" (Ref.: AIR 1934 PC 49, 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 33 of 95 

Karapaya Servai v. Mayandi ; (1993) 3 SCC 418:AIR 1993 
SC 2295 Goutam Kundu v. State of West Bengal & Anr. -
para 24) 

(vi) In a civilised society it is imperative to presume the 
legitimacy of a child born during continuation of a valid 
marriage and whose parents had "access" to each other 
(Ref.: (2009) 12 SCC 454 : AIR 2009 SC 3115 Sham Lal 
alias Kuldeep v. Sanjeev Kumar & Ors. -para 42) 

(vii) Burden of proving illegitimacy is on the person who makes 
such allegation (Ref. : para 10 of (2005) 4 SCC 449 Sh. 
Banarasi Dass v. Mrs. Teeku Datta) 

(viii) The party who wants to dislodge the conclusiveness has the 
burden to show a negative, not merely that he did not have 
the opportunity to approach his wife but that she too did not 
have the opportunity of approaching him during the relevant 
time. (Ref.: AIR 2001 SC 2226, Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram -
para 10) 

(ix) The presumption under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence 
Act can only be displaced by a strong preponderance of 
evidence, and not by a mere balance of probabilities or on 
the basis of slender material. The standard of proof in such 
cases must be of a degree in between the preponderance of 
probability and proof beyond reasonable doubt by way of 
abundant caution and has a matter of public policy (Ref.: 
AIR 2001 SC 2226, Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram -para 11 & 
12) 

(x) The presumption can only be rebutted by a strong, clear, 
satisfying and conclusive evidence. The presumption cannot 
be displaced by mere balance of probabilities or any 
circumstance creating doubt (Ref.: (2009) 12 SCC 454 : AIR 
2009 SC 3115 Sham Lal alias Kuldeep v. Sanjeev Kumar & 
Ors. -para 39) 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 34 of 95 

(xi) The verdict of displacement of the presumption shall not be 
rendered on the basis of slender materials. If a husband and 
wife were living together during the time of conception but 
the DNA test revealed that the child was not born to the 
husband, the conclusiveness in law would remain 
irrebuttable (Ref.: (2001) 5 SCC 311, Kamti Devi v. Poshi 
Ram -Para 11; (2005) 4 SCC 449, Banarsi Dass v. Teeku 
Datta -para 13). 

(xii) The courts must be inclined towards upholding the 
legitimacy of the child unless the facts are so compulsive and 
clinching as to necessarily warrant a finding that the child 
could not at all have been begotten to the father and as such 
a legitimation of the child would result in rank injustice to 
the father (Ref.: Dukhtar Jahan v. Mohd. Farooq [(1987) 1 
SCC 624). 

We consider at a later stage in this judgment the precedents 

considering the effect of result of a DNA examination. 

V. 
Prima facie case 

56. From the above enunciation of law by the Supreme Court, it 

is crystal clear that the Family Court had to be satisfied that the 

husband had established a strong prima facie case of non-access to 

dispel the presumption of legitimacy of the child under Section 112 

of the Indian Evidence Act and only when such strong prima facie 

case had been established, could the court consider the direction for 

the DNA examination. So what constitutes a strong prima facie 

case? 

57. So far as the expression "prima facie case" is concerned, in 

the judgment reported at AIR 1958 SC 79, Martin Burn Ltd. v. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 35 of 95 

R.N. Banerjee, the Supreme Court had observed thus : 

"27. …A prima facie case does not mean a case proved to 
the hilt but a case which can be said to be established if the 
evidence which is led in support of the same were believed. 
While determining whether a prima facie case had been 
made out the relevant consideration is whether on the 
evidence led it was possible to arrive at the conclusion in 
question and not whether that was the only conclusion which 
could be arrived at on that evidence. It may be that the 
Tribunal considering this question may itself have arrived at 
a different conclusion. It has, however, not to substitute its 
own judgment for the judgment in question. It has only got 
to consider whether the view taken is a possible view on the 
evidence on the record. (See Buckingham & Carnatic Co., 
Ltd. [ (1952) Labour Appeal Cases 490] . 

This interpretation was reiterated by the Supreme Court in its 

later pronouncements reported at Bangalore Woollen, Cotton and 

Silk Mills Co. Ltd. V. B Dasappa : AIR 1960 SC 1352 : (1960) 2 

LLJ 39; Nirmala J. Jhala v. State of Gujarat : (2013) 4 SCC 301 

and Cholan Roadways Ltd. v. G. Thirugnanasambandam : (2005) 

3 SCC 241. 

58. So what is the prima facie case made out by the husband on 

record as on 16 th October, 2015 when he filed the application u/s 

151 of the CPC for direction to conduct the DNA examination of 

the child? 

59. By that date, the learned Family Court Judge also had the 

pleadings of the parties as well as substantial evidence of the 

respondent no.1 available before him which ought to have formed 

part of the "prima facie" consideration. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 36 of 95 

VI. Whether the case of non-access was specifically pleaded by 
the respondent no.1 

60. To justify the order for a DNA examination, before anything 

else, the foremost requirement in the present case for establishing 

illegitimacy even prima facie, is a specific pleading of "non-

access", that is to say a plea of no opportunity for cohabiting as 

husband and wife and an opportunity of establishing marital 

relations. It therefore, becomes necessary to scrutinize the petition 

filed by the appellant to examine as to whether he had pleaded non-

access at the relevant time. 

61. Let us see what the respondent no.1 has to say about access 

to his wife in his divorce petition. In para 6 of the divorce petition, 

the respondent no.1 has pointed out that the parties were posted at 

different places; that there was change in her behaviour towards 

him and that she started to avoid him without any rhyme or reasons 

due to which the matrimonial life of the parties "started to fall 

within the periphery of strained relationship and the cohabitation 

between the petitioner and respondent no.1 started to become a 

rare event". 

In para 7, respondent no.1 states that they resided as husband 

and wife together "as a last occasion at Lucknow". 

In para 8, the respondent no.1 states that "to save his 

matrimonial life, he made all efforts from his side but the conduct 

of the respondent no.1 (wife) towards the petitioner was pathetic 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 37 of 95 

during this period". 

62. In para 10, the respondent no.1 has set out his postings 

admitting that from 2011, the parties were posted at different 

places. The respondent no.1 has moved from District Lakhimpuri, 

Kheri District, U.P. in 2011; remained as District Magistrate, 

Bareilly from 2011 to 8 th June, 2014 and thereafter as District 

Magistrate, Aligarh when he filed the petition. 

However, he does admit that the appellant joined his 

company at his places of postings, though it was a "rare entity". 

The respondent no.1 has attributed neglect to the appellant 

wife who, admittedly, was posted at different places. 

63. It is most important to note that in para 11, the husband has 

stated that from the "period 2011 to December 2013", the 

appellant and the respondent no.1 "hardly cohabited". 

64. At the same time, a backhanded statement is made that "from 

the start of the year 2013, even the access to cohabit was denied" 

to him by the appellant. How is "the start of the year 2013" to be 

computed? 
Clearly an indefinite position shows that the 

respondent is not sure of his own case. In fact, it reflects that even 

in the start of the year 2013, the parties were cohabiting and having 

a normal relationship. 

65. From the above pleadings, there can be no manner of doubt 

that the respondent no.1 has not stated that he had no access to the 

appellant wife at the relevant time. On the contrary, he has 

submitted that they were cohabiting from the period 2011 to 

December, 2013 albeit "hardly". 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 38 of 95 

66. It needs no elaborate detailing or consideration of pleadings 

that "rare entity", "pathetic", "hardly cohabited", "hardly" 

cannot be equated to the categorical assertion of no access which 

is required by law to displace the presumption under Section 112 of 

the Indian Evidence Act. Consequently it was not even the 

husband's clear and unequivocal case in the divorce petition that he 

had no access to his wife at the time when the child of the parties 

could have been conceived. 

67. Baby 'X' was born on 6 th of October 2013. The relevant 

period of 280 days i.e. 9 months 7 days prior thereto would take us 

to start of the end of December, 2012/first week January, 2013 

(covering the "start of the year 2013" as well. The possible period 

of Baby 'X' conception would be around 31 st December, 2012. 

It is also the appellant's case that the parties "hardly 

cohabited" from 2011 to December, 2013. 'H' has thus admitted 

"access" at the relevant time. 

VII. Whether there is non-traverse by the wife of the husband's 
pleadings, and thereby, deemed admission thereof? 

68. It is argued by Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel for 

the respondent no.1 that in her written statement/reply to the 

petition under Section 13(1)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, 

the appellant wife has not specifically denied the averments of the 

appellant. The submission is that there is no averment by her in 

either the reply or the counter claim that there was no denial of 

access during the "relevant time" or that there was physical access 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 39 of 95 

provided to the respondent no.1. In this regard, reference is made 

to the appellant wife's response to paras 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16 and 

36 of the divorce petition. 

It is submitted that therefore she is deemed to have admitted 

the husband's case. Mr. V.K. Gupta, ld. Senior Counsel for the 

respondent no.1 has submitted that as a result, nothing further is to 

be examined by the court so far as paternity of the child is 

concerned. 

69. Placing reliance on Rules 3 to 5 of Order VIII of the Code of 

Civil Procedure, Mr. V.K. Gupta, ld. Senior Counsel for the 

respondent no.1 has vehemently urged that the denial by the 

appellant had to be specific; that every allegation in the petition 

which is not denied specifically or by necessary implication, has to 

be taken to be admitted. It is submitted that the appellant wife in 

the present case has failed to specifically deny each and every 

assertion made by the respondent no.1 husband which by necessary 

implication have to be taken to be admitted by her and as a result, 

the wife is deemed to have admitted that the respondent no.1 

husband had no access to her at the relevant time. 

70. 
Reliance is also placed on Section 58 of the Indian Evidence 

Act, 1872 to contend that such facts which by any rule of pleading 

are deemed to have been admitted, need not be proved. 

71. Mr. Gupta has requested this court to refrain from making 

any comment on the plea of the respondent no.1 -husband 

regarding access to his wife as it is the subject matter of trial before 

the Trial Court and further that no observation should be made on 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 40 of 95 

the conduct of the respondent no.1 husband for the same reason. 

This submission, however, fails to consider the requirement of law 

which mandates that the court has to be satisfied that a person 

seeking DNA examination has to establish a "strong prima facie 

case" as well as inter alia the iminent need for ordering the same, 

in the justice of the case while also evaluating the equity or 

assessing the interest of justice. Admissions, if any, have to be 

examined from this perspective. It needs no elaboration that 

admissions of both sides have to be examined and their effect on 

"prima facie" case evaluated. 

Therefore, during this consideration, the court would need to 

examine the pleadings of the parties in order to ascertain as to 

whether there was a failure to non-traverse of the assertions of the 

plaintiff by the appellant wife and which are the facts which could 

be deemed to have been admitted by her. 

72. In order to avoid prolixity, we extract hereunder some of the 

material assertions in the reply of the appellant wife to the divorce 

petition : 

"4. That the contents of Para 6 to Para 11 of the 
Petition are denied since the same are based on 
incorrect and wrong facts which is nothing but figment 
of imagination of the Petitioner and has been raised 
only to malign the reputation of the Answering 
Respondent and create frivolous and fabricated 
grounds for seeking divorce from the Answering 
Respondent on the ground of adultery which itself is 
totally false and malicious. 

5. 
That the contents of Para 12 of the Petition is 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 41 of 95 

denied to the extent that the pregnancy of the Answering 
Respondent was known to the Petitioner ever since the 
Answering Respondent became aware of the same 
through medical examination which was conducted 
sometimes in the month of February 2013, and 
therefore, the averments contrary to the same are not 
accepted as they are false and frivolous. 

6. 
That the contents of Para 13 to Para 16 of the 
Petition are vehemently denied and it is submitted that 
the Petitioner is not only creating a false and 
malicious ground but is stooping so low that he is 
trying to allege that he is not the biological father of 
his own child which is not only unfortunate but also 
shows the dirty and scheming mentality of the 
Petitioner. In fact, it is very painful for the Answering 
Respondent to make this submission before the 
Hon'ble Court that the Petitioner was always eager to 
have a male child and was therefore, pressurizing the 
Answering Respondent to get a sex determination test 
ever since the news of conception had reached him. 
However, the Answering Respondent never agreed to 
this illegitimate demand and always insisted that she 
was happy to have a healthy child, be it a boy or a girl 
but the petitioner always got upset whenever, he was 
told that even a girl child was as precious as a male 
child. As the Petitioner always stressed on the fact that 
in his family tradition the first child has always been a 
male child throughout and therefore, he did not want to 
break this tradition under any circumstances. The 
purpose told by him to the Answering Respondent for 
getting sex determination test was only to ensure that it 
is a male child otherwise his intention was to get the 
child aborted in case of a female child to which the 
Answering Respondent never succumbed. 

7. 
That the contents of Para 17 to Para 24 of the 
Petition are vehemently denied by the Answering 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 42 of 95 

Respondent for the reason that the entire averments 
made in these paragraphs are not only false and 
fabricated but have also been done only with a view to 
malign the reputation of the Answering Respondent as 
well as her family and to extract a huge amount of 
money from them as a black mailing tactics so that the 
Answering Respondent and her family may succumb to 
such pressure as their family is one of the most reputed 
and prestigious family of the State of Uttar Pradesh. In 
fact, the perusal of the contents of the aforesaid 
paragraphs also shows the sick mentality of the 
Petitioner who has no hesitation in knowingly making 
such false and wild allegations against his own child 
and wife only with a purpose to convert the said 
allegations into monetary benefits. xxx xxx 
xxx 
8. 
That the contents of Para 25 to Para 26 of the 
Petition are vehemently denied. It is submitted that the 
averments made therein are not only false and fabricated 
but also shows the sick and dirty mentality of the 
Petitioner who is not only making wild allegations but is 
also putting words into the mouth of the Answering 
Respondent without substantiating anything on record 
with a view to mentally harass and torture the 
Answering Respondent. It is submitted that there is not 
an iota of truth in the allegations made by the 
Petitioner and he is only trying to create a strong 
ground as well as sympathy for himself. Such conduct 
of the Petitioner should be strongly condemned and the 
ground of adultery raised by him be rejected at the 
outset by this Hon'ble Court. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
11. That the contents of Para 40 to Para 46 of the 
Petition are vehemently denied. It is submitted that a 
perusal of the entire Petition would clearly show that 
the Petitioner has only tried to repeat the false and 
fabricated facts related to this case in one way or the 
other only with a view to malign and harass the 
Answering Respondent and her family. The main 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 43 of 95 

purpose of the Petitioner is to extract a huge amount of 
money from the Answering Respondent and her family 
as she is the only child of her parents and therefore, the 
Petitioner is well aware that they would do everything to 
ensure the happiness of their only child and grand child. 
Therefore, in the light of the aforesaid facts and 
circumstances, the ground of adultery taken by the 
Petitioner should not only rejected but also a heavy 
cost should be imposed on the Petitioner for making 
false and fabricated averments and wasting the 
precious time of this Hon'ble Court. However, the 
Answering Respondent prays for grant of divorce from 
the petitioner on the ground of cruelty meted out to her 
by the Petitioner as she will, under no circumstances, 
like to stay with such a person who has such sick, 
pervert and dirty mentality and is a threat to her life 
and her daughter's life. Further, in view of the 
manner in which the Plaintiff has vilified the 
Answering Respondent and the innocent child, the 
Answering Respondent seeks full and sole custody of 
the child and no legal rights or visitation rights be 
given to the Plaintiff now or in future so that he does 
not further endanger the child's life and jeopardize her 
in the presence or future." 
(Emphasis by us) 

73. Before proceeding with the discussion, we may refer to the 

two judgments placed by Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel 

for the respondent no.1 in support of the submission that this court 

must deem the allegations in the divorce petition having been 

admitted by the wife. Mr. Gupta has placed reliance on para 11 of 

the judicial pronouncement reported at AIR 1964 SC 538, Badat & 

Co. Bombay v. East India Trading Co. which reads thus : 

"11. Order 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure prescribes, 
among others, that the plaintiff shall give in the plaint 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 44 of 95 

the facts constituting the cause of action and when it 
arose, and the facts showing that the court has 
jurisdiction. The object is to enable the defendant to 
ascertain from the plaint the necessary facts so that he 
may admit or deny them. Order 8 provides for the 
filling of a written statement, the particulars to be 
contained therein and the manner of doing so; Rules 
3, 4 and 5 thereof are relevant to the present enquiry 
and they reads: 
"Order 8 Rule 3. It shall not be sufficient for a 
defendant in his written statement to deny 
generally the grounds alleged by the plaintiff, but 
the defendant must deal specifically with each 
allegation of fact of which he does not admit the 
truth, except damages. 
Rule 4. Where a defendant denies an allegation of 
fact in the plaint, he must not do so evasively, but 
answer the point of substance. Thus if it is alleged 
that he received a certain sum of money, it shall 
not be sufficient to deny that he received that 
particular amount, but he must deny that he 
received that sum or any part thereof, or else set 
out how much he received. And if an allegation is 
made with diverse circumstances, it shall not be 
sufficient to deny it along with those 
circumstances. 
Rule 5. Every allegation of fact in the plaint, if 
not denied specifically, or by necessary 
implication or stated to be not admitted the 
pleading of the defendant, shall be taken to be 
admitted except as against a person under 
disability. 
Provided that the court may in its discreation require 
any fact so admitted to be proved otherwise than by 
such admission." 
These three rules form an integrated code dealing with 
the manner in which allegations of fact in the plaint 
should be traversed and the legal consequences 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 45 of 95 

flowing from its non-compliance. The written 
statement must deal specifically with each allegation of 
fact in the plaint and when a defendant denies any such 
fact, he must not do so evasively, but answer the point 
of substance. If his denial of a fact is not specific but 
evasive, the said fact shall be taken to be admitted. In 
such an event, the admission itself being proof, no other 
proof is necessary. The first para of Rule 5 is a 
reproduction of Order 19, Rule 13 of the English rules 
made under the Judicature Acts. But in mofussil Courts 
in India, where pleadings were not precisely drawn, it 
was found in practice that if they were strictly construed 
in terms of the said provisions, grave injustice would be 
done to parties with genuine claims. To do justice 
between those parties, for which Courts are intended, 
the rigor of Rule 5 has been modified by the 
introduction of the proviso thereto. Under that proviso 
the court may, in its discretion, require any fact so 
admitted to be proved otherwise than by such 
admission. In the matter of mofussil pleadings, Courts, 
presumably replying upon the said proviso, tolerated 
more laxity in the pleadings in the interest of justice. 
But on the original side of the Bombay High Court, we 
are told, the pleadings are drafted by trained lawyers 
bestowing serious thought and with precision. In 
construing such pleadings the proviso can be invoked 
only in exceptional circumstances to prevent obvious 
injustice to a party or to relieve him from the results of 
an accidental slip or omission, but not to help a party 
who designedly made vague denials and thereafter 
sought to rely upon them for non-suiting the plaintiff. 
The discretion under the proviso must be exercised by 
a court having regard to the justice of a cause with 
particular reference to the nature of the parties, the 
standard of drafting obtaining in a locality, and the 
traditions and conventions of a court wherein such 
pleadings are filed. In this context the decision this 
context the decision in Tildesley v. Harper [ (1878) LR 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 46 of 95 

7 Ch D 403] will be useful. There, in an action against a 
lessee to set aside the lease granted under a power, the 
statement of claim stated that the donee of the power 
had received from the lessee a certain sum as a bribe, 
and stated the circumstances; the statement of defence 
denied that that sum had been given, and denied each 
circumstance, but contained no general denial of a bribe 
having been given. The court held, under rules 
corresponding to the aforesaid rules of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, that the giving of the bribe was not 
sufficiently denied and therefore it must be deemed to 
have been admitted. Fry., J. posed the question thus: 
What is the point of substance in the allegations in the 
statement of claim? and answered it as follows: 
"The point of substance is undoubtedly that a bribe was 
given by Anderson to Tildesley, and that point of 
substance is nowhere met … no fair and substantial 
answer is, in my opinion, given to the allegation of 
substance, namely, that there was a bribe. In my opinion 
it is of the highest importance that this rule of pleading 
should be adhered to strictly, and that the court should 
require the defendant, when putting in his statement of 
defence, and the plaintiff, when replying to the 
allegations of the defendant, to state the point of 
substance, and not to give formal denials of the 
allegations contained in the previous pleadings without 
stating the circumstances. As far as I am concerned, I 
mean to give the fullest effect to that rule. I am 
convinced that it is one of the highest benefit to suitors 
in the court. xxx" 
(Emphasis supplied) 

74. Mr. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent no.1 

has sought to urge that the instant case was being conducted in 

Delhi, a metropolis. 
However, as has been noted above, 

professionally the same efficiency and standards which counsels in 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 47 of 95 

this city may exhibit so far as civil matters (as was before the 

Supreme Court in Badat & Co. Bombay), may not apply when it 

comes to matters involving close details of sexual relations 

between a husband and wife as in the present case. We examine 

this aspect a little later. And, in any case, the pleadings of the wife 

have to be tested on the same standards as those of the husband. 

75. The second judgment relied upon by Mr. V.K. Gupta 

reported at (2003) 8 SCC 673, Sushil Kumar v. Rakesh Kumar 

relates to an election dispute wherein the Supreme Court was 

considering the question of disqualification of a candidate on 

grounds of age to contest election to the State Legislative 

Assembly. Specific assertions of facts relating to the date of birth, 

names, date of birth of the petitioner and the respondent and his 

elder brother; schooling were made which had not been specifically 

traversed. In this context, the Supreme Court making reference to 

Section 58 of the Indian Evidence Act observed that a fact admitted 

need not be proved. There can be no dispute at all with this well 

settled legal proposition. However, the standards which would 

apply to the pleadings in the election petition cannot apply to the 

pleadings in a matrimonial case. This would be more so as in a 

case as the present one. 

76. Even otherwise, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant 

places reliance on the observations of the Supreme Court in the 

judgment reported at AIR 1976 SC 461, Madan Gopal Kanodia v. 

Mamraj Maniram & Ors. to submit that the scrutiny by the court 

should be meaningful and should not be in such a manner as to 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 48 of 95 

defeat a genuine claim. We extract hereunder the observations of 

the Supreme Court in para 26 of this pronouncement which are 

relied upon by the appellant : 

"26. In the written statement filed by the plaintiff under 
Order 6, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the 
particulars and essential details of the 21 bales of cloth 
were clearly mentioned in para 1(b). Further more, 
counsel for the plaintiff gave a statement before the trial 
court on September 5, 1952 where also all the essential 
details regarding the 200 bales of cloth were given. In 
the statement the counsel for the plaintiff admitted that 
the plaintiff had received the sale proceeds of 179 bales 
of cloth and that 21 bales of cloth remained unaccounted 
for. In the evidence also the plaintiff has sought to prove 
the very case set up in the plaint as also in the written 
statement filed later under orders of the Court. We are 
unable to see any substantial variation between the 
pleadings of the plaintiff and the evidence led by him at 
the trial. It is well settled that pleadings are loosely 
drafted in the courts, and the courts should not 
scrutinise the pleadings with such meticulous care so 
as to result in genuine claims being defeated on trivial 
grounds. In our opinion, the finding of the High Court 
that there was wide gap between the pleadings and the 
proof is not at all borne out from the record of the 
present case." 
(Emphasis by us) 

77. We may also advert to the following observation of the 

Supreme Court in para 51 of the pronouncement reported at AIR 

1952 SC 47, Kedar Lal Seal & Anr. V. Hari Lal Seal with regard 

to the pleadings which were clumsily or inartistically worded : 

"51. I would be slow to throw out a claim on a mere 
technicality of pleading when the substance of the thing 
is there and no prejudice is caused to the other side, 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 49 of 95 

however clumsily or inartistically the plaint may be 
worded. In any event, it is always open to a court to 
give a plaintiff such general or other relief as it deems 
just to the same extent as if it had been asked for, 
provided that occasions no prejudice to the other side 
beyond what can be compensated for in costs." 

78. On the aspect of the technical view being pressed on behalf 

of the respondent no.1-husband, we are compelled to note the 

observation in para 6 of the judgment reported at (1975) 1 SCC 

774, Sushil Kumar Sen v. State of Bihar of Krishna Iyer J while 

concurring with the majority opinion, had written that "Justice is 

the goal of jurisprudence -processual, as much as substantive". 

Krishna Iyer, J had noted that "the processual law so dominates in 

certain systems as to overpower substantive rights and substantial 

justice. The humanist rule that procedure should be the handmaid, 

not the mistress, of legal justice compels consideration of vesting a 

residuary power in Judges to act ex debito justiciae where the 

tragic sequel otherwise would be wholly inequitable. xxx. 

Parliament, I hope, will consider the wisdom of making the Judge 

the ultimate guardian of justice by a comprehensive, though 

guardedly worded, provision where the hindrance to rightful relief 

relates to infirmities, even serious, sounding in procedural law. 

Justice is the goal of jurisprudence -processual, as much as 

substantive. While this appeal has to be allowed, for reasons set 

out impeccably by my learned brother, I must sound a pessimistic 

note that it is too puritanical for a legal system to sacrifice the end 

product of equity and good conscience at the altar of processual 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 50 of 95 

punctiliousness and it is not too radical to avert a breakdown of 

obvious justice by bending sharply, if need be, the prescriptions of 

procedure. The wages of procedural sin should never be the death 

of rights." 

Krishna Iyer, J had also noted that "the mortality of justice at 

the hands of law troubles a Judge's conscience and points an angry 

interrogation at the law reformer." 

79. It is trite that courts are required to meaningfully construe 

the entire gamut of pleadings before arising at the conclusions and 

outcomes of cases. 

80. There can be no dispute with these authoritative 

pronouncements especially in the context of pleadings in 

matrimonial cases which have to guide our consideration of the 

pleadings of the parties. 

81. There is one more aspect of this matter which over burdened 

courts overlook. Courts get several opportunities to examine 

pleadings, evidence as well as enter into discussions involving 

sexual references. The same could arise in cases as the present 

involving birth of a child during the subsistence of a marriage or 

allegations of impotency or cases involving sexual offences 

including rape, incest, etc; allegations of impotency against a 

spouse in any matrimonial case amongst others. In each of these 

cases, parties are required to plead and disclose what is most 

internal/confidential/intimate to them. 

82. One of us (Gita Mittal, J.) has had the opportunity to 

examine an appeal against a person convicted for offence of rape 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 51 of 95 

under Section 376 of the IPC. In the judgment dated 29 th 

September, 2009 entitled Virender v. The State of NCT of Delhi, 

Crl. App.No.121/2008, it was noticed that the conviction rested on 

statements attributed to the child victim. The first was the 

statement recorded by the investigating officer under Section 161 

of the CrPC; the second recorded by the Metropolitan Magistrate 

under Section 164 of the CrPC and the third to the sessions court 

during the trial. The persons recording the statements of the victim 

in Virender were personnel trained to do so, one being a police 

official recording the statement under Section 161 during 

investigation, two of them being judges of experience and 

expertise, namely, the Metropolitan Magistrate who recorded the 

statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. and lastly, the Additional 

Sessions Judge who recorded the statement during trial who while 

recording the statement of the accused under Section 313 of the 

Cr.P.C. referred to the evidence of his having misbehaved with the 

prosecutrix. 

83. The statements attributed as having made by the victim at 

these three stages, while referring to the acts of the offender, note 

that he had done "gandi harkatein"; "galat kaam" and indulged in 

misbehaviour. These statements hopelessly failed to bring out the 

ingredients of the offence. From this failure to bring out the bare 

ingredients of the offence, one glaring factor had shone through 

which was noted in the following terms : 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 52 of 95 

"79. In the instant case, the evidence recorded by the 
learned Metropolitan Magistrate under section 164 of 
the CrPC and by the court appears to suggest 
embarrassment of the court to put questions of any 
kind to the prosecutrix and witness so as to elucidate 
the complete truth from her resulting in, not 
contradictory but incoherent testimony of the child 
victim who has concealed the essential ingredients of 
the offence. Use of appropriate language would enable 
the necessary decency to be maintained in the 
proceedings and the record. 

A judge is require to be mindful that the edifice on 
which the entire structure of the evidence of the 
prosecution stands is the trustworthiness of the 
testimony of the witness. Therefore, the manner and the 
language in which the evidence is recorded is of extreme 
importance.

84. The issue with regard to teaching of offences 
regarding sexual assault and rape itself has been a 
source of much discussion. I am informed that there are 
instances of even legal educators being bashful and 
embarrassed about teaching such subjects. Judges and 
counsels are products of the legal education. The 
multi-faceted problem and concerns noticed above are 
not confined to ensuring gender justice in courts alone. 
In this background, it is absolutely imperative that these 
areas of law and the issues which have been raised 
herein are taken up with all seriousness. Perhaps the 
programme of continuing legal education needs to take a 
look on these questions." 

(Emphasis by us) 

84. We have made a detailed reference to the above for the sole 

reason that, when it comes to matters of deepest intimacy involved 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 53 of 95 

in a sexual encounter even in a matter of pain (sexual violence), 

most individuals as victims are hesitant to disclose the details or as 

professionals/experts (lawyers, police, judges) to discuss them in 

public space. Hence, the nature of pleadings in cases involving 

disclosure of intimate details of the sexual life of even partners of a 

marriage. 

85. The same is apparent from the expressions used by the 

husband in the present divorce petition as well. He has made bald 

statements. Whereas, if specific detail was to be insisted upon, he 

was required to state the exact dates and places when he had sought 

to engage in the sexual intimacies with his wife, dates and 

particulars of which attempt or invitation or effort by him was 

spurned or refused by her. He does not do so. The failure to reflect 

in more detail on the parties intimate relationship is a reflection of 

his natural embarrassment to describe close details of the parties 

intimate sexual life and of what must be the most private to them. 

86. We have extracted above the husband's petition wherein also 

he refers to the alleged extra marital relationship also in extremely 

general terms. No specific details or instances are cited by him. 

Mr. Sethi, learned Senior Counsel would submit that the 

respondent no.1 was himself not sure of his case and has set-up 

contrary pleas in almost every paragraph of his divorce petition 

with regard to access. These varied assertions of access (ranging 

from "hardly") are spread all over the petition. 

87. Reading of the above would also show that as mandated by 

Rule 4 of Order VIII, the answering party must answer "point of 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 54 of 95 

substance" in the pleadings of the other side. In the case in hand, 

the point of substance, as pressed in the divorce petition is whether 

the appellant wife has committed adultery with the person cited as 

respondent no.2 and whether the child born on 6 th October, 2013 is 

a result of such act of adultery. Put more simply, the appellant 

wife has to deal with matters relating to intimate details of her 

matrimonial life with the respondent no.1 husband and alleged 

extra marital affair with the respondent no.2. 

88. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant 

wife has submitted that the appellant has categorically stated in the 

written statement that the child to whom she had given birth on 6 th 

October, 2013 was the respondent no.1 husband's. It is submitted 

that she has clearly stated that the allegations of the husband were 

demeaning, defaming, vilifying and false allegations which 

amounted to cruelty. She has categorically denied the adultery 

attributed to her and specifically adverted to "his child". The 

submission is that the pleadings have to be read as a composite 

whole and not as if each sentence was disjointed. 

89. The scrutiny of the above extract of the written statement 

would show that the wife has categorically denied that she has 

committed any act of adultery, that she has no association at all 

with the respondent no.2. She has repeatedly asserted that 

"incorrect and wrongfacts"; "figment of imagination of the 

petitioner"; "frivolous and fabricated ...ground of adultery" (para 

4); that the child born on 6 th of October 2013 is "his own child", 

"false and malicious...trying to allege that he is not the biological 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 55 of 95 

father of his own child" (para 6); "false and wild allegations 

against his own child and wife" (para 7); "there is not an iota of 

truth in the allegations made by the petitioner" (para 8); "ground of 

adultery taken by the petitioner should not only be rejected but also 

heavy costs" (para 11). 

In para 6 of the written statement, the anguish of the wife is 

expressed when she has asserted how "painful" it was for her to 

make the submissions. In para 11 of her written statement, the wife 

states that "perusal of the entire petition would show that the 

petitioner has only tried to repeat the false and fabricated facts 

related to this case in one way or other ...". 

90. In this background, can it be held that the appellant has 

failed to answer the point of substance? The answer has to be in 

the negative. The wife has effectively denied the substantive case 

of the husband and also generally denied each and every assertion 

made by the husband each time he has repeated the allegation. 

The wife's categorical denial of the allegation of adultery 

and insistence that the child was the biological child of the 

respondent no.1 even at one place coupled with her general denials 

elsewhere in the written statement is sufficient denial in law, more 

so when she asserts pain in having to deal with such allegations in 

the pleadings. There is no requirement in law for the wife to go on 

repeating the same pleas. Clearly even if the appellant has so 

declared in one place, it was sufficient denial of the repetitive plea 

of the respondent no.1. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 56 of 95 

VIII. Is the court bound to pass orders premised on admissions 
of parties? 

91. Without expressing any opinion at this stage of the impact of 

the wife's pleadings on the bald statements by the husband, the 

proposition pressed by Mr. Gupta, learned senior counsel for the 

husband that the wife has failed to deny the allegations of the 

husband entitling him to the relief, can be tested from yet another 

angle. 

92. Even if the submissions of Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior 

Counsel for the respondent no.1 that the respondent no.1-husband 

had specifically asserted no access, that such fact as well as the fact 

that the child born on 6 th October, 2013 was not born from the 

wedlock and cohabitation of these two parties, was actually 

admitted by the appellant wife, was the family court bound to 

accept this position as admitted and to pass an order based on such 

admission alone? The position in law is clearly to the contrary. 

93. We find that the proviso to Rule 5 of Order VIII itself grants 

discretion to the court to "require any fact so admitted to be proved 

otherwise than by such admission". A similar discretion is 

reserved to the court even in Section 58 of the Indian Evidence 

Act, 1872 wherein the proviso confers such discretion on the court 

to require facts admitted to be proved "otherwise than by such 

admissions". The reason for such discretion, in a case like the 

present one, is obvious. 

94. Let us assume a case where the husband's pleadings qua 

denial or lack of access to the wife to enable her to conceive their 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 57 of 95 

child was specific. In her response/reply/written statement, instead 

of denying the husband's plea of "no access", the wife actually 

admitted the assertions of the husband. 

95. 
The parties may have entered into a conspiracy to establish 

that the child was not theirs for any malafide reasons, say for 

instance, reasons of any tangible benefits arising out of inheritance; 

estate benefits; immigration and citizenship etc.; or to claim any 

benefit provided by law. They could collude to deny paternity or 

relationship. Say, where a government scheme operates to confer 

immovable property benefit on individuals who are not 

related/siblings and it may be financially beneficial for establishing 

that they are not related. In the case of contested matrimonial 

litigation and child custody battles also, parties could falsely agree 

to paternity issues to ensure denial of custody to the husband. 

96. It needs no elaboration that it is the rights of the child which 

are affected by any order accepting such pleadings of the parents. 

Such child is not before the court. In the face of the admissions, 

was the court bound to return a finding that the child was not his? 

The answer has to be an emphatic no. Such finding of the court 

could wreak havoc in the life of Baby 'X' who is the innocent party 

not before the court. It could adversely affect, even disentitle, such 

child to rights in immoveable property. 

The court has therefore, to independently ascertain the 

correctness and genuineness of the allegation by one party, 

irrespective of the admission in the pleadings of the other in as 

much as it is the rights of the child involved. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 58 of 95 

97. In the present case, even if the wife's pleadings could be 

treated as an admission of the husband's case, the court is bound to 

scrutinize the same with circumspection and require corroboration 

of the admission, if any, by independent evidence to premise a 

court order thereon. 

98. In any event, looked at from any angle, we find that even if it 

could be held that the husband's pleadings had not been traversed, 

we have noted above that the respondent wife was called upon by 

the husband not to traverse the case of complete non-access but of 

"hardly cohabited" between "2011 to December, 2013". 

99. We find that in his cross-examination on the 24 th of 

September 2015, the respondent no.1 husband has admitted that 

during official meetings, the appellant wife used to come to his 

residence for lunch or breakfast. The husband has also admitted 

that his mother used to go to stay with the appellant wife during her 

visits to Pilibhit. 

100. In the present case also, the parties though posted in different 

places, were coming together in reasonable proximity with 

opportunity of intercourse. 

101. The petition itself mentions that the parties were posted at 

different places. Hence the statement by the husband that the 

parties from 2011 to December, 2013 "hardly cohabited" i.e. 

reduced opportunity relatable to official postings. But there is no 

averment by the husband that there was no opportunity at all or that 

the wife had no access to him (Ref.: Kamti Devi (Smt.) & Anr. v. 

Poshi Ram) 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 59 of 95 

102. Prima facie, the respondent no.1 is unable to support a case 

of no access and instead of supporting the propounded allegations 

of adultery, the circumstances on record and the evidence of the 

respondent no.1 also lean in favour of the presumption under 

Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act. Even if it could be held 

that the wife has admitted such case, it could not be held that the 

wife had stated that the parties had no cohabitation as husband and 

wife during the relevant time. It is not possible to agree with the 

respondent no.1 that there was deemed admission of "no 

cohabitation" or "non-access" by the wife. 

IX. Admissions of paternity by the husband on court records -
impact on "prima facie case" 

103. An examination as to whether the respondent no.1-husband 

had made out a prima facie case for grant of the prayer for the 

DNA examination, cannot be completed without examining the 

material in the present case in the form of admissions on the part of 

the husband on the record. 

104. It is the admitted case of the husband on 1 st October, 2014 a 

joint petition being HMA No. 1099/2014, was filed in the court of 

Principal Judge, Saket, New Delhi under Section 13B(1) of the 

Hindu Marriage Act. We have extracted above para 7 of this 

petition, wherein the respondent no.1 had unequivocally and 

unconditionally declared that Baby 'X' was born to them on 6 th 

October, 2013 who was in custody of the mother at Sultanpur. The 

respondent no. 1 had also referred to the agreement that the 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 60 of 95 

permanent custody of this child would remain with the wife. 

A joint statement was made in support of the petition 

reiterating and declaring that there was one female child born on 6 th 

October, 2013. This petition came to be withdrawn on account of 

the objection with regard to its maintainability on account of 

territorial jurisdiction of the court. 

105. On 31 st October, 2014, the parties had jointly filed a second 

petition under Section 13B(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act which 

was registered as HMA No. 783/2014 before the Family Court, 

Patiala House, New Delhi for the relief of dissolution of their 

marriage by a decree of divorce by mutual consent. This petition 

also contained an identical admission of the birth of the child on 6 th 

October, 2013 in para 7 as well as the agreement with regard to her 

permanent custody. 

106. Both the petitions were supported with affidavits of the 

husband clearly stating that the consent was voluntary and that 

there was no collusion between the parties in the submissions made 

in the petition. 

107. We find that so far as drafting and filing of the petitions 

under the Hindu Marriage Act are concerned, Rules have been 

notified by the Delhi High Court which are captioned as Rules to 

Regulate Proceedings under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The 

proceedings are required to be initiated by petitions in the format 

detailed in Rule 5 thereof. So far as contents of the petition are 

concerned, Rule 7 stipulates the particulars required to be given. 

108. We extract hereunder the relevant portion of these rules : 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 61 of 95 

"7. Contents of petition -In addition to the 
particulars required to be given under Order VII, Rule 1 
of the Code and Section 20(1)of the Act, all petitions 
under Secs. 9 to 13 shall state-
(a) the place and date of marriage. 
(b) whether the petitioner and the respondent 
were Hindu by religion at the time of the marriage 
and whether they continue to be so up to the date 
of filing of the petition; 
(c) the name, status and domicile of the wife 
and the husband before the marriage and at the 
time of filing the petition; 
(d) the address where the parties of the 
marriage reside at the time of the presentation of 
the petition and last resided, together; 
(e) the names of children, if any, of the 
marriage, their sex and their dates of birth or 
ages; 
(f) 
if prior to the date of the petition there has 
been any proceeding under the Act between the 
parties to the petition, full particulars thereof. 
(g) the matrimonial office or offences alleged 
or other ground, upon which the relief is sought, 
setting out with sufficient particularity the time 
and places of the acts alleged and other facts 
relied upon, but not the evidence by which they 
are intended to be proved, e.g.-
xxx 
(iv) in the case of alleged desertion, the date 
and the circumstances in which it began, in the 
case of cruelty the specific acts of cruelty and the 
occasion when and the place where such acts 
were committed." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

109. It is an admitted position that the divorce petitions which 

were filed, were in compliance with the Rules. In both these 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 62 of 95 

petitions, the husband had clearly stated that a child born on the 6 th 

October, 2013. Clearly, as per Rule 7(e), the parties had given 

details of the child "of the marriage". This is a material admission 

by the husband, not once but twice, on affidavit on judicial record 

as well as on oath in his oral statement dated 1 st of October, 2014 in 

HMA No.1099/2014. 

110. When queried about the impact of this admission, Mr. V.K. 

Gupta, learned senior counsel for the respondent no.1 has asserted 

that it was not open for this court to go into this question and that 

the same was irrelevant for the purposes of adjudicating on the 

prayer for a DNA examination of the child. 

Regrettably we are unable to agree with this submission. 

111. The principles of law governing adjudication on an 

application for DNA examination of a child are well settled. The 

respondent no.1 -husband was bound to have made out a prima 

facie case for grant of such a relief. Admissions of fact by a 

husband are an important part of prima facie consideration of the 

case. In the face of the above admissions, which negate his 

challenge to paternity, the respondent was bound to have rendered 

an explanation for the admissions. No such explanation has been 

tendered before the Family Court. There is not a whit of an 

explanation in the entire divorce petition, or in the application 

seeking the DNA examination. The same has been refused to be 

given before us. 

112. These admissions on judicial record, clearly operate against 

a finding of a prima facie case in favour of the husband. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 63 of 95 

X. 
Conduct of the husband despite his allegations against his 
wife -impact thereof 

113. In a case like the present once, conduct of the parties would 

throw valuable light upon the prima facie consideration. We have 

discussed above that the husband is himself not sure of the case 

which he wants to make out. He himself has doubts about his plea 

of illegitimacy. This is amply borne out from his pleadings about 

his conduct and emotions after learning about the pregnancy of the 

appellant. 

114. The parties are at variance with regard to the date on which 

the respondent no.1-husband learnt about the pregnancy. While the 

respondent no.1 would want the court to believe that he learnt of 

the same only in April, 2013, the appellant-wife has submitted that 

he learnt of the same in February, 2013 after her medical 

examination confirmed the same. 

115. In para 13 of the divorce petition, the respondent no.1 has 

stated that this news "brought a mix bag of emotions" as "on one 

hand he was happy to hear the news of a child coming in his life 

which any normal male would have cherished but on the other 

hand raised a strong level of suspicion in his intriguing mind about 

the paternity of the child". 
In para 14, the respondent no.1-

husband refers to "such a whirlpool blowing in the mind of the 

petitioner(husband) about the paternity of the child which has 

raised a very strong doubt". Later in para 14, the husband has 

referred to the fury of the wife when he doubted her character. 

116. In para 15, reference is made to "doubt" or "suspicion" or 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 64 of 95 

"more strong level of suspicion". In para 17, the husband refers to 

removal of his "doubts". If there had been no access or 

cohabitation, the husband would not have nursed merely a "doubt" 

but would have had a firm belief that the child was not his. There 

would be no question of "a mix bag of emotions" nor any occasion 

to be "happy to hear the news of a child coming in his life". If he 

had no access to his wife and had no relations with her, there would 

also be no "whirlpool" in the husband's mind about the paternity of 

the child but the husband would be absolutely sure that the child 

was not his. 

117. Even in his examination-in-chief on affidavit dated 29 th July, 

2015, the respondent no.1 husband has reiterated the above 

pleadings. 

118. These statements are to be tested against his admitted silence 

with regard to his even nursing a suspicion through the entire 

period of the pregnancy of nine months (and thereafter) when the 

parties not even continued living as they were in the past, but also 

celebrated the pregnancy of the appellant with all normal 

ceremonies in the family of the respondent no.1-husband. 

119. It is stated in her written statement (and admitted by the 

husband in his evidence) that in March, 2013, the religious 

ceremony relating to the pregnancy of the appellant was performed 

at Bareilly in which parents of both the parties had participated. 

His parents had come from Bihar for this purpose while her parents 

had joined them as well! 

120. One more material event inexplicably concealed by the 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 65 of 95 

husband is also brought on record of the case by the wife. It is on 

record that the birth of the child was celebrated by the parties and 

their families and a proper namkaran ceremony was hosted. The 

respondent no.1 husband has claimed in his evidence that he came 

to know the name of the child "Baby X" in the namkaran sanskar 

ceremony which was held in the October end or beginning of 

November, 2015 and that his parents, relatives and he himself had 

participated in the ceremony. The respondent no.1 had denied the 

suggestion that he had invited 150 guests to attend the ceremony. 

121. In his cross-examination, respondent no.1 was confronted 

with seven photographs from the namkaran ceremony which have 

been exhibited on record as PW-1/R-3 to PW-1/R-9. It includes 

five photographs which feature just the respondent no.1-husband 

and his wife (the appellant) with the child. In Ex.PW1/R-3 and 

Ex.PW-1/R-5, featuring the appellant, respondent no.1 and the 

child, the respondent no.1 husband appears extremely happy and is 

holding the child in his arms in an intimate gesture as part of a 

loving family. Ex.PW-1/R-4 appears to be a family photograph 

which includes the couple with their child in the arms of the 

husband and immediate family members of the parties. 

122. Ex.PW-1/R-6 and Ex.PW-1/R-7 feature the appellant with 

two of his friends (including the alleged adulterer). 
The 

photographs display his comfort and, in fact, his bearing reflects 

happiness on the occasion. He has displayed complete comfort 

with the appellant as well as the child and friendship with even the 

alleged adulterer. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 66 of 95 

123. The photograph Ex.PW-1/R-9 shows the respondent no.1 

with his mother and their Pandit performing the pooja (prayer) 

relating to the namkaran ceremony. In his cross-examination, the 

respondent no.1 has prevaricated suggesting that "one person 

probably" looks like him! 

None of these photographs displays any tension or anger or 

revulsion as would be the normal reaction of any man, if, the 

situation was as has been portrayed. 

124. Let us note two more instances of the reaction of the 

respondent no.1 to the arrival of the child and thereafter. In the 

hearing before us, on the 23 rd of May 2016, a further affidavit was 

sought to be filed by the appellant along with enclosures. The 

same was taken on the record of the present case with the consent 

of the respondent no.1 husband. 

125. On 5 th of July 2016, we were informed by Mr. V.K. Gupta, 

learned Senior Counsel for the respondent no.1 -husband, that 

though there was no objection to the affidavit being taken on 

record, the respondent no.1 was not filing any reply thereto for the 

reason that "the facts stated in the affidavit are irrelevant for the 

purposes of the present appeal" as well as "for the purposes of 

deciding the main divorce petition for the reason that it was 

premised on the allegations of adultery on the part of the 

appellant". So the appellant's affidavit and its annexures remain 

undisputed before us. 

126. For the purposes of the present appeal, we are only 

concerned with the question as to whether the respondent no.1 had 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 67 of 95 

established a strong prima facie case in consonance with the 

requirements laid down by the Supreme Court for directing a DNA 

examination of the child born on 6 th October, 2013. The affidavit 

and enclosures stand taken on record with the consent of the 

husband. We are within our jurisdiction to scrutinise the additional 

affidavit and enclosed documents from this perspective alone. 

127. The first document so brought on record is the birth 

certificate dated 22 nd November, 2013 of the child issued by the 

Lucknow Municipal Corporation which contains the name of the 

parents of the child. We find that the birth certificate reflects the 

father's name as "H" i.e. the respondent no.1 -husband and the 

appellant as the mother of the girl child born on 6 th October, 2013. 

128. The other document placed before us is the passbook issued 

on 2 nd November, 2013 of an Account bearing No.33423970043 

which was opened in the State Bank of India, Civil Lines, Near 

Kacheri, Bareilly. This passbook is of a saving bank account of the 

child which was opened by the respondent no.1 -husband while he 

was posted as District Magistrate, Bareilly. In the account, against 

the column for name of the child, as it was a minor account, after 

her name, it is mentioned "UNG 'H' IAS". We are informed that 

this means that the child was "under natural guardian 'H' IAS". 

Legally the father of the child is recognised as the natural guardian. 

129. As per the wife's affidavit, during the namkaran ceremony 

of the child, cash gifts had been received, which totalled 

`1,61,000/-. The respondent no.1 -husband had deposited this 

amount in this saving bank account on the 2 nd of November 2013. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 68 of 95 

Photographs of the parents were also furnished to the bank by the 

respondent no.1 which includes his own photograph as the child's 

father. 

130. Further subsequently, on the 20 th of November 2013, the 

respondent no.1 had got the name of the appellant -wife also 

added as a joint guardian of the child to continuously make deposit 

for the benefit of the child. 

131. Prima facie, there is substance in the appellant's contention 

that each of these documents again contain admissions by the 

appellant of his having fathered the child born on 6 th October, 

2013. 

132. Considering the vehemence with which the respondent 

husband is now agitating the plea of adultery, it is inconceivable 

that the husband, an experienced bureaucrat of considerable 

experience, having control over a huge administrative 

establishment and paraphernalia, would not only tolerate the 

deviations of an errant wife, support her through a pregnancy 

(allegedly extra marital) and also celebrate the same by performing 

customary puja upon a wife's conception as well as the birth of the 

child by a huge celebration. Or to permit his name to feature as 

such child's birth certificate or to create and operate a bank account 

for her! 

These are behaviour which militates against a "prima facie" 

case in his favour on the plea that he was not the father of the child. 

133. It is important to note that the respondent husband has not 

even remotely suggested any unnatural conduct on the part of his 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 69 of 95 

wife during their marriage. He has made no allegation that she had 

spurned him or found him abhorrent. On the contrary, normal 

civility and relations are reflected and the parties appear to have 

been meeting normally as husband and wife as well as 

professionally in their official residences and official commitments. 

134. In the discussion by the Supreme Court in para 10 of the 

judgment reported at AIR 2001 SC 2226:(2001) 5 SCC 311, Kamti 

Devi (Smt.) & Anr. v. Poshi Ram, what is material is whether there 

was a denial to the wife of access to the husband. No such material 

is on record. 

Concealment and statement of wrong facts -whether impacts 
consideration of prima facie case? 

135. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant 

wife has drawn our attention to para 16 of the divorce petition. 

Here, in an effort to support a plea of non-access, the respondent 

no.1-husband has pleaded that "the denial of access" and "cruel 

conduct" of the wife towards him "continued during the entire 

period of pregnancy also…". 

136. In the written statement, the appellant-wife has stated that in 

May, 2013, the respondent no.1-husband invited her to visit 

Udaipur where he had made all arrangements for stay etc. in 

Udaipur Vilas Palace Hotel which is a well-known wedding and 

honeymoon destination and that, for the first time, all expenses 

were borne by him. The appellant wife has also asserted that he 

had arranged this Udaipur outing with the intention to persuade her 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 70 of 95 

for a sex determination of the child to which she could not 

reconcile nor accept. The appellant-wife has further pleaded that 

for the first time he spent money lavishly on this outing, that the 

parties came from Bareilly by road to Delhi and from Delhi, caught 

a flight to Udaipur. 

137. The fact that the parties went to Udaipur for holiday from 9 th 

May, 2013 to 13 th May, 2013 has not even been mentioned in the 

divorce petition by the husband. 
However, in his cross 

examination on 24 th September, 2015, this fact has been admitted 

by him. When questioned that the stay of Udaipur must have cost 

him `40,000/-to `50,000/-per day and that he had paid over `2 to 

2.5 lakhs for the entire trip, the husband replied that he does not 

know the tariff, nor does he recollect who had borne the expenses. 

The appellant would suggest prevarication on his part, but this 

aspect does not need to detain us here for a prima facie 

consideration, except to the extent that the husband has concealed 

this trip. The trip is conduct incompatible with that of a husband 

whose wife is pregnant with an outsider's child. It is urged that on 

the contrary, the trip supports the appellant's case of a normal 

relationship between the parties. 

During the Udaipur visit, the appellant wife was already 

around three months into her pregnancy. Any reasonable person 

who knew that the child was not his or that his wife was carrying 

on an adulterous relationship would never vacation with her. 

The plea of the husband that he had no access to the wife 

during the duration of the pregnancy is therefore, clearly false. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 71 of 95 

138. The appellant-wife has further asserted that the parties 

continued to visit each other and that even thereafter, they both had 

access to each other on all material time. It is the wife's assertion 

that on 15 th August, 2013, he specifically came to stay with her at 

her place of posting so that she would not be alone on her birthday 

which happened to fall on 16 th August, 2013. 

139. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel points out that 

the entire case of the respondent no.1 of appellant wife having an 

adulterous relationship with the respondent no.2, hinges on his 

solitary allegation that one of his friend namely, Shri Vikas Verma 

had seen the respondents in "intimate gesture" in the company of 

each other on at least four to five occasions in public places. It is 

stated that "Shri Vikas Verma has himself seen respondent nos.1 

and 2 at Hotel Manor, Faizabad, P.S. Chinhath, District Lucknow 

and their gestures fully corroborates..........the fact that respondent 

nos.1 and 2 behind back of the petitioner were having an 

extramarital relationship.....". 

140. Mr. Sethi has drawn our attention to the record and pointed 

out that Shri Vikas Verma was examined as a witness on 16 th of 

October 2015 when he tendered his evidence by way of affidavit 

which was exhibited as Ex.PW2/A. This witness gave an address of 

Lucknow as his address. However, in his cross-examination, this 

witness revealed that his residential address was "241/A, Raiganj, 

South Sarafa Katra, P.S. Rajgath, Gorakhpur" and that he even has 

a jewellery shop situated in Hindi Bazar, Gorakhpur. He also 

disclosed that he had mentioned his father-in-law Shri Rajinder 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 72 of 95 

Verma's address of Lucknow in his affidavit of evidence. It is 

urged that this witness has clearly given a wrong address to falsely 

justify his presence at Lucknow to support the husband. 

141. In his cross-examination further, Shri Vikas Verma has 

completely disclaimed that he had seen the appellant and the 

respondent no.2 going inside Hotel Mannar! So far as the alleged 

intimacy is concerned, in his cross-examination on 16 th October, 

2015. Shri Verma baldly claimed that he had seen these two 

persons "going inside Hotel Charan". 

This witness thus not only completely disclaimed the 

contents of his own vague affidavit but also gave no specific date. 

It lends support by the criticism that the respondent no.1 is 

therefore, relying on bald and vague innuendo and suggestion in 

support of his plea of adultery, without any material in support. 

The evidence of Shri Vikas Verma was on the record of the Family 

Court on 28 th January, 2016 for examining whether there was a 

prima facie case in favour of the husband when the application was 

considered and the impugned order passed. 

XI. DNA report dated 23 rd April, 2015 -whether supports a 
prima facie case in favour of the respondent no.1 -
husband? 

142. The application dated 16 th October, 2015 on which the 

impugned order was passed, in para 3 claims that the divorce 

petition was filed on the act of adultery, "confirmed by the DNA 

report of umbilical cord (dried) belonging to the child delivered by 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 73 of 95 

the respondent no.1" and his blood samples, sent to DNA Lab 

India Genetics Research and Development Centre for DNA test. In 

para 4, the respondent no.1 referred to a DNA test purported to be 

conducted by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Directorate 

of Forensic Science Services, Ministry of Home Affairs, 

Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh under orders of the Additional Chief 

Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow in a criminal complaint filed by the 

respondent no.1 under Section 497 of the IPC. The certified copy 

of this report was filed by the appellant on the court record. 

143. Before the Family Court, the respondent husband has relied 

on a DNA test report dated 23 rd April, 2015. The respondent no.1 

claims that this is a report of testing of a sample from the husband 

with a sample claimed by the husband to be that of the umbilical 

cord of the child. 

144. The respondent husband has claimed that he first got a 

private DNA test conducted wherein a report dated 21 st November, 

2013 was obtained, but the respondent husband has not placed 

reliance on the report, either before the Family Court or in the 

present appeal. 

145. Before we deal with the report, it is necessary to understand 

the requirements of law for its acceptance. In order to lend 

veracity to a DNA report, even prima facie, first and foremost, the 

person relying on the same has to prove the sources of the samples; 

their confirmed identity, authenticity as well as purity thereof. 

Additionally, the person relying on a scientific report has to make 

out the chain of custody of these samples and to support that it was 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 74 of 95 

only such confirmed samples which were actually tested and that 

the scientific report relates to only the claimed samples, without 

there being any possibility of mistake or tampering or soiling 

thereof. Thus the first and foremost fact which had to be indicated 

was that the report dated 23 rd April, 2015 actually related to 

samples extracted/obtained from the minor child; that it was such 

sample which had actually been sent to the test laboratory; that the 

laboratory had conducted the test on that very sample vis-a-vis pure 

sample from the respondent husband and that the report was 

actually a result of DNA test conducted on the human samples 

obtained from the minor child and the respondent husband. 

We hasten to repeat here that we are at this stage again 

assessing the material which was before the learned Trial Judge at 

the time of passing of the impugned order from a prima facie 

aspect alone. 

146. The respondent no.1's evidence stood completed on 29 th 

September, 2015 and was before the Family Court when the 

application was considered. In his cross-examination, the appellant 

wife has challenged every facet of the husband's claim with regard 

to the DNA testing. From the very acquisition of the sample to the 

result have been subjected to a cross-examination. 

147. The respondent no.1 husband nowhere gives any particular 

date on which the alleged sample i.e. the umbilical cord became 

available to him, except to say that it was collected in the hospital. 

He is unable to give definite size of the umbilical cord. So far as 

its preservation was concerned, the respondent no.1 has claimed 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 75 of 95 

that he "collected it through a piece of paper, wrapped the same in 

the paper and put it in my pocket at that time. Thereafter, I put the 

same in an air tight glass jar which I purchased later on, after 

leaving the hospital". The respondent no.1 claimed that "umbilical 

cord was kept in the same glass jar duly wrapped in a paper for 

more than 1½ years (one and a half years)". He states that he did 

not inform his parents or in-laws about having taken the cord for 

testing. 

148. Medical texts advise that the umbilical cord falls off after 7 

to 10 days of birth, sometimes after 5 days. The respondent no.1 

does not explain that the mother and child remained admitted in 

hospital for such period. 

149. Before us, additional material is pointed out from the trial 

court record which was called for. In order to prove the DNA test 

report, the respondent no.1 examined on 4 th March, 2016 as his 

witness, Shri S. Sathyan, Senior Scientific Officer, Central 

Forensic Science Laboratory, Hyderabad as PW-4. This witness 

refers to a letter dated 25 th February, 2015 received by the CFSL 

from the CMO, Lucknow (Ex.PW-4/1). While requesting the 

Director of the CFSL to get the DNA test done as per the court 

order, the CMO, Lucknow has referred to "the blood sample of 

"H" and the so called umbilical cord of Baby .......". The Director 

does not confirm the source of the sample. 

150. In his evidence also, PW-4 Shri Sathyan refers to the so 

called umbilical cord. In his cross-examination, the witness clearly 

stated that he was not sure as to whether the tested sample was that 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 76 of 95 

of umbilical cord or not. Prima facie, there is thus, nothing at all to 

connect the sample subjected to the testing, to the child concerned. 

151. Mr. Sethi would urge that even if the husband had actually 

collected the cord of the child, he has wrapped it in paper and 

stored it in an ordinary bottle acquired by him, not a sanitised 

sample bottle. The submission is that for an effective testing 

sample had to be scientifically collected and preserved. It was so 

kept for a long period of one and half years, clearly exposed to 

continuous contamination. Ld. Senior Counsel would submit that 

no reliance can be placed on the DNA report premised on such 

sample for this reason as well. Unfortunately, the question as to 

whether the alleged sample could have got contaminated, if 

maintained or preserved in the manner as has been claimed by the 

respondent no.1 husband, was disallowed. It is urged that even if 

the sample was actually the child's, there is doubt about its purity 

or effect of impurities on the testing. 

152. Before us it is urged by Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior 

Counsel for the appellant wife, that the DNA report does not 

indicate that it relates to a sample of Baby 'X'. Therefore, 

assuming without admitting that the report could be accepted as 

having been proved, it is certainly no proof of the fact that the 

laboratory had conducted a test on a sample which actually 

belonged to the child. At best, the DNA report relied upon by the 

respondent husband had only suggested that a DNA test had been 

conducted on a sample of some tissue which did not match the 

respondent no.1 husband. Simply put, the respondent -husband is 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 77 of 95 

unable to connect the DNA report to the child in question. 

153. In the face of the above, the DNA test report, prima facie 

does not support the husband's claim that the report establishes that 

it actually relates to a sample of the child. 

XII. In the facts of the present case, effect of the presumption 
under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act 

154. The appellant before us has vehemently urged that in the 

instant case, the presumption of legitimacy of the child is 

irrebuttable and conclusive of the fact. This is for the reason that 

the respondent has failed to make out a case of non-access during 

the relevant period when the child could have been conceived. 

There is no dispute that the child was borne to the parties who were 

married to each other and had access to each other during the 

period of possible conception. 

155. This principle stands reiterated by the Supreme Court in its 

judgment reported at AIR 2010 SC 2851, Bhabani Prasad Jena v. 

Convenor Secretary, Orissa State Commission for Women & Anr. 

In the following para 19 of the judgment, the Supreme Court 

extracted para 13 of (2005) 4 SCC 449, Banarasi Das v. Mrs. 

Teeku Datta & Anr., and again cautioned that the DNA test was 

not to be directed as a matter of routine and that only in deserving 

cases, such a direction should be given : 

"19. In Banarsi Dass v. Teeku Dutta [(2005) 4 SCC 449] 
this Court was concerned with a case arising out of a 
succession certificate. The allegation was that Teeku Dutta 
was not the daughter of the deceased. An application was 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 78 of 95 

made to subject Teeku Dutta to DNA test. The High Court 
held that the trial court being a testamentary court, the 
parties should be left to prove their respective cases on the 
basis of the evidence produced during trial, rather than 
creating evidence by directing DNA test. When the matter 
reached this Court, few decisions of this Court, 
particularly, Goutam Kundu [(1993) 3 SCC 418 : 1993 
SCC (Cri) 928] were noticed and it was held that even the 
result of a genuine DNA test may not be enough to escape 
from the conclusiveness of Section 112 of the Evidence 
Act like a case where a husband and wife were living 
together during the time of conception. This is what this 
Court said: (Banarsi Dass case [(2005) 4 SCC 449] , SCC 
pp. 454-55, para 13) 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
It was emphasised that DNA test is not to be directed as a 
matter of routine and only in deserving cases such a 
direction can be given." 
(Emphasis by us) 

156. Ld. Senior Counsel for the appellant has also placed the 

pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at AIR 2015 SC 418 

Dipanwita Roy v. Ronobroto Roy. In this case, categorical 

assertions that the parties never lived together, that is of "no 

access" were made. The wife was clearly stated to be living in an 

adulterous relationship at another address with another person. In 

para 2 of the judgment, the pleadings of the party were extracted 

which reads thus : 

"2. One of the grounds for seeking divorce was based 
on the alleged adulterous lifestyle of the petitioner wife. 
For his above assertion, the respondent husband made the 
following allegations in Paras 23 to 25 of his petition: 
"23. That since 22-9-2007 the petitioner never lived 
with the respondent and did not share bed at all. On a 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 79 of 95 

very few occasions since then the respondent came to 
the petitioner's place of residence to collect her things 
and lived there against the will of all to avoid public 
scandal. The petitioner did not turn (sicaway) the 
respondent from house on those occasions. 
24. That by her extravagant lifestyle the respondent 
has incurred heavy debts. Since she has not disclosed 
her present address to bank and has only given the 
address of the petitioner, the men and collection agents 
of different banks are frequently visiting the petitioner's 
house and harassing the petitioner. They are looking for 
the respondent for recovery of their dues. Notice from 
attorney firms for recovery of dues from the respondent 
and her credit card statements showing heavy debts are 
being sent to the petitioner's address. The respondent 
purchased one car in 2007 with the petitioner's uncle, 
Shri Subrata Roy Chowdhary, as the guarantor. The 
respondent has failed to pay the instalments regularly. 
25. That the petitioner states that the respondent has 
gone astray. She is leading a fast life and has lived in 
extra-marital relationship with the said Mr Deven Shah, 
a well-to-do person who too is a career oriented 
gentleman and has given birth to a child as a result of 
her cohabitation with Shri Deven Shah. It is reported 
that the respondent has given birth to a baby very 
recently. The respondent is presently living at the 
address as mentioned in the cause-title of the 
plaint."(emphasis supplied)" 
(Emphasis by us) 

There can be no dispute with the above proposition. 

157. It appears from the narration of facts that the petitioner had 

never lived with or shared a bed with her at all (or in any case since 

22-9-07). 
The husband had made "clear and categorical 

assertions". In paras 10, 11 and 12, the Supreme Court held as 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 80 of 95 

follows : 

"10.It is borne from the decisions rendered by this Court 
in Bhabani Prasad Jena[Bhabani Prasad Jena v. Orissa 
State Commission for Women, (2010) 8 SCC 633 : (2010) 
3 SCC (Civ) 501 : (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 1053] and Nandlal 
Wasudeo Badwaik[Nandlal Wasudeo Badwaik v. Lata 
Nandlal Badwaik, (2014) 2 SCC 576 : (2014) 2 SCC (Civ) 
145 : (2014) 4 SCC (Cri) 65] that depending on the facts 
and circumstances of the case, it would be permissible for 
a court to direct the holding of a DNA examination to 
determine the veracity of the allegation(s) which constitute 
one of the grounds, on which the party concerned would 
either succeed or lose. There can be no dispute, that if the 
direction to hold such a test can be avoided, it should be 
so avoided. The reason, as already recorded in various 
judgments by this Court, is that the legitimacy of a child 
should not be put to peril. 
11. The question that has to be answered in this case is in 
respect of the alleged infidelity of the appellant wife. The 
respondent husband has made clear and categorical 
assertions in the petition filed by him under Section 13 of 
the Hindu Marriage Act, alleging infidelity. He has gone to 
the extent of naming the person who was the father of the 
male child born to the appellant wife. It is in the process of 
substantiating his allegation of infidelity that the 
respondent husband had made an application before the 
Family Court for conducting a DNA test which would 
establish whether or not he had fathered the male child born 
to the appellant wife. The respondent feels that it is only 
possible for him to substantiate the allegations levelled by 
him (of the appellant wife's infidelity) through a DNA test. 
We agree with him. In our view, but for the DNA test, it 
would be impossible for the respondent husband to 
establish and confirm the assertions made in the pleadings. 
We are therefore satisfied that the direction issued by the 
High Court, as has been extracted hereinabove, was fully 
justified. DNA testing is the most legitimate and 
scientifically perfect means, which the husband could use, 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 81 of 95 

to establish his assertion of infidelity. This should 
simultaneously be taken as the most authentic, rightful and 
correct means also with the wife, for her to rebut the 
assertions made by the respondent husband, and to establish 
that she had not been unfaithful, adulterous or disloyal. If 
the appellant wife is right, she shall be proved to be so. 
12. We would, however, while upholding the order passed 
by the High Court, consider it just and appropriate to 
record a caveat, giving the appellant wife liberty to comply 
with or disregard the order passed by the High Court, 
requiring the holding of the DNA test. In case, she accepts 
the direction issued by the High Court, the DNA test will 
determine conclusively the veracity of accusation levelled 
by the respondent husband against her. In case, she declines 
to comply with the direction issued by the High Court, the 
allegation would be determined by the court concerned by 
drawing a presumption of the nature contemplated in 
Section 114 of the Evidence Act, especially, in terms of 
Illustration (h) thereof. Section 114 as also Illustration (h), 
referred to above, are being extracted hereunder: 
"114.Court may presume existence of certain facts.-
The court may presume the existence of any fact 
which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being 
had to the common course of natural events, human 
conduct and public and private business, in their 
relation to the facts of the particular case." 
"Illustration (h)-that if a man refuses to answer a question 
which he is not compelled to answer by law, the answer, if 
given, would be unfavourable to him;" 
This course has been adopted to preserve the right of 
individual privacy to the extent possible. Of course, without 
sacrificing the cause of justice. By adopting the above 
course, the issue of infidelity alone would be determined, 
without expressly disturbing the presumption contemplated 
under Section 112 of the Evidence Act. Even though, as 
already stated above, undoubtedly the issue of legitimacy 
would also be incidentally involved." 
(Emphasis supplied) 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 82 of 95 

158. We may note the submissions of Mr. V.K. Gupta, ld. Senior 

Counsel for the respondent insisting that the Supreme Court has 

authoritatively laid down that the DNA test is the only manner of 

establishing a plea of infidelity by one spouse against the other. It 

is urged that, therefore, in a case where a spouse alleges infidelity 

on the part of his wife, medical examination has to be ordered. We 

are unable to agree with this submission. In paras 11 and 12, the 

Supreme Court is concerned with the facts of that particular case. 

The Supreme Court has in fact in para 10 reiterated the same 

caution as was mandated in prior judicial precedents. 

159. The absolute submission and proposition pressed by Mr. 

Gupta may be tested from another angle. What if there were no 

child from the alleged infidelity or the extra marital affair of the 

wife? What about a case where the wife alleges infidelity against 

the husband, with or without there being a child from such 

relationship? The husband (or the wife) has to stand on his own 

feet and establish the allegedly infidelity as per law. 

Accepting the proposition urged by Mr. Gupta would in 

effect, tantamount to laying down the principle that a spouse had to 

merely make an allegation of infidelity (or mental illness or 

impotency), without anything more, and courts would have to 

mandatorily direct scientific (or medical) examination. 

160. It is a first principle of procedural law that a party alleging a 

fact, must prove it. Binding judicial precedents noted above have 

laid down that a party must establish a strong prima facie case 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 83 of 95 

before a court would make an order for the scientific (or medical) 

examination, especially of the intrusive kind as a DNA 

examination. The court cannot conduct a fishing or roving inquiry 

for a party and a DNA test cannot be ordered to gather evidence on 

behalf of a party who has made a bald allegation, without anything 

more. 

161. For this reason, even in Diwanwita Roy, while approving the 

order for the DNA test in the facts of the case, the court has clearly 

declared that the presumption under Section 112 of the Evidence 

Act would not be lightly disturbed. In para 10, the court has noted 

that the order depends "on the facts and circumstances of the case". 

In para 11, the Supreme Court has noted "the question to be 

answered in this case". 

162. Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent 

has placed the observations in the judgment of the Supreme Court 

reported at (2014) 2 SCC 576 Nandlal Wasudeo Badwaik v. Lata 

Nandlal Badwaik & Anr. Reliance has been placed on the 

following by ld. Senior Counsel : 

"13. Before we proceed to consider the rival 
submissions, we deem it necessary to understand what 
exactly DNA test is and ultimately its accuracy. All 
living beings are composed of cells which are the 
smallest and basic unit of life. An average human body 
has trillions of cells of different sizes. DNA 
(Deoxyribonucleic Acid), which is found in the 
chromosomes of the cells of living beings, is the 
blueprint of an individual. Human cells contain 46 
chromosomes and those 46 chromosomes contain a total 
of six billion base pairs in 46 duplex threads of DNA. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 84 of 95 

DNA consists of four nitrogenous bases -adenine, 
thymine, cytosine, guanine and phosphoric acid 
arranged in a regular structure. When two unrelated 
people possessing the same DNA pattern have been 
compared, the chances of complete similarity are 1 in 30 
billion to 300 billion. Given that the Earth's population 
is about 5 billion, this test shall have accurate result. It 
has been recognised by this Court in Kamti Devi[Kamti 
Devi v. Poshi Ram, (2001) 5 SCC 311 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 
892] that the result of a genuine DNA test is 
scientifically accurate. It is nobody's case that the result 
of the DNA test is not genuine and, therefore, we have 
to proceed on an assumption that the result of the DNA 
test is accurate. The DNA test reports show that the 
appellant is not the biological father of the girl child. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
15. Here, in the present case, the wife had pleaded that 
the husband had access to her and, in fact, the child was 
born in the said wedlock, but the husband had 
specifically pleaded that after his wife left the 
matrimonial home, she did not return and thereafter, he 
had no access to her. The wife has admitted that she had 
left the matrimonial home but again joined her husband. 
Unfortunately, none of the courts below have given any 
finding with regard to this plea of the husband that he 
had or had not any access to his wife at the time when 
the child could have been begotten. 
16. As stated earlier, the DNA test is an accurate test 
and on that basis it is clear that the appellant is not the 
biological father of the girl child. However, at the same 
time, the condition precedent for invocation of Section 
112 of the Evidence Act has been established and no 
finding with regard to the plea of the husband that he 
had no access to his wife at the time when the child 
could have been begotten has been recorded. 
Admittedly, the child has been born during the 
continuance of a valid marriage. Therefore, the 
provisions of Section 112 of the Evidence Act

conclusively prove that Respondent 2 is the daughter of 
the appellant. At the same time, the DNA test reports, 
based on scientific analysis, in no uncertain terms 
suggest that the appellant is not the biological father. In 
such circumstance, which would give way to the other is 
a complex question posed before us." 

163. It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court has further reiterated 

the conclusiveness of the presumption under Section 112 of the 

Indian Evidence Act in para 14 of the pronouncement in the 

following terms : 

"14. Now we have to consider as to whether the DNA test 
would be sufficient to hold that the appellant is not the 
biological father of Respondent 2, in the face of what has 
been provided under Section 112 of the Evidence Act, 
which reads as follows: 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
From a plain reading of the aforesaid, it is evident that a 
child born during the continuance of a valid marriage 
shall be a conclusive proof that the child is a legitimate 
child of the man to whom the lady giving birth is married. 
The provision makes the legitimacy of the child to be a 
conclusive proof, if the conditions aforesaid are satisfied. 
It can be denied only if it is shown that the parties to the 
marriage had no access to each other at any time when 
the child could have been begotten." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

164. In Nandlal Wasudeo Badwaik, the husband had led 

evidence that after his wife left the matrimonial home, she did not 

return and that he had no access to her when the child could have 

been begotten. The courts below had not given any finding with 

regard to this plea. It is also noteworthy that in this case, the DNA 

testing was done under orders of the court which had not been 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 86 of 95 

opposed by the wife. The DNA test report suggested that the 

appellant was not the biological father. In these circumstances, the 

court held in para 17 that where there was evidence to the contrary, 

the presumption under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act, 

being rebuttable, would yield to conclusive proof. In para 19, the 

court noted that the husband's plea, that he had no access to the 

wife when the child was begotten, stood proved by the DNA test 

report. 

165. Principles laid down in prior judgments including AIR 1934 

PC 49, Karapaya Servai v. Mayandi; AIR 1954 SC 176, Chilukuri 

Venkateswarlu v. Chilukuri Venkatanarayan; AIR 1993 SC 2295, 

Goutam Kundu v. State of West Bengal & Anr.; AIR 2001 SC 

2226, Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram; AIR 2003 SC 3450, Sharda v. 

Dharmpal and AIR 2010 SC 2851, Bhabani Prasad Jena v. 

Convenor Secretary, Orissa State Commission for Women & Anr. 

have not been overturned and bind the present consideration. No 

absolute proposition as is contended by Mr. Gupta has been laid 

down in the judicial precedents. 

166. Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant 

has placed reliance on the Single Bench pronouncement in this 

court reported at (2011) 121 DRJ 563, Rohit Shekhar v. Narayan 

Dutt Tiwari in support of his submissions. The consideration in 

this case has to be read in the light of the facts situation in which 

the judgment was rendered. Mr. Rohit Shekhar claimed to be the 

biological son of the defendant no.1 and born out of the 

relationship of defendant no.1 with the defendant no.2. It is an 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 87 of 95 

admitted position that the defendant no.2 was married to a third 

person which marriage was subsisting at the time of birth of the 

plaintiff. The husband of the defendant no.2 had claimed no access 

to the defendant no.2 at the time on which the plaintiff would have 

been conceived. The defendant no.2 -mother was supporting the 

plea of the plaintiff that he was the biological son of the defendant 

no.1. 

167. The application seeking the DNA examination was filed not 

by the father -defendant no.1, but by the plaintiff and sought 

directions to the defendant no.1 to furnish blood samples for a 

DNA comparison with his own samples to establish that the 

defendant no.1 was his father. The court had considered the 

plaintiff's right to know his roots and noted that the application had 

been filed by an adult person who had moved the court for a 

declaration to determine his or her paternity. The court had 

recognized the well settled position of the jurisdiction to order a 

DNA examination and ordered accordingly. 

This case has no parity with the case in hand. 

168. We have discussed above the pleadings of the husband in the 

present case and concluded their insufficiency from the factual 

matrix brought out before us, the judgments relied upon by the 

appellant would not apply to the present case. 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016

XIII. Ensuring the Constitutional rights of the child 

169. Our consideration cannot end here. The inevitable victim of 

an order in a paternity challenge in matrimonial litigation is the 

child who is not before the court. We have noted above that for a 

wide variety reasons (paras 95 to 97) parties may attempt to obtain 

collusive orders on this issue. Any consideration and adjudication 

on this aspect directly impacts the right to life of the child 

guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It is a 

first principle of legal procedure and natural justice, that a person 

affected has a right to be heard. 

170. So far as children are concerned, it is trite that the courts are 

parens patriae and it is the responsibility of the court to ensure the 

welfare and best interest of the child in every proceeding where the 

rights and interest of the child are impacted. Such interest of the 

child has to be ensured independent of the rights and claims of the 

parties to the lis. 

171. As parens patriae, the court is bound to ensure the rights of 

the child which has to include independent and fair representation 

as well as hearing to the child, before passing such order. 

172. Para 81 of the three judge bench pronouncement of the 

Supreme Court reported at AIR 2003 SC 3450 Sharda v. 

Dharmpal sheds some light on the consideration by the court in a 

case involving any issue of the paternity of the child which reads 

thus: 

"81. If for arriving at the satisfaction of the court and 
to protect the right of a party to the lis who may 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 89 of 95 

otherwise be found to be incapable of protecting his 
own interest, the court passes an appropriate order, the 
question of such action being violative of Article 21 of 
the Constitution of India would not arise. The court 
having regard to Article 21 of the Constitution of India 
must also see to it that the right of a person to defend 
himself must be adequately protected." 
(Emphasis by us) 

173. How can, say, as in a case as the present, the court protect 

the rights of the child in question? This can only be done by 

ensuring independent representation to the child at all stages of the 

case where the aspect of paternity is being considered or is 

involved. 

174. Valuable insight is shed on the standards and parameters 

within which the courts are bound to ensure the rights of the child 

in the "Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council 

of Europe on child -friendly justice". The Guidelines were 

adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe 

on the 17 th of November 2010. These Guidelines, though not 

binding on the courts in India, but lend valuable guidance to the 

manner in which the rights of the child, if and when in conflict with 

parents, or otherwise in judicial precedents can be adequately 

protected. Reference may usefully be made to Chapter IV 

captioned "Child-friendly justice before, during and after judicial 

proceedings". Sub-Chapter A of this Chapter deals with "Child-

friendly justice during judicial proceedings". We are concerned 

with Section 2 thereof which reads "Legal counsel and 

representation". The relevant extract thereof reads thus: 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 90 of 95 

"Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council 
of Europe on child -friendly justice 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx 
IV. Child-friendly justice before, during and after 
judicial proceedings 
A. 
General elements of child-friendly justice. 
xxx

2. Legal counsel and representation

"42. In cases where there are conflicting interests between 
parents and children, the competent authority should 
appoint either a guardian ad litem or another independent 
representative to represent the views and interests of the 
child. 

43. Adequate representation and the right to be represented 
independently from the parents should be guaranteed, 
especially in proceedings where the parents, members of the 
family or caregivers are the alleged offenders. 
xxx 
xxx 
xxx" 
(Emphasis by us) 

We are of the view that these are the rights which must be 

ensured to every child in all judicial proceedings independently 

from the parents especially in cases involving parentage and 

identity issues. 

175. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of such case, 

the court would be bound to appropriately appoint a guardian ad 

litem or an amicus curiae to ensure the interest of the child which 

has to include effective representation to him/her, depending on the 

facts and circumstances of the case.

XIV. Impugned order 

176. It was imperative for the trial judge who was seized of the 

application for a DNA examination of the minor child in the 

present case on the 28 th of January 2016 to consider the same, on 

the binding parameters set out hereinabove. On that date the court 

had almost the entire case of the respondent no.1 husband before it 

inasmuch as the substantive evidence of the respondent no.1 and 

his main witness also stood recorded. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned 

Senior Counsel for the appellant has carefully taken us through the 

impugned order dated 28 th of January 2016 passed by the learned 

Trial Judge whereby the appellant's application was allowed and 

the directions were issued to the appellant to produce Baby 'X' to 

the office of the Director, CFSL, CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New 

Delhi at 10:30 am on 10 th February, 2016 when the respondent 

no.1would also be present so that samples of the child and the 

respondent no.1 would be obtained by the laboratory in the 

presence of both parties for conducting the DNA test at the expense 

of the husband. Additionally the directions were made that prior 

thereto, the respondent no.1 shall deposit an amount of `1,00,000/-

by way of demand draft/banker's cheque in the name of the court 

which would stand forfeited and made over to the appellant in the 

event that the paternity test on the basis of the DNA results shows 

the husband to be the father of the child. In case, the result reveals 

that the respondent no.1 is not the father of the child, the amount 

would be refunded to the respondent no.1. It was further directed 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 92 of 95 

that the parties to the petition, their agents, representative or any 

other person acting on their behalf or any entity in print, electronic 

media or internet will not print, publish or telecast any matter 

relating to the case, in any manner without the permission of the 

court. 

177. So far as the reasoning for the order is concerned, we find 

that the trial court has merely noted the bald contention of the 

appellant; the provisions of the Section 112 of the Indian Evidence 

Act. 

The trial court has noted the reliance placed by the appellant 

on the pronouncements in Goutam Kundu v. State of W.B. in (1993) 

3 SC; Miss Renuka Vs. Tammanna AIR 2007 Kant 133; Sunil 

Eknath Trambake Vs. Leelavati Sunil Trambake AIR 2006 Bom 

140; Shri Banarsi Dass Vs. Teeku Datta (2005) 4 SCC 449; Smt. 

Kanti Devi Vs. Poshi Ram (2001) 5 SCC 311 and; Dukhtar Jahan 

Vs. Mohammad Farooq 187 Cr.L.J. 849. 

Reliance has been placed on the extract of the 185 th Report 

of the Law Commission of India and that of the Supreme Court in 

Dipanwita Roy v. Ronobroto Roy. 

178. We find that the appellant had also objected to the DNA test 

report relied upon by the respondent no.1 pointing out that the 

appellant was never joined in the testing and furthermore that the 

child was the third party to the consideration. The plea of 

cohabitation of the appellant and the respondent no.1 is also noted 

as also the denial of the respondent no.1. Without at all recording 

any prima facie conclusions in accordance with law, as noted by us 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 93 of 95 

above, simply observing that "keeping in view the facts and 

circumstances of this case and in view of the discussions made 

herein above", the court recorded its satisfaction that there was a 

need for conducting the DNA test of the petitioner. In our view, 

the Family Court has completely failed to consider the matter, as 

was required in law. The impugned order dated 28 th January, 2016 

is clearly contrary to the well settled principles noticed by us in the 

above judgments, devoid of reasoning to support the order, fails to 

consider or return a finding that the respondent no.1 had a prima 

facie case in his favour and is legally not sustainable. 

179. The instant case has to be examined from yet another 

perspective. In Bhabani Prasad Jena the Supreme Court has held 

that the court must see whether the justice of the case requires a 

DNA testing and whether there is imminent need to do so. The 

respondent no.1 before us is interested only in dissolution of his 

marriage by decree of divorce. For this purpose, he has on two 

prior occasions filed the petitions for dissolution of marriage by a 

decree of divorce by mutual consent (HMA No. 1099/2014 at Saket 

Courts & HMA No. 783/2014 at Patiala House Courts). 

180. It is to be noted that even the joint statement of the parties 

stood recorded by the Family Court, Saket on 1 st of October, 2014 

in HMA No. 1099/2014. If it was not for want of territorial 

jurisdiction, these proceedings would have been completed. 

181. In the divorce proceedings before the Family Court, the 

appellant has also filed a counter claim seeking dissolution of 

marriage of the parties by decree of divorce on grounds of cruelty, 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 94 of 95 

inter alia on the ground that the pleadings of the respondent no.1 in 

his divorce petition apart from other assertions work cruelty upon 

her. 

So far as the substantive relief which the respondent no.1 

seeks, there is no imminent need for the directions of a DNA test. 

182. In view of the above, it has to be held that there is no 

imminent need for the DNA test for grant of the substantive relief 

as prayed for by the respondent no.1. 

XV. Conclusion 

183. 'H' -respondent no.1 husband has not pleaded "non-access" 

to the appellant wife or "no opportunity" at the time when Baby 

'X' could have been conceived. On the contrary, he has admitted 

"access". 'W' -the appellant wife has effectively denied the pleas 

of adultery. 

184. 'H' has failed to make out a prima facie case justifying an 

order for compelling Baby 'X' to give a sample for a DNA 

examination. The repeated admissions of paternity by 'H' in his 

pleadings, affidavit and his statement on oath in support on judicial 

record militate against a prima facie case in favour of 'H' for 

making the order prayed for. The husband 'H' has made 

admissions of paternity in public records of the Registrar of Births 

as well as bank record. No explanation was tendered before the ld. 

Family Court Judge or before us. The respondent no.1 has 

concealed material facts; is guilty of mis-statement before the 

Family Court and his conduct post-conception of the child do not 


MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016 

Page 95 of 95 

support a prima facie case in his favour justifying the impugned 

order. The respondent no.1 has also not established imminent need 

for the order or that such order was at all necessary for a just 

decision of the case. The impugned order is unreasoned, contrary 

to law and unsustainable. 

XVI. Result 

185. As a result, the order dated 28 th January, 2016 is hereby set 

aside and quashed. The appeal is allowed. 

186. We make it clear that nothing herein contained is a final 

expression of opinion on the merits of the controversy. We have 

only taken a prima facie view. The ld. Family Court Judge shall 

proceed in the matter in accordance with law, uninfluenced by any 

observation contained herein. 

187. In view of the order passed in the main appeal, CM 

No.5064/2016 does not survive for adjudication and is hereby 

dismissed. 

Lower Court Record be sent back forthwith.
