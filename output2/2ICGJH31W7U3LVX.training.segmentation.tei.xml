He further denied that he deliberately did not collect the relevant <lb/>document of the treatment as the same would have confirmed the treatment <lb/>which the deceased was receiving for her mental ailment. He further denied <lb/>that he deliberately did not make any inquiry regarding the business details of <lb/>the accused as it would falsify the case of the complainant regarding the demand <lb/>of dowry. The witness stated that he made no inquiries as to how many times <lb/>after marriage, the accused had gone to Manipur and also on how many <lb/>occasions the deceased had accompanied him further nor of the place where <lb/>they had stayed. The witness further denied that he deliberately withheld this <lb/>material from the Court because it would have proved that the deceased was <lb/>happily residing with the accused and visiting various places including his <lb/>relatives. He further denied that he obtained the signatures of the accused on <lb/>blank documents after pressurizing him and converted the same into various <lb/>memos to connect him with the present case. He further denied that the accused <lb/>had made no disclosure statement or that he was deposing falsely. <lb/></body>

He further stated that he made the payment for their stay and <lb/>accommodation. He further submitted that during the ceremonies, traditional <lb/>dress and jewelleris had been given to Reena and he made payment for the <lb/>same.

			<page>Page 59 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>the parents of the deceased were satisfied with the background and <lb/>the financial status of the accused, they gave the final nod; <lb/> that the demand of Rs.1.5 lacs and gold items as dowry from the <lb/>parents and brothers of the deceased at the time of the engagement <lb/>was not proved by the prosecution; <lb/> that the prosecution had also failed to prove that PW-13 i.e. father <lb/>of the deceased had incurred Rs.15 to Rs.16 lacs on the marriage as <lb/>expenses; <lb/> that though the EON car was given by the father of the deceased, it <lb/>was purchased in the name of the deceased and remained in the <lb/>possession of the deceased to use and even after the death of the <lb/>deceased, the car was released on superdari to PW-13 i.e. father of <lb/>the deceased, which established that the car, which was registered <lb/>in the name of the deceased had not been used by the accused no. 1 <lb/>/ respondent no. 1 and the claim of the prosecution that the accused <lb/>no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had raised a demand of a car as dowry <lb/>from the deceased or her parents, does not inspire the confidence; <lb/> that the claim of PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased that he gave <lb/>Rs.30,000/-to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and claim of <lb/>PW-14 i.e. mother of the deceased that she gave Rs.25,000/-to the <lb/>deceased in addition to what they had spent i.e. Rs.40,000/-on the <lb/>ceremony had not been proved; <lb/> that the marriage of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had been <lb/>performed at Manipur according to Manipur customs, but it had not <lb/>been established that Rs.30,000/-was paid to the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 as a dowry demand and furthermore, PW-13 i.e. <lb/>father of the deceased had admitted that the arrangement of the stay <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 60 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>in the hotel was made by the parents of the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 and that the father of the deceased had stated that <lb/>he had not seen the original bills regarding the payment made by <lb/>the deceased at any time nor was he aware what amounts were paid <lb/>by the deceased in relation to the customary rights at Manipur. <lb/>97. The learned trial court thus held that the prosecution had failed to prove <lb/>that PW-13 had paid any amount to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 during <lb/>his visit in Manipur as dowry and observed that it was rather the parents of the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1, who had made all arrangements of the stay and <lb/>also borne the expenses for the same. <lb/>98. The learned trial court concluded that the deceased left for Manipur on <lb/>27.11.2011 and stayed there for 19-20 days when PW-13 i.e. father of the <lb/>deceased came back with his family at Delhi on 02.12.2011 and the deceased <lb/>stayed at Manipur for 10-11 days more after 09.12.2011 and it was observed <lb/>thus that according to PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased, on 08/09.12.2011, the <lb/>deceased informed them that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had given <lb/>beatings to her to bring more dowry and demanded gold items for his family <lb/>members and in relation to this, PW-14 i.e. mother of the deceased had deposed <lb/>that the deceased had informed her about the said demands on telephone and it <lb/>was thus observed by the learned trial court that there was a contradiction, as to <lb/>whom, the deceased had informed about the said demand. <lb/>99. The further conclusions drawn by the learned trial court were to the effect <lb/>that the deceased was an advocate by profession and thus it was highly <lb/>improbable that the deceased being an advocate and having sufficient money <lb/>with her, stayed with the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 at Manipur even <lb/>thereafter, without any protest against his alleged cruel acts; that it was not <lb/>claimed by the prosecution that even after the deceased came to Delhi, either <lb/></body>

			<body>she visited her parents or her parents visited her to console her for the said <lb/>incident and that they had even not talked to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. <lb/>1 to that effect. The learned trial court further held to the effect that it was not <lb/>the prosecution version that the parents of the deceased had talked to the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 in relation to the maltreatment made to the <lb/>deceased at Manipur and that the allegations levelled by the prosecution against <lb/>the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1, thus did not inspire any confidence. In <lb/>relation to the alleged claimed by PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased that a sum <lb/>of Rs.50,000/-had been paid to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 on his <lb/>demand on 21.1.2012 when he demanded a sum of Rs.1 lakh from PW-14, <lb/>mother of the deceased PW-13 i.e. father of deceased had claimed that PW-14 <lb/>i.e. mother of the deceased had informed him about this demand though PW-14 <lb/>i.e. mother of the deceased had deposed that PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased <lb/>did not know that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had come to their house <lb/>on 21.01.2012 and that she had told the factum of payment of Rs.50,000/-to the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 after the death of the deceased. It was <lb/>concluded by the learned trial court that the giving of the amount of Rs.50,000/-<lb/>by PW-14 i.e. mother of the deceased was wholly circumspect in view of the <lb/>evidence led. <lb/>100. As regards the claim of the prosecution that on 12.02.2012, the accused <lb/>no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had slapped the deceased and gave leg blows on her <lb/>stomach and the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had caught hold of her by hair <lb/>and also gave beatings to her, it was observed by the learned trial court that <lb/>there was a contradiction in the testimony of PW-13 and PW-14, in as much <lb/>as, PW-14 had deposed that on 13.02.2012 the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 <lb/>had left the deceased at her parental home, and at that time the deceased had <lb/>informed her about beatings and that PW-13 while claiming that the said assault <lb/></body>

			<body>was given on 12.02.2012, had not disclosed as to when and how he came to <lb/>know of the said facts. It was also observed by the learned trial court that in her <lb/>cross-examination, PW-14 had deposed that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. <lb/>1 was not in Delhi on 12.02.2012 and it was thus concluded by the learned trial <lb/>court that there were contradictions in the statements of PW-13 and PW-14 and <lb/>the prosecution version and the prosecution had failed to prove that the accused <lb/>no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and the accused no. 2 respondent no. 2 had given <lb/>beatings to the deceased on 12.02.2012. <lb/>101. As regards the claim of the prosecution that on 29.02.2012, the accused <lb/>no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had got the deceased taken to the Hans Hospital for her <lb/>abortion and got her aborted, the learned trial court observed to the effect that <lb/>PW-13 in his cross-examination had deposed that in February, 2012, the <lb/>deceased got pregnant and on 13.02.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 <lb/>had left the deceased at her parental home and had stated that he would not take <lb/>care of a pregnant lady and resultantly on 29.02.2012, he got her aborted, <lb/>whereas PW-14 remained silent about any such talk by the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 on 13.02.2012. The learned trial court further observed to the <lb/>effect that PW-14 had deposed that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had <lb/>taken the deceased to the hospital for treatment on 29.02.2012 and had got her <lb/>aborted but also stated that in December, 2011, she came to know about the <lb/>pregnancy of the deceased and thus it was observed by the learned trial court <lb/>that it was implicit that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 was also aware of <lb/>the pregnancy from December, 2011 till 13.02.2012 and that he had not made <lb/>any grievance in relation to the pregnancy of the deceased. <lb/>102. It was also observed by the learned trial court that there were <lb/>contradictions in the version of PW-13 and PW-14 in relation to the aspect as to <lb/>for what purpose the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 herein had taken the <lb/></body>

			<body>deceased to the Hans Hospital, for whereas PW-13 had stated that she had been <lb/>taken for an abortion, PW-14 had stated that it was for treatment. It was further <lb/>observed by the learned trial court to the effect that if the version of PW-13 was <lb/>believed to be correct, it implied that PW-13 had learned on 13.02.202 that the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 was not happy with the pregnancy of the <lb/>deceased and thus on 29.02.2012, he was sure that the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 had taken the deceased for an abortion, then it was not <lb/>explained by PW-13 why he remained silent and had not protested and how he <lb/>had allowed the deceased to go to the hospital with the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1. The learned trial court also observed to the effect that the <lb/>prosecution had not led any evidence of any doctor from the Hans Hospital to <lb/>prove that the abortion had taken place that day too due to the malafide <lb/>intention of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and observed that it was the <lb/>specific case of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 that the deceased had got <lb/>aborted because of her weak condition. <lb/>103. PW-16 in her cross-examination had admittedly stated that the <lb/>deceased was physically weak and her weight was 36 kg. only and PW-12 <lb/>also deposed that at the time of death, the weight of the deceased was 36 kg. <lb/>It was thus observed by the learned trial court that in the given <lb/>circumstances, the prosecution had failed to prove that the accused was <lb/>responsible for the abortion of the deceased. <lb/>104. As regards the alleged demand of a house made by the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 from the parents of the deceased, it was observed by the <lb/>learned trial court that whereas PW-13 had deposed on 08.03.2012 that the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 alongwith his mother left the deceased at his <lb/>place because her condition was not good and she was mentally and physically <lb/>disturbed, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had told him that they would take <lb/></body>

			<body>her back only when they would provide him a house at Sant Nagar, Burari and <lb/>PW-13 had taken the deceased to Dr. Mukesh Yadav but no treatment was <lb/>given there and thereafter, she was taken to the Hindu Rao Hospital where she <lb/>was got admitted for one or two days and was treated for 15-16 days. The <lb/>learned trial court further observed to the effect that PW-14 i.e. mother of the <lb/>deceased had also deposed to the effect that according to PW-13 and PW-14, <lb/>the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 for the first time had raised the demand of a <lb/>house on 08.03.2012. It was also observed by learned trial court that there was a <lb/>contradiction in the statements of PW-13 and PW-14 in as much as PW-14 in <lb/>her statement Ex.PW23/E had stated that after one month of the marriage, the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had started harassing the deceased and had <lb/>demanded a new house at Sant Nagar, Burari and it can thus be held that on <lb/>08.03.2012, the demand of the house was not raised by the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 for the first time but had been raised just after a month of the <lb/>marriage. The learned trial court also concluded that the prosecution had not led <lb/>any evidence to establish that on 08.03.2012, the condition of the deceased was <lb/>not good and she was mentally and physically disturbed due to the acts of the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1. It was observed by the learned trial court in the <lb/>testimony of PW-13 that on 12.03.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 <lb/>along with his mother had left for Manipur and that it was not the prosecution <lb/>version that after 08.03.2012 till 03.04.2012, the deceased ever visited her <lb/>matrimonial house or the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 came to her parental <lb/>home to take her back. <lb/>INCIDENT OF 03.04.2012 <lb/>105. In relation to the fateful night of the incident dated 03.04.2012, PW-<lb/>14 had testified on oath that the deceased informed her that she had been <lb/>called by the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 herein at the house and had <lb/></body>

			<body>left for her place in her car about 9.30 p.m. and PW-13 had also deposed <lb/>that the deceased had gone at about 9.30 p.m. to the house of the accused <lb/>no. 1 / respondent no. 1 to make inquiries about him and at 10.30 p.m. the <lb/>accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had informed them about the deceased <lb/>falling down. It was also observed by the learned trial court that <lb/>admittedly, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 was not in Delhi on that <lb/>day. The learned trial court also observed to the effect that according to <lb/>PW-14, the deceased had not only informed her at 8.30 pm, that she had <lb/>been called by the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 but she waited up to <lb/>9.30 p.m. i.e. for an hour, to leave for that place and what was the exact <lb/>conversation between the deceased and PW-14 from 8.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. <lb/>was within the specific knowledge of PW-14 but the same had not been <lb/>disclosed by the prosecution. It was thus observed by the learned trial court <lb/>that in the given circumstances, it could not be believed that the deceased <lb/>simply told her mother i.e. PW-14 that she was going to inquire about the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 as deposed by PW-13. <lb/>106. The learned trial court further observed to the effect that it was <lb/>evident from the record that at 9.30 p.m. the deceased had left her parental <lb/>home alone and this fact was within the knowledge of PW-13 and PW14 <lb/>i.e. her parents and after that the deceased had left her parental home after <lb/>a gap of one hour, and there would have been some discussion between her <lb/>parents and deceased regarding going to that place and they would have <lb/>allowed her to go alone at 9.30 p.m. only once they were satisfied. It was <lb/>observed by the learned trial court that if there was any threat whatsoever <lb/>from the side of the accused or else the parents of the deceased would not <lb/>have allowed her to go alone or the deceased would have gone alone. The <lb/>learned trial court also observed to the effect that if there was a threat then <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 66 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>the prosecution had failed to explain as to why PW-13 and PW-14 had <lb/>allowed the deceased to go alone, and that the prosecution had failed to <lb/>explain that once the deceased and her parents were aggrieved by the <lb/>cruelties of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 on the deceased then why <lb/>they allowed her to go alone on that day and that too in the night and in her <lb/>own vehicle. The learned trial court also observed to the effect that there <lb/>was a time gap of one hour when the deceased left the home and when the <lb/>accused no. 2 informed about her falling down and that it was nowhere the <lb/>case of the prosecution that during the said period, PW-13 and PW-14 even <lb/>tried once to contact the deceased about her well being nor that the <lb/>deceased talked to her parents during the said period. It was also observed <lb/>by the learned trial court that this kind of conduct of the deceased and PW-<lb/>13 and PW-14 i.e. parents of the deceased, whose daughter had already <lb/>been treated cruelty by the accused, as claimed by the prosecution, was <lb/>unnatural. It was thus observed by the learned trial court that it can be <lb/>held that parents of the deceased were not apprehensive of the well being <lb/>of the deceased at the hands of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1. Rather, <lb/>accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had not only informed them about the <lb/>incident, but had also informed that the deceased had been taken to the <lb/>Trauma Centre and had asked them to come immediately and it was <lb/>observed by the learned trial court that if the accused no. 2 / respondent no. <lb/>2 was at fault then she would not have done so. <lb/>LACK OF COMPLAINTS MADE TO THE POLICE <lb/>107. The prosecution through witnesses, PW-13, PW-14, PW-15, PW-16 and <lb/>PW-17 i.e. father, mother, step brothers and step sister of the deceased, brought <lb/>forward the allegation of demand of dowry and it was observed by the learned <lb/>trial court that though these witnesses had deposed about the alleged cruelties <lb/></body>

			<body>meted out by the accused and allegedly noticed by them from time to time, they <lb/>made no complaint to the police against the accused till 04.04.2012. The learned <lb/>trial court also observed that PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased in his testimony <lb/>had stated that on 25.03.2012, he had asked the deceased as to why the deceased <lb/>was not making a police complaint and she had replied that she loved the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 a lot and for betterment of her matrimonial life, <lb/>she had hesitated to make any complaint to the police. The learned trial court <lb/>also observed to the effect that vide the statement Ex.PW11/A recorded on <lb/>04.04.2012, PW-13 had stated that the allegation made against the accused no. 1 <lb/>/ respondent no. 1 was that after the marriage, he had made a demand of a car <lb/>and in his statement Ex.PW11/A, PW-13 had raised the suspicion only against <lb/>the sister of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 i.e. the accused no. 2 / <lb/>respondent no. 2 herein and not the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 herein. <lb/>108. It was also observed that PW-13 had only stated in his testimony on <lb/>oath that he i.e. PW-13 could not give the complete details of the cruelties <lb/>to the SDM as he was in a state of shock but despite the same the statement <lb/>Ex.PW11/A remained conspicuously silent as to why the name of the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 was not mentioned as suspect at that time. <lb/>The learned trial court further observed that even if it is presumed for the <lb/>sake of arguments that PW-13 was in the state of shock at that time but it <lb/>is highly improbable that he was in a shock to such an extent that he had <lb/>forgotten to mention the name of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 as <lb/>suspect. <lb/>VARIATIONS IN THE STATEMENTS OF THE WITNESSES AT <lb/>DIFFERENT STAGES <lb/>109. The learned trial court has also observed that in the supplementary <lb/>statement dated 05.04.2012 of PW-13 recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C., he <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.L.P.74/2016 <lb/></note>

			<body>had stated that the in-laws of the deceased had demanded a car, which he <lb/>fulfilled and thereafter the in-laws of the deceased kept on raising their demands <lb/>which he kept on fulfilling to make the deceased happy and that on 08.03.2012, <lb/>the mother of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and the accused no. 2 / <lb/>respondent no. 2 had left the deceased at her parental home after harassing her <lb/>and the deceased allegedly died because of the harassment and demand of <lb/>dowry made by her in-laws. The learned trial court observed to the effect that <lb/>the statement dated 05.04.2012 i.e. supplementary statement of PW-13 recorded <lb/>under Section 161 Cr.P.C. when compared to the statement dated 04.04.2013 <lb/>reveals that PW-13 made material improvements in his statement dated <lb/>05.04.2012 and had also included the in-laws of the deceased in the making of <lb/>dowry demands and alleged cruelties. It was also observed by the learned trial <lb/>court that the statement made by PW-13 in court also had material improvement <lb/>and apart from making improvements, PW-13 had gone to the extent of <lb/>bringing note Mark PW13/N and deposed that it was in the hand writing of the <lb/>deceased and if the said note was so vital and came to his notice at an early <lb/>stage then he had failed to give any explanation for his silence in relation <lb/>thereto till his deposition and thus it was observed that PW-13 had made <lb/>material improvements in his statements from time to time and that further <lb/>there was a failure of the investigating agency to record the statements of the <lb/>family members on 04.04.2012. <lb/>110. The learned trial court also observed to the effect that apart from the <lb/>statement of PW-13 recorded on 04.04.2012, the statement of no other person <lb/>was recorded by the investigating agency on that day and specifically the <lb/>statements of PW-14, PW-15, PW-16 and PW-17 were not recorded despite <lb/>their availability. The statements of PW-14 and PW-15 indicate that their <lb/>statements were recorded on 27-04-2012 and it was thus observed by the <lb/></body>

			<body>learned trial court that even between 04.04.2012 and 27.04.2012, the <lb/>investigating agency did not attempt to record the statements of the family <lb/>members nor had they given their willingness to give their statements. The <lb/>learned trial court also observed that the statements of PW-14 and PW-15 <lb/>recorded on 27.04.2012, were not their voluntary statements but it had been <lb/>made at the instance of PW-13 and it was observed by the learned trial court <lb/>also that the investigating agency had recorded the statements of PW-14 and <lb/>PW-15 which were undated with the sole objective of the prosecution to fill up <lb/>the lacunae in the prosecution case. <lb/>111. The learned trial court also concluded to the effect that the testimony <lb/>of PW-13 and PW-14 brought forward the existence of a wedlock between <lb/>the father of the deceased and Kamla Goyal through which four sons were <lb/>born out and that two sons namely Bharat Goyal and Gaurav Goyal and <lb/>one daughter i.e. the deceased were born of the second wedlock and that a <lb/>property dispute was going on between PW-13 on the one hand and his <lb/>children on the other hand and the deceased was disturbed and used to <lb/>remain under depression and had filed the complaint qua which aspect <lb/>investigation was not conducted by the investigating agency and thus it was <lb/>held that the deceased had committed suicide, in which the accused had no <lb/>role to play. <lb/>112. The learned trial court also concluded to the effect that the prosecution <lb/>had miserably failed to establish that the accused ever treated the deceased with <lb/>cruelty in terms of Section 498A of the IPC. The learned trial court further <lb/>observed to the effect that since the prosecution had failed to prove that the <lb/>accused had treated the deceased with cruelties within the meaning of Section <lb/>498A IPC, the presumption under Section 113B of Indian Evidence Act of <lb/>dowry death cannot be raised against the accused and thus it was observed that <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.L.P.74/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 70 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>the prosecution had failed to prove that the accused had committed an offence <lb/>under Section 304B of IPC. <lb/>113. The learned trial court also observed to the effect that the death of the <lb/>deceased was homicidal in nature in which the accused had no role to play and <lb/>thus the prosecution had failed to prove that the accused had committed the <lb/>offence punishable under Section 302 of IPC. <lb/>CONTENTIONS OF THE STATE <lb/>114. Through Criminal Leave Petition No. 74/2016, the State is aggrieved by <lb/>the impugned judgment dated 16.09.2015 of the learned trial court and has <lb/>submitted : -<lb/>(a) that the impugned judgment is based on conjectures and surmises <lb/>and is against the facts and law; <lb/>(b) that the learned trial court had not dealt with the presumption of <lb/>dowry death under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 in <lb/>relation to the death of the victim having taken place under unnatural <lb/>circumstances within seven years of her marriage and that the <lb/>presumption had been successfully rebutted; <lb/>(c) that the two material witnesses i.e. PW-13 Sh. Sita Ram Goyal and <lb/>PW-14 Smt. Veena Goyal, parents of the deceased had consistently stated <lb/>about the dowry demand and the death of the victim having taken place <lb/>within five months from her marriage with the accused no. 1 / respondent <lb/>no. 1 and thus the presumption of dowry death was attracted, which had <lb/>been rebutted by the accused; <lb/>(d) that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate that there were <lb/>only minor contradictions in the statements of PW-13 Sh. Sita Ram <lb/>Goyal (the father of the deceased Smt. Reena Goyal), PW-14 Smt. Veena <lb/>Goyal (the mother of the deceased), PW-15 Smt. Mamta Goyal (step <lb/></body>

			<body>sister-in-law of the deceased) and PW-16 Tanjeev Kumar Goyal and that <lb/>they were not of a nature as to be fatal to the case of the prosecution; <lb/>(e) that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate the post-mortem <lb/>report which had clearly stated that the death was caused due to coma and <lb/>shock consequent upon multiple injuries that could be caused by blunt / <lb/>surface impact due to fall from a height; <lb/>(f) <lb/>that the learned trial court had erred in observing that the deceased <lb/>had suicidal tendency and the same is based on conjectures and surmises <lb/>and that there was no evidence on record to show the same ; <lb/>(g) that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate that there was no <lb/>occasion for the victim to commit suicide at the house of the accused no. <lb/>1 / respondent no. 1; <lb/>(h) that the learned trial court had erroneously disbelieved the <lb/>statement of PW-13 on the ground that there were improvements in the <lb/>statement made by PW-13 before the SDM and that PW-13 had duly <lb/>explained the improvements made at the time of giving his first statement <lb/>before the SDM submitting that he was in a state of shock and that the <lb/>same was a plausible explanation and ought not to have been described <lb/>by the learned trial court; <lb/>(i) <lb/>that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate that PW-13 had <lb/>deposed that he had handed over Rs.30,000/-to the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 at Manipur and that he had further deposed that on <lb/>8/9.11.2011, the deceased had informed him that the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 had given beatings to her at Manipur for more dowry <lb/>and had demanded three gold sets for his three sisters, gold rings and gold <lb/>chain for his parents and had also demanded on gold chain for his <lb/>brother-in-law ; <lb/></body>

			<body>(j) <lb/>that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate the deposition of <lb/>PW-13 that on 21.01.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had <lb/>come to his house and had demand Rs.1 lakh from PW-14 in relation to <lb/>which a sum of Rs.50,000/-was paid to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. <lb/>1 on his persistent demand; <lb/>(k) that the learned trial court had failed to appreciate that PW-13 had <lb/>deposed that on 12.02.2012 the deceased had gone to her matrimonial <lb/>house at Indira Vihar where the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had <lb/>caught hold of the deceased by her hairs and had given beatings to her <lb/>and she had fallen down on the ground and that PW-13 had also deposed <lb/>that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had slapped the deceased and <lb/>had also given leg blows on her stomach; <lb/>(l) <lb/>Interalia, it is submitted on behalf of the State that the learned trial <lb/>court had erred in disbelieving the testimony of the witnesses, in as much <lb/>as all the witnesses were persistent in relation to material particulars in <lb/>relation to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 having demanded a car <lb/>and dowry and of that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 having made a <lb/>demand for gold sets and a sum of Rs.50,000/-and a house and also in <lb/>relation to the assault and maltreatment with the deceased and also in <lb/>relation to the abortion of the deceased having been got done of the <lb/>deceased child by the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and of his having <lb/>been happy about the same. It was further contended on behalf of the <lb/>State that merely because the complainant had not made any complaint <lb/>prior to 03.04.2012 by the deceased or any other family members about <lb/>the alleged demand of dowry and cruelty cannot be a ground for <lb/>discrediting the witnesses in view of the fabric of Indian society where <lb/>the foremost concern of the family is to ensure that the matrimonial <lb/></body>

			<body>alliance is continued and generally police complaints are made. The State <lb/>thus had sought the conviction of the respondents under Sections <lb/>498A/304B/34 of IPC. <lb/>CONTENTIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS <lb/>115. On behalf of the respondents is contended that there was no infirmity in <lb/>the impugned judgment of the learned trial court and that the testimony of the <lb/>prosecution witnesses were wholly variant in relation to material particulars. It <lb/>was submitted on behalf of the respondents that the record established that the <lb/>deceased had not been able to adjust herself to the difference in culture, <lb/>traditions, linguistic aspects besides food habits at her matrimonial home at <lb/>Imphal, Manipur, which is a small and different town in comparison to Delhi <lb/>where the deceased was an advocate by profession. It was also submitted on <lb/>behalf of the respondents that merely because the deceased had committed <lb/>suicide, did not bring the respondents under the ambit of Sections 304B and <lb/>498A of IPC, as the allegations of demand of dowry and consequently cruelty <lb/>and harassment for the same had not been proved on record and thus there was <lb/>no presumption that can be raised under Section 113(a) of the Indian Evidence <lb/>Act, 1872. <lb/>116. It was also submitted on behalf of the respondents that as per the <lb/>requirement of Section 304B of IPC, firstly there has to be a demand of dowry <lb/>and secondly, it had to be shown that the same had to be raised soon before the <lb/>death and thirdly, the deceased had been subjected to cruelty and harassment by <lb/>her husband or his relations and it was thus submitted on behalf of the <lb/>respondents that qua the statement of PW-13 and PW-14 i.e. the parents of the <lb/>deceased, to the effect that the car was demanded on 05.11.20111 and was <lb/>given on 07.11.2011. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.L.P.74/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 74 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>117. It was further submitted on behalf of respondents that no averment had <lb/>been made in relation to any harassment or cruelty caused to the deceased for <lb/>that demand and that admittedly the Hyundai Eon car was in the name of the <lb/>deceased, who was driving the car throughout and even after her death the said <lb/>car was taken away by the father of the deceased i.e. PW-13. It was also <lb/>submitted on behalf of the respondents that the allegations of beating given to <lb/>the deceased on 12.02.2012 and of the pregnancy of the deceased having been <lb/>got aborted on 29.02.2012 were not made by PW-13 to the SDM in his <lb/>statement nor were they so stated by PW-13 to the police nor were they so <lb/>stated by PW-14. It is further submitted on behalf of the respondents that the <lb/>evidence on record establishes that the deceased was physically and mentally <lb/>weak and was having 36 kg. weight and that no medical evidence had been <lb/>placed on record by the prosecution of any forced abortion. <lb/>VERDICTS RELIED UPON BY THE RESPONDENTS <lb/>118. Reliance was placed on behalf of the respondents on the verdict of the <lb/>Supreme Court titled as Satvir Singh and others vs. State of Punjab and <lb/>another, AIR 2001 Supreme Court 2828 to contend that the commission of <lb/>the offence punishable under Section 304B IPC was not even attracted in the <lb/>facts and circumstances of the instant case, in as much as, there was nothing on <lb/>record to indicate that there was any cruelty inflicted on the deceased soon after <lb/>her death which could establish that there was no perceptible nexus between her <lb/>death and the dowry related harassment or cruelty inflicted upon her. <lb/>119. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondents on the verdict of <lb/>the Supreme Court in the case Hans Raj vs. State of Haryana, AIR 2004 SC <lb/>2790 to contend that the mere fact that a woman committed suicide within a <lb/>period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that she had been <lb/>subjected to cruelty by her husband does not automatically give rise to the <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.L.P.74/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 75 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>presumption and that the court is required to look into all the other <lb/>circumstances of the case and that one of the circumstances which has to be <lb/>considered by the Court was whether the alleged cruelty was likely to drive the <lb/>woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to the life, limb or <lb/>health of the woman. It was thus contended on behalf of the respondents that <lb/>there were no circumstances brought forward on record in the instant case to <lb/>show that there was any cruelty at any stage inflicted on the deceased which <lb/>was likely to drive her to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to <lb/>her life limb or health. <lb/>120. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondents on the verdicts of <lb/>the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court tiled as &quot;Mangat Ram vs. State of Haryana, 2014 (3) <lb/>JCC 1730 to contend that under Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, <lb/>1872, a statutory presumption does not arise by operation of law merely on the <lb/>proof of circumstances enumerated in Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence <lb/>Act, 1872 and merely because a married woman committed suicide within a <lb/>period of seven years from the date of her marriage, the presumption under <lb/>Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 would not automatically apply. <lb/>ANALYSIS <lb/>121. It is essential to observe that through the present Criminal Leave Petition <lb/>No. 74/2016, the State seeks leave to appeal against the impugned judgment of <lb/>the learned trial court whereby the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and the <lb/>accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 have been acquitted in relation to the alleged <lb/>commission of the offences punishable under Section 498A/304B/34 IPC and <lb/>also of the alternative charge under Section 302/34 IPC and thus it has <lb/>essentially to be borne under consideration that though an Appellate Court has <lb/>full powers to review and reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which <lb/>an order of acquittal is founded and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.L.P.74/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 76 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>no limitation, restriction or condition on the exercise of such powers and an <lb/>Appellate Court on the evidence before it, may reach its own conclusion both on <lb/>question of conviction and law as laid down in Chandrappa vs. State of <lb/>Karnataka &amp; Ors. 2007(4) SCC 415 and Prandas vs. The State AIR 1954 SC <lb/>36, however, it cannot be overlooked that the verdict of the Supreme Court in <lb/>Chandrappa vs. State of Karnataka &amp; Ors. 2007(4) SCC 415 also lays down <lb/>categorically that: <lb/>&quot;(4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in <lb/>case of acquittal, there is double presumption in <lb/>favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of <lb/>innocence is available to him under the fundamental <lb/>principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person <lb/>shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved <lb/>guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the <lb/>accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption <lb/>of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and <lb/>strengthened by the trial court. <lb/>(5) if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of <lb/>the evidence on record, the appellate court should not <lb/>disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial <lb/>court.&quot; <lb/>120. <lb/>In the case of Ghurey Lal Vs. State of U.P. 2008(10) SCC 450 the <lb/>Supreme Court has laid down the following guiding principle, to be adhered <lb/>to before leave to appeal against an order of acquittal may be granted: <lb/>&quot;. The appellate court may only overrule or otherwise <lb/>disturb the trial court&apos;s acquittal if it has &apos;very <lb/>substantial and compelling reasons&apos; for doing so. <lb/>A number of instances arise in which the appellate <lb/>court would have &apos;very substantial and compelling <lb/>reasons&apos; to discard the trial court&apos;s decision. &apos;Very <lb/>substantial and compelling reasons&apos; exist when: <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.L.P.74/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 77 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>i)The trial court&apos;s conclusion with regard to the facts <lb/>is palpably wrong; <lb/>ii) The trial court&apos;s decision was based on an <lb/>erroneous view of law; <lb/>iii) The trial court&apos;s judgment is likely to result in <lb/>&quot;grave miscarriage of justice&quot;; <lb/>iv) The entire approach of the trial court in dealing <lb/>with the evidence was patently illegal; <lb/>v) The trial court&apos;s judgment was manifestly unjust <lb/>and unreasonable; <lb/>vi) The trial court has ignored the evidence or <lb/>misread the material evidence or has ignored material <lb/>documents like dying declarations/report of the <lb/>Ballistic expert, etc. <lb/>vii) This list is intended to be illustrative, not <lb/>exhaustive. <lb/>2. The Appellate Court must always give proper <lb/>weight and consideration to the findings of the trial <lb/>court. <lb/>3. If two reasonable views can be reached-one that <lb/>leads to acquittal, the other to conviction-the High <lb/>Courts/appellate courts must rule in favour of the <lb/>accused.&quot; <lb/>121. To similar effect is the verdict of the Supreme Court in State of Madhya <lb/>Pradesh Vs. Dal Singh &amp; Ors. JT 2013(8) SC 625. <lb/>122. Gauged on the above parameters laid down by the Supreme Court of <lb/>India in the afore-mentioned cases, it is apparent that there is nothing on the <lb/>record to indicate that the learned trial court&apos;s decision was based on an <lb/>erroneous view of law or that the learned trial court had ignored the evidence or <lb/>misread the material evidence or had ignored the material documents. Rather, <lb/>the analysis of evidence put forth by the learned trial court is based on a <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.L.P.74/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 78 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>reasonable conclusion possible on the evidence on record and there are no <lb/>substantial and compelling reasons to discard the findings of the learned trial <lb/>court. <lb/>123. The factum that the presumption of innocence is available to an accused <lb/>in criminal jurisprudence where each person is presumed to be innocent unless <lb/>he is proved guilty by a competent court of law, and the aspect of the <lb/>presumption of his innocence being further reinforced and reaffirmed by his <lb/>acquittal by the trial Court strengthens the conclusion drawn on the evidence on <lb/>the record by the learned trial court and thus there is now in the present case the <lb/>double presumption in favour of the innocence of the accused / respondents. <lb/>124. The evidence before the learned trial court establishes that the deceased <lb/>and the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had married pursuant to a love affair <lb/>between them and that they were attached to each other even till the demise of <lb/>the deceased. This aspect reinforces the testimonies of the parents of the <lb/>deceased, who have categorically stated that the deceased had stated that she <lb/>loved the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and that she wanted a good <lb/>matrimonial life. The accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 in his statement under <lb/>Section 313 Cr.P.C., 1973 has also stated that the deceased and he were very <lb/>much in love and that there was no problem between them. The factum that the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 of his own came back to Delhi on 04.04.2012 <lb/>from Manipur immediately on learning of the demise of the deceased, who <lb/>expired on 03.04.2012 speaks volumes in favour of his innocence, in as much as <lb/>the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 made no attempt to abscond though he was <lb/>not even in Delhi at the time of the demise of the deceased. <lb/>125. The evidence on record also proves the weak physique of the deceased <lb/>which corroborates the plea of defence put forth by the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 that the abortion took place as it was advised medically in view <lb/></body>

			<body>of the frail health of the deceased. As rightly observed by the learned trial court, <lb/>there is no evidence that has been led on the record to show that there was <lb/>coerced abortion. <lb/>126. The factum that there was no complaint made prior to the demise of the <lb/>deceased in relation to any demands for dowry, coupled with the factum that <lb/>even Mark PW-13/N the alleged hand writing of the deceased in which she <lb/>stated allegedly that her life had been made hell by the respondents was not <lb/>produced during investigation of the father of the deceased and he chose to <lb/>produce it only in the witness box when he was being examined, coupled with <lb/>the factum that the said hand writing of the deceased was not sent for any <lb/>forensic hand writing examination nor compared with any admitted hand <lb/>writing of the deceased in any manner lend credence to the observation of the <lb/>learned trial court that there were categorical improvements in the testimonies <lb/>of the prosecution witnesses from the version put forth by them during the <lb/>investigation. Furthermore, the factum that the Mark PW-13/N is written in <lb/>English script with Hindi words makes it all the more circumspect. <lb/>127. The available record also establishes that the deceased was unable to <lb/>adjust to the life style at Manipur having lived in the Metropolitan City of Delhi <lb/>and was unable to adjust to the cultural differences between herself and her <lb/>upbringing and that of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and his parents were <lb/>residing at Manipur. <lb/>128. The available record further brings forth that the prosecution has been <lb/>unable to establish its claim that the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had <lb/>demanded an EON Car as dowry from the deceased and her parents which <lb/>purchased by the PW-13 i.e. the father of the deceased on 7.11.2011 for a sum <lb/>of Rs.3,46,758/-and was purchased in the name of his daughter i.e. the <lb/>deceased who continued to be in possession of the deceased and was driven by <lb/></body>

The further contention of the State that there was a demand of a sum of <lb/>Rs.1 Lakh made to the mother of the deceased by the accused no. 1 / respondent <lb/>no. 1 is also not substantiated in view of the testimonies of PW-13, PW-15 who <lb/>allegedly gave Rs.50,000/-to her step mother-in-law i.e. PW-14 to hand over <lb/>the same to the accused, in as much as PW-14 stated that she gave Rs.50,000/-<lb/>to the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 when he demanded Rs.1 Lakh which she <lb/>took from PW-15, she did not even inform her sons namely Bharat Goyal and <lb/>Gaurav Goyal about the same and she did not arrange the same through PW-13 <lb/>nor through her sons nor did she ask her own daughters-in-law and asked for the <lb/>amount from her step daughter-in-law and she did not even disclose the same to <lb/>her daughter (since deceased), are all aspects which cast a doubt on the veracity <lb/>of the prosecution version in relation to the alleged demand of Rs.1 Lakh, <lb/>especially as even PW-17 Sh. Manjeev Goyal and PW-15 Smt. Mamta Goyal <lb/>(his wife) did not ask for the money amounting to Rs.50,000/-when they shifted <lb/>and separated from PW-13 and PW-14. <lb/>130. The allegations against the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 of having <lb/>made demands of three gold sets for his three sisters and the gold rings and gold <lb/>chains for his parents and also of his having demanded one gold chain for his <lb/>brother-in-law (Jija), was also not conclusively established through the <lb/>prosecution evidence led. As regards the allegations levelled against the <lb/>respondents to the effect that on 12.02.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. <lb/>1 / husband of the deceased had slapped her and had given her leg blows and the <lb/>accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had caught hold of the deceased by her hairs <lb/></body>

			<body>and had given beatings, have also not been substantiated through the evidence <lb/>on record as it has not been brought forward on record as to when and how PW-<lb/>13 had learnt of the said fact. Furthermore, PW-14 had deposed that on <lb/>13.02.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had left the deceased at her <lb/>parental home and at that time he had informed about the said beatings and in <lb/>his cross-examination, PW-14 had deposed that the accused no. 1 / respondent <lb/>no. 1 was not in Delhi on 12.02.2012. The accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 in <lb/>his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C., 1973 had also categorically stated that <lb/>he reached at Delhi on 12.02.2012 at about 9.30 p.m. by an Air India flight <lb/>which the prosecution has been unable to refute thus casting a grave doubt on <lb/>the veracity of the prosecution version in relation to the allegations that have <lb/>been levelled against the accused / respondents of harassment and maltreatment <lb/>of the deceased for dowry demands. <lb/>131. As per the record, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had left the <lb/>deceased on 08.03.2012 at her parental home and did not come to take her back <lb/>at any stage. The prosecution has sought to contend that the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 told PW-13 that they would take back Smt. Reena Goyal (since <lb/>deceased) only when the family members of the deceased would provide him a <lb/>house in Sant Nagar, Burari. As per Ex.PW11/A, the statement of PW-13 <lb/>recorded by the Executive Magistrate though it has been stated by Sh. Sita Ram <lb/>Goyal (father of the deceased) that the marriage between the deceased and the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 took place on 02.11.2011, he further stated that <lb/>his daughter was an advocate and that on 07.03.2012, a Wednesday, the accused <lb/>no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had taken his daughter (since deceased) to his rented <lb/>accommodation at Indira Vihar (the house number has not been mentioned) <lb/>and on 08.03.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1, his mother and the <lb/>sister of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 i.e. Ms. Chanchan / the accused no. <lb/></body>

			<body>2 / respondent no. 2 herein, left his daughter (since deceased) at his house i.e. <lb/>PW-13 and never came back to take her back thereafter and the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 went away with his mother to Manipur, there is not a whisper <lb/>of an averment in Ex.PW11/A in relation to any demand of dowry for any <lb/>harassment meted out to the deceased. That such facts were not stated by the <lb/>father of the deceased i.e. PW-13, to the SDM in the first statement made to the <lb/>Executive Magistrate renders circumspect the prosecution version in relation to <lb/>the alleged harassment, demand of dowry and maltreatment of the deceased by <lb/>the respondents and also in relation to the alleged demand of a house at Sant <lb/>Nagar, Burari. <lb/>132. The testimony of PW-13 also does not bring forth that between <lb/>02.11.2011 and 07.03.2012, the deceased had ever stayed at her matrimonial <lb/>home. The testimony of PW-13 also states that when the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 had taken his daughter on 07.03.2012 to his house at Indira <lb/>Vihar, the next day i.e. on 08.03.2012, the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 had <lb/>informed PW-13 i.e. Sita Ram Goyal that the condition of Smt. Reena Goyal <lb/>(since deceased) was not good and thereafter, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. <lb/>1, the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 and their mother had brought Smt. Reena <lb/>Goyal (since deceased) to the house of her father and had left her at her house at <lb/>which time she i.e. Smt. Reena Goyal was not in a good condition and was not <lb/>able to stand and was mentally and physically disturbed. The testimony of the <lb/>PW-13 also states that at that time, the accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 stated <lb/>that they would bring back the deceased only when her family members had <lb/>provided her a house at Sant Nagar, Burari. PW-13 further stated that he and his <lb/>family members had taken the deceased to Dr. Mukesh Yadav for medical <lb/>treatment but she was not treated there and thereafter they took her to Hindu <lb/>Rao Hospital wherein the deceased was medically treated for 15-16 days after <lb/></body>

			<body>her admission in the hospital for one or two days. He further stated that the <lb/>accused persons and their mother did not visit the hospital to see the condition <lb/>of Smt. Reena Goyal despite having been informed about the condition of Smt. <lb/>Reena Goyal and that thereafter the accused did not come to the house to take <lb/>his daughter and on 12.03.2012, the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 went to <lb/>Manipur along with his mother. <lb/>133. As to what medical treatment was given to Smt. Reena Goyal d/o PW-13 <lb/>i.e. Sh. Sita Ram Goyal at the Hindu Rao Hospital and for what she was <lb/>medically treated for upto 20 days, has not been explained anywhere on the <lb/>record. From the date 08.03.2012 till the date of her demise, admittedly there <lb/>was no contact between the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and the accused no. <lb/>2 / respondent no. 2 and the deceased. <lb/>134. The testimonies of PW-13 Sh. Sita Ram Goyal (the father of the deceased <lb/>Smt. Reena Goyal), PW-14 Smt. Veena Goyal (the mother of the deceased), <lb/>PW-15 Smt. Mamta Goyal (step sister-in-law of the deceased), PW-16 Tanjeev <lb/>Kumar Goyal and PW-17 Sh. Manjeev Goyal (both step brothers of the <lb/>deceased), the family members of the deceased, bring forth that there were <lb/>property disputes between PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased and her children, in <lb/>as much as the first wife of PW-13 i.e. father of the deceased and her children <lb/>were living separately and the children of PW-13 (i.e. father of the deceased) <lb/>born of the wedlock with PW-14 were living separately and that complaints <lb/>were regularly made at the Police Station Civil Lines on account of property <lb/>disputes are aspects which bring forth the probability of the deceased being <lb/>under depression on account of the disputes between PW-13 i.e. father of the <lb/>deceased and his other sons namely Bharat Goyal and Gaurav Goyal. <lb/>135. Furthermore, the Investigating Officer Inspector Subhash Chand i.e. PW-<lb/>24 also admittedly made no inquiries in relation to the aspect of property dispute <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.L.P.74/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 84 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>between the family members of Sh. Sita Ram Goyal in view of his two <lb/>marriages, he having stated that he learnt of the two marriages only at this last <lb/>stage and neither did he make any inquiries in relation to the aspect of the first <lb/>wife, nor in relation to the aspect whether there was some civil disputes in <lb/>relation to the property of Sh. Sita Ram Goyal. <lb/>136. Significantly, the Investigating Officer has also categorically stated that <lb/>he had not visited to Manipur and made no inquiries in relation to the business <lb/>of the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 or his alibi. <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>137. The testimonies of the prosecution witnesses i.e. PW-13 Sh. Sita Ram <lb/>Goyal (the father of the deceased Smt. Reena Goyal), PW-14 Smt. Veena Goyal <lb/>(the mother of the deceased), PW-15 Smt. Mamta Goyal (step sister-in-law of <lb/>the deceased), PW-16 Tanjeev Kumar Goyal and PW-17 Sh. Manjeev Goyal <lb/>(both step brothers of the deceased) bring forth that the accused no. 1 / <lb/>respondent no. 1 had a good finance business at Manipur. that the parents of the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 were Government servants and father of the <lb/>accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 had already retired. The evidence on the record <lb/>thus, as rightly held by the learned trial court does not establish any cruelty <lb/>meted out to the deceased by the accused no. 1 / respondent no. 1 and the <lb/>accused no. 2 / respondent no. 2 for dowry in terms of Sections 498A of IPC, <lb/>1860 as held by the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in the judgment titled as &quot;Kanwar Pal <lb/>vs. Shakuntala and Ors.&quot; reported in 2015 IV AD (Delhi) 450 that : -<lb/>&quot;to establish the offence under section 304B IPC of dowry death, <lb/>the presumption under section 113B of Evidence Act cannot be <lb/>raised against an accused until independently the offence under <lb/>Section 498A IPC is proved by leading evidence qua the specific <lb/>allegation with regard to time and date of such demand and <lb/>cruelty and furthermore establishing the proximate live link <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.L.P.74/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 85 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand (offence <lb/>under Section 498A IPC) and the death of the victim&quot; <lb/>138. It is evident thus that the prosecution has failed to prove that the accused <lb/>nos. 1 and 2 / respondent nos. 1 and 2 had treated the deceased with cruelty <lb/>within the meaning of Section 498A IPC, 1860 and thus the presumption under <lb/>Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 of a dowry death cannot be <lb/>raised against the accused nos. 1 and 2 / respondent nos. 1 and 2, as there is <lb/>nothing on record to establish any credible evidence led by the prosecution to <lb/>prove any specific allegation with regard to the time and date of any demands or <lb/>cruelty meted out to the deceased having not established any proximate live link <lb/>between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demands and the death of the <lb/>victim i.e. deceased. <lb/>139. It is essential to observe that to bring the accused nos. 1 and 2 / <lb/>respondent nos. 1 and 2 within the ambit of culpability under Sections 304B of <lb/>IPC, 1860, the prosecution has to established the following essential ingredients <lb/>of Section 304B of IPC, 1860: -<lb/>(i) <lb/>that soon before her death, the woman must have been <lb/>subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband / or in-laws, <lb/>which cruelty must be for or in connection with demand for dowry; <lb/>and <lb/>(ii) such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been meted out <lb/>to the woman soon before her death. <lb/>140. The verdict of the Hon&apos;ble Apex Court in Raman Kumar v. State of <lb/>Punjab, 2009(3) JCC 1840 : (2009) 16 SCC 35 categorically lays down that <lb/>the presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act is a presumption of <lb/>law which can be raised only on proof of the following ingredients : -<lb/>(i) <lb/>The death of a woman should be caused burns or bodily injury or <lb/>otherwise than under a normal circumstance; <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.L.P.74/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 86 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>(ii) Such a death should have occurred within seven years of her <lb/>marriage; <lb/>(iii) She must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her <lb/>husband or any relative of her husband; <lb/>(iv) Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with <lb/>demand of dowry; <lb/>(v) Such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been meted out to <lb/>the woman soon before her death; <lb/>141. It was further laid down by the Supreme Court in the said verdict in para <lb/>16 to the effect : -<lb/>&quot;16. A conjoint reading of Section 113B of the Evidence Act and <lb/>Section 304B IPC shows that there must be material to show that <lb/>soon before her death the victim was subjected to cruelty or <lb/>harassment. The prosecution has to rule out the possibility of a <lb/>natural or accidental death so as to bring it within the purview of <lb/>the &quot;death occurring otherwise than in normal circumstances&quot;. <lb/>The expression &quot;soon before&quot; is very relevant where Section <lb/>113B of the Evidence Act and Section 304B IPC are pressed into <lb/>service. The prosecution is obliged to show that soon before the <lb/>occurrence there was cruelty or harassment and only in that case <lb/>presumption operates. Evidence in that regard has to be led in by <lb/>the prosecution. &quot;Soon before&quot; is a relative term and it would <lb/>depend upon the circumstances of each case and no strait jacket <lb/>formula can be laid down as to what would constitute a period of <lb/>soon before the occurrence. It would be hazardous to indicate <lb/>any fixed period, and that brings in the importance of a proximity <lb/>test both for the proof of an offence of dowry death as well as for <lb/>raising a presumption under Section 113B of the Evidence Act. <lb/>The expression &quot;soon before for death&quot; used in the substantive <lb/>Section 304B IPC and Section 113B of the Evidence Act is <lb/>present, with the idea of proximity test. No definite period has <lb/>been indicated and the expression &quot;soon before&quot; is not defined. A <lb/>reference to the expression &quot;soon before&quot; used in Section 114 <lb/>Illustration (a) of the Evidence Act is relevant. It lays down that a <lb/>court may presume that a man who is in the possession of goods <lb/>soon after the theft, is either the thief who had received the goods <lb/>knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for his <lb/>possession. The determination of the period which can come <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.L.P.74/2016 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 87 of 88 <lb/></page>

			<body>within the term &quot;soon before&quot; is left to be determined by the <lb/>courts, depending upon facts and circumstances of each case. <lb/>Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression &quot;soon before&quot; <lb/>would normally imply that the interval should not be much <lb/>between the cruelty or harassment concerned and the death in <lb/>question. There must be existence of a proximate and live link <lb/>between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the <lb/>death concerned. If the alleged incident of cruelty is remote in <lb/>time and has become stale enough not to disturb the mental <lb/>equilibrium of the woman concerned, it would be no <lb/>consequence.&quot; <lb/>142. Tested on the anvil on the above parameters, the prosecution evidence <lb/>led, does not bring forth that there was any harassment or cruelty meted out to <lb/>the deceased soon before her death to compel her to commit suicide. <lb/>143. In view thereof, the submissions made on behalf of the State through the <lb/>Criminal Leave Petition No. 74/2016 seeking leave to appeal to contend that the <lb/>learned Additional Sessions Judge had not appreciated the evidence cannot be <lb/>accepted in as much as there is nothing on record to indicate that the learned <lb/>trial court has ignored any material evidence, nor to indicate that there has been <lb/>any misappreciation of evidence. <lb/>144. In view thereof, the Criminal Leave Petition No. 74/2016 whereby the <lb/>State seeks the setting aside of the impugned judgment dated 16.09.2015 of the <lb/>learned Additional Sessions Judge-II (North West), Rohini Courts, Delhi in <lb/>Session Case no. 67/12 in relation to FIR no. 95/12 registered at police station <lb/>Mukherjee Nagar, under Section 498A/304B/34 IPC whereby the accused no. 1 <lb/>/ respondent no. 1 namely B. Raj Sharma and the accused no. 2 / respondent no. <lb/>2 namely Chanchan were acquitted in relation to the alleged commission of <lb/>offence punishable under Section 498A/304B/34 IPC, 1860 and also for the <lb/>alternative charge framed under Section 302/34 IPC, 1860 is thus, -dismissed. <lb/></body>
