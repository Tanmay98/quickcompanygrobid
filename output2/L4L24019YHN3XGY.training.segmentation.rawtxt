7. 
As regards the incident of 1.11.1984, it has been stated in the 

affidavit dated 8.9.1985 of the complainant, Sh. Harvinder Singh, to 

the effect: 

"Too much smoke was seen from the 
neighbouring colonies at about 11.00 morning of 
1.11.84. That smoke started coming nearer 
slowly. Meanwhile, a crowd consisting of 200/250 
people at once reached in front of the Gurdwara 
of our colony and set the Gurdwara on fire and 
started looting the things kept in the Gurdwara. 
The people of the mob came by a D.T.C. bus 
boarded on the same bus after looting and 
burning. One white car and the other red driven 
by some leader-brand people were leading the 
mob. The residents of the colony came out when 
mob had gone ahead and started extinguishing the 
fire of the Gurdwara. The mob again came back 
when they were still standing and thinking what to 
do next. They attacked the Sikhs with bricks, 
stones and rods as a result of which we sustained 
injuries. Then they burnt our house. 

On reaching home, I found my father who 
sustained a deep rod injury. He was lying 
unconscious. Whole of his body was blood 
stained. A mob of about 200/250 culprits attacked 
the house of Sardar Nath Singh, the president of 
our colony in the street of our back side, when I 
was still helping my father. They started beating 
the members of his family and set the truck on 
fire, parked outside. I and the members of my 
family were witnessing all the incident peeping 
through the holes of rear door of our house. They 
threw 15/16 years old son of Sh. Nath Singh, alive 
into the burning truck but the residents of the 
colony saved him later on. We were so scared 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 6 of 132 

that we ran away leaving the doors of the house 
open. My jeejaji (husband of the sister) and my 
father went to the house of one old lady who 
locked the house from the outside. Then we came 
to know that some Hindu brother had got my 
injured mother admitted in to the Rana Nursing 
Home, Rajouri Garden. The noises of burning 
were heard by us while sitting inside the closed 
room. The condition of the father was going to be 
much more poor. All the three of us were hungry 
and helpless in the closed room. We passed the 
night there." 

8. 
As regards the incident of 2.11.1984, it was stated in the said 

affidavit: 

"The old mother opened the door at 5.00 morning 
of the 2 nd date and borrowed two cycles from 
somewhere. I started on one cycle with my father 
and the other was driven by my brother-in-law 
and a Hindu boy. We reached Uttam Nagar when 
it struck 7.00 O' clock. A crowd of about 
200/250 persons surrounded us there in front of 
the office of the cong.(I) Party and started beating 
us with rods. We fell down with the injuries. They 
gave rod blows at my head, legs and hands. The 
blood coming from my head. Meanwhile a noise 
of shouting came, they should be burnt alive with 
Kerosene oil. I started running on hearing it. 
They were going to give me rod blows at the back 
side. I reached near the police post, Uttam Nagar 
running fast. I requested the police with folded 
hands to save my brother-in-law and my father 
who were being beaten by the mob in the opening 
on the road. But they started abusing me and did 
not listen to me, on the other hand, they said " 
you Sikhs deserve such behavior". The S.P.Said " 
What can we do?" The dead bodies of the Hindus, 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 7 of 132 

filled in the roads are too coming from Punjab." 
Blood was coming from my head, hands were not 
in working order. I begged the police for help but 
they refused to help me. I prayed to allow me to 
phone. I phoned the owners of my factory. They 
were also Sardars. I remained lying till 3.00 O' 
Clock at noon. The police refused to provide me 
medical aid in spite of my repeated requests. They 
said, "It will make no difference if you die when 
thousands of Sikhs are dying. The S.P. Uttam 
Nagar, came to the police post at about 3.15 
noon. I requested him to send me to the hospital. 
That S.P. brought some injured mothers and 
children to the police post from the Najafgarh 
side. About 40/50 sardars had reached there till 
5.00 in the evening. He sent me and two or three 
more injured to Din Dayal Hospital, Hari Nagar. 
My head was stitched and I was again sent to the 
police post, Uttam Nagar, after a short while. My 
masters came to bring me at 8.00 at night. They 
left me and some other Sikhs to the Gurdwara of 
Hari Nagar. Charanjit Singh, a friend mine, took 
me to his house at Hari Nagar, where I was got 
treated medically from a private doctor. 

2. I saw two or three constables who came to the 
police post with the goods looted from the 
neighbouring shops when I was praying for water 
in the injured condition, in the Police post, Uttam 
Nagar. They had soap cakes, tooth paste and 
honey bottles in their hands. The policemen were 
enjoying and watching sitting carefree when the 
shops of the Sikhs were being looted opposite to 
them. My brother-in-law and my father lost their 
lives during this incident. My sister who had only 
twenty seven days old son at that time, became 
widow. I have been disabled due to the injuries at 
the hands."

Administration Committee to examine the cases relating to the riots in 

Delhi during October and November, 1984 addressed to the 

Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi, Raj Niwas, Delhi, puts forth 

the incident of 1.11.1984 and 2.11.1984 as follows: 

"2. The deponent has alleged inter-alia that on 1 st 
November, 1984 a large mob came to their colony 
in a D.T.C. bus and set the Gurdwara on fire and 
looted the same. Sometime after, the mob attacked 
the houses of Sikhs with brick bats, stones and 
iron rods, as a result of which his father also 
sustained a deep injury. The mob also attacked 
the house of S.Nath Singh, the President of their 
colony and the deponent saw that his (Nath Singh) 
house-hold goods were looted and the son of Nath 
Singh was thrown in a burning truck which was 
set on fire by the mob. The boy was however 
saved by the residents of the colony. Feeling 
scared and apprehensive, he along with his father 
and his sister's husband, went to the house of a 
Hindu and spent the night there. He learnt that 
his injured mother was got admitted in the Rana 
Nursing Home, Rajouri Garden. 

3. The deponent has further alleged that on 2 nd 
November, 1984 he along with his father and 
brother-in-law proceeded towards Uttam Nagar 
on borrowed cycles. At Uttam Nagar a mob of 
200-250 persons surrounded them and started 
beating them with rods, as a result he sustained 
injuries on his head, legs and hands. He reached 
police post Uttam Nagar and requested for 
protection but in vain. At about 3.15 p.m. when 
S.P.came to the police post with some other 
injured women and children, he was sent for 
medical aid to Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital, 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 9 of 132 

Hari Nagar along with others. His brother-in-law 
and his father were killed in the incident and he 
himself was disabled on account of injuries 
sustained by him." 

10. It is further stated in the said letter dated 7.2.1992 that Sh. 

Harvinder Singh had been examined by the Committee who had 

confirmed his affidavit and gave the name of his brother-in-law as 

being Avtar Singh, s/o Raghubir Singh R/o B-I/96, Janakpuri, and that 

the scrutiny of the police records revealed that the incidents narrated 

by them had neither been investigated nor linked in any of the case 

registered at Police Station Najafgarh vide FIRs No. 256/84, 257/84 

and 258/84 relating to the October-November, 1984 riots. In view of 

the injuries as a very serious nature of the crime was revealed in the 

affidavit, the Committee recommended that fresh cases be registered 

regarding the incidents narrated by the deponents with it having been 

observed to the effect that two cases had to be registered one under 

Sections 147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436 of the Indian Penal 

Code, 1860 qua the incident of 1.11.1984 and the other in regard to an 

incident date 2.11.1984 under Sections 147/148/149/302 & 307 of the 

Indian Penal Code, 1860 to be investigated by an independent agency 

other than the local police. 

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PETITIONERS 

11. Through the petitions it has been submitted that on the scrutiny 

by the SIT which took up the present case along with few other 

cases/FIRs for further investigation of the case records of the previous 

FIR/ complaint made at that relevant time which had been closed and 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 10 of 132 

it found that the complainant due to fear could not disclose the name 

of the respondent as an accused as the respondent was then very 

influential with a lot of influence in the then Government and that the 

complainant also could not depose fearlessly against the respondent. It 

is further submitted through the petitions that it had also been found 

that at the relevant time when the case was under investigation, 

important and relevant evidences through available had not been 

collected and enquired upon by the then Investigating Team due to the 

reasons best known to them and thus the closure report had been filed. 

12. The State has further submitted that pursuant to the 

recommendations of the Justice G.P. Mathur Committee on the SIT 

having been constituted with the specific mandate to investigate/re-

investigate the criminal cases which were filed in the National Capital 

Territory of Delhi in connection with the 1984 anti sikh riots and to 

examine the record afresh, intimation regarding further investigation 

of the case was given to the Court and further investigation was taken 

up and during the course of investigation by the SIT, the complainant, 

Harvinder Singh, was examined afresh and some fresh witnesses were 

also examined under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 

1973 for the very first time who corroborated the contents of the FIR 

and the affidavit of the complainant, and that they had never been 

examined by any other agency previously. 

13. It was further stated through the petitions that it had been 

categorically stated by the complainant and the fresh witnesses that the 

respondent, the then Member of Parliament from the outer Delhi 

constituency had formed an unlawful assembly armed with deadly 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 11 of 132 

weapons for the purpose of committing criminal acts including rioting, 

arson, murder, causing disharmony and hatred between the different 

religious groups and destruction of properties belonging to the Sikh 

Community during the 1984 riots. 

14. It was further submitted by the State that despite the Justices 

Jain & Aggarwal Committee having recommended that the 

investigation be conducted by an independent agency other than the

Janakpuri for the incident of 1.11.1984 and of the FIR 264/92, Police 

Station Vikaspuri for the incident of 2.11.1984, the investigation of 

these cases was not handed over to any independent agency as 

recommended and the closure report was filed by the Delhi Police 

through its Riots Cell. The State further submitted that the delay in 

registration of the FIR and non-assigning of the investigation of the 

cases to an independent agency clearly suggests the influence of the 

respondent herein even at that time. It has been submitted through the 

petitions that in the affidavit before the Justice Ranganath Mishra 

Commission of Inquiry, the complainant, i.e., Sh.Harvinder Singh, 

mentioned that some leaders were leading the mob who came in a 

white car but the name of the leader was not disclosed due to

conducted by the SIT, the complainant had disclosed clearly that the 

leader who came in the white Car was the then Congress-I Member of 

Parliament, Sajjan Kumar, i.e., the respondent herein herein and he 

further deposed that after the assassination of Smt.Indira Gandhi on 

1.11.1984 during the day time a violent mob led by the respondent 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 12 of 132 

herein came towards the Gurudwara near Gulab Bagh and that the 

witnesses could clearly identify the respondent amongst the mob 

whom they know very well and the respondent pointed out towards 

the Gurudwara near Gulab Bagh and then the violent mob rushed 

towards the Gurudwara Saheb and started looting and burning the 

property of the Gurudwara and also set the Gurudwara on fire. It was 

also stated by Sh. Harvinder Singh in his affidavit that the rioters led 

by the respondent herein attacked the Sikhs in order to kill them in 

which the complainant, his father Sohan Singh S/o Amar Singh and 

the mother Smt. Jaspal Kaur sustained serious injuries and that the 

violent mob also attacked the houses and shops of the Sikh community 

including the house of one Sardar Nath Singh who was the Pradhan of 

the Gurdwara as well as the Gulab Bagh Colony and the respondent 

also set their truck on fire. It has been further submitted through the 

petition that Gurcharan Singh son of Sardar Nath Singh was thrown in 

the burning truck who was saved by the neighbours. It was further 

submitted through the petitions that on 2.11.1984 the complainant 

along with his injured father and brother-in-law proceeded towards the 

hospital, after remaining in hiding overnight on two bicycles for the 

treatment of his injured father and reached at the main road Uttam 

Nagar Bus Terminal, when about 20/25 persons came from the nearby 

Congress-I office and after the crowd further swelled, they were 

attacked. It was further averred through the petition that the 

complainant"s father Shri Sohan Singh and brother-in-law Sh.Avtar

mentioned in the affidavit dated 8.9.1985 of the complainant. In the 

incident of 2.11.1984 as mentioned in the affidavit dated 8.9.1985 of 

the complainant there is no reference to any person by a specific name

injured on the forehead with a brick by having been hit with a brick 

but as she was within the crowd, he could not bring her into the house. 

As per this statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal 

Procedure, 1973 of the complainant, the mob of rioters entered into 

the house of Nath Singh which was behind the house of the 

complainant and also set on fire trucks standing outside the house of

Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 17 of 132 

family members i.e. his brothers, sisters, brother-in-law and his 

injured father left their house open and went into the house in front of 

their house and his sisters entered the house of Tilak Raj in front of 

their house, whereas his brother hid in a house in another lane and his 

brother-in-law, injured father and he i.e. the complainant hid in an old 

lady"s house and that old lady locked them inside the house and 

herself sat inside the temple. That old lady, as per the statement of the 

complainant, was a Hindu and whilst they continued to be locked 

inside the house, they could continuously hear the sound of shouting, 

beatings and of burning fires. As per this statement of the complainant 

under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, after an 

hour he learnt that some Hindu brother had admitted his mother to the 

Rana Nursing Home at Rajouri Garden. He further stated that he 

along with his injured father and brother-in-law hid without food and 

water throughout the night and the next morning at 5 a.m. that old lady 

opened the lock and asked them to run away from there as the rioters 

had learnt of their having been hidden in her house and she also stated 

that they would kill them. As per this statement of the complainant, 

Harvinder Singh, he went to the house of Tilak Raj, who resides in 

front of his house and requested him to help them as his father"s 

condition was very bad and Tilak Raj got two bicycles arranged and 

also sent a Hindu boy with them and that he made his brother-in-law 

sit on one of the cycles and his brother-in-law tied his father to him i.e. 

the complainant with a Pagdi inasmuch as the complainant"s father 

was very seriously injured and the complainant thus sat with his 

father. He further stated that on the other cycle his brother-in-law and 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 18 of 132 

the Hindu boy took his father to Uttam Nagar which was at a distance 

of 4 to 5 km from their house but as they were crossing by the 

Congress-I office at Uttam Nagar then the rioters surrounded there and 

started beating them with Sarias. The complainant further stated that 

his brother-in-law Avtar Singh, who was coming on the other cycle 

was also surrounded by the rioters and the rioters were assaulting all 

three of them and that in the meantime a sound came from the truck 

"Aag lagakar maar do, i.e., set on fire and kill" and on hearing this he, 

i.e., the complainant started running blindly and the rioters were 

running behind him and he ran towards the Police Post, Uttam Nagar 

and requested the police personnel that his father and his brother-in-

law were being assaulted by the rioters on the road but the police did 

not help him and that he continued to cry that his father and brother-

in-law be saved, but the police personnel started abusing him, saying 

that these Sikhs had killed Indira Gandhi and thus they should be dealt 

with as they were being dealt. He further stated that he was bleeding 

profusely as he had been assaulted with the Sarias on his head and that 

four of his bones of his two arms had also got broken and that his eyes 

had also been seriously injured because of the fist blows given to him 

and that he had asked them that he be provided medical aid but he 

was not provided any medical assistance and rather the police 

personnel were spreading rumors that corpses of Hindus were coming 

in trains from Punjab and after sometime they spread another rumor 

that the Sikhs had put poison into the water tank. 

19. In his statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal 

Procedure, 1973, the complainant Harvinder Singh, also stated that at

Page 19 of 132 

about 2 to 3 p.m. a senior officer whose name he learnt from his 

badge, as V.K. Katna came to the police post and the complainant 

requested him for medical assistance and in the meantime the Officer 

received a wireless message and thus went in his jeep from the spot 

and returned after two hours with a police bus containing 40/50 

injured Sikh men, ladies and children and then put the complainant 

and four other persons into the jeep and took them to the D.D.U 

Hospital Hari Nagar, where due to the lack of doctors, nurses and 

other staff without any anesthesia he was given 14/15 stitches on his 

head and was also treated for his eyes but there was no treatment 

given that day for his broken bones. As per this statement under 

Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 of the 

complainant, the complainant requested the police in the hospital to 

leave him at his friend"s house at Hari Nagar but the police left him 

and the two other injured persons at the Uttam Nagar, Police Post and 

from 7 a.m. till 5 p.m., he remained at the Police Post, Uttam Nagar 

and that he could see from the Police Post that shops near the road 

were being looted and burnt and that the police was sitting as a silent 

spectator and that he also saw some police personnel were taking out 

the looted articles from the shop and brought them to the Police Post. 

As per the statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal 

Procedure, 1973 the entire day he continued to remain hungry and 

thirsty and injured at the Police post and despite his repeated requests 

he was given one glass of water and on inquiries at the Police Post, he 

learnt that his father and brother-in-law had been burnt alive and they 

were also not handed over the dead bodies of his father and brother-in-


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 20 of 132

several dead bodies together. 

20. As per this statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal 

Procedure, 1973 at about 9 p.m. the complainant and other persons at 

the Police Post were taken by the complainant"s friend Charanjit Singh 

and his employer Sharan Singh were taken to the Fateh Nagar 

Gurudwara Saheb and on the next day he was treated for his broken 

bones and other injuries. Through the statement under Section 164 of 

the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the complainant stated that he 

would make an appeal to the Court that Sajjan Kumar (the respondent 

herein) and other persons who brought the crowd had killed his father 

Sohan Singh and brother-in-law Avtar Singh and had injured his 

mother and he thus sought action against them and stated that the 

massacre had taken place at the instigation of Sajjan Kumar i.e. the 

respondent herein. He also requested through the statement under 

Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 that a day-to-day 

trial be given in the instant case inasmuch as 32 years had already 

elapsed and he sought that he got justice during his lifetime and sought 

the incarceration of the killers. 

21. As per the certificate issued by the learned SDJM, District 

Mohali, Punjab, the said statement under Section 164 of the Code of 

Criminal Procedure, 1973 was as per her belief made voluntarily by 

the complainant Sh. Harvinder Singh in her presence and was read 

over to the complainant Sh. Harvinder Singh who admitted the same

Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 30 of 132 

clearly identified the respondent herein and the interrogation of the 

respondent herein was required and a notice dated 19.11.2016 was 

issued to the respondent to put in appearance before the Investigating 

Officer of the case on 22.11.2016 at 3 p.m. on which date the 

respondent herein did come with a fleet of advocates to the office of 

the SIT but did not answer any question of the Investigating Officer 

and rather tried to dictate the terms of the investigation and in a tone 

of instruction asked the Investigating Officer of the SIT to give a 

written questionnaire and stated that he would not participate in the 

investigation unless a written questionnaire is given to him and stated 

that he would only give a written reply to the already prepared 

questionnaire. It was further submitted by the State that after all these 

tantrums, the respondent herein left with his advocates and the 

Investigating Officer failed to proceed with his investigation. 

36. It was further submitted by the SIT that on the next date of 

appearance i.e. on 14.12.2016 in relation which the notice dated 

5.12.2016 was issued to the respondent, he did not appear on the 

ground of ill health and he was called thus to put in appearance on 

21.12.2016. It was thus submitted on behalf of the SIT that though the 

respondent has pretended to join the investigation with his fleet of 

advocates, he has in fact not joined the investigation inasmuch as he 

did not cooperate in the same. 

37. It was further contended on behalf of the petitioner that even 

after the order dated 21.12.2016 of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka 

Courts, on the anticipatory bail applications filed by the applicant, the 

notice dated 2.1.2017 was issued to the accused to join the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 31 of 132 

investigation on 4.1.2017 in connection with the FIR No.227/1992, 

Police Station Janakpuri but even then during interrogation, the 

attitude of the respondent was non-cooperative and he did not reply to 

any question asked in connection of the case. 

38. Further submissions have been made on behalf of the petitioner 

submitting inter alia to the effect: 

 that there was no reason for the respondent/the 

accused to believe that he might be arrested; 

 that the matter was at the stage of investigation 

in relation to a very serious crime and anticipatory 

bail ought not to have been granted by the learned 

ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts; 

 that there is all the reason to believe that the 

accused might or has the capability to influence 

the witness and tamper with the evidences and 

thus invocation of Section 438 of the Code of 

Criminal Procedure, 1973 would hamper the 

overall investigation; 

 that anticipatory bail is a grant of an 

extraordinary privilege which can be granted only 

in exceptional cases and that the applicant has 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 32 of 132 

failed to give any exceptional ground for grant of 

anticipatory bail; 

 that it was mandatory on the part of the learned 

ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts to ensure compliance of 

pre-requisite conditions for grant of anticipatory 

bail including the nature and gravity of the 

accusation; 

 that the Court ought to have recorded reasons 

for grant of anticipatory bail which could have 

been granted if the Court was of the prima facie 

view that the applicant had been falsely enroped 

in the case and would not misuse his liberty; 

 that the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts has 

erroneously held the arrest of the applicant for the 

purpose of interrogation after 32 years of the 

incident was not required inasmuch as there was 

nothing to be recovered at the instance of the 

applicant; 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 33 of 132 

 that the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts had 

failed to appreciate that the complainant had given 

his affidavit dated 8.9.l985 before Justice 

Ranganath Mishra Commission of Inquiry as the 

FIR was registered only after more than seven 

years 
and 
that 
investigation 
despite 

recommendation of the Jain & Agrawal 

Committee had not been handed over to an 

independent agency which itself suggests the 

influence of the respondent and the lackadaisical 

approach of the then investigation agency; 

 it was an admitted fact that the complainant 

and other eye-witnesses who had shifted from 

Delhi to Punjab after riots were apprehensive 

about their life and safety and were not willing to 

visit Delhi due to fear of the respondent and; 

 that it was only after constitution of SIT as an 

independent entity to investigate the 1984 riots 

cases that the complainant and other witnesses 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 34 of 132 

reposed their faith in the system and gave their 

statement and identified the respondent. 

39. It has thus been submitted on behalf of the SIT that the 

respondent is a very influential person with muscle and money power 

and it is not possible to proceed with the investigation without keeping 

him in custody and that the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts had failed 

to appreciate that the incident in question had such a serious effect that 

the witnesses had to flee from Delhi and had given their statements 

only after the SIT was constituted. 

40. It has also been submitted on behalf of the applicant that 

pursuant to investigation being made by the SIT, the respondent is 

required to be confronted with the eye-witnesses, facts and the crime 

spot and in view of the non-cooperative behavior of the respondent, it 

would not be possible for the SIT to proceed smoothly with the 

investigation and the constitution of the SIT would become futile. 

41. It has also been submitted on behalf of the State that the 

anticipatory bail granted to the applicant has been in derogation of the 

established principles of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. 

42. Inter alia, apart from seeking that the impugned order dated 

21.12.2016 of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts in Bail Appln. No. 

14073/16 in FIR No.264/1992 under Sections 147/148/149/302/207 of 

the Indian Penal Code, 1860, Police Station Vikas Puri and in Bail 

Appln. No. 14072/2016 in FIR No.227/1992, under Sections 

147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436 of the Indian Penal Code, 

1860, Police Station Janakpuri be set aside, the applicant through the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 35 of 132 

said petition has also sought an expungment of observations made in 

paragraphs No.24 and 26 of the impugned orders dated 21.12.2016. 

IMPUGNED ORDER DATED 21.12.2016 

43. It is essential to advert to the impugned order dated 21.12.2016 

of the learned ASJ-01 Dwarka qua the Bail Appln. No. 14073/16 and 

Bail Appln. No. 14072/2016 in relation to the FIR Nos. 264/1992 

Police Station Vikas Puri and 227/1992 Police Station Janakpuri 

respectively, vide which it was observed similarly in each to the 

effect: 

FIR No.264/1992 registered at Police Station 
Janakpuri Vikaspuri and FIR No.227/1992 
registered at Police Station Janakpuri. 

"16. 
I have considered the rival submissions 
and have carefully perused the police file and 
reply of the Investigating Officer. 

17. 
It is an admitted fact between the parties 
that the present FIR was registered in the year 
1992 on the basis of affidavit dated 09.09.1985 of 
complainant Sh.Harvinder Singh sworn before 
Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission. It is also 
an admitted fact that alleged offence pertains to 
incident dated 01.11.1984 and 02.11.1984. It is 
also an admitted fact that neither complainant 
Sh.Harvinder Singh nor any of the witnesses 
examined by the Special Riot Cell had found any 
evidence to connect the applicant with the offence 
in question. It is also an admitted fact that earlier 
investigation was closed as untraced and the 
closure report was accepted by the Ld.MM on 
27.08.1994/16.02.1996. It is also an admitted fact 
that from 1994 till examination of witnesses 
including the complainant in the year 2016, 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 36 of 132 

nothing incriminating had come against the 
applicant. 

18. 
The deposition made by complainant 
Sh.Harvinder Singh under Section 164 Cr.P.C. 
statement against applicant has been made for the 
first time after 32 years of the incident and in the 
previous affidavit dated 09.09.1985, no such 
allegations were made. 

19. 
Similarly, some of the witnesses (names 
of witnesses withheld at the "request of 
Ld.Addl.PP for SIT) examined in 2016 under 
Section 161 Cr.P.C. were also examined during 
the course of investigation in the year 1992 and at 
that time, they had not identified the applicant to 
be the person, who had incited the mob to burn 
down the property of the Sikhs or to murder them. 
20. Some of the witnesses (names of witnesses 
withheld at the request of Ld.Addl.PP for SIT), 
who have been examined under Section 
161Cr.P.C. happen to be the relatives of the 
witnesses, who were examined in the previous 
investigation and in the previous investigation, 
their relatives had not stated anything 
incriminating against the present applicant. 
Therefore, from where these witnesses have 
derived the information regarding the role of the 
present applicant is also a matter of trial. 

21. Some of the witnesses (names of witnesses 
withheld at the request of Ld.Addl.PP for SIT), 
who have been examined under Section 161 
Cr.P.C. in 2016 are witnesses of hear-say 
evidence regarding the role of the present 
applicant and their statements do not incriminate 
the present applicant. 

22. 
Although an explanation has been given 
by the complainant in his statement under Section 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 37 of 132 

164 Cr.P.C. as to why he had not named the 
applicant earlier but whether such explanation 
can be believed or not, after 32 years, is a matter 
of trial. However, some of the witnesses examined 
in this case under Section 161 Cr.P.C in 2016, 
have not provided any explanation as to why at 
the time of their earlier examination in the year 
1992, they did not depose anything against the 
present applicant. This delay of around 24 years 
from the registration of the FIR do not make out 
a case for custodial interrogation of the applicant 
when admittedly at the time of first investigation, 
nothing incriminating had come against the 
present applicant. Nothing has come on record to 
show that applicant, during this course of 24 
years, had threatened or influenced any of the 
witnesses so as to refrain any of them from 
making statement against him. Further, applicant 
is having deep roots in the society and thrice, he 
remained as a member of the Parliament. 
Therefore, chances of applicant fleeing from 
justice are also quite remote. 

23. 
In the opinion of this court, for the 
purpose of interrogation of the applicant after 32 
years of the incident, arrest of applicant is not 
required as there are no allegations that anything 
used in the commission of offence is to be 
recovered at the instance of the applicant. 

24. The submission of the Id.counsel for the 
applicant that the case has been re-opened for 
political consideration just to falsely implicate the 
applicant also cannot be ignored and makes out a 
ground for anticipatory bail to the applicant. 

25. 
The judgments relied upon by the 
Id.counsel for the complainant as well as Ld.Chief 
Public Prosecutor for State delivered in Sajjan 
Kumar's case (supra) are not applicable to the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 38 of 132 

facts of the present case as same pertain to 
framing of charge and none of these judgments 
relied upon, pertain to grant or refusal of 
anticipatory bail where after a delay of 32 years, 
witnesses, who had not deposed anything against 
applicant earlier have turned around to depose 
otherwise. 

26. There can be no dispute with regard to ratio 
laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India 
in the matter of Jai Prakash Singh's case (supra) 
regarding the principles for grant of anticipatory 
bail relied upon by the Ld.counsel for SIT. In the 
present case also, exceptional circumstances have 
been made out for grant of anticipatory bail as 
there is prima facie material to show that the 
applicant has been falsely enroped in the crime in 
question after 32 years of the incident and his 
chance of mis-using the liberty is also non-
existent. 

27. In the facts and circumstances, the 
anticipatory bail application of the applicant is 
allowed. In the event of arrest, lO/SHO concerned 
is directed to release the applicant on bail on his 
furnishing a personal bond in the sum of 
Rs.1,00,000/-with one surety of the like amount 
with the conditions that applicant shall join the 
investigation as and when directed by the lO, 
shall not threaten or influence any of the 
witnesses and shall not leave the country without 
prior permission of the concerned court." 

ARGUMENTS OF STATE THROUGH SIT 

44. On behalf of the State, it has been submitted that though the 

parameters of cancellation of regular bail apply also to cases of 

cancellation of anticipatory bail, it was submitted on behalf of the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 39 of 132 

State by the then learned ASG Sh. Sanjay Jain that the present case 

was not a normal case which could fall within the domain of a case in 

which anticipatory bail granted could be withdrawn only on violation 

of the conditions imposed by a Court. Inter alia, it was contended on 

behalf of the SIT that this was a case of massacre/genocide in which 

pursuant to the assassination of the then Prime Minister Smt.Indira 

Gandhi the anti Sikh riots had taken place and that the complainant 

alone could not have got the FIR registered. 

45. During the submissions that were made on behalf of the State 

through the SIT (1984 riots) the learned ASG contended that there was 

a fundamental flaw in the impugned orders of the learned ASJ-01, 

Dwarka Courts, New Delhi granting anticipatory bail to the 

respondent in Bail Appln. No. 14072/2015 and in Bail Appln. No. 

14073/2015 both dated 21.12.2016 of the learned Additional Sessions 

Judge-01/Special Judge (P.C. Act) (CBI-03), Dwarka Courts in FIR 

No.227/1992, under Sections 147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436 

of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, Police Station Janakpuri and FIR 

No.264/1992, under Sections 147/148/149/302/307 of the Indian Penal 

Code, 1860 Police Station Vikaspuri, inasmuchas the seriousness and 

gravity of the offences had not been taken into account, that irrelevant 

considerations had been taken into account and that the factum that the 

complainant and other witnesses had pursuant to the further 

investigation done by the SIT had categorically identified the 

respondent herein as being the leader of the mob, who had got down 

from the white car on 01.11.1984 and on his signaling towards the 

Gurudwara, the mob had moved towards to the Gurudwara and had 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 40 of 132 

proceeded towards the Gurudwara and had started plundering, looting 

and damaging the same and had set it on fire which had been ignored 

and it was thus submitted on behalf of the petitioner by the SIT that 

the said statements could not have been ignored by the Trial Court at 

the time of consideration of the applications filed by the respondent 

herein seeking grant of anticipatory bail. 

JUDICIAL VERDICTS LAW RELIED UPON BY THE STATE 

46. It was submitted on behalf of the petitioner placing reliance on 

the verdict of the Hon"ble Apex Court on Adri Dharan Das Vs. State 

of West Bengal (2005) 4 Supreme Court Cases 303 to submit that the 

applicant i.e. the respondent ought to have shown that he had reason to 

believe that he may be arrested in a non-bailable offence and the same 

was required to be founded on reasonable grounds and that, it could be 

so founded only if there is something tangible to go by on the basis of 

which it could be said that the applicant"s apprehension that he may be 

arrested was genuine and that mere fear is not belief for which reason 

it was not enough for the applicant to show that he has some sort of 

vague apprehension that someone is going to make an accusation 

against him in pursuance of which he may be arrested and that the 

grounds on which the belief of the applicant is based that he may be 

arrested in a non-bailable offence must be capable of being examined. 

47. In the instant case the SIT has sought to submit that there are 

grave allegations against the petitioner in the statements made by the 

complainant and other witnesses whose names have been sought not to 

be disclosed by the SIT for their safety and well being and the State 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 41 of 132 

has sought the cancellation of grant of anticipatory bail granted vide 

impugned order of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts submitting 

inter alia to the effect that the custodial interrogation of the 

respondent is required. 

48. Reliance was placed on behalf of the petitioner on the verdict of 

the Hon"ble Supreme Court in Kiran Devi Vs. State of Rajasthan and 

Another 1987 (Supp) Supreme Court Cases 549 in which it had been 

laid down to the effect that in a murder case when the investigation 

was incomplete the proper course to adopt was to leave it to the Trial 

Court to do the needful if and when the person concerned was arrested 

in the light of the record available at that point of time and that the 

anticipatory bail ought not to have been granted in a murder case. It 

was thus submitted on behalf of the SIT that as the investigation was 

in progress there was all the reason to believe that the respondent 

might or had the capability to influence witnesses and tamper with the 

evidence and that the discretionary relief under Section 438 of the 

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 ought not to have been granted. 

49. Reliance was placed on behalf of the petitioner on the verdict of 

the Hon"ble Apex Court in the Raghuvir Saran Agarwal Vs. State of 

UP and Others (1998) 8 Supreme Court Cases 617 in which in a 

dowry death case anticipatory bail granted by the Court where the 

investigation was still in progress without giving any reasons 

whatsoever, was set aside. 

50. Placing reliance on the verdict of the Hon"ble Supreme Court in 

Jai Prakash Singh Vs. State of Bihar and Another (2012) 4 Supreme 

Court Cases 379 it was contended that the discretion under Section 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 42 of 132 

438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 should be guided by law 

duly governed by rule and cannot be arbitrary, fanciful or vague and 

the Court must not yield to spasmodic sentiment nor to unregulated 

benevolence and anticipatory bail cannot be granted without recording 

any reason through parameters laid down in judicial pronouncement 

without considering the nature and gravity of the offence specifically 

where the assailants / the accused were named. Reliance was 

specifically placed in para 19 of the said verdict to the effect that : -

"Parameters for grant of anticipatory bail in a 
serious offence are required to be satisfied and 
further while granting such relief, the court 
must record the reasons therefor. Anticipatory 
bail can be granted only in exceptional 
circumstances where the court is prima facie of 
the view that the applicant has falsely been 
enroped in the crime and would not misuse his 
liberty. (See D.K. Ganesh Babu v. P.T. 
Manokaran, State of Maharshtra v. Modh. Sajid 
Husain Mohd. S. Hussain and Union of India v. 
Padam Narain Aggarwal)." 

51. The verdict of the Hon"ble Apex Court in Japani Sahoo Vs. 

Chandra Sekhar Mohanty (2007) 7 Supreme Court Cases 394 was 

relied upon on behalf of the State to contend that the observations in 

the impugned order to the effect that the statement under Section 164 

of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the statement under 

Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 of the 

complainant and other witnesses recorded in 2016, and to delay in the 

recording of the statements of around 24 years from the registration of 

the FIR did not make a case for custodial interrogation could not have 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 43 of 132 

been the sole ground to throw away the prosecution version and that 

mere delay in approaching the Court of law by itself is not sufficient 

ground for dismissing the case though it may be a relevant 

circumstance in reaching the final verdict. 

52. Specific reliance was placed in para 14 of this verdict to the 

effect that : -

"14. The exercise of judicial discretion in favour 
of the respondents, who are ascribed leadership 
roles, on irrelevant grounds of they having not 
tampered with the evidence or being unlikely to 
commit other offence was highly improper and 
perverse and calls for interference, particularly 
when the investigation is still underway and the 
respondents still hold the status or position from 
where they can influence the witnesses. The 
relevant considerations for grant of anticipatory 
bail, viz. gravity of the offence, status and 
position of the accused persons, stage of 
investigation, likelihood of evidence being 
tampered, wider interest of justice and public at 
large and prima facie case appearing against the 
accused persons as also severity of punishment 
to which they may be exposed, are disregarded in 
the impugned orders making them even more 
vulnerable. The distance in time from the date of 
the alleged offences to the present stage of 
investigation is unfortunate and attributable to 
the failure of law enforcement agencies, but it 
cannot derogate from the requirements of 
bringing to book all the persons who might have 
had a role in rudely disrupting the lives of 
millions of citizens eking out their living in 
harmony in a progressive state of secular 
democratic republic of India, As observed by the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 44 of 132 

Supreme Court in its order dated 26.3.2008 
(supra): 

"...Communal harmony is the hallmark of 
democracy.... If in the name of religion people 
are killed, that is absolutely a slur and blot on 
the society governed by the rule of law.... 
Religious fanatics really do not belong to any 
religion. They are no better than terrorists who 
kill innocent people for no rhyme or reason.... 
And, when the State Government is pursuing the 
proceedings for proper investigation by the SIT 
constituted by the Supreme Court and consisting 
of independent high-ranking and experienced 
officers, the contention without any supporting 
material that there is a conspiracy to frame the 
respondents cannot be countenanced." 

53. A further submission was made on behalf of the SIT, placing 

reliance on the verdict of the Hon"ble High Court of Madras in case 

titled as V.N. Sudhagaran Vs. Enforcement Officer 1997 CriLJ 2630 

to contend that the petitioner therein had been issued summons to join 

the investigation and all that was required was that he should appear 

before the authority and join the investigation proceeding and to assist 

the investigating agency in the matter for which he was summoned 

and that it was not proper to grant anticipatory bail, which amounted 

to imparting fetters on the powers conferred under the Act, as there 

was no accusation and reasonable apprehension of being arrested for a 

non-bailable offence. Reliance was thus placed on observations in para 

4 of the said verdict tot the effect : -

"4. The exercise of power under section 
438 Cr.P.C. contemplates existence of two 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 45 of 132 

conditions, namely, an existing accusation and 
reasonable apprehension of arrest on the basis 
of such accusation [see Thangapandi Nadar v. 
State, 1982 Mad LJ (Cri) 250]. 

"Reason to believe" is much stronger than the 
expression "reason to suspect" and not identical 
with the expression "Knowledge"; Mere "fear" 
is not "belief". It must be capable of being 
examined by the Court objectively, because, it is 
then alone Court can examine whether applicant 
has reason to believe that he may be arrested. In 
order to successfully invoke the jurisdiction 
under Section 438 Cr.P.C. the petitioner has to 
make out a special case to secure an order of 
anticipatory bail which is of an exceptional type. 
He must prove that the charge levelled against 
him is mala fide and, stems from ulterior motive 
and it is for the petitioner to prima facie 
substantiate his allegation that the charge of 
serious non-bailable offence against him has 
been levelled mala fide [see Mahanthagowda v. 
State of Karnataka, 1978 Cri LJ 1045]. The 
High Court of Kerala in Thayyanbadi Meethal 
Kunhiraman v. Sub-Inspector of Police, Panoor 
(1985 Mad LJ (Cri) 263) : (1985 Cri LJ 1111) 
has held that a mere apprehension of arrest will 
not suffice. That means apprehension must be 
reasonable and based on existing facts. 
Imaginary accusation or future possible 
accusations will not be sufficient. On such 
accusations which are yet to come there cannot 
be any reasonable apprehension of an existing 
threat of arrest. It is a condition, precedent for 
an application under section 438 that there must 
be an existing reasonable apprehension of arrest 
on an existing accusation of having already 
committed a non-bailable offence prior to the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 46 of 132 

point of time of filing the application. That 
accusation will have to be specified in the 
application and the direction to be sought for is 
for the release in case of arrest in connection 
with that accusation. In Sankaranarayanan v. 
Sub-Inspector of Police, 1983 M.L.J. (Cri) 13 
this court has held that where the accused 
asserting that he may be arrested, State on the 
other hand contending that so far no case has 
been registered against the petitioner, the grant 
of anticipatory bail on the basis of vague and 
general allegation amounts to harming oneself 
in perpetuity against a possible arrest." 

Furthermore, it was submitted on behalf of the SIT, that the 

learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts has erroneously held that the case has 

been re-opened for political consideration which is just for false 

implication of the applicant and that the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka 

Courts had failed to appreciate that the SIT has been constituted by 

Ministry of Home Affairs on the recommendation of the Hon"ble 

Justice G.P.Mathur Committee keeping in view all the earlier reports 

of various commissions and committees pertaining to 1984 riots 

formed under earlier governments also, only in order to give justice to 

the victims of 1984 riots. It was reiterated on behalf of the petitioner 

that the SIT is an independent agency having no influence of any kind 

and that the SIT is committed to do a fair investigation on the cases, 

and in furtherance thereof, is in the process of connecting the chain of 

the events of the evidence collected by them and there was absolutely 

no cogent material on record for the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts 

to be persuaded by the accused to the effect that the case has allegedly 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 47 of 132 

been re-opened due to the political considerations and thus the very 

making of such an observation is an act of judicial impropriety. 

54. Reliance was placed on behalf of the petitioner on the verdict of 

the case titled as State of Gujarat Vs. Mayaben Surendrabhai 

Kodnani and Another (2010) CriLJ 1095 submitting to the effect that 

Courts shall consider prima facie case the attitude and activities of 

accused while granting anticipatory bail whilst adverting to 

observations in para 11 of the said verdict to the effect : 

"11. 
In the facts emerging from the record, it 
was clear that the respondents were leaders and 
had taken a leadership role in inciting the mob 
which attacked absolutely innocent persons, 
according to the submission. It was also 
submitted that the respondents were, by virtue of 
their position and influence, already kept away 
from the investigating agency of the State and 
hence the apprehension of their wielding 
effective influence on the witnesses was real and 
perfectly plausible. It was also pointed out that 
no sooner their alibis were fully investigated and 
their presence was satisfactorily established by 
independent record of location of their mobile 
phones at the relevant time, they had become 
unavailable to the SIT and approached the 
Court for anticipatory bail, rather than even 
responding to the call of the SIT." 

Specific reference was to paras 21 & 22 of the said verdict to 

the effect that : 

"21. Considering all the contentions and 
averments made on both sides as also the 
material appearing against the respondents, it is 
clear and not in serious dispute that the 
respondents were, at the relevant time, 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 48 of 132 

prominent leaders of VHP which had called the 
bandh, or of the party in power and they were 
present at the scenes of offences for some time. 
It is also in evidence that violent mobs had 
gathered with weapons and the atmosphere was 
surcharged with anger and hatred following 
burning of a railway coach along with 
passengers at Godhra on the previous day; and 
54 burnt bodies being brought to Ahmedabad on 
28.2.2002. The attitude and activities of the 
respondents in that milieu is not even claimed to 
be towards quelling or controlling the mobs nor 
is it believable that they visited the scenes of 
offences for any personal or private purpose. In 
such circumstances, prima facie, the allegations 
of inciting or encouraging the mobs into wanton 
display of hatred, destruction of properties and 
killing of innocent men, women and children 
produce a chilling picture of communal violence 
on an unprecedented scale, leaving on the 
psyche of ordinary citizens scars which might 
take decades to fade. Therefore, the offences 
which are alleged to have been committed by 
faceless mobs of thousands of persons led by few 
have to be treated as very heinous and having far 
reaching implications. As recently observed by 
the Apex Court in State of Punjab v. Rakesh 
Kumar [2008 (12) SCALE 95 

"...For instance, a murder committed due to 
deep-seated mutual and personal rivalry may not 
call for penalty of death. But an organized crime 
or mass murders of innocent people would call 
for imposition of death sentence as 
deterrence...." While such crimes are 
investigated by one after the other agency and 
matters have reached upto the highest court for 
redressal of grievances about investigation, there 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 49 of 132 

is no doubting that the belated investigation 
must not be hampered by providing protective 
umbrella to the persons who may be found to be 
involved. 

22. The exercise of judicial discretion in favour 
of the respondents, who are ascribed leadership 
roles, on irrelevant grounds of they having not 
tampered with the evidence or being unlikely to 
commit other offence was highly improper and 
perverse and calls for interference, particularly 
when the investigation is still underway and the 
respondents still hold the status or position from 
where they can influence the witnesses. The 
relevant considerations for grant of anticipatory 
bail, viz. gravity of the offence, status and 
position of the accused persons, stage of 
investigation, likelihood of evidence being 
tampered, wider interest of justice and public at 
large and prima facie case appearing against the 
accused persons as also severity of punishment 
to which they may be exposed, are disregarded in 
the impugned orders making them even more 
vulnerable. The distance in time from the date of 
the alleged offences to the present stage of 
investigation is unfortunate and attributable to 
the failure of law enforcement agencies, but it 
cannot derogate from the requirements of 
bringing to book all the persons who might have 
had a role in rudely disrupting the lives of 
millions of citizens eking out their living in 
harmony in a progressive state of secular 
democratic republic of India, As observed by the 
Supreme Court in its order dated 26.3.2008 
(supra): "...Communal harmony is the hallmark 
of democracy.... If in the name of religion people

the society governed by the rule of law.... 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 50 of 132 

Religious fanatics really do not belong to any 
religion. They are no better than terrorists who 
kill innocent people for no rhyme or reason...." 
And, when the State Government is pursuing the 
proceedings for proper investigation by the SIT 
constituted by the Supreme Court and consisting 
of independent high-ranking and experienced 
officers, the contention without any supporting 
material that there is a conspiracy to frame the 
respondents cannot be countenanced." 

Reliance was further placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict 

of the Hon"ble Apex Court in the case titled as Pokar Ram Vs. State 

of Rajasthan (1085) 2 SCC 597 to contend that the learned ASJ-01, 

Dwarka Courts had exercised discretion against the established 

principles of law under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal 

Procedure, 1973 and that exercise of the discretion under Section 438 

of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 has to be guided by law, duly 

governed by rule of law and cannot be arbitrary and vague as has been 

erroneously done. Specific reference was made to the observations in 

para 11 of the said verdict to the effect: 

"The only question which we are called upon to 
decide is whether : the learned Sessions Judge 
was justified in granting anticipatory bail in the 
facts and circumstances of this case? 
Unquestionably, no case was made out for 
granting anticipatory bail in this case. Let it be 
made distinctly clear that status in life, affluence 
or otherwise, are hardly relevant considerations 
while examining the request for granting 
anticipatory bail. Anticipatory bail to some 
extent intrudes in the sphere of investigation of 
crime and the court must be cautious and 
circumspect in exercising such power of a 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 51 of 132 

discretionary nature. This case amply illustrates 
that the power was exercised sub silentio as to 
reasons or on considerations irrelevant or not 
germane to the determinations. This Court, to 
avoid miscarriage of justice, must interfere." 

55. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the SIT in case titled as 

Prakash Kadam v. Ramprasad Vishwanath Gupta, (2011) 6 SCC 189 

to contend that it is not an absolute rule that considerations of 

cancellation of bail are different from consideration of grant of bail 

and that depends on the facts and circumstances. It has thus been 

contended on behalf of the SIT that even if it be contended on behalf 

of the respondent that he had not misused the grant of anticipatory bail 

as granted by the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts, the same did not 

amount to a consideration of the aspect as to whether the said bail 

ought to have been granted or not, reliance was thus placed on behalf 

of the SIT on the paras 17, 18, 19 & 20 of the said verdict to the 

effect: -

"17. 
It was contended by learned Counsel 
for the Appellants before us, and it was also 
contended before the High Court, that the 
considerations for cancellation of bail are 
different from the consideration of grant of bail 
vide Bhagirathsingh s/o Mahipat Singh Judeja 
v. State of Gujarat, Dolat Ram and Ors. v. State 
of Haryana and Ramcharan v. State of M.P. 
However, we are of the opinion that that is not 
an absolute rule, and it will depend on the facts 
and circumstances of the case. 

18. 
In considering whether to cancel the 
bail the Court has also to consider the gravity 
and nature of the offence, prima facie case 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 52 of 132 

against the accused, the position and standing of 
the accused, etc. If there are very serious 
allegations against the accused his bail may be 
cancelled even if he has not misused the bail 
granted to him. Moreover, the above principle 
applies when the same Court which granted bail 
is approached for canceling the bail. It will not 
apply when the order granting bail is appealed 
against before an appellate/revisional Court. 
19. 
In our opinion, there is no absolute rule 
that once bail is granted to the accused then it 
can only be cancelled if there is likelihood of 
misuse of the bail. That factor, though no doubt 
important, is not the only factor. There are 
several other factors also which may be seen 
while deciding to cancel the bail. 

20. 
This is a very serious case and cannot 
be treated like an ordinary case. The accused 
who are policemen are supposed to uphold the 
law, but the allegation against them is that they 
functioned as contract killers. Their version that 
Ramnarayan Gupta was shot in a police 
encounter has been found to be false during the 
investigation. It is true that we are not deciding 
the case finally as that will be done by the trial 
court where the case is pending, but we can 
certainly examine the material on record in 
deciding whether there is a prima facie case 
against the accused which disentitles them to 
bail." 

56. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict of 

the Hon"ble Apex Court in case titled as "Ash Mohammad vs Shiv 

Raj Singh @ Lalla Babu & Anr 2012 CriLJ 4670 Criminal Appeal 

No. 1456 of 2012 decided on 20.09.2012 to contend that whilst 

referring to para nos. 18 & 19 in Prakash Kadam v. Ramprasad 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 53 of 132 

Vishwanath Gupta (supra), the Hon"ble Apex Court had reiterated to 

principles laid down thereunder whilst observing to the effect : 

"18. We have referred to the above authorities 
solely for the purpose of reiterating two 
conceptual principles, namely, factors that are to 
be taken into consideration while exercising 
power of admitting an accused to bail when 
offences are of serious nature, and the 
distinction between cancellation of bail because 
of supervening circumstances and exercise of 
jurisdiction in nullifying an order granting bail 
in an appeal when the bail order is assailed on 
the ground that the same is perverse or based on 
irrelevant considerations or founded on non-
consideration of the factors which are relevant. 

19. 
We are absolutely conscious that liberty 
of a person should not be lightly dealt with, for 
deprivation of liberty of a person has immense 
impact on the mind of a person. Incarceration 
creates a concavity in the personality of an 
individual. Sometimes it causes a sense of 
vacuum. 
Needless 
to 
emphasize, 
the 
sacrosanctity of liberty is paramount in a 
civilized society. However, in a democratic body 
polity which is wedded to Rule of Law an 
individual is expected to grow within the social 
restrictions sanctioned by law. The individual 
liberty is restricted by larger social interest and 
its deprivation must have due sanction of law. In 
an orderly society an individual is expected to 
live with dignity having respect for law and also 
giving due respect to others' rights. It is a well 
accepted principle that the concept of liberty is 
not in the realm of absolutism but is a restricted 
one. The cry of the collective for justice, its 
desire for peace and harmony and its necessity 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 54 of 132 

for security cannot be allowed to be trivialized. 
The life of an individual living in a society 
governed by Rule of Law has to be regulated and 
such Regulations which are the source in law 
subserve the social balance and function as a 
significant instrument for protection of human 
rights and security of the collective. It is because 
fundamentally laws are made for their obedience 
so that every member of the society lives 
peacefully in a society to achieve his individual 
as well as social interest. That is why Edmond 
Burke while discussing about liberty opined, "it 
is regulated freedom". 

20. 
It is also to be kept in mind that 
individual liberty cannot be accentuated to such 
an extent or elevated to such a high pedestal 
which would bring in anarchy or disorder in the 
society. The prospect of greater justice requires 
that law and order should prevail in a civilized 
milieu. True it is, there can be no arithmetical 
formula for fixing the parameters in precise 
exactitude but the adjudication should express 
not only application of mind but also exercise of 
jurisdiction on accepted and established norms. 
Law and order in a society protects the 
established precepts and sees to it that 
contagious crimes do not become epidemic. In 
an organized society the concept of liberty 
basically requires citizens to be responsible and 
not to disturb the tranquility and safety which 
every well-meaning person desires. Not for 
nothing J. Oerter stated: 
Personal liberty is the right to act without 
interference within the limits of the law. 

21. 
Thus analyzed, it is clear that though 
liberty is a greatly cherished value in the life of 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 55 of 132 

an individual, it is a controlled and restricted 
one and no element in the society can act in a 
manner by consequence of which the life or 
liberty of others is jeopardized, for the rational 
collective does not countenance an anti-social or 
anti-collective act." 

57. Reliance was also placed on the observation in paras 32 & 34 of 

the said verdict of the Hon"ble Apex Court, which are to the effect : -

"32. We may usefully state that when the citizens 
are scared to lead a peaceful life and this kind of 
offences usher in an impediment in 
establishment of orderly society, the duty of the 
court becomes more pronounced and the burden 
is heavy. There should have been proper analysis 
of the criminal antecedents. Needless to say, 
imposition of conditions is subsequent to the 
order admitting an accused to bail. The question 
should be posed whether the accused deserves to 
be enlarged on bail or not and only thereafter 
issue of imposing conditions would arise. We do 
not deny for a moment that the period of custody 
is a relevant factor but simultaneously the 
totality of circumstances and the criminal 
antecedents are also to be weighed. They are to 
be weighed in the scale of collective cry and 
desire. The societal concern has to be kept in 
view in juxtaposition of individual liberty. 
Regard being had to the said parameter we are 
inclined to think that the social concern in the 
case at hand deserves to be given priority over 
lifting the restriction of liberty of the accused. 

34. 
We may note with profit that it is not an 
appeal for cancellation of bail as cancellation is 
not 
sought 
because 
of 
supervening 
circumstances. The present one is basically an 
appeal challenging grant of bail where the High 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 56 of 132 

Court has failed to take into consideration the 
relevant material factors which make the order 
perverse." 

It was thus submitted on behalf of the petitioner that the present 

petition though couched as being one under Section 439 (2) of the 

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was also one under Section 482 of 

the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 filed on behalf of the petitioner 

seeking the setting aside of the grant of the anticipatory bail to the 

respondent in Bail Appln. No. 14072/2015 and in Bail Appln. No. 

14073/2015 both dated 21.12.2016 of the learned Additional Sessions 

Judge-01, Dwarka Courts in FIR No.227/1992, under Sections 

147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436 of the Indian Penal Code, 

1860, Police Station Janakpuri and FIR No.264/1992, under Sections 

147/148/149/302/307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 Police Station 

Vikaspuri granted vide orders dated 21.12.2016 and that both the 

petitions filed were not merely ones seeking cancellation of the bail 

sought because of any supervening circumstances but rather 

challenges to grant of the bail inasmuchas the learned Additional 

Sessions Judge-01, Dwarka Courts had failed to take into 

consideration the material factors which rendered the impugned orders 

perverse. 

58. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict of 

the Hon"ble Supreme Court in the case titled as Dinesh M.N. (S.P.) 

Vs. State of Gujarat (2008) 9 SCC 66 with specific reference to para 

23 of the said verdict to contend that at the time of grant of bail, the 

Court dealing with an application for the cancellation of bail under 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 57 of 132 

Section 439 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can consider 

whether irrelevant materials were taken into consideration at the time 

of grant of bail. Even though the re-appreciation of the evidence was 

not called for and it was thus contended as was also observed vide 

para 26 of the said verdict that once it is concluded that the bail was 

granted on untenable grounds, the plea of absence of supervening 

circumstances has no leg to stand. 

59. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the petitioner on the 

verdict of the Hon"ble Apex Court in the case titled as Neeru Yadav 

Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another (2014) 16 SCC 508 with 

specific reference to para 12 of the said verdict which lays down as 

follows : -

"12. 
We have referred to certain principles 
to be kept in mind while granting bail, as has 
been laid down by this Court from time to time. 
It is well settled in law that cancellation of bail 
after it is granted because the accused has 
misconducted himself or of some supervening 
circumstances warranting such cancellation 
have occurred is in a different compartment 
altogether than an order granting bail which is 
unjustified, illegal and perverse. If in a case, the 
relevant factors which should have been taken 
into consideration while dealing with the 
application for bail and have not been taken note 
of bail or it is founded on irrelevant 
considerations, indisputably the superior court 
can set aside the order of such a grant of bail. 
Such a case belongs to a different category and 
is in a separate realm. While dealing with a case 
of second nature, the Court does not dwell upon 
the violation of conditions by the accused or the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 58 of 132 

supervening circumstances that have happened 
subsequently. It, on the contrary, delves into the 
justifiability and the soundness of the order 
passed by the Court." 

to contend that if in a case, the relevant factors which have been taken 

into consideration while dealing with the application for bail ought not 

been taken note of and where the grant of bail is founded on irrelevant 

considerations, indisputably the superior court can set aside the order 

of such a grant of bail. 

60. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict of 

the Hon"ble Supreme Court in the case titled as Harbans Kaur and 

Another Vs. State of Haryana (2005) 9 SCC 195 to the effect : -

"There is no proposition in law that relatives are 
to be treated as untruthful witnesses. On the 
contrary, reason has to be shown when a plea of 
partiality is raised to show that the witnesses had 
reason to shield actual culprit and falsely 
implicate the accused. No evidence has been led 
in this regard. So far as the delay in lodging the 
FIR is concerned, the witnesses have clearly 
stated that after seeing the deceased in an 
injured condition immediate effort was to get 
him hospitalized and get him treated. There 
cannot be any generalization that whenever 
there is a delay in lodging the FIR, the 
prosecution case becomes suspect. Whether 
delay is so long as to throw a cloud of suspicion 
on the seeds of the prosecution case, would 
depend upon the facts of each case. Even a long 
delay can be condoned if the witnesses have no 
motive of implicating the accused and have given 
a plausible reason as to why the report was 
lodged belatedly. In the instant case, this has 
been done. It is to be noted that though there 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 59 of 132 

was cross-examination at length no infirmity 
was noticed in their evidence. Therefore, the trial 
Court and the High Court were right in relying 
on the evidence of the prosecution witnesses." 

61. It was thus submitted on behalf of the petitioner that the 

anticipatory bail granted in Bail Appln. No. 14072/2015 and in Bail 

Appln. No. 14073/2015 both dated 21.12.2016 of the learned 

Additional Sessions Judge-01, Dwarka Courts in FIR No.227/1992, 

under Sections 147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436 of the Indian 

Penal Code, 1860, Police Station Janakpuri and FIR No.264/1992, 

under Sections 147/148/149/302/307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 

Police Station Vikaspuri as virtually common grounds are urged 

against the respondent in both the FIRs i.e., 227/1992, Police Station 

Janakpuri and 264/1992, Police Station Vikaspuri as virtually similar 

impugned orders dated 21.12.2016 be set aside and the observations 

made in the para 24 & 26 of the impugned orders dated 21.12.2016 in 

relation to both the FIRs above mentioned be expunged. 

RESPONDENT'S CONTENTIONS 

62. Through the reply submitted on behalf of the respondent and as 

contended by learned counsel for the respondent Sh. Anil Kumar 

Sharma, it was submitted at the very outset that both the cases Crl. 

M.C. 338/2017 and 339/2017 are in respect of FIR No. 227/92 and 

264/92 registered with Police Stations Janak Puri and Vikas Puri 

respectively but both the aforesaid FIR's are on the strength of the 

same affidavit dated 08.09.1985 submitted by the complainant before 

Justice Ranganthan Mishra Commission pertaining to the same 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 60 of 132 

incident and on the same subject matter i.e. both the said FIR's stated 

the same contents and both the cases were sent for closure by the 

investigating agency of the respective Police Stations and both the 

closure reports were accepted on 16.02.1996 and 27.08.1994 

respectively but the SIT was treating them as two different cases. 

63. It was further submitted on behalf of the respondent that the SIT 

has no reason to move the application under section 439(2) r/w section 

482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 against the grant of 

anticipatory bail order dated 21.12.2016 neither on the facts nor on the 

law and that the impugned order was neither erroneous nor arbitrary 

nor a blanket one and that the order was comprehensive, reasoned and 

a speaking one taking into consideration the material on record. 

64. It was also submitted on behalf of the respondent that the 

contention of the prosecution that the respondent had no reason to 

believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed 

a non-bailable offence was erroneous inasmuchas the respondent had 

every reason and apprehension for the same and thus the respondent 

had preferred an application for grant of anticipatory bail in the 

present case. The respondent also submitted that the prosecution had 

stated that there was a likelihood of tampering with the prosecution 

witnesses but there was not a whisper of his involvement in the 1984 

riots cases and that in the year 1990, i.e. after six years of the alleged 

occurrence, the case was registered vide RCl/90/SIV.II/SIC(l), New 

Delhi against the Respondent pertaining to riots that took place on 

01.11.1984 in the Sultanpuri area in which this Court had granted 

anticipatory bail to the respondent in the case titled as "Sajjan Kumar 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 61 of 132 

Vs. State'' vide order dated 07.11.1990 which is reported as 43 (1991) 

DLT 888 and that this Court had observed that after the lapse of six 

long years, the respondent could not be allowed to be detained and had 

further observed that for mere interrogation, the arrest of the 

respondent was not at all necessary and that in the above said case, the 

respondent was also acquitted by the then learned Court of the 

Additional Sessions Judge, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi, vide 

order dated 23.12.2002. 

65. It was further submitted by the respondent that in the year 2005, 

on the recommendation of the Hon'ble Justice Nanavati Commission, 

FIRs no. 250/84, 347/91 and 307/94 of Police Station Sultan Puri and 

416/84 of Police Station Delhi Cantt. were re-registered as 

RC7(S)/05/SCB-II/DLI/2005, RC8(S)/05/SCB-II, DLI both dated 

28.11.2005, RC25(S)/05/SCB-I/SCR-I/DLI dated 22.11.2005 in 

respect of Sultan Puri area and RC24 2005 S 2004 dated 22.11.2005 

for the Delhi Cantt area and that in these cases this Court vide its order 

dated 26.02.2010 had granted anticipatory bail in the aforesaid four 

cases whilst observing that it would not be justifiable to detain the 

respondent in custody after the lapse of 25 years of the incident and 

that against the above said order of this Court, a petition for special 

leave to appeal (CrI.) No. 2770 & 2771 of 2010 was preferred and the 

same was dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India vide order 

dated 29.03.2010. 

66. It was further submitted on behalf of the respondent that in the 

present case, the respondent was named after 32 years of the incident 

and the case was referred by the Ministry of Home Affairs vide its 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 62 of 132 

order dated 12.02.2015 to re-open after constituting the petitioner i.e. 

the SIT on the recommendation of the Justice G.P. Mathur Committee 

report and the petitioner in-turn had taken up further investigation on 

11.08.2016 and prior to that the respondent was never named in any of 

the FIRs. It was submitted by the respondent that it can thus not be 

said that the impugned order of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts is 

manifestly erroneous, illegal and perverse and it was submitted that 

rather the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts had rightly appreciated the 

material and rendered just findings where no interference was called 

for and that apparently, no custodial interrogation of the applicant was 

needed and that the Court of learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts had 

rightly observed that for the purpose of interrogation of the applicant 

after 32 years of the incident, arrest of the applicant was not required 

as there were no allegations that anything used in the commission of 

offence was to be recovered at the instance of the applicant. Inter alia 

it was submitted on behalf of the respondent that there was nothing 

that had been stated whether the prosecution has any new material 

which was required to be considered and there was no cogent, 

overwhelming ground and circumstances, which, so required the 

cancellation of the anticipatory granted to the respondent. 

67. Inter alia it was submitted on behalf of the respondent that he 

had not misused the terms / conditions imposed while granting the bail 

nor had he misused the concession of bail and that the prosecution had 

not mentioned any specific instances of any abuse of liberty by the 

respondent or probable apprehension in relation thereto and that it was 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 63 of 132 

the case of the prosecution that the respondent had never been named 

earlier when the matter had been sent for a closure. 

68. It was further contended on behalf of the respondent that the 

contention of the prosecution through the statements under Section 

161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 of witnesses that they 

had corroborated the contents of the FIR and the affidavit of the 

complainant could not be accepted, inasmuchas the said witnesses had 

never been examined before any other agency and thus the contention 

of the petitioner that they have categorically stated and alleged that the 

respondent was an MP from Outer Delhi Constituency and had formed 

an unlawful assembly, armed with deadly weapons for the purpose of 

committing criminal acts including riots, arson, murder causing 

disharmony and hatred between different religious groups and 

destruction of the properties belonging to Sikh community during 

1984 riots was absolutely incorrect. The respondent further contended 

that in 1990, the Special Riot Cell had been created to investigate the 

cases of the victims of 1984 riots and not a single word was stated in 

the entire petition as to how the Delhi Police was wrong in filing the 

closure report/untraced report in both the cases. 

69. Inter alia, it has been submitted on behalf of the respondent 

that the contents of the affidavit of the complainant are nowhere 

suggestive of the fact that the leader leading the mob who came in a 

white car was the respondent and thus the petitioner has no reason to 

contend that the name of the leader was not disclosed by the 

complainant due to fear and influence of the respondent and that the 

name of the respondent given now by the complainant after a gap of 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 64 of 132 

32 years speaks aloud that he has been named only to target him. It 

has also been submitted on behalf of the respondent that the 

statements made under Sections 161 and 164 of the Code of Criminal 

Procedure, 1973 of the complainant are weighed on the touchstone of 

trial and admittedly the name of the respondent has been brought forth 

through the said statements for the first time after the constitution of 

the SIT and that prior to the constitution of the SIT neither the 

complainant nor any other witness had ever named the respondent and 

that it was thus apparent that the respondent has been named after 

having been so tutored him. 

70. 
The respondent through his reply has further categorically 

stated that he had always cooperated with the Investigating Agency 

and stated that he had joined the investigation each time and 

categorically denied that he had gone with the fleet of advocates on 

22.11.2016 though he was accompanied by his counsel and stated that 

the counsel was nowhere involved in the interrogation proceedings. 

The respondent also denied that he had not answered any of the 

questions of the Investigating Officer though he was interrogated at 

length for about 2 hours. The respondent inter alia denied that he 

tried to dictate the terms of the investigation and also asked the 

Investigating Officer to give a written questionnaire and also denied 

that he would not answer till the questionnaire was given and rather 

requested the Investigating Officer to supply him a copy of the 

complaint/questions, if any, so that he could give appropriate and 

comprehensive reply. It was contended thus on behalf of the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 65 of 132 

respondent that if there was a CCTV surveillance in the office of the 

petitioner it must have retained the record. The reply of the respondent 

is accompanied by an affidavit of the respondent dated 27.11.2017. 

71. 
The respondent has further submitted that the status report filed 

by the petitioner Annexure P-7 supports the apprehension of the 

respondent that the petitioner had made up its mind to arrest him and 

that the SIT had opposed the anticipatory bail tooth and nail and the 

present proceedings under Section 439(2) of the Code of Criminal 

Procedure, 1973 also support the intention of the State to arrest him 

and thus the respondent apparently had every reason to believe that he 

would be arrested and thus the prayer made by the respondent seeking 

grant of anticipatory bail was wholly merited. The respondent has 

further categorically denied that there is any likelihood of his 

influencing the witnesses or tampering with the evidence and has 

categorically submitted that the respondent is not even remotely 

connected with the case. The respondent has further contended that 

the FIR was registered in the year 1997 and that in the affidavit dated 

8.9.1985 of the complainant there were no allegations made against 

the respondent and that the Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission had 

concluded that no responsible person and the authority of the 

Congress-I had hatched any conspiracy organizing large scale rioting, 

etc. and the Commission had itself recommended new Committees to 

be appointed to go through individual cases of omission and non-

registration of the case by the local police whereupon the Delhi 

Administration by notification of 21.2.1987 had constituted a 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 66 of 132 

Committee of Hon"ble Mr.Justice M.L.Jain and Mr. A.K.Banerjee, a 

Retired Officer of the IPS, to examine inter alia whether there were 

cases of omission to register or properly investigate offences 

committed in Delhi during the period of the riots from October 31, 

1984 to November 7, 1984. Pursuant to the recommendation of Jain 

Banerjee Committee a writ petition being W.P.(C) No.3327/1987 was 

preferred by Sh. B.N.Gupta and thereafter on 22.3.1990, the Delhi 

Administration appointed another Committee comprising Hon"ble Mr. 

Justice P.S. Poti, the former Chief Justice of Gujarat High Court and 

Mr.P.A. Rosha, a retired IPS officer whereafter the riot cell was 

constituted which investigated the present case and filed a closure 

report which was accepted on 27.8.1994 by the concerned competent 

Court. The respondent denied that the Riot Cell constituted in 1990 

and which filed the closure reports which were accepted was not an 

independent agency as recommended by the Jain Aggarwal 

Committee and submitted that the petitioner had no reason to blame 

the respondent for delay being under the influence of the respondent. 

72. 
The respondent has further stated that the shifting of the 

complainant from Delhi to Punjab after the incident is a matter of 

record but denied that the same was due to any fear of the respondent 

or because all the witnesses and the complainant were apprehensive 

about their life and safety and were not willing to visit Delhi due to 

fear of the respondent and that it could not be accepted that the 

complainant and other witnesses got faith in the system only after the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 67 of 132 

constitution of the SIT to investigate the cases in relation to the 1984 

riots. 

73. 
Through the written submissions, the respondent reiterated that 

the FIRs 227/92 and 264/92 are identical and based on a single 

complaint of Harvinder Singh in relation to two different police 

stations, i.e., Janakpuri and Vikaspuri based on the affidavit dated 

8.9.1985 of Harvinder Singh filed before the Justice Ranganath 

Mishra Commission and that the SIT has treated the FIR of Police 

Station Janakpuri in relation to the incident dated 1.11.1984 and of 

Vikaspuri in relation to the incident of 2.11.1984 but the contents of 

the affidavit contained incidents of both the dates and thus the 

respondent sought to ascertain whether the complaint with Janakpuri 

Police Station would be read to be the portion of the first day and the 

remaining contents for the other date and submitted that this brought 

forth the intention of the SIT, i.e., the petitioner as to how the 

petitioner was trying to multiply one incident. 

74. The respondent has further contended placing reliance on the 

verdict of the Apex Court Dolat Ram and Others Vs. State of 

Haryana; (1995) 1 SCC 349 (para 4) to contend that there is 

difference between rejection of bail in a non-bailable case at the initial 

stage and the cancellation of bail so granted and that very cogent and 

over whelming circumstances are necessary for orders directing 

cancellation of bail already granted and that the grounds for 

cancellation of bail are (broadly illustrative and not exhaustive). It was 

further contended on behalf of the respondent that no concrete 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 68 of 132 

material had been produced by the prosecution to show that the 

accused had interfered or attempt to interfere with the due course of 

administration of justice or evasion or attempt to evade the due course 

of justice or that the abuse of the concession granted to the accused in 

any manner. Reliance was placed on the observations in paragraph 4 

of the verdict of the Apex Court which lays down to the effect: 

"4. Rejection of bail in a non-bailable case at the 
initial stage and the cancellation of bail so 
granted, have to be considered and dealt with on 
different basis. Very cogent and overwhelming 
circumstances are necessary for an order 
directing the cancellation of the bail, already 
granted. Generally speaking, the grounds for 
cancellation of bail, broadly (illustrative and not 
exhaustive) are: interference or attempt to 
interfere with the due course of administration of 
Justice or evasion or attempt to evade the due 
course of justice or abuse of the concession 
granted to the accused in any manner. The 
satisfaction of the court, on the basis of material 
placed on the record of the possibility of the 
accused absconding is yet another reason 
justifying the cancellation of bail. However, bail 
once granted should not be cancelled in a 
mechanical manner without considering whether 
any supervening circumstances have rendered it 
no longer conducive to a fair trial to allow the 
accused to retain his freedom by enjoying the 
concession of bail during the trial. These 
principles, it appears, were lost sight of by the 
High Court when it decided to cancel the bail, 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 69 of 132 

already granted. The High Court it appears to us 
overlooked the distinction of the factors relevant 
for rejecting bail in a nonbailable case in the first 
instance and the cancellation of bail already 
granted." 

75. 
It was also submitted on behalf of the respondent that there was 

no concrete material that had been produced by the petitioner to show 

that the accused had interfered or attempted to interfere with the due 

course of administration of justice by threatening the complainant and 

his family members and the truth will surface when the evidence is 

adduced and in view of the conditions that have been imposed by the 

Sessions Judge for grant of anticipatory bail, the Investigating Agency 

could interrogate the accused, i.e., the respondent effectively and that 

it is settled law that for cancellation of bail the conduct subsequent to 

release on bail and the supervening circumstances alone are relevant. 

76. 
The respondent has contended that the conditions imposed on 

the respondent at the time of grant of anticipatory bail vide the 

impugned orders were to the effect: 

"(i). Respondent Shall join the investigation as 
and when directed by the I.O. 

(ii) 
Respondent shall not threaten or 
influence any of the witnesses 

(iii) And, shall not leave the country without 
prior permission of the concerned Court." 

77. 
Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondent on the 

verdict of the Apex Court in Padamakar Tukaram Bhavnagre and 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 70 of 132 

anr. V. State of Maharashtra and Anr. (2012) 122 AIC 237 (SC), 

on para 13 of the said verdict to the effect: 

"13. 
It is true that this Court has held that 
generally speaking the grounds for cancellation of 
bail broadly are interference or attempt to 
interfere with the due course of justice or abuse of 
the concession granted to the accused in any 
manner. This Court has clarified that these 
instances are illustrative and bail can be 
cancelled where the order of bail is perverse 
because it is passed ignoring evidence on record 
or taking into consideration irrelevant material. 
Such vulnerable bail order must be quashed in the 
interest of justice. No such case, however, was 
made out to persuade learned Single Judge to 
quash the anticipatory bail order passed in favour 
of accused 6 & 7. Order granting anticipatory 
bail to them, therefore, deserves to be confirmed. 
We feel that if the conditions imposed by learned 
Sessions Judge are confirmed, it would be 
possible for the investigating agency to 
interrogate the accused effectively. 

14. In the circumstances, we quash and set aside 
the impugned orders. Anticipatory bail granted to 
the appellants-accused 6 and 7 by learned 
Additional Sessions Judge by order dated 
23/01/2012 is hereby confirmed. The appellants-
accused 6 and 7 shall cooperate with the 
investigating agency and abide by the conditions 
imposed on them. Needless to say that it will be 
open to learned Additional Sessions Judge seized 
of the case to vary the conditions if necessary in 
accordance with law. Needless to say further that 
all observations made by us touching the merits of 
the case are prima facie observations and the trial 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 71 of 132 

court shall decide the case without being 
influenced by them." 

78. 
The respondent has further submitted that the conduct of the 

respondent indicated that he had fully cooperated and was fully 

cooperating with Investigating Agency, inasmuch as the respondent 

was granted bail on 21.12.2016 and had been summoned by the 

petitioner to join the investigation on 21.12.2016 itself at 3 p.m. and 

admittedly the respondent had gone to join the investigation at the 

petitioner"s office on 21.12.2016 at 3 p.m. but the Investigating 

Officer was not there and had gone to the Court to collect the case file 

and the order. The respondent had never been summoned by the 

Investigating Agency for interrogation till date and thus there is no 

question of non-cooperation by the respondent and that the respondent 

had joined the investigation every time except on 14.12.2016 for 

medical reasons which had been appreciated by the petitioner and had 

been allowed and merely asking for a copy of complaint, document or 

questionnaire to ensure a proper reply cannot be taken as non-

cooperation by the Investigating Agency. 

79. The respondent has further contended that it is not the case of 

the petitioner that : 

"a) the respondent will flee away from justice or 
will not be readily available during trial; 

b) or, 
has 
misused 
or 
abused 
the 
concession/liberty granted to him; c) or, has 
interfered or attempt to interfere with the due 
course of administration of justice; 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 72 of 132 

d) or, has threatened someone or tampered with 
the prosecution witnesses and; 

e) or, has breached some conditions imposed 
upon him while granting the anticipatory bail." 

80. The respondent further contends that there is no material 

suggestive of cancellation of bail and that it has not been disputed by 

the petitioner that the respondent has been named for the first time 

after 32 years of the incident and that the first case was registered 

against the respondent in the year 1990 vide RC-1/90/SIV.II/SIC(1) 

and that the respondent had been granted bail in this case on 7.11.1990 

by this Court in the case titled Sajjan Kumar V. State in Crl.Misc. 

(Main) No.2073/1990 though similar stereotyped allegations had been 

levelled with specific reference to para 6 of the verdict wherein the 

contentions of the Investigating Agency were set forth to the effect: 

"(6) The submission of the learned counsel for the 
respondent is that the petitioner is politically a 
powerful and influential person who can directly 
or indirectly interfere in the course of 
investigation. Considering the seriousness of the 
offence and keeping in view the events that 
happened on 11th September, 1990, coupled with 
the fact that it has taken six long years to start 
investigation, there is every likelihood that if the 
petitioner is allowed to remain at large, no 
witness will come forward and depose about the 
events concerning this case. This potential threat 
to the prosecution witnesses, who have already 
experienced a haul cast during the riots will 
prevent them from bringing to book the accused 
and others charged of committing acts of brutality 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 73 of 132 

against the community. Under the circumstances, 
it is a fit case where the anticipatory bail be not 
confirmed." 
and the observations of this Court in para 29, 30, 31 and 32 in this 

verdict were relied upon which are to the effect:-

"(29) Before parting with this case, we may note 
that the basic rule for an applicant who seeks his 
enlargement on bail from the court may be tersely 
put as bail, not jail, except where there are 
circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing 
from Justice or throttling the course of justice or 
creating other trouble in the shape of repeating 
offences or intimidating witnesses and the like. 
………………………………………………………… 
……………………………………………... 

30. The considerations which weigh with the 
Courts while granting bail either under Section 
438 or Section 439 Criminal Procedure Code are 
:-

(1) The nature and gravity of the circumstances in 
which the offence is committed; 

(2) The position and the status of the accused with 
reference to the victim and the witnesses; 

(3) The likelihood of the accused fleeing from 
justice; 

(4) Of repeating the offence; 

(5) Of jeopardising his own life being faced with a 
grim prospect of possible conviction in the case; 

(6) Of tampering with witnesses; 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 74 of 132 

(7) The history of the case as well as of his 
investigation; and 

(8) Other relevant grounds which may apply to 
the facts and circumstances of a particular case. 

31. In this case, all these factors were carefully 
taken into consideration when the petitioner was 
initially granted anticipatory bail and are being 
kept in view while disposing of the present 
petition. It is now well settled by a catena of 
judgments of the Supreme Court that this power is 
not to be exercised as if a punishment before trial 
is being imposed. The only material 
considerations in such a situation are whether the 
accused would be readily available for his trial 
and whether he is likely to abuse the discretion 
granted in his favor by tampering with the 
evidence. As observed earlier, there is no material 
on record to suggest that the petitioner who has a 
status in the society, and enjoys good reputation, 
love and affection from the persons at large, is 
likely to repeat the offence, abuse the trust placed 
in him by the court, or avoid the trial. 

32. After a lapse of 6 long years of the incident, 
the petitioner cannot be allowed to be detained, 
particularly when there is no averment that a 
weapon of offence with which the petitioner is 
alleged to have caused any injury to the deceased 
is yet to be recovered for mere interrogation, in 
my opinion, the arrest of the petitioner is not at all 
necessary. Even otherwise, the CBl does not 
appear to be serious in interrogating the 
petitioner. On 27-9-90, when the case was taken 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 75 of 132 

up, learned counsel for the respondent frankly 
conceded that from the day when the petitioner 
was granted anticipatory bail, he has not been 
summoned for interrogation. It was only 
thereafter that the petitioner was summoned once 
on 28-9-90, and thereafter no attempt has been 
made to further interrogative him." 

81. 
It was also submitted on behalf of the respondent that the 

second time the cases were registered by the CBI in the year 2010 on 

the recommendations of the Nanawati Commission vide RC7 (S)/ 05/ 

SCB-II/DLI/2005, RC8(S)/05/SCB-II/DLI, RC25(S)/05/SCB-I//SCR-

I/DLI and RC24.2005(S) 2004 and that the Hon"ble High Court of 

Delhi granted anticipatory bail vide order dated 26.02.2010 in case 

titled Sajjan Kumar V. The State through C.B.I. (Bail Appln. No. 

306/2010, 311/2010,312/2010 and 313/2010) and it was submitted 

that in this case too, similar allegations were levelled which are 

levelled now. 

82. 
Reliance was placed thus on behalf of the petitioner on 

specific paragraphs of this verdict to the effect:-

"26. As against this, Mr.R.S.Cheema, learned 
senior counsel for respondent has contended that 
petitioners are involved in serious offences of 
murder, arson and rioting. Petitioner Sajjan 
Kumar had organized a mob and targeted the 
persons of Sikh community; instigated the said 
mob to kill and burn the houses of members of 
Sikh community. The incident of arson, looting, 
killing of male members of Sikh community was 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 76 of 132 

perpetrated in a barbaric, inhuman and cold 
blooded manner, as a consequence whereof 
victims were isolated, felt insecure, threatened 
and at that time had no courage to go before the 
investigating agency or the court to make a 
statement against the culprits. Some of the close 
relatives of the deceased persons had migrated to 
Punjab. They had no courage to return to Delhi, 
so as to make a statement before the court or the 
investigating agency. With the passage of time 
they mustered up the courage and approached the 
Commission and filed their affidavits. All these 
years the truth was not allowed to come to surface 
which shows the pervading influence which the 
local administration had over the whole matter, 
as petitioner Sajjan Kumar was holding high 
political position. Accordingly, delay of 25 years 
in this case will be of no consequence. 

27. Learned senior counsel has further contended 
that if petitioners are granted bail witnesses will 
not be able to depose freely; the confidence of 
people in the system will erode and a fallacious 
message will go that these petitioners are above 
the law. In case petitioners are granted bail it will 
hamper the fair trial, inasmuch as, the witnesses 
may not come forward to depose in the matter 
and/or they may be threatened or influenced by 
the petitioner. In nutshell, it is contended that in 
the facts of this case, bail cannot be granted. 

28. From what has been stated hereinbefore, it is 
clear that in respect of the same incident four 
FIRs were registered earlier and the same were 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 77 of 132 

investigated by the Delhi police and statement of 
witnesses were recorded. In two FIRs, closure 
reports were filed which were duly accepted by 
the learned Metropolitan Magistrate after 
recording statement of complainants. In two other 
FIRs as many as ten charge sheets were filed in 
the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge. 
After full fledged trial accused involved therein, 
were acquitted, which included the petitioners as 
well. So far as petitioner Sajjan Kumar is 
concerned, he was not sent up to face trial in the 
FIRs registered by the Delhi Police. A separate 
case was registered against him in the year 1990 
by CBI pursuant to the recommendation of above-
referred Committee, wherein role was ascribed to 
him that he had instigated the mob by holding 
public meeting in the Sultanpuri area and 
thereafter, he led the mob which went on rampage 
and burnt the properties; looted the belongings 
and killed several persons belonging to Sikh 
community. However, after a full-fledged trial this 
petitioner was also acquitted in the said case. 
Several witnesses, whose statements have been 
recorded by the CBI had also made statements in 
earlier FIRs. Present FIRs are relating to the 
same incidents which were involved in earlier 
cases. Some more witnesses have come forward 
and made statements implicating the petitioners. 
So far as other witnesses, who are common in 
earlier FIRs as well as in the present FIRs, have 
again made statements implicating the petitioners, 
however, their version had already been tested in 
earlier cases sent for trial. The new witnesses 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 78 of 132 

have to explain as to why they did not come 
forward earlier, during the trial. 

29. Be that as it may, the statement of such 
witnesses cannot be brushed aside completely at 
this stage but at the same time, they have to 
explain during trial as to why they had not 
deposed against the petitioner on earlier 
occasions. 25 years have gone by and this delay 
undoubtedly tilts the balance in favour of the 
petitioners, at least for the purpose of grant of 
bail to them. 

30. I do not find much force in the contentions of 
learned senior counsel that in case petitioners are 
enlarged on bail it will hamper fair trial and 
witnesses may not depose against the petitioners 
due to the fear and threat. Admittedly all along 
for the last 25 years petitioners have remained at 
large as they were not in custody. CBI conducted 
investigation almost for about five years. During 
this period, CBI did not deem it fit to arrest any of 
the petitioners. In spite of petitioners being at 
large, witnesses came forward and made 
statements before the CBI. There is no specific 
allegation against the petitioners of having 
threatened or influenced any of the witnesses, so 
as to refrain any of them from making statement 
against them. Besides this, it is evident from the 
facts narrated herein above that after the 
unfortunate and appalling incident the relatives 
or the family members of victims were not left 
alone to fend for themselves as members of 
various 
Commission/Committees 
including 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 79 of 132 

eminent jurists had been visiting the affected 
areas and even met the families of the victims 
residing in camps and interacted, counselled, 
encouraged, offered support to them right from 
the beginning. 

31. Indeed, it is true, that offence with which 
petitioners have been charged by the CBI is of 
grave nature and ordinarily in such cases courts 
would be slow in admitting the accused on 
anticipatory bail, in the face of statements of eye 
witnesses. However, in the peculiar facts and 
circumstances of this case and for the reasons as 
mentioned in the preceding paras hereinabove, I 
am of the view that it would not be justifiable to 
detain the petitioners in custody, after lapse of 25 
years of incident." 

83. 
Inter alia it was submitted on behalf of the respondent that an 

SLP was also preferred against the afore-cited verdict to the Supreme 

Court which was dismissed vide order 29.3.2010 in the case titled 

Jagdish Kaur v. Sajjan Kumar & Ors. Crl.No.2770/2010 and 

2771/2010, with it having been observed by the Apex Court to the 

effect: 

" Permission to file SLPs is granted. 

In view of the reasons stated in the impugned 
order, we are not inclined to interfere with the 
same. We make it clear that the observation and 
conclusion arrived by the High Court are 
confined only for the disposal of the anticipatory 
bail. At the time of trial the court concerned is 
free to decide the issue on the basis of the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 80 of 132 

materials placed and uninfluenced by any of the 
observation made in the impugned order. 

With the above observations, the special leave 
petitions are dismissed." 

84. 
Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondent on the 

verdict of the Supreme Court in Badresh Bipinbhai Seth v. State of 

Gujarat and Anr.; (2016) 1 SCC 152 to contend that bail is not to be 

withheld as a punishment and merely because an accused is charged 

with a serious offence that by itself cannot be a reason to refuse the 

grant of anticipatory bail which is otherwise justified and though it is 

also the obligation of an applicant to make out a case for grant of 

anticipatory bail, that does not mean that he has to make out a special 

case and that a wise exercise of judicial power inevitably takes care of 

evil consequences which are likely to flow out of its intended use. 

Reference was made in this verdict relied upon on behalf of the 

respondent to the judgment of the Division Bench of the SC in 

Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v., State of Maharashtra; 2001 11 

SCC 294 which lays down that the conflicting interests are to be 

balanced while taking a decision as to the bail is to be granted or not 

and reliance was thus placed on observations in para 1 of the 

Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre's case (supra): 

"1. Leave granted. 

2. This appeal involves issues of great public 
importance pertaining to the importance of 
individual's personal liberty and the society's 
interest. 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 81 of 132 

3. The society has a vital interest in grant or 
refusal of bail because every criminal offence is 
the offence against the State. The order granting 
or refusing bail must reflect perfect balance 
between the conflicting interests, namely, sanctity 
of individual liberty and the interest of the society. 
The law of bails dovetails two conflicting interests 
namely, on the one hand, the requirements of 
shielding the society from the hazards of those 
committing crimes and potentiality of repeating 
the same crime while on bail and on the other 
hand absolute adherence of the fundamental 
principle of criminal jurisprudence regarding 
presumption of innocence of an accused until he 
is found guilty and the sanctity of individual 
liberty." 

85. 
Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondent on the 

verdict of the Apex Court in Mahant Chand Nath Yogi V. State of 

Haryana; (2003) 1 SCC 326, to contend that where the anticipatory 

bail has been granted on relevant considerations supported with 

reasons, the same cannot be set aside by holding the grant of 

anticipatory bail erroneous and merely because the submission made 

by the Public Prosector that earlier investigation made by the police 

officers and scrutinized by the superiors was faulty and mala fide, is 

not a ground to be put against an applicant. 

86. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the respondent on the 

verdict of the Division Bench of this Court in Brahmanand Gupta v. 

Delhi Administration W.P.(C) No.3337/1987 decided on 4.10.89 

whereby notification No.F-1/PS/HS/87-1227-1244 to 1433 dated 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 82 of 132 

23.2.1987 by virtue of which the Lt. Governor had appointed 

Mr.Justice M.L.Jain (Retd.) and Mr.Justice A.K.Banerjee as a 

Committee inter alia to monitor the investigation of criminal cases 

relating to criminal offence which had been committed during the riots 

which had taken place after 31.10.1984 which verdict quashed the said 

notification and vide order dated 8.2.1996 the Civil appeal filed by the 

Citizen Justice Committee and other against this verdict was dismissed 

by the Supreme Court. 

87. Reliance was also placed on observations in Brahmanand 

Gupta (Supra) on the observations of the Division Bench of this Court 

to the effect : 

"We are however, in agreement with Mr.Gupta 
that the Committee was not authorized to accept 
or act on any fresh allegations against individuals 
pertaining to the said incidents of rioting. In 
other words, whereas it was open to the 
committee to get information where there has 
been omission to register or properly investigate 
offences, the Committee had no jurisdiction to 
accept any affidavits in which fresh allegations 
were levelled for the first time, which allegations 
were not sought to be levelled at the time of or 
soon after the riots had taken place." 

88. 
and it was thus contended on behalf of the respondent that the 

setting up of the SIT vide notification dated 12.2.2016 for the 

investigation of appropriate and serious criminal cases which were 

filed in Delhi in connection with the 1984 riots which had earlier been 

investigated and closed, could not be relied upon. 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017

ANALYSIS 

89. On a consideration of the rival submissions on behalf of either 

side, it is essential to observe that the incident in relation to FIR 

227/92, Police Station Janakpuri relates to the incident dated 

1.11.1984 at 11 a.m. and the incident in relation to FIR 264/92, Police 

Station Vikaspuri relates to an occurrence of 2.11.1984 at 7 a.m. both 

the FIRs are registered on the basis of the affidavit of the same 

complainant Sh.Harvinder Singh s/o Sh. Sohan Singh dated 8.9.1985 

placed before the Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission in relation to 

which FIRs after investigation by the Special Riot Cell, the cases were 

sent untraced and the closure reports were accepted on 16.2.1996 and 

27.8.1984 respectively, both of which cases were reopened after the 

Government of India constituted the Special Investigation Team on 

12.2.2015 for investigation of the cases of the 1984 anti-sikh riots. 

90. The affidavit of the complainant did not name the respondent as 

an accused and mentions a white coloured car and another red car 

driven by some leader brand people leading the mob on 1.11.1984 at 

11 a.m. and makes no mention of the presence of any such leaders on 

2.11.1984. The statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal 

Procedure, 1973 of the complainant was recorded on 20.09.2016 in 

the Court of SDJM Dera Bassi Mohali, Punjab after constitution of the 

SIT pursuant to notification with the SIT (1984 riots having been

Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017

fires. As per this statement of the complainant under Section 164 of 

the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, after an hour he learnt that 

some Hindu brother had admitted his mother to the Rana Nursing 

Home at Rajauri Garden. He further stated that he along with his 

injured father and brother-in-law hid without food and water 

throughout the night and the next morning at 5 a.m. that old lady 

opened the lock and asked them to run away from there as the rioters

that they would kill them. As per this statement of the complainant, 

Harvinder Singh, he went to the house of Tilak Raj, who resides in 

front of his house and requested him to help them as his father"s 

condition was very bad and Tilak Raj got two bicycles arranged and 

also sent a Hindu boy with them and that he made his brother-in-law 

sit on one of the cycles and his brother-in-law tied his father to him 

i.e. the complainant with a Pagdi inasmuch as the complainant"s father 

was very seriously injured and the complainant thus sat with his 

father. He further stated that on the other cycle his brother-in-law and 

the Hindu boy took his father to Uttam Nagar which was at a distance 

of 4 to 5 km from their house but as they were crossing by the 

Congress-I office at Uttam Nagar then the rioters surrounded there and 

started beating them with Sarias. The complainant further stated that 

his brother-in-law Avtar Singh, who was coming on the other cycle 

was also surrounded by the rioters and the rioters were assaulting all 

three of them and that in the meantime a sound came from the truck 

"Aag lagakar maar do, i.e., set on fire and kill" and on hearing this he, 

i.e., the complainant started running blindly and the rioters were 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 88 of 132 

running behind him and he ran towards the Police Post, Uttam Nagar 

and requested the police personnel that his father and his brother-in-

law were being assaulted by the rioters on the road but the police did 

not help him and that he continued to cry that his father and brother-

in-law be saved, but the police personnel started abusing him, saying 

that these Sikhs had killed Indira Gandhi and thus they should be dealt 

with as they were being dealt. He further stated that he was bleeding 

profusely as he had been assaulted with the Sarias on his head and that 

four of his bones of his two arms had also got broken and that his eyes 

had also been seriously injured because of the fist blows given to him 

and that he had asked them that he be provided medical aid but he 

was not provided any medical assistance and rather the police 

personnel were spreading rumors that corpses of Hindu were coming 

in trains from Punjab and after sometime they spread another rumor 

that the Sikhs had put poison into the water tank.

requested him for medical assistance and in the meantime the Officer 

received a wireless message and thus went in his jeep from the spot 

and returned after two hours with a police bus containing 40/50 

injured Sikh men, ladies and children and then put the complainant 

and four other persons into the jeep and took them to the D.D.U 

Hospital Hari Nagar, where due the lack of doctors, nurses and other 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 89 of 132 

staff without any anesthesia he was given 14/15 stitches on his head 

and was also treated for his eyes but there was no treatment given that 

day for his broken bones. As per his statement under Section 164 of 

the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 of the complainant, the 

complainant requested the police in the hospital to leave him at his 

friend"s house at Hari Nagar but the police left him and two other 

injured persons at the Uttam Nagar, Police Post and from 7 a.m. till 5 

p.m., he remained at the Police Post, Uttam Nagar and that he could 

see from the Police Post that shops near the road were being looted 

and burnt and that the police was sitting as a silent spectator and that 

he also saw some police personnel were taking out the looted articles 

from the shop and brought them to the Police Post. As per the 

statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 

the entire day he continued to remain hungry and thirsty and injured at 

the Police post and despite his repeated requests he was given one 

glass of water and on inquiries at the Police Post, he learnt that his 

father and brother-in-law had been burnt alive and they were also not 

handed over the dead bodies of his father and brother-in-law. It was 

learnt by him subsequently that the police had burnt several dead 

bodies together.

Page 90 of 132 

bones and other injuries. Through the statement under Section 164 of 

the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the complainant stated that he 

would make an appeal to the Court that Sajjan Kumar (the respondent 

herein) and other persons who brought the crowd had killed his father 

Sohan Singh and brother-in-law Avtar Singh and had injured his 

mother and he thus sought action against them and stated that the 

massacre had taken place at the instigation of Sajjan Kumar i.e. the 

respondent herein. He also requested through the statement under 

Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 that a day-by-

day trial be given in the instant case inasmuch as 32 years had already 

elapsed and he sought that he got justice during his lifetime and 

sought the incarceration of the killers." 

95. Through his statement under Section 164 of the Code of 

Criminal Procedure, 1973 dated 20.09.2016, no specific averment in

herein, who was known to him previously, inasmuchas had come to 

his mohalla several times and as the complainant Sh. Harvinder 

Singh"s father also used to vote for the Congress and thus his family 

members also used to vote for the Congress and so he was able to 

identify Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein very well and that the 

respondent herein i.e. Sajjan Kumar was standing with the rioters and 

with the movements of his hands was telling them something and soon 

two DTC buses came and stopped near the crowd and several persons

slogans went towards the Gurudwara and started breaking the 

Gurudwara and that that time his father was the Pradhan of the 

Gurudwara and of the colony and when he reached the Gurudwara to

Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 made after Dera 

Basti Court was correct and that the Hindi translation of the same also 

was to the effect as to what he had stated in his statement under 

Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. 

101. Through his statement in FIR No.227/1992, registered with 

Police Station Janakpuri dated 23.12.2016, the complainant Sh. 

Harvinder Singh also identified the places of occurrence where he had 

seen Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein on the date of the alleged 

commission of the offence on 01.11.1984. 

102. Through his statement dated 25.10.2016 under Section 161 of 

the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the witness of the prosecution 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 96 of 132 

in FIR No. 264/94 PS Vikaapuri (name withheld at the request of the 

SIT) also stated to the effect that on 01.11.1984 at about 10.00 a.m. 

riots had commenced after the assassination of the Prime Minister 

Indira Gandhi and stated that he had seen outside his house which falls 

on the main Nazafgarh Road at different places there was smoke of 

fire and a crowd of 100-150 persons was coming shouting slogans 

towards his mohalla and two DTC buses boarded with people also

Sajjan Kumar i.e. the Congress M.P., whom he knew from before, 

who got down and went into the crowd and started talking to the

and set it on fire. He stated further that his father was the Pradhan of 

the colony and of the Gurudwara and on reaching the Gurudwara the

which the crowd followed to his house and attacked at their house also 

and set the truck bearing No. DLL 8770 standing behind their house 

on fire and also set their scooter bearing No. DLU 8150 on fire. 

103. The statement of another witness of the prosecution under 

Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (name withheld 

at the request of the SIT) dated 25.10.2016 in the FIR No. 264/92 is 

also to the effect that the respondent herein got down from the white 

car on 01.11.1984 when the crowd of rioters had collected and of his 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 97 of 132 

having pointed out to the Gurudwara as a consequence of which the 

crowd went towards the Gurudwara and caused breakage there. This 

witness also identified Sajjan Kumar i.e. the respondent herein whom 

stated that he had seen him several times. 

104. The presence of the respondent at the time of the incident on 

2.11.1984 is not mentioned in the statement under Section 164 of the 

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 of the complainant. The witnesses 

examined by the prosecution under Section 161 of the Code of 

Criminal Procedure, 1973 also speak of the presence of the respondent 

on 1.11.1984 and not on 2.11.1984. As observed by the learned ASJ-

01, Dwarka Courts all the statements have been made virtually 32 

years after the incident when for the first time the respondent is named 

as being the leader in question who got down from the white car and 

on his instigation there were attacks made on the Gurudwara and on 

Sikhs. 

105. In the circumstances of the case the observations of the learned 

ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts that the veracity of allegations levelled 

against the respondent herein can only be determined during trial 

cannot be termed to be erroneous at this stage. To the same effect are 

the observations made by this Court in Sajjan Kumar V. State in 43 

(1991) DLT 88 wherein an affidavit dated 15.7.87 of Anwar Kaur was 

taken up for consideration by the Jain Banerjee Committee appointed 

on 21.2.1987 and before that she did not make any complaint before 

the police from the date of the incident nor before the Justice 

Ranganath Mishra Commission, taking into account the factum that 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 98 of 132 

that it was contended by the investigating agency that the investigation 

could commence only after six years of the incident as the witnesses 

were afraid and frightened and would not come to testify and that if 

the respondent herein was allowed to remain enlarged on bail, (who is 

also the respondent herein to the present petition), whilst observing 

that bail not jail was the basic rule unless the process of justice was 

sought to be throttled by the applicant by influencing witnesses or 

tampering with the evidence or by creating other trouble in the shape 

of repeating offences, bail ought to be granted and anticipatory bail 

was thus granted to the very same accused arrayed as the respondent 

herein in the said case. 

106. During the course of the submissions made on behalf of the 

SIT, it was contended that this judgment had been appealed against. 

However, no orders in relation thereto have been submitted before this 

Court. 

107. To the same effect are the observations of this court, in Sajjan 

Kumar Vs. CBI in Bail application No. 306/2010 which verdict 

significantly has been upheld by the Supreme Court in Crl. M.P. No. 

6021/2010 vide verdict dated 29.03.2010 i.e. in Jagdish Kaur Vs. 

Sajjan Kumar and Ors. The verdict of the Hon"ble Supreme Court in 

Bhadresh Bipinbhai Sheth Vs. State of Gujarat and Another in (2016) 

SCC 152 also spells guidelines on the aspect of grant of cancellation 

of anticipatory bail. 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 99 of 132 

108. It is essential to observe that the verdicts relied upon on behalf 

of the petitioner are in facts and circumstances of cases, which are not 

in pari materia with the facts and circumstances of the instant case. 

109. This is so inasmuchas the verdicts relied upon on behalf of the 

petitioner are on facts distinguishable from the instant case as set forth 

hereinbelow. 

110. In Adri Dharandas vs. State of West Bengal; ( 2005) 4 SCC 

303 which has been relied upon on behalf of the SIT on the ground 

that there exist no reason to believe that the respondent may be 

arrested and that mere fear is not belief, and that it was not sufficient 

for the respondent to show that he had some sort of vague 

apprehension that someone is going make an accusation against him in 

pursuance of which he may be arrested, the available record speaks 

eloquently in the form of the petitions Crl. M.C. 339/2017 and 

Crl.M.C. 338/2017 filed by the petitioner herein seeking cancellation 

of anticipatory bail granted to the respondent herein vide orders dated 

21.12.2016 of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts in Bail Appln. Nos. 

14072/2015 and 14073/2015 which had been filed on the basis of the 

respondent having been named as an accused by the complainant and 

other witnesses 32 years after the date of incident and thus the 

contention of the respondent that he had the apprehension of his arrest 

and had a reason to believe that he could be arrested cannot be 

rejected. 

111. The verdict of the Supreme Court in Raghuvir Saran Aggarwal 

v. State of U.P.; (1988) 8 SCC 617 lays down that anticipatory bail 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 100 of 132 

ought not to be granted without any reason for exercise of such 

jurisdiction or else every person against whom a first information 

report is lodged alleging a serious crime would rush to the High Court 

or the Sessions Court that the case may be considered and may seek 

anticipatory bail which would render the provisions of the Criminal 

Procedure in the matter of arrest, redundant. As regards the 

reliance placed on this verdict which related to a case of a dowry 

death, it is essential to observe that in the instant case, the impugned 

orders dated 21.12.2016 of the learned ASJ-01 South West, Dwarka, 

categorically set forth reasons for the grant of anticipatory bail to the 

effect : 

"17. It is an admitted fact between the parties that 
the present FIR was registered in the year 1992 
on the basis of affidavit dated 09.09.1985 of 
complainant Sh.Harvinder Singh sworn before 
Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission. It is also 
an admitted fact that alleged offence pertains to 
incident dated 01.11.1984 and 02.11.1984. It is 
also an admitted fact that neither complainant 
Sh.Harvinder Singh nor any of the witnesses 
examined by the Special Riot Cell had found any 
evidence to connect the applicant with the offence 
in question. It is also an admitted fact that earlier 
investigation was closed as untraced and the 
closure report was accepted by Ld.MM on 
27.8.94/16.02.1996. It is also an admitted fact 
that from 1996 till examination of witnesses 
including the complainant in the year 2016, 
nothing incriminating had come against the 
applicant. 

18. The deposition made by complainant 
Sh.Harvinder Singh under Section 164 Cr.P.C. 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 101 of 132 

statement against applicant has been made for the 
first time after 32 years of the incident and in the 
previous affidavit dated 09.09.1985, no such 
allegations were made. 

19. Similarly, some of the witnesses (names of 
witnesses withheld at the request of Ld.Addl.PP 
for SIT) examined in 2016 under Section 161 
Cr.P.C. were also examined during the course of 
investigation in the year 1992 and at that time, 
they had not identified the applicant to be the 
person, who had incited the mob to burn down the 
property of the Sikhs or to murder them. 

20. Some of the witnesses (names of witnesses 
withheld at the request of Ld.Addl.PP for SIT), 
who have been examined under Section 161 
Cr.P.C. happen to be the relatives of the 
witnesses, who were examined in the previous 
investigation and in the previous investigation, 
their relatives had not stated anything 
incriminating against the present applicant. 
Therefore, from where these witnesses have 
derived the information regarding / the role of the 
present applicant is also a matter of trial. 

21. Some of the witnesses (names of witnesses 
withheld at the request of Ld.Addl.PP for SIT), 
who have been examined under Section 161 
Cr.P.C. in 2016 are witnesses of hear-say 
evidence regarding the role of the present 
applicant and their statements do not incriminate 
the present applicant. 

22. Although an explanation has been given by the 
complainant in his statement under Section 164 
Cr.P.C. as to why he had not named the applicant 
earlier but whether such explanation can be 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 102 of 132 

believed or not, after 32 years, is a matter of trial. 
However, some of the witnesses examined in this 
case under Section 161 Cr.P.C in 2016, have not 
provided any explanation as to why at the time of 
their earlier examination in the year 1992, they 
did not depose anything against the present 
applicant. This delay of around 24 years from the 
registration of the FIR do not make out a case for 
custodial interrogation of the applicant when 
admittedly at the time of first investigation, 
nothing incriminating had come against the 
present applicant. Nothing has come on record to 
show that applicant, during this course of 24 
years, had threatened or influenced any of the 
witnesses so as to refrain any of them from 
making statement against him. Further, applicant 
is having deep roots in the society and thrice, he 
remained as a member of the Parliament. 
Therefore, chances of applicant fleeing from 
justice are also quite remote. 

23. In the opinion of this court, for the purpose of 
interrogation of the applicant after 32 years of the 
incident, arrest of applicant is not required as 
there are no allegations that anything used in the 
commission of offence is to be recovered at the 
instance of the applicant. 

24. The submission of the Id.counsel for the 
applicant that the case, has been re-opened for 
political consideration just to falsely implicate the 
applicant also cannot be ignored and makes out a 
ground for anticipatory bail to the applicant. 

25. The judgments relied upon by the Id.counsel 
for the complainant as -well as Ld.Chief Public 
Prosecutor for State delivered in Sajjan Kumar's 
case (supra) are not applicable to the facts of the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 103 of 132 

present case as same pertain to framing of charge 
and none of these judgments relied upon, pertain 
to grant or refusal of anticipatory bail where after 
a delay of 32 years, witnesses, who had not 
deposed anything against applicant earlier have 
turned around to depose otherwise. 

26. There can be no dispute with regard to ratio 
laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India 
in the matter of Jai Prakash Singh's case (supra) 
regarding the principles for grant of anticipatory 
bail relied upon by the Id.counsel for SIT. In the 
present case also, exceptional circumstances have 
been made out for grant of anticipatory bail as 
there is prima facie material to show that the 
applicant has been falsely enroped in the crime in 
question after 32 years of the incident and his 
chance of mis-using the liberty is also non-
existent." 

112. The reliance on the verdict in Jai Prakash v. State of Bihar and 

Anr.; (2012) 4 SCC 379 is thus placed inasmuch as in the said case, it 

was observed that the FIR had been lodged promptly which itself was 

an assurance regarding truth of the informant"s version and that 

undeserved and unwarranted sympathy to an accused was shown, 

which is not so in the instant case that the parameters for grant of 

anticipatory bail had not been applied and rather undeserving and 

unwarranted sympathy had been shown to the accused and it had thus 

been laid down in the facts and circumstances of that case where the 

FIR has been lodged promptly within a period of two hours at the time 

of the incident which had occurred at midnight as mentioned in para 

11 of the verdict relied upon. 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 104 of 132 

113. The verdict in Japani Sahoo vs. Chandra Sekhar Mohanty: 

(2007) 7 SCC 394 is in a case which related to an incident of a threat 

of the payment of a demand of Rs.5,000/-was made by a police 

personnel to the respondent therein claiming that if the complainant 

did not make the payment by the next morning of Rs.5000/-he would 

be booked in cases like NDPS and dacoity whereafter the complainant 

had silently returned home and on the next day had lodged a complaint 

in question before the competent court on the advice of his lawyer and 

it was held that the criminal offence is a wrong against the State and 

the society even if committed against an individual and it was further 

held by the said verdict that normally in serious offences, prosecution 

is launched by the State and the Court of law has no power to throw 

away the prosecution solely on the ground that there has been a delay 

and that mere delay in approaching a court of law would not by itself 

afford a ground for dismissing a case although it may be a relevant 

circumstance in reaching the final verdict. In the instant case the delay 

in naming the respondent is of 32 years. In the case relied upon the 

offence was alleged to have been committed by the accused on 2.2.96 

and the complaint was filed on 5.2.96. 

114. Reliance placed by the State on the verdict of the Apex Court in 

Sajjan Kumar v. CBI, (2010) 9 SCC 368, vide which the appeal by 

the appellant therein who is the present respondent against the order of 

the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts in State Case 26/10 and appeal 

against order dated 19.7.2010 of the High Court of Delhi whereby the 

order of learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts framing charges under 

Sections 153A/295/302/395/427/436/339/505 was upheld and the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 105 of 132 

application which had been filed for discharge by the applicant, i.e., 

the respondent herein had been declined and it had been observed to 

the effect that in the said case on hand though delay may be a relevant 

ground in the light of materials which were available before the Court 

through CBI, without testing the same at trial the proceedings could 

not be quashed merely on the ground of delay is wholly inapt. In the 

instant case, the petitioner is seeking cancellation of grant of 

anticipatory bail granted to the respondent herein vide orders dated 

21.12.2016 of the learned ASJ-01, Dwarka Courts. 

115. Reliance is placed on State of Maharashtra & Ors. V. Mohd. 

Sajid Hussain, Mohd. S. Hussain; (2008) 1 SCC 213 to contend that 

even though the respondent may not have been named in the First 

Information Report as laid down in this Court by the Apex Court it 

was sufficient to observe that the FIR may not be encyclopedic and in 

the said case the accused had been absconding and had not cooperated 

with the Investigating Agency and there was also a mistake in relation 

to the age of the prosecutrix who had been allegedly raped and she 

was found to be below the age of 16 years is in facts not in pari 

materia with the instant case, inasmuchas the respondent herein is not 

absconding. 

116. In Dinesh M.N. v. State of Gujarat; ( 2008) 5 SCC 66 the order 

of grant of bail was held to be vulnerable with it having been held that 

the accused could not take a plea while applying for bail that a person 

whom he killed was a hardened criminal and this was not a factor 

which could be taken into account and irrelevant materials of a 

substantial nature having swayed the trial Court by the fact that the 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 106 of 132 

deceased had a shady representation and criminal antecedents while 

granting bail to the accused had been taken into account, the 

cancellation of anticipatory bail by the High Court of Gujarat was 

upheld by the Supreme Court observing to the effect that once it was 

concluded that when bail had been granted on untenable grounds, the 

plea of absence of supervening circumstances had no legs to stand on 

and in that case it was held that irrelevant materials had been taken 

into account and relevant materials had been kept out of consideration 

while granting bail inasmuch as the factum that the FIR had been 

lodged by one of the co-accused to divert attention from the fake 

encounter by the appellant accused, a senior police officer and other 

police officer for entering into a criminal conspiracy and causing a 

fake encounter of a hardened criminal and destroying the evidence 

relating to the death of his wife, it was held that these material factors 

had been kept out of consideration while granting bail and that even 

though the re-appreciation of the evidence as done by the Court 

granting bail is to be avoided, the Court dealing with an application 

for cancellation of bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal 

Procedure, 1973 can consider whether relevant materials were taken 

into consideration inasmuch as it was not known as to what extent the 

irrelevant materials weighed with the Court for accepting the prayer 

for bail. 

117. The verdict in State v. Anil Sharma (1997) 7 SCC 187 relied 

upon by the State held that the apprehension of the CBI that the 

respondent in that case who was the member of the legislative 

assembly of the State of HP and was also a minister of HP State 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 107 of 132 

Government for three years and a son of a former Union Minister for 

Telecommunication and the CBI was conducting an investigation of a 

case against him for an offence punishable under Section 13 (2) of the 

Prevention of Corruption relating to acquiring wealth, power in excess 

of his known sources of income and where according to CBI there 

was clear cut evidence pointing to transfer of assets to the respondent 

by his father, the contention of the CBI that the respondent"s was a 

clear case of corruption in high places and considering the responsible 

and high offices which the respondent held and wide influence which 

he could wield and the great handicap which the Investigating Officer 

would be subject to while interrogating a person armed with an order 

of anticipatory bail and the application having been dealt with by the 

High Court as if it was considering the prayer for grant of regular bail 

after the arrest, it was observed to the effect that the consideration 

which should weigh with the Court while dealing with the request for 

anticipatory bail need not be the same as an application to release on 

bail after arrest and that the High Court ought not to have side stepped 

the apprehension expressed by the CBI (that the respondent would 

influence the witnesses) as one which can be made against all accused 

persons in all cases and that the apprehension was quite reasonable 

while considering the high position which the respondent held and the 

nature of the accusation relating to the period during which he held 

such office and it was observed also in the said case that in a case of 

that kind effective interrogation of a suspected person was of 

tremendous advantage in disinterring many useful informations and 

also materials which would have been concealed and that often 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 108 of 132 

interrogations in such a condition would reduce to a mere ritual if the 

suspected person knew that he was well protected and insulated by a 

pre-arrest bail order during the time he was interrogated. The verdict 

of the High Court Madras in case titled as V.N.Sudhagaran v. 

Enforcement Officer, Enforcement Directorate, Shastri Bhawan 

Madras 1196 (2) MWM Cr 30 lays down that as a condition 

precedent for an application under Section 438 of the Code of 

Criminal Procedure, 1973, that there must be an existing reasonable 

apprehension of arrest on an existing accusation of having already 

committed a non-bailable offence prior to the point of time of filing 

the application and in that case merely because another person has 

been arrested, it was held that the applicant could not take it as a basis 

to infer arrest and in the said case it was observed that there was no 

accusation nor any reasonable apprehension of the applicant and 

where in that case where only summons were issued by the 

Enforcement Directorate to the applicant it was not proper for him to 

presume that he was an accused and at that stage no anticipatory bail 

could be granted by putting fetters and spokes in the wheels of 

investigation to render nugatory and defeat the very purpose and 

scope of FERA 1973, and that in that case there was no accusation or 

reasonable apprehension of the applicant being arrested in the non-

bailable offence and the application was thus rejected. As already 

observed herein above the factum that the petitioners seeks 

cancellation of anticipatory bail of the applicant now itself is bound to 

make the applicant apprehensive of arrest. 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 109 of 132 

118. As regards the reliance placed on behalf of the SIT on the 

verdict of the High Court of Gujarat in case titled as State of Gujarat 

Vs. Mayaben Surendrabhai Kodnani and Another 2010 Cri LJ 

1095, it is essential to observe that the FIRs in that case were 

registered on the same day when the riots and lootings had not ceased 

and it was observed by the Hon"ble High Court of Gujarat in para 16 

of the said judgment to the effect : -

"16. It could also not be disputed that members of 
the minority community were fleeing from the 
scenes of the offences and taking shelter 
elsewhere or in the relief camps set up for the riot 
affected people. The statements or complaints 
made by such victims of the riots in such 
circumstances have to be read in the context of 
the prevailing situation and the state of affairs in 
which names of prominent persons like the 
respondents were clearly alleged to have been 
omitted from their statements by the investigating 
officer and the complaints about such 
investigation had led to filing of petitions before 
the Supreme Court and ultimately the constitution 
of SIT after six petitions before the Supreme Court 
and ultimately the constitution of SIT after six 
years. Therefore, absence of important details 
about the offences or names of the respondents in 
the earlier statements or complaints made before 
the investigating agency or the lapse of time of six 
years could not by itself make the subsequent 
statements of the same witnesses contradictory or 
unreliable. However, it is not that no witness has 
ever implicated the respondents before the 
investigation by SIT. No less than six witnesses 
have mentioned the names of the respondents in 
the year 2002 itself. Therefore, the argument that 
the respondents are being implicated for the first 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 110 of 132 

time by or through the SIT cannot be accepted at 
this stage. In both the cases, there are statements 
of witnesses indicating that a huge crowd armed 
with weapons had gathered at the scene of the 
offences when the respondents had reached and 
they had incited and instigated the mob into 
attacking the area populated by minority 
community. The respondents were identified as 
operating with the mob after coming to the spot by 
particular vehicles and several victims had fallen 
to the bullets of the police, while one of the 
respondents was present. It is also alleged that the 
respondents had offered weapon or cans of 
inflammable liquid and subsequently intimidated 
some of the witnesses for removal of the name of 
one of the respondents presumably from the list of 
persons being implicated during investigation by 
the SIT. It has been clearly alleged that the names 
of the respondents were not being recorded by the 
investigating officer while earlier statements were 
: recorded in the year 2002." 

Thus it is indicated that in the said case relied upon on behalf of 

the SIT that six witnesses had mentioned the name of the accused 

persons at the time when the initial investigation was being conducted 

and much before the SIT took over the investigation. Furthermore, 

there are observations on para 7 of the said verdict that the presence of 

the accused in that case was also brought forth through the records of 

the mobile phone of the accused persons at the place and at the time of 

the occurrence. 

119. Qua reliance placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict of the 

Apex Court in the case titled as Pokar Ram Vs. State of Rajasthan 

and Others (1985) 2 SCC 597, it is essential to observe that such 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 111 of 132 

reliance was placed on behalf of the SIT on observation in para 11 of 

the said verdict to the effect: -

"11. The accusation against the respondent is 
that he has committed an offence of murder 
punishable-under Sec. 302 IPC. Surprisingly, 
when anticipatory bail was granted on 
September 30, 1983, there is not a whisper of it 
in the order of the learned Sessions Judge, 
Jodhpur. When a person is accused of a offence 
of murder by the use of a fire arm, the Court has 
to be careful and circumspect in entertaining an 
application for anticipatory bail. Relevant 
considerations are conspicuous by silence in the 
order of the learned Sessions Judge. Could it be 
said in this case that the accusation appears to 
stem not from motives of furthering the ends of 
justice but from some ulterior motive ? Could it 
be said that the object being to injure and 
humiliate the respondent by having him arrested 
? What prompted the learned Sessions Judge to 
grant anticipatory bail left us guessing and we 
arc none the wiser by the discussion in the order 
of the learned Single Judge declining to 
interfere" 

120. It is essential however to advert to the facts of this case which 

are reproduced in paras 8 & 9 of the said verdict to the effect : -

"8. The incident in which Bhanwaria was 
injured with fire arm occurred on August 23, 
1983 in respect of which the first information 
report was lodged on August 24, 1983, in which 
it was in clear and unambiguous terms alleged 
that the respondent was at the relevant time 
armed with a gun and fired towards Bhanwaria 
who suffered injuries by gun shot-The incident 
occurred as stated earlier around 4.00 P. M. On 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 112 of 132 

August 23, 1983 and this information is lodged 
with the Police Station at a distance of 30 k.m. 
from the scene of occurrence on August 24, 1983 
at 11.30 a.m. Amongst others, the offence 
registered was under Sec. 307 IPC i.e. attempt to 
commit murder. The first information report 
thus discloses use of fire arm with which the 
respondent attempted to commit murder of 
Bhanwaria. Surprisingly, the Investigating 
Officer had not arrested him till September 29, 
1983 when he moved an application for 
anticipatory bail under Sec.438 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure presumably after coming to 
know that injured Bhanwaria has succumbed to 
his injuries and the offence would one of 
murder punishable under Sec. 302 IPC. This 
conduct of the Investigating Officer left us 
guessing. Some light is shed by some averments 
from the affidavit filed in the High Court and 
extracted by the learned Judge in his judgment. 
It is stated that the respondent is the Sarpanch of 
Vil. Danwara and is an influential person and 
that his father Ranjit Singh is ex-M.L.A. and is 
at present Pradhan of the Panchayat Samiti. Are 
these relevant considerations for not cancelling 
anticipatory bail when it appears to have been 
granted by a clear misconception of the relevant 
considerations governing of anticipatory bail ? 
The answer is emphatically in the negative in 
view of the extracted observations from the 
decision of the Constitution Bench in Gurbaksh 
Singh Sibbia's case. 

9. The accusation against the respondent is that 
he has committed an offence of murder 
punishable-under Sec. 302 IPC. Surprisingly, 
when anticipatory bail was granted on 
September 30, 1983, there is not a whisper of it 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 113 of 132 

in the order of the learned Sessions Judge, 
Jodhpur. When a person is accused of a offence 
of murder by the use of a fire arm, the Court has 
to be careful and circumspect in entertaining an 
application for anticipatory bail. Relevant 
considerations are conspicuous by silence in the 
order of the learned Sessions Judge. Could it be 
said in this case that the accusation appears to 
stem not from motives of furthering the ends of 
justice but from some ulterior motive ? Could it 
be said that the object being to injure and 
humiliate the respondent by having him arrested 
? What prompted the learned Sessions Judge to 
grant anticipatory bail left us guessing and we 
arc none the wiser by the discussion in the order 
of the learned Single Judge declining to 
interfere". 

121. Reliance placed on behalf of the SIT on the verdict in the case 

titled as Harbans Kaur And Another Vs. State of Haryana (2005) 9 

SCC 195, it is essential to observe that the same is on the basis of the 

evidence led and is not in facts pari materia to the instant case 

inasmuchas in the instant case the investigation is still in progress. 

122. Reliance placed on behalf of the petitioner on the verdict of 

Supreme Court in the case titled as Prakash Kadam and Others Vs. 

Ramprasad Vishwanath Gupta and Another (2011) 6 SCC 189 is 

also on facts not in pari materia to the facts in the instant case 

inasmuchas in that case the appellants were policemen accused of 

contract killing in Case No. 317 of 2010 then pending before the 

Sessions Judge, Greater Bombay and had been charge sheeted for the 

offences punishable under Section 302/34/120B, 364/34 of the Indian 

Penal Code, 1860 and other minor offences and the prosecution case 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 114 of 132 

was that the appellants were engaged as contract killers by a private 

person to eliminate the accused. As observed vide para 20 of the said 

verdict the version of the accused therein that the accused was shot 

dead in a police encounter was found to be false during investigation 

and it was observed vide para 25 of the said verdict that prima facie 

some police officers and staff were engaged by some private persons 

to kill their opponent and the police officers and the staff acted as 

contact killers for them and it was observed further that if such police 

officers and staff could be engaged as contract killers to finish some 

person there may be very strong apprehension in the minds of the 

witnesses about their own safety and if the police officers and staff 

could kill a person at the behest of a third person, it cannot be ruled 

out that they may kill the important witnesses or their relatives or give 

threat to them at the time of trial of the case to save themselves and 

that this aspect had been completely ignored by the Sessions Judge 

while granting bail to the accused persons and thus it was held vide 

para 26 that the High Court was perfectly justified in cancelling the 

bail to the appellant accused who were police personnel and it was 

their duty to uphold the law but far from performing their duty they 

appeared to have operated as criminals and that the protectors had 

become the predators. 

123. As regards the reliance placed on behalf of the SIT on the 

verdict in Neeru Yadav v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. (Supra), it 

is essential to observe that the accused therein was a history-sheeter of 

Police Station Kavi Nagar, District Ghaziabad with 15 cases 

registered against him of which four inter alia were in relation to 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 115 of 132 

offences punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 

and two cases were punishable under Sections 307 of the Indian Penal 

Code, 1860 and three cases were in relation to Section 25 under the 

Arms Act and it was observed by the Court that the number and 

nature of crimes registered against the accused spoke voluminously 

about his antecedents. Furthermore the allegations against the accused 

in relation to whom the appellant therein sought cancellation of bail 

were found to be not in parity to the facts against the co-accused who 

was on bail and it was thus observed vide para 17 of the said verdict 

to the effect: 

" Coming to the case at hand, it is found that 
when a stand was taken that the second 
respondent was a history-sheeter, it was 
imperative on the part of the High Court to 
scrutinize every aspect and not capriciously 
record that the second respondent is entitled to 
be admitted to bail on the ground of parity. It 
can be stated with absolute certitude that it was 
not a case of parity and, therefore, the impugned 
order clearly exposes the non-application of 
mind. That apart, as a matter of fact it has been 
brought on record that the second respondent 
has been charge-sheeted in respect of number of 
other heinous offences. The High Court has 
failed to take note of the same. Therefore, the 
order has to pave the path of extinction, for its 
approval by this Court would tantamount to 
travesty of justice, and accordingly we set it 
aside." 

124. It has thus to be re-emphasized as already observed herein 

above that the verdicts relied upon on behalf of the petitioner herein 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 116 of 132 

are in facts and circumstances of the said cases not in pari materia 

with the facts and circumstances of the instant case and on the facts 

sought to be put forth in the instant case as alleged are distinguishable 

from those in the cases relied upon on behalf of the petitioner. 

125. Apart from the factum that the grounds for cancellation of bail, 

i.e., an interference or attempt to interfere in the due course of 

administration of justice, or attempt to evade the due course of justice 

or abuse of the concession granted to the accused in any manner are 

not made out against the respondent, in the facts and circumstances of 

the instant case the contentions raised on behalf of the State through 

the SIT, the petitioner, that the grant of anticipatory bail to the 

applicant vide the impugned orders in FIR No.227/1992, under 

Sections 147/148/149/295/395/307/302 and 436 of the Indian Penal 

Code, 1860, Police Station Janakpuri and FIR No.264/1992, under 

Sections 147/148/149/302/307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 Police 

Station Vikaspuri was perverse by ignoring evidence on record or 

taking into account irrelevant considerations cannot be accepted. This 

is so inasmuch as the impugned orders dated 21.12.2016 take into 

account the factum that the FIR as initially registered in both cases on 

the basis of the affidavit of the complainant did not contain a whisper 

of any allegation against the respondent regarding his participation in 

the 1984 riots in the affidavit dated 8.9.1985 sworn before the Justice 

Ranganath Mishra Commission. 

126. The impugned orders also take into account the factum that 

neither the complainant nor any of the witnesses examined by the 

Special Riot Cell had found any evidence to connect the applicant 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 117 of 132 

with the offence in question in relation to incidents dated 1.11.1984 

and 2.11.1984 and admittedly earlier investigations were closed as 

untraced and the closure reports were accepted by the Courts of the 

Metropolitan Magistrates. It was further more observed by the 

impugned orders that admittedly from 1994 till examination of the 

witnesses including the complainant in the year 2016 (an 

reference to statements recorded under Section 161 of the Code of 

Criminal Procedure, 1973) nothing incriminating had come against 

the respondent herein and that the deposition made by the complainant 

under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 had been 

made for the first time after 32 years of the incident and some of the 

witnesses who were examined in 2016 had also been examined in the 

year 1992 and at that time had not named the respondent to be the 

person who had incited the mob to burn down the properties of the 

Sikhs or to murder them. 

127. Undoubtedly a submission has been made on behalf of the State 

that some of the witnesses examined under Section 161 of the Code of 

Criminal Procedure, 1973, where statements were recorded after re-

investigation by the SIT had been never ever been examined earlier. It 

was also observed vide the impugned orders that though an 

explanation had been given in the statement under Section 164 of the 

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 as to why he had not named the 

respondent earlier, that as to whether such an explanation would be 

believed or not after 32 years was a matter of trial. It was also 

observed vide the impugned orders that some of the witnesses who 

had been examined in the year 1992 had not deposed anything against 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 118 of 132 

the respondent herein and that the delay of around 24 years from the 

registration of the FIR did not make out a case of a custodial 

interrogation of the respondent herein when admittedly at the time of 

first interrogation nothing incriminating had come against the 

respondent. It was also observed vide the impugned orders that there 

was nothing on record to show that the respondent herein during this 

course of 24 years had threatened or influenced any of the witnesses 

to refrain any of them making any statement against him and that 

further more the respondent had deep roots in society and had thrice 

been a Member of the Parliament and chances of him fleeing from 

justice were also quite remote and that there were no allegations 

against the respondent that anything used in the commission of the 

offence was to be recovered at the instance of the respondent. 

128. As observed in Sajjan Kumar v. State 43 1991 DLT 88 by this 

Court the basic rule is "bail not jail" except where there are 

circumstances suggestive of an accused fleeing from justice or 

throttling the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape 

of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like. 

129. The verdict of this Court in Sajjan Kumar V. State (Through 

CBI) in Bail application No.306/2016 dated 26.10.2010 in which the 

aspect of re-registration of FIR 250/1984, 347/1991, 307/.94 PS 

Sultanpuri and FIR 416/84 PS Delhi Cantt. was ordered on 

24.10.2005, in which the charge sheets were submitted after the case 

having been submitted untraced, in which the CBI therein had 

contended that new witnesses had come forward witnessing the 

incidents of arson and killing after the closure report had been filed 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 119 of 132 

and duly accepted by the Metropolitan Magistrate and wherein the 

accused had even been acquitted for want of evidence, it was 

contended on behalf of the accused that the fresh prosecution on the 

same facts having been launched and where the name of the accused 

had for the first time surfaced before the Jain Banerjee Committee 

which recommended registration of the case, and that some of the 

witnesses who had earlier not named the accused which showed that 

they had improved their version and that the witnesses had surfaced 

after a lapse of 25 years, it was observed by this Court that the delay 

in making the statements was required to be explained during trial and 

veracity of these witnesses had to be tested when they appear in the 

witness-box and it was held that in that case there was a delay of 25 

years from the date of incident when the prayer of the respondent 

herein seeking anticipatory bail was opposed and it was observed that 

it would not be justifiable to detain the appellant in custody after a 

lapse of 25 years of taking incident. 

130. The contention of the CBI in that case relied upon on behalf of 

the respondent herein was that the accused were involved in serious 

offences of arson, killing and rioting and the specific contentions 

raised on behalf of the CBI were to the effect: 

"26…………….………….. Petitioner Sajjan 
Kumar (i.e. the very same respondent herein) had 
organized a mob and targeted the persons of 
Sikh community; instigated the said mob to kill 
and burn the houses of members of Sikh 
community. The incident of arson, looting, 
killing of male members of Sikh community was 
perpetrated in a barbaric, inhuman and cold 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 120 of 132 

blooded manner, as a consequence whereof 
victims were isolated, felt insecure, threatened 
and at that time had no courage to go before the 
investigating agency or the court to make a 
statement against the culprits. Some of the close 
relatives of the deceased persons had migrated to 
Punjab. They had no courage to return to Delhi, 
so as to make a statement before the court or the 
investigating agency. With the passage of time 
they mustered up the courage and approached 
the Commission and filed their affidavits. All 
these years the truth was not allowed to come to 
surface which shows the pervading influence 
which the local administration had over the 
whole matter, as petitioner Sajjan Kumar was 
holding high political position. Accordingly, 
delay of 25 years in this case will be of no 
consequence." 

131. Undoubtedly, in the case relied upon on behalf of the 

respondent, the respondent had already been acquitted in the said case 

and witnesses had also been examined during trial but on re-

registration of the case during investigation some of the witnesses 

who were common in the earlier FIR again made statements 

implicating the respondent accused, i.e., respondent herein and it was 

observed by this Court that the new witnesses would have to explain 

as to why they did not come forward earlier during the trial and 

though their statements could not be brushed aside as they had to 

explain during trial as to why they did not depose against the accused 

on earlier several occasions and that 25 years had gone by and this 

delay undoubtedly tilted the balance in favour of the accused at least 

for the purpose of grant of bail to them. This Court also did not 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 121 of 132 

accept the contentions of the CBI in that case that the release of the 

accused therein, i.e. the very same respondent to the present petition, 

being enlarged on bail would hamper the fair trial and that witnesses 

may not depose against the petitioner due to fear and threat was not 

accepted by this Court, it having been observed vide para 30 thereof 

to the effect: 

"30. I do not find much force in the contentions 
of learned senior counsel that in case petitioners 
are enlarged on bail it will hamper fair trial and 
witnesses may not depose against the petitioners 
due to the fear and threat. Admittedly all along 
for the last 25 years petitioners have remained at 
large as they were not in custody. 
CBI 
conducted investigation almost for about five 
years. During this period, CBI did not deem it fit 
to arrest any of the petitioners. In spite of 
petitioners bearing at large, witnesses came 
forward and made statements before the CBI. 
There is no specific allegation against the 
petitioners of having threatened or influenced 
any of the witnesses, so as to refrain any of them 
from making statement against them. Besides 
this, it is evident from the facts narrated herein 
above that after the unfortunate and appalling 
incident that relatives of the family members of 
the victims were not left alone to fend for 
themselves 
as 
members 
of 
various 
Commission/Committees including eminent 
jurists had been visiting the affected areas and 
even met the families of the victims residing in 
camps and interacted, counselled, encouraged, 
offered support to them right from the 
beginning. 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 122 of 132 

31. Indeed, it is true, that offence with which 
petitioners have been charged by the CBI is of 
grave nature and ordinarily in such cases courts 
would be slow in admitting the accused on 
anticipatory bail, in the face of statements of eye 
witnesses. However, in the peculiar facts and 
circumstances of this case and for the reasons as 
mentioned in the preceding paras hereinabove, I 
am of the view that it would not be justifiable to 
detain the petitioners in custody, after lapse of 25 
years of incident. 

32. Accordingly, it is ordered that in the event of 
their arrest, petitioners shall be released on bail, 
subject to furnishing personal bond in the Sum 
of Rs.50,000/-each with one surety in the like 
amount to the satisfaction of Investigating 
Officer/Arresting Officer/SHO." 

132. The appeal against this order to the Supreme Court of India was 

declined in Crl.M.P. No.(S). 6021/2010 observing to the effect: 

"Heard Mr.Anil B. Divan and Mr.Ravi Shankar 
Parsad, Senior Advocates appearing for the 
petitioner. 

Permission to file SLPs is granted. 

In view of the reasons stated in the impugned 
order, we are not inclined to interfere with the 
same. We make it clear that the observation and 
conclusion arrived by the High Court are 
confined only for the disposal of the anticipatory 
bail. At the time of the trial the court concerned 
is free to decide the issue on the basis of the 
materials placed and uninfluenced by any of the 
observation made in the impugned order." 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017

133. The verdict of the Hon"ble Supreme Court in Badresh Bipinbhai 

Seth V. State of Gujarat and Anr.; (Cr.Appeal No.1134-1135/2015) 

reiterates the factors and parameters delineated by the Supreme Court 

in Siddharam Salingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra: (2011) 1 

SCC 694 which need to be taken into consideration while dealing with 

the aspect of grant or rejection of anticipatory bail as under :-

(a) The nature and gravity of the accusation and 
the exact role of the accused must be properly 
comprehended before arrest is made; 

(b) The antecedents of the applicant including the 
fact as to whether the accused has previously 
undergone imprisonment on conviction by a court 
in respect of any cognizable offence. 

(c) The possibility of the applicant to flee from 
justice; 

(d) The possibility of the accused's likelihood to 
repeat similar or other offences; 

(e) Where the accusations have been made only 
with the object of injuring or humiliating the 
applicant by arresting him or her; 

(f) Impact of grant of anticipatory bail 
particularly in cases of large magnitude affecting 
a very large number of people; 

(g) The courts must evaluate the entire available 
material against the accused very carefully. The 
court must also clearly comprehend the exact role 
of the accused in the case. The cases in which the 
accused is implicated with the help of Sections 34 
and 149 of the Penal Code, 1860 the court should 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 124 of 132 

consider with even greater care and caution, 
because over implication in the cases is a matter 
of common knowledge and concern; 

(h) While considering the prayer for grant of 
anticipatory bail, a balance has to be struck 
between two factors, namely, no prejudice should 
be caused to free, fair and full investigation, and 
there should be prevention of harassment, 
humiliation and unjustified detention of the 
accused; 

(i) The court should consider reasonable 
apprehension of tapering of the witness or 
apprehension of threat to the complainant; 

(j) Frivolity in prosecution should always be 
considered and it is only the element of 
genuineness that shall have to be considered in 
the matter of grant of bail and in the event of 
there being some doubt as to the genuineness of 
the prosecution, in the normal course of events, 
the accused is entitled to an order of bail." 

134. The following observations of the Apex Court in Badresh 

Bipinbhai Sheth (Supra) are germane and relevant to the instant 

case: 

"25.3 It is imperative for the courts to carefully 
and with meticulous precision evaluate the facts 
of the case. The discretion to grant bail must be 
exercised on the basis of the available material 
and the facts of the particular case. In cases 
where the court is of the considered view that the 
accused has joined the investigation and he is 
fully cooperating with the investigating agency 
and is not likely to abscond, in that event, 
custodial interrogation should be avoided. A great 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 125 of 132 

ignominy, humiliation and disgrace is attached to 
arrest. Arrest leads to many serious consequences 
not only for the accused but for the entire family 
and at times for the entire community. Most 
people do not make any distinction between arrest 
at a pre-conviction stage or post-conviction stage. 

25.4 There is no justification for reading 
into Section 438 CrPC the limitations mentioned 
in Section 437 CrPC. The plentitude of Section 
438 must be given its full play. There is no 
requirement that the accused must make out a 
"special case" for the exercise of the power to 
grant anticipatory bail. This virtually, reduces the 
salutary power conferred by Section 438 CrPC to 
a dead letter. A person seeking anticipatory bail is 
still a free man entitled to the presumption of 
innocence. He is willing to submit to restraints 
and conditions on his freedom, by the acceptance 
of conditions which the court may deem fit to 
impose, in consideration of the assurance that if 
arrested, he shall be enlarged on bail. 

25.5 
The proper course of action on an 
application for anticipatory bail ought to be that 
after evaluating the averments and accusations 
available on the record if the court is inclined to 
grant anticipatory bail then an interim bail be 
granted and notice be issued to the Public 
Prosecutor. After hearing the Public Prosecutor 
the court may either reject the anticipatory bail 
application or confirm the initial order of 
granting bail. The court would certainly be 
entitled to impose conditions for the grant of 
anticipatory bail. The Public Prosecutor or the 
complainant would be at liberty to move the same 
court for cancellation or modifying the conditions 
of anticipatory bail at any time if liberty granted 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 126 of 132 

by the court is misused. The anticipatory bail 
granted by the court should ordinarily be 
continued till the trial of the case. 

25.6 
It is a settled legal position that the court 
which grants the bail also has the power to cancel 
it. The discretion of grant or cancellation of bail 
can be exercised either at the instance of the 
accused, the Public Prosecutor or the 
complainant, on finding new material or 
circumstances at any point of time. 

25.7…………………………………………………… 
………………………………………………………… 
…………………………………………………………. 

25.8 Discretion vested in the court in all matters 
should be exercised with care and circumspection 
depending upon the facts and circumstances 
justifying its exercise. Similarly, the discretion 
vested with the court under Section 438 CrPC 
should also be exercised with caution and 
prudence. It is unnecessary to travel beyond it and 
subject the wide power and discretion conferred 
by the legislature to a rigorous code of self-
imposed limitations." 

CONCLUSION 

135. The available records indicate that pursuant to the impugned 

orders the respondent has made himself available for investigation and 

it has been submitted on his behalf that he shall continue to do so. 

136. On a consideration of the totality of the circumstances put forth 

it is held that presently, there are no grounds made out by the 

petitioner for cancellation of anticipatory bail granted vide orders 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 127 of 132 

dated 21.12.2016 in Bail Appln. 14072/2016 in relation to FIR 227/92 

Police Station Janakpuri and Bail Appln. 14073/2016 in relation to 

FIR No.262/92 Police Station Vikaspuri granted by the ASJ-01, 

Dwarka Courts, New Delhi. The prayer made by the petitioner to that 

extent is disallowed. 

137. However, the respondent shall not ask for a questionnaire from 

the SIT to answer to its queries during investigation, subject to 

protections enshrined under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. 

Furthermore, the respondent shall comply with all conditions imposed 

on him vide the impugned orders dated 21.12.2016 at the time of the 

grant of the anticipatory bail in FIR No.227/1992 Police Station 

Janakpuri and FIR No.264/1992 Police Station Vikaspuri. 

138. A prayer is made by the petitioner seeking expunction of 

observations made in para 24 and 26 of the impugned orders dated 

21.12.2016 which paragraphs are identical in both the impugned 

which paragraphs 24 and 26 read to the effect: 

"24. 
The submission of the ld.Counsel for 
the applicant that the case has been re-opened 
for political consideration just to falsely 
implicate the applicant also cannot be ignored 
and makes out a ground for anticipatory bail to 
the applicant. 

25. 
………. 

26. 
There can be no dispute with regard to ratio laid 
down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the matter 
of Jai Prakash Singh's case (Supra) regarding the 
principles for grant of anticipatory bail relied upon by the 
ld.cousnel for SIT. In the present case also, exceptional 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 128 of 132 

circumstances have been made out for grant of 
anticipatory bail as there is prima facie material to show 
that the applicant has been falsely enroped in the crime in 
question after 32 years of the incident and his chance of 
mis-using the liberty is also non-existent, 

139. That the High Court can in the exercise of its inherent 

jurisdiction may expunge remarks made by it or by the Court over 

which it exercises supervisory, appellate and revisional jurisdiction, if 

it be necessary to do so to prevent abuse of the process of the Court or 

otherwise to secure the ends of justice is laid down by the Hon"ble 

Supreme Court in its verdict dated 15.3.1963 in the The State of Uttar 

Pradesh v. Mohammad Naim;, AIR 1964 SC 703 which also lays 

down that this jurisdiction is of an exceptional nature and has to be 

exercised in exceptional cases only. It has also been observed by the 

Apex Court in its verdict that : 

"if there is one principle of cardinal importance in the 

administration of justice, it is this: the proper freedom and 

independence of judges and Magistrates must be maintained and 

they must be allowed to perform their functions freely and fearlessly 

and without undue interference by anybody, even by this court. At 

the same time it is equally necessary that in expressing their 

opinions judges and Magistrates must be guided by considerations 

of justice, fair play and restraint. It is not infrequent that sweeping 

generalizations defeat the very purpose for which they are made. 

It has been judicially recognized that in the matter of making 

disparaging remarks against persons or authorities whose conduct 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 129 of 132 

comes into consideration before courts of law in cases to be decided 

by them, it is relevant to consider 

(a) whether the party whose conduct is in question is before the 

court or has an opportunity of explaining or defending himself; (b) 

whether there is evidence on record bearing on that conduct 

justifying the remarks; and (c) whether it is necessary for the 

decision of the case, as an integral part thereof, to animadvert on 

that conduct. It has also been recognised that judicial 

pronouncements must be judicial in nature, and should not 

normally depart from sobriety, moderation and reserve." 

140. The ratio of these observations were referred to in 

R.K.Laxmanan v. A.K. Srinivasan and Anr.; [1976] 1 S.C.R. 204 and 

in the verdict of Apex Court in Niranjan Patnaik v. Shashibhusan 

Kar and Anr.; AIR 1986 SC 819, wherein it was observed vide 

paragraph 24 to the effect: 

"It is, therefore, settled law that harsh or 
disparaging remarks are not to be made against 
persons and authorities whose conduct comes 
into consideration before courts of law unless it 
is really necessary for the decision of the case, as 
an integral part thereof to animadvert on that 
conduct. We hold that the adverse remarks made 
against the appellant were neither justified nor 
called for.", 

whilst also adverting to the observations in Panchanan Banerji v. 

Upendra Nath Bhattacharji, A.I.R. 1927 Allahabad 193 Sulaiman, J. 

held as follows : 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 130 of 132 

"The High Court, as the supreme court of 
revision, must be deemed to have power to see 
that Courts below do not unjustly and without 
any lawful excuse take away the character of a 
party or of a witness or of a counsel before it." 

141. The verdict of the Supreme Court in Abani Kami Ray v. State 

of Orissa and Ors.; 1995(6) SCALE 41 also observes to the effect: 

"What we have said above is nothing new and is 
only a reiteration of the established norms of 
judicial propriety and restraint expected from 
everyone discharging judicial functions. Use of 
intemperate language or making disparaging 
remarks against any one unless that be the 
requirement for deciding the case, is inconsistent 
with judicial behaviours. Written words in 
judicial orders for permanent record which 
make it even more necessary to practice self-
restraint in exercise of judicial power while 
making written orders. It is helpful to recall this 
facet to remind ourselves and avoid pitfalls 
arising even from provocation." 

142. As regards the observations in para 26 of the impugned orders, 

it is essential to observe that the observations to the effect: 

"In the present case also, exceptional 
circumstances have been made out for grant of 
anticipatory bail as there is prima facie material 
to show that the applicant has been falsely 
enroped in the crime in question after 32 years 
of the incident and his chance of mis-using the 
liberty is also non-existent." 

have essentially to be expunged as without completion of 

investigation, it could not have been concluded by the learned ASJ-01, 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 131 of 132 

Dwarka Courts that there was prima facie material to show that the 

applicant, i.e., the respondent to the present petitioner, has been 

falsely enroped in the crime in question after 32 years of the incident 

and his chance of misusing the liberty was also non-existent. This is 

so inasmuch as the recommendations for the re-investigation in the 

instant cases was on the basis of the recommendations of the Justice 

G.P.Mathur Committee report whereafter vide order dated 12.2.2015 

the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs had constituted a 

Special Investigation for investigating/re-investigating the cases of the 

1984 riots and to take all such measures under the Law for a thorough 

investigation of the criminal cases and to file the charge sheet against 

the accused in the proper Court where after investigation sufficient 

evidence was found available. The SIT was constituted by the 

Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India vide No. 13018/13/-

Delhi-I (NC) dated 12.02.2015 for re-investigation of the communal 

cases which were filed in the NCT of Delhi in connection with the 

1984 riots and investigation in these cases was taken up thereafter by 

the SIT (1984 riots) a notified police station having jurisdiction over 

the whole of the NCT of Delhi by the Lt. Governor of Delhi vide 

GNCT Delhi Notification -Notification No. 6/13/2015-2129 to 2131 

dated 09.07.2015. In these circumstances, the observations in para 26 

of the impugned orders to the effect: 

"In the present case also, exceptional 
circumstances have been made out for grant of 
anticipatory bail as there is prima facie material 
to show that the applicant has been falsely 
enroped in the crime in question after 32 years 


Crl.M.C 338/2017 & 339/2017 

Page 132 of 132 

of the incident and his chance of mis-using the 
liberty is also non-existent." 

are expunged. 

143. In para 24 of the impugned orders also, which states to the 

effect i.e. the submission of the ld. Counsel for the applicant that the 

case has been re-opened for political consideration just to falsely 

implicate the applicant also cannot be ignored and makes out a ground 

for anticipatory bail to the applicant, which accepts the contention of 

the respondent herein that the cases have been re-opened for political 

consideration just to falsely implicate him and that this fact cannot be 

ignored and makes out a case of grant of bail, have essentially to be 

expunged, and are accordingly expunged as the learned Trial Court 

could not have pre-judged the issues involved. 

144. The petitions CRL.M.C. 338/2017 and CRL.M.C. 339/2017 are 

disposed of accordingly. The copies of the statements under Section 

161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 filed by the State during 

the course of submissions made are directed to be placed in a sealed 

cover as the State has requested for withholding the identities of the 

witnesses examined other than the complainant. The Case Diary 

submitted by the SIT on 12.12.2017 is hereby directed to be returned 

to the Investigating Agency, the SIT.
