JUSTICE S.P.GARG<lb/> S.P.GARG, J.<lb/></head>\n\n\t\t\t<p>1.<lb/> The instant appeals have been preferred by the appellants -<lb/>Parveen Kumar, Ramesh Chander and Ajay Kumar to challenge the legality<lb/> and correctness of a judgment dated 30.04.2014 of learned Addl. Sessions<lb/> Judge in Sessions Case No.23/2013 arising out of FIR No.88/2011 PS BHD<lb/> Nagar by which they were held guilty for committing offences punishable<lb/> under Sections 304B/498A/34 IPC. By an order dated 05.05.2014, they were<lb/> sentenced to undergo RI for ten years with fine `10,000/-each under Section<lb/> 304B/34 IPC and RI for three years with fine `2,000/-each under Section<lb/> 498A/34 IPC. Both the sentences were to operate concurrently.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>2.<lb/> Briefly stated, the prosecution case as reflected in the charge-<lb/>sheet was that Meenakshi (since deceased) was married to Ajay on<lb/> 19.04.2010. Her death took place in the matrimonial home on 16.05.2011.<lb/> In her statement (Ex.PW-3/A) Laxmi -victim&apos;s mother informed that on<lb/> 16.05.2011 at around 08.00 p.m. she got a telephone call from Ajay, her son-<lb/>in-law, informing that Meenakshi had fallen from the stairs. Before their<lb/> reaching the hospital i.e. Ortho Hospital, Gopal Nagar, Meenakshi had<lb/> already expired. She levelled allegations of harassment on account of dowry<lb/> demands against the appellants. In his statement (Ex.PW-5/A) Sunil -<lb/>victim&apos;s brother alleged that his sister used to be given beatings during her<lb/> stay in the matrimonial home.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>3.<lb/> During investigation, post-mortem examination of the body was<lb/> conducted. As per post-mortem report (Ex.PW-6/A) dated 17.05.2011<lb/> prepared by PW-6 (Dr.Pervinder Singh) external injuries numbering 19 in<lb/> all were found on the victim&apos;s various body organs, including vital ones. On<lb/> internal examination, it was observed :<lb/> &quot;(1) Peritoneal cavity contained clotted<lb/> blood.<lb/> (2) Left lobe of liver was lacerated.<lb/> (3) Effusion of blood present under the<lb/> scalp over frontal region of skull. Sub dural<lb/> and sub arachnoid haemorrhage present<lb/> over left temporal lobe of brain in an area of<lb/> 4.5 X 4.5 c.m. Contusion present over left<lb/> temporal lobe of brain in an area of 4.5 X<lb/> 4.5 c.m.&quot;<lb/> Death was opined due to haemorrhage and shock along with<lb/> cranio cerebral damage (head injury) consequent to multiple injuries<lb/> described. All the injuries were opined ante-mortem caused by hard blunt<lb/> force impact (object). These were found collectively sufficient to cause<lb/> death in the ordinary course of nature.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>4.<lb/> Upon completion of investigation, a charge-sheet was filed<lb/> against the appellants for commission of offences punishable under Sections<lb/> 498A/302/304B/34 IPC. By an order dated 15.09.2011, charge under<lb/> Sections 498A/304B/302/34 IPC was ordered to be framed against the<lb/> appellants.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>5.<lb/> Charge framed on 19.10.2011 against the appellants reads as<lb/> under :<lb/> &quot;That on or before 16.05.2011, at your<lb/> house at RZ-B 204, Gopal Nagar Delhi,<lb/> within the jurisdiction of PS Baba Haridas<lb/> Nagar, you all the accused, subjected Smt.<lb/> Meenakshi (deceased) w/o accused Ajay<lb/> Kumar, to cruelty on account of demand of<lb/> dowry and you all thereby committed an<lb/> offence punishable U/s 498A IPC read with<lb/> Section 34 IPC and within the cognizance of<lb/> this court.<lb/> Secondly on 16.05.2011 at about<lb/> 11.00 p.m., at RZ-B 204, Gopal Nagar<lb/> Delhi, within the jurisdiction of PS Baba<lb/> Haridass Nagar, Smt. Meenakshi (since<lb/> deceased) was found dead otherwise than<lb/> under normal circumstances within the span<lb/> of seven years of her marriage and soon<lb/> before her death she was subjected to<lb/> cruelty or harassment in connection with the<lb/> demands of dowry by you, in furtherance of<lb/> common intention of you all and you all<lb/> thereby committed an offence punishable<lb/> U/s 304-B/34 IPC and within the cognizance<lb/> of this court.<lb/> Or in alternative, on the aforesaid<lb/> date and place, you all, in furtherance of<lb/> your common intention committed murder of<lb/> Smt. Meenakshi (deceased) W/o accused<lb/> Ajay Kumar and thereby committed an<lb/> offence of murder punishable U/s 302/34<lb/> IPC and within the cognizance of this court.<lb/> And I hereby direct that you all be<lb/> tried for the aforesaid offences.&quot;<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>6.<lb/> To substantiate its case, the prosecution examined thirty-five<lb/> witnesses.<lb/> In 313 Cr.P.C. statements, the appellants denied their<lb/> involvement in the crime and pleaded false implication. During arguments,<lb/> learned counsel for the appellants urged that there was no demand of dowry<lb/> it being a dowry-less marriage. The deceased was suffering from various<lb/> diseases including epilepsi and menorrhagia and her death was due to<lb/> excessive bleeding. She was provided with due treatment but she did not<lb/> recover and collapsed.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>7.<lb/> By the judgment dated 30.04.2014, the learned Trial Court<lb/> found the appellants guilty for commission of offence under Sections<lb/> 498A/304B/34 IPC. By the same judgment, however, the learned Trial<lb/> Court did not give any findings about commission of offence punishable<lb/> under Section 302/34 IPC and simply &quot;dropped it&quot;. The relevant para 98 of<lb/> the conclusion reads as under :<lb/> &quot;98. From the above discussion, I am of<lb/> the opinion that prosecution has been<lb/> successful in proving that deceased died<lb/> unnatural death within seven years of her<lb/> marriage and she was being harassed and<lb/> tortured by the accused persons for demand<lb/> of dowry so soon before her death and the<lb/> presumption available to the prosecution<lb/> under section 113-B of the Indian Evidence<lb/> Act has been raised against the accused<lb/> persons which accused failed to rebut.<lb/> Therefore, the prosecution has been<lb/> successful in bring home the guilt of the<lb/> accused persons under section 498A/304-<lb/>B/34 IPC and accused persons are hereby<lb/> convicted under section 498A/304-B/34 IPC<lb/> and alternative charge under section 302/34<lb/> IPC against the accused persons is hereby<lb/> dropped. &quot;<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>8.<lb/> In my considered view, the Trial Court fell in grave error in not<lb/> returning findings on the alternative charge framed under Section 302/34<lb/> IPC. The impugned order &apos;dropping&apos; the charge under Section 302 IPC is<lb/> manifestly illegal and against the accepted procedure. No reasons<lb/> whatsoever have been given by the Trial Court for &apos;dropping&apos; the charge<lb/> under Section 302/34 IPC. It has neither convicted the appellants nor<lb/> acquitted them for commission of offence under Section 302/34 IPC.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>9.<lb/> In similar circumstances, in case &apos;Tapas Kumar Ghosh vs. State<lb/> of West Bengal&apos;, 2011 (15) SCC 354, the Trial Court had framed alternative<lb/> charge under Sections 302/34 IPC, besides charges under Sections<lb/> 498A/304B/34 IPC. Convicting the accused under Sections 498A/304B<lb/> IPC, the Trial Court specifically recorded in its judgment that the Court was<lb/> not considering the alternative charge under Section 302 IPC. The said<lb/> judgment was confirmed by the High Court, reducing the period of sentence.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>10.<lb/> Observations of the Supreme Court are relevant to note :<lb/> &quot;4. The question raised before us is that<lb/> having framed an alternative charge under<lb/> Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, the<lb/> Appellant could not have been held to be<lb/> guilty of an offence under Section 304B IPC<lb/> inasmuch as the essential ingredients of both<lb/> the offences are distinct and different. The<lb/> onus in the case of Section 304B IPC shifts<lb/> to<lb/> the<lb/> accused,<lb/> unlike<lb/> under<lb/> Section 302 IPC where the onus continues to<lb/> be on the prosecution and it is expected to<lb/> prove the case beyond any reasonable<lb/> doubt.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>5. Having examined the evidence on record,<lb/> we do not propose to deal with this legal<lb/> issue at any greater length. Suffice it to note<lb/> that no prejudice had been caused to the<lb/> present Appellant inasmuch as the trial<lb/> court neither considered the alternative<lb/> charge nor punished the accused for that<lb/> offence. Thus, we leave this question open.&quot;<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>11.<lb/> This Court in &apos;Prakash Chander vs. The State&apos;, 1995 Crl.L.J.<lb/> 368 had the occasion to deal with such a situation. In that proceedings also,<lb/> the accused persons therein were charged for the offence under Section 302<lb/> IPC read with Section 34 IPC for intentionally or knowingly in furtherance<lb/> of their common intention causing the death of one Swaran Kanta. In the<lb/> alternative, they were charged for the offence of dowry death punishable<lb/> under Section 304 B IPC. The learned Addl. Sessions Judge acquitted Pyare<lb/> Lal, Usha, Praveen Kumar and Lila Wanti of the charge under Sections<lb/> 302/34 IPC. Prakash Chander was, however, found guilty of offence of<lb/> murder of his wife and was convicted under Section 302 IPC modifying the<lb/> charge from Section 302/34 IPC to Section 302 IPC. The alternative charge<lb/> under Section 304B IPC against Lila Wanti was modified and she was<lb/> convicted under Section 498A IPC. Regarding Prakash Chander, the learned<lb/> Addl. Sessions Judge held that the &apos;alternative charge did not survive and it<lb/> was cancelled&apos;.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>12.<lb/> This Court observed :<lb/> &quot;26. Our aforesaid conclusion on offence<lb/> under section 302 IPC, however, does not<lb/> conclude the entire matter as there was also<lb/> an alternate charge against accused<lb/> Prakash Chand and other accused for<lb/> having caused death of Mrs. Swaran Kanta<lb/> by burn or otherwise than normal<lb/> circumstances, within seven years of her<lb/> marriage and they having subjected her to<lb/> cruelty and harassment for and in<lb/> connection with demand of dowry and<lb/> thereby having committed an offence of<lb/> &quot;Dowry<lb/> Death&quot;<lb/> punishable<lb/> under<lb/> Section 304-B IPC.<lb/> 27. On charge under section 304B, learned<lb/> Additional Sessions Judge has held that &quot;it<lb/> does not survive and it is cancelled.&quot;<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>28. On the aspect of offence under<lb/> section 304B, IPC, the questions which fall<lb/> for determination are :-<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>1. Whether the order cancelling charge<lb/> under section 304-B IPC is legal ?<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>2. If answer to question No. 1 is in negative,<lb/> does the cancellation of charge on the facts<lb/> and circumstances of the case, amount to an<lb/> order of acquittal and, if so, what is the<lb/> effect of State not having filed an appeal ?<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>3. Whether evidence establishes or not the<lb/> commission of offence under section 304-B,<lb/> IPC by the accused Prakash Chander ?<lb/> 29. Cancellation of the charge after the<lb/> evidence has been led is unknown to the<lb/> criminal jurisprudence. Before a charge is<lb/> framed an accused may be discharged if the<lb/> facts and circumstances so justify. After the<lb/> charge is framed the accused has either to<lb/> be found guilty or not guilty of the charge.<lb/> Mr. Sud also did not dispute that the order<lb/> cancelling the charge is not legal. The<lb/> learned trial court committed manifest error<lb/> by holding that the alternate charge does<lb/> not survive and is cancelled. The first<lb/> question is, Therefore, answered in<lb/> negative.&quot;<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>13.<lb/> This Court further held :<lb/> &quot;38. The present case, in our view, is on<lb/> much stronger footing. The accused has not<lb/> been<lb/> acquitted<lb/> of<lb/> offence<lb/> under<lb/> section 304B, IPC but only charge has been<lb/> cancelled which is not permissible in law.<lb/> That does not, on the facts and<lb/> circumstances of the case as already noticed<lb/> above, amount to acquittal. Assuming,<lb/> however, that tantamounts to an implied<lb/> acquittal, it would only show that the said<lb/> acquittal was for the reason that he was held<lb/> guilty of the main offence of murder and not<lb/> independently. Our conclusion that in view<lb/> of two reasonable views it would not be safe<lb/> to hold Prakash Chander guilty of offence<lb/> under section 302 IPC, is not an impediment<lb/> for his conviction under section 304-B, IPC.<lb/> In our view the point in issue is squarely<lb/> covered by Kalawati&apos;s case.<lb/> XXXX<lb/> XXXX<lb/> XXXX<lb/> 40. The High Court cannot be a silent<lb/> spectator when it finds that the trial court<lb/> has committed a manifest error and has a<lb/> duty to correct the said error. That manifest<lb/> error is the order for cancellation of a<lb/> charge under section 304B, IPC. The<lb/> interest of the accused is, of course,<lb/> paramount but at the same time the court<lb/> has also to keep in view the compelling<lb/> public interest to see that because of a<lb/> manifest error the administration of<lb/> criminal jurisprudence is not reduced to<lb/> total ineffectiveness which will breed<lb/> dissatisfaction amongst the public. Like all<lb/> procedural laws Code of Criminal<lb/> Procedure is also designed to subserve the<lb/> ends of justice and not to frustrate them by<lb/> mere technicalities. Viewed from this angle<lb/> too it would be our duly to find out whether<lb/> the accused is guilty of the charge under<lb/> section 304B, IPC or not.<lb/> XXXX<lb/> XXXX<lb/> XXXX<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>43. We also find that Sections 302 and 304B,<lb/> IPC are not mutually exclusive. If in a case<lb/> material on record suggest commission of<lb/> offence under section 302, IPC and also<lb/> commission of offence under Section 304B,<lb/> IPC, the proper course would be to frame<lb/> charges under both these sections and if the<lb/> case is established then accused can be<lb/> convicted under both the sections but no<lb/> separate sentence need be awarded under<lb/> section 304B, in view substantive sentence<lb/> being awarded for the higher offence under<lb/> Section 302, IPC. In the present case though<lb/> court rightly framed charge also under<lb/> section 304B, IPC and also in the course of<lb/> judgment came to the conclusion that<lb/> cruelty, demand of dowry and death within<lb/> seven years of marriage had been<lb/> established but ultimately proceeded to<lb/> cancel the challan on the wrong assumption<lb/> that the two offences are mutually exclusive.<lb/> In the facts and circumstances of the case<lb/> we do not think that any prejudice would be<lb/> caused to the accused by examination of the<lb/> case from the point of view of offence under<lb/> section 304-B, IPC. In our view the learned<lb/> Additional Sessions Judge, for the<lb/> conclusion reached by him, after holding<lb/> Prakash Chander guilty of offence under<lb/> section 304B need not have awarded any<lb/> separate sentence in respect of the said<lb/> offence.<lb/> 44. In view of aforesaid discussion our<lb/> answer to the second question is that<lb/> cancellation of charge for offence under<lb/> Section 304-B, IPC does not amount to an<lb/> order of acquittal and the setting aside of<lb/> the order of conviction for the offence under<lb/> Section 302, IPC is not an impediment in<lb/> this court examining whether commission of<lb/> offence under section 304-B, IPC stands<lb/> established or not. The State not having filed<lb/> any appeal against the order cancelling<lb/> charge is of no effect.&quot;<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>14.<lb/> In the instant case, a prejudice has been caused by not giving<lb/> any finding on the alternative charge framed under Sections 302/34 IPC. It<lb/> deprived the State to take any steps in challenging &apos;acquittal&apos; under Section<lb/> 302 IPC. In case of conviction under Sections 302/34 IPC, it would have<lb/> given a right to the appellants to challenge conviction under Sections 302/34<lb/> IPC before the Division Bench of this Court. It was imperative for the Trial<lb/> Court to give a positive finding whether the prosecution was able to<lb/> establish the commission of the offence under Sections 302/34 IPC or not.<lb/> The impugned judgment merely &apos;dropping&apos; the charge under Section 302/34<lb/> IPC, thus, cannot be sustained.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>15.<lb/> In the light of above discussion without commenting upon the<lb/> findings recorded under Sections 304B/34 IPC, the matter is sent back to the<lb/> Trial Court for disposal on merits and to give findings on the alternative<lb/> charge framed under Sections 302/34 IPC too.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>16.<lb/> The appeals stand disposed of accordingly. The appellants (if<lb/> in custody) shall be produced before the Trial Court on 28.02.2017.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>17.<lb/> Trial Court record be sent back forthwith with the copy of the<lb/> order.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>18.<lb/> Copy of the order be sent to Superintendent Jail for<lb/> information.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>19.<lb/> Observation in the order shall have no impact on the merits of<lb/> the case.<lb/></p>\n\n\t\t\t<head>(S.P.GARG)<lb/> JUDGE<lb/> FEBRUARY 20, 2017 / tr</head>\n\n\n\t</text>\n</tei>\n"
