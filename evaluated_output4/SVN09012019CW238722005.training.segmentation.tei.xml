The Petitioner was recruited as Sub-Inspector in Railway Protection <lb/>Special Force on 20 th March, 1979.

			<body>diagnosed with gall bladder stones and was referred to the Northern Railway <lb/>Hospital, New Delhi, where he was advised to undergo surgery for the <lb/>aforesaid illness. The Petitioner was hesitant to undergo surgery and opted <lb/>for Ayurvedic and Unani treatment. <lb/>3. The aforesaid modes of treatment being time consuming, the Petitioner <lb/>accordingly filed an application dated 18 th April, 1992, seeking sanction of <lb/>75 days leave w.e.f. 25 th April, 1992. This request was accepted vide order <lb/>dated 14 th May, 1992, and accordingly he was sanctioned leave for a period <lb/>of 75 days w.e.f. 1 st June, 1992. A movement order dated 1 st June, 1992 was <lb/>issued to the Petitioner to move to Danapur. Petitioner requested for an <lb/>extension of leave by 90 days, which was allowed for 45 days LWOP <lb/>(Leave Without Pay) by the competent authority w.e.f. 16 th August, 1992 to <lb/>29 th September, 1992. On 30 th September, 1992, Petitioner applied for a <lb/>further extension of 45 days LWOP, however, his request was not acceded <lb/>to as he had already availed maximum permissible leave of 120 days. <lb/>4. The letter rejecting his request for grant of further extension reads as <lb/>under:-<lb/>&quot;Shri. Raj Vir Singh, <lb/>Inspector, <lb/>Quarter No. A-602 <lb/>Sector No. 19, <lb/>Noida Ghaziabad (U.P) <lb/>Sub: Extension of Leave. <lb/>Ref: Your Application dated 01.10.1992. <lb/></body>

			<body>With reference to your application dated 01.10.92, <lb/>requesting for further grant of extension of 45 days leave on <lb/>the ground of your treatment, you are hereby informed that <lb/>no further extension of leave is admissible, because you <lb/>have already been given the maximum leave (120 days) <lb/>permissible at a time, in one case, as per extant rules. <lb/>However, you are directed to report to the nearest <lb/>Rly. Doctor for proper treatment of the reported disease <lb/>of &apos;Gall Bladder Stone&apos;. <lb/>Necessary intimation be also sent to this office, <lb/>accordingly.&quot; <lb/>5. Thereafter, despite a lapse of 50 days Petitioner did not comply with <lb/>directions as noted in the aforesaid letter, constraining the Respondents to <lb/>issue a reminder dated 8 th December, 1992, which reads as under:-<lb/>&quot;To <lb/>Shri. Raj Vir Singh, Inspector, <lb/>Quarter No. A-602 <lb/>Sector No. 19, Noida Ghaziabad (U.P) <lb/>Sub: Extension of Leave. <lb/>Ref: Your Application dated 01.10.1992. <lb/>.......xxx........ <lb/>Your extension of leave was rejected by this office vide <lb/>registered A/D Letter of even No. (3710) dated 17.10.92 <lb/>with the direction that if you are not well then report to <lb/>nearest Rly.

The aforesaid letters were delivered to the Petitioner and he <lb/>acknowledged the receipt thereof. Petitioner ignored the warning given in <lb/>the aforesaid letter and neglected to join duty and overstayed beyond <lb/>sanctioned leave. As a result, Respondents issued a charge sheet on 5 th <lb/>March, 1993, inter-alia containing the followings charges:-<lb/>&quot;ARTICLES OF CHARGES:-<lb/>Inspector /5029 Raj Vir Singh of &apos;E&apos; Coy, No.6BNIRPSF is <lb/>hereby charged for unauthorisedly overstaying, disobedience of <lb/>lawful orders and utter carelessness, in that he is overstaying <lb/>unauthorisedly wef.30.9.92 after availing from BN/HQr. his <lb/>sanctioned 120-days leave/Extension as granted wef.02.06.92 to <lb/>29.06.92. He had applied for further extension of 45-days leave, <lb/>which was not granted and he was instructed by an intimation <lb/>sent at his home address by post, to report to Rly. Doctor. This <lb/>letter was acknowledged by him on 23.10.92.

			<body>September, 1994, which holds the Petitioner guilty of the aforementioned <lb/>charge. The enquiry report was examined and accepted by the Disciplinary <lb/>Authority and resultantly vide order dated 2 nd December, 1994 Petitioner <lb/>was awarded punishment of dismissal from service w.e.f. 2 nd December, <lb/>1994. <lb/>8. The Petitioner preferred an appeal to Director General (DG) against the <lb/>order of dismissal. The appeal was allowed on 10 th October, 1995 on the <lb/>ground that the enquiry report was not served upon the Petitioner, before <lb/>imposing the punishment. Accordingly, a direction was given that the <lb/>Petitioner be reinstated in service and the enquiry report be served upon him <lb/>affording him an opportunity to make representation, if any, within a <lb/>stipulated time. The Disciplinary Authority was further directed to record <lb/>its findings afresh and pass the final orders after consideration of the enquiry <lb/>report and the representation of the Petitioner. In compliance of the <lb/>aforesaid order passed by the Appellate Authority, the Petitioner was <lb/>reinstated in service from 14 th November, 1995 and he joined duty on 16 th <lb/>September, 1996. The enquiry proceedings were reopened and a copy of the <lb/>enquiry report was furnished to the Petitioner. He submitted a representation <lb/>on the enquiry report and on its consideration, the Disciplinary Authority <lb/>vide order dated 30 th September, 1997 awarded the punishment of dismissal <lb/>from service. He preferred an appeal to DG/RPF which was rejected vide <lb/>order dated 23 rd April, 1998. Petitioner thereafter filed a revision petition <lb/>before the Central Government of India against the order passed by the <lb/>Appellate Authority. The Central Government of India, vide order dated <lb/>27 th January, 1999 modified the penalty of dismissal from service to <lb/></body>

			<body>&quot;compulsory retirement&quot;. The order passed by the Central Government was <lb/>given effect to by the Respondent vide order dated 18 th June, 2003 by <lb/>striking off Petitioner&apos;s name from its strength w.e.f. 30 th September, 1997. <lb/>The Petitioner filed a Review Petition dated 24 th August, 1999 before <lb/>Hon&quot;ble President of India followed by reminders seeking its disposal. <lb/>Petitioner&apos;s request for review was rejected by the competent authority. <lb/>9. Compulsory retirement from service entailed grant of retiral benefits to <lb/>the Petitioner and in order to process the payments, Petitioner was requested <lb/>to submit the relevant documents. He submitted an application for <lb/>regularization of &quot;overstay period&quot; and also the &quot;intervening period&quot;. The <lb/>Railway Board partly allowed the request vide order dated 3 rd January, 2004 <lb/>and regularized the &quot;intervening period&quot; from 3 rd January, 1995 to 16 th <lb/>September, 1996 (i.e. from the date of dismissal to reinstatement in service) <lb/>as period spent on duty. The regularization for the overstay period was <lb/>declined. Petitioner was called upon to submit the required documents for <lb/>furnishing the final settlement, but for the reasons best known to him, he did <lb/>not do so. Petitioner has assailed the aforenoted orders in the present <lb/>petition. <lb/>Submissions of the Parties <lb/>10. Learned counsel for the Petitioner has primarily challenged the <lb/>impugned orders on the ground that the Enquiry Officer has proceeded on an <lb/>incorrect premise, inasmuch as the relevant provisions of Indian Railway <lb/>Medical Manual have not been taken into consideration. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">WP(C) No. 23872/2005 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 7 of 30 <lb/></page>

			<body>11. According to the Petitioner, Rule 541(3) of the Indian Railway Medical <lb/>Manual (IRMM) is applicable to his case and the Enquiry Officer as well as <lb/>the Appellate Authorities have proceeded to wrongly apply Rule 541 of the <lb/>IRMM. He further relied upon Rule 530 of the IRMM and urged that the <lb/>aforesaid provision does not require any application to be made in the event <lb/>that the leave was exhausted and there is no discussion by the Respondent as <lb/>to why the request for further leave was not granted. <lb/>12. The learned counsel also argued that the Respondents had acted <lb/>malafidely against the Petitioner. He submitted that the Petitioner was <lb/>directed to join duty at New Jalpaiguri (NJP) vide order dated 14 th <lb/>November, 1995 and this action was in violation of Rule 153.4 of the <lb/>Railway Protection Force Rules, which prohibits transfer of an employee <lb/>pendente inquisitionis. To buttress the aforesaid submission, he pointed out <lb/>certain observations made in the enquiry report. Learned counsel has also <lb/>argued that the punishment awarded by Respondent is disproportionate to <lb/>the allegations of misconduct. He stated that Respondents did not issue a <lb/>duty pass to enable the Petitioner to go to NJP and thereby caused delay in <lb/>his joining at NJP. The duty pass was issued on 3 rd September, 1996 <lb/>enabling the petitioner to join on 16 th September, 1996. <lb/>13. The learned counsel for the Petitioner further argued that the Petitioner <lb/>should have been granted extraordinary leave, which is admissible as per the <lb/>Rules, in the event no other leave is admissible. According to him, the <lb/>Disciplinary Authority in its order dated 30 th September, 1997 takes note of <lb/>the aforesaid provision, but has wrongly denied the benefit of the same on a <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 8 of 30 <lb/></page>

			<body>flimsy ground that the medical certificate submitted by the Charged Officer <lb/>did not inspire confidence and denied the leave. <lb/>14. He also submitted that, the Disciplinary Authority in its order dated 30 th <lb/>September, 1997, while recording that the Charged Officer remained <lb/>&quot;unauthorisedly absent&quot; does not hold him to be absent &quot;without sufficient <lb/>reason&quot;. The finding of intentional disobedience of the orders of the <lb/>superior officers is also incorrect, inasmuch as the Petitioner had sent a letter <lb/>dated 30 th September, 1992 seeking extension of leave. Relying on the <lb/>aforesaid letter, the counsel submitted that the authority while issuing the <lb/>letter dated 17 th October, 1992, knew about Petitioner&quot;s continued sickness, <lb/>hence, without considering the two PMC&quot;s submitted by the Petitioner, <lb/>Respondents have wrongly rejected his request. Counsel for the Petitioner <lb/>points that, Respondents failed to take note of Rule 539(2) of the IRMM, in <lb/>as much as the enquiry report records that the Charged Officer had <lb/>submitted two PMCs for the period from 28 th September, 1992 to 19 th April, <lb/>1993, covering a period of 50 days, yet they have not taken any decision on <lb/>this issue and not rejected the said certificates. In absence of rejection of <lb/>PMC, Respondents have acted in a malafide manner by not allowing the <lb/>Petitioner to join the service, in violation of Rule 541 (3) of the IRMM. He <lb/>further submitted that the doctor who had given the certificate was a medical <lb/>practitioner registered with UP Medical Council having a valid registration <lb/>number and there was no reason to disbelieve the said certificate. <lb/>15. Per contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent has <lb/>argued that the Petitioner is misconstruing the rules in the Medical Manual. <lb/></body>

			<body>Learned counsel also referred to the order dated 4 th April, 2016 passed <lb/>by this Court, requiring the Respondents to produce the fitness <lb/>certificate dated 15 th March, 1993 referred to in para 21 of the legal <lb/>notice dated 13 th April, 2004 issued by the Petitioner&apos;s counsel. <lb/>16. Learned counsel for the Respondent urged that it can been clearly <lb/>discerned from the fitness certificate dated 14 th /15 th March, 1993 that it had <lb/>not been issued by a Railway Doctor and it also did not bear the address of <lb/>the doctor certifying the said certificate. <lb/>Analysis and Findings <lb/>17. The key question that arises for consideration in the present appeal is <lb/>with respect to the applicability of the rules provided in IRMM. It would <lb/>therefore be apposite to note the said rules, before proceeding to deal with <lb/>the rival submissions of the parties on this issue. The relevant Rules read as <lb/>under:-<lb/>&quot;537. The different types of certificates that are issued by the <lb/>Railway doctors in the event of sickness of a Railway <lb/>employee are as under:-<lb/>(1) Sick certificate. <lb/>(2) Continuation sick certificate. <lb/>(3) Certificate of recommendation for change of air or <lb/>recuperation. <lb/>(4) Fit certificate. <lb/>(5) Duty fit certificate. <lb/>(6) Invalidation certificate. <lb/></body>

			<body>538. Sick certificate:-<lb/>(1) When a railway employee, who is residing within the <lb/>jurisdiction of a Railway doctor, is unable to attend duty by <lb/>reason of sickness, he must produce, within 48 hours, a sick <lb/>certificate from the competent Railway doctor in the prescribed <lb/>form as given in annexure XI to this chapter. <lb/>(2) Should a Railway employee, residing within the jurisdiction <lb/>of the Railway doctor, desire to be attended by a non-Railway <lb/>doctor of his own choice, it is not incumbent on him to place <lb/>himself under the treatment of the Railway doctor. It is however <lb/>essential that if leave of absence is required on medical <lb/>certificate, a request for such leave should be supported by a sick <lb/>certificate from the Railway doctor. <lb/>(3) Sick certificate may be issued by the Railway doctor of the <lb/>section in which the Railway employee resides for the time <lb/>being. <lb/>(4) When a Railway employee residing outside the jurisdiction of <lb/>a Railway doctor requires leave on medical certificate, he should <lb/>submit, within 48 hours, a sick certificate from a registered <lb/>medical practitioner. Such certificate should be, as nearly as <lb/>possible, in the prescribed form as given in the annexure XI and <lb/>should state the nature of the illness and the period for which the <lb/>Railway employee is likely to be unable to perform his duties. <lb/>The competent authority may, at it&apos;s discretion accept the <lb/>certificate or, in cases where it has reasons to doubt the <lb/>bonafides, refer the case to the Authorised Medical Officer for <lb/>advice or investigation. The medical certificates from the <lb/>Registered private practitioners produced by the employee in <lb/>support of their applications for leave may be rejected by the <lb/>competent authority only after a Railway medical officer has <lb/>conducted the necessary verifications and on the basis of the <lb/>advice tendered by him after such verifications. However, where <lb/>the Railway medial officer could not be deputed for such <lb/>verifications, the certificate from the registered private medical <lb/>practitioner may be accepted straightaway. <lb/></body>

			<body>Note :-(i) Ordinarily, the jurisdiction of a Railway doctor will be <lb/>taken to cover Railway employees residing within a radius of 2.5 <lb/>K.M of railway hospital or health unit to which the doctor is <lb/>attached, and within a radius of one kilometer of a Railway <lb/>station of the doctor&apos;s line jurisdiction. <lb/>(ii) To prevent misuse of private medical certificates, the <lb/>Divisional Railway Managers may withdraw the privilege as <lb/>given in the concluding portion of the above sub-paragraph by <lb/>special notification to the staff for special periods. In respect of <lb/>workshop employees, the power to withdraw the privilege of <lb/>acceptance of certificates from registered private practitioners <lb/>shall be exercised by the administrative officers in J.A.G and S.A <lb/>Grades. <lb/>(5) When issuing the certificates, Railway doctors will exercise <lb/>care and judgement in recommending the period of absence for <lb/>which the Railway employee is unable to attend duty which <lb/>should be commensurate with the nature and severity of illness. <lb/>(6) The submission of sick certificate as prescribed in sub-<lb/>para(1) to (5) above shall be tantamount to only an application <lb/>for leave on medical certificate, and shall not be held to carry <lb/>with it permission to quit the station, unless such permission is <lb/>expressly given by the competent Railway doctor. <lb/>Note:-(1)A Railway employee who is placed on sick list by a <lb/>Railway doctor should continue to report to him when fit to <lb/>travel, or send intimation about his condition if he is bed-ridden, <lb/>at such intervals as directed by the Railway doctor. If a Railway <lb/>employee fails to do so, he is liable to be discharged from sick <lb/>list for non-attendance. <lb/>(2) Special provisions for members of Railway Protection <lb/>Force reporting Sick: <lb/>No member of the Force shall be taken on sick list by any <lb/></body>

However, in case there is any delay beyond 24 hours in <lb/>obtaining a fitness certificate from the competent Railway <lb/>medical officer, the employee concerned will be deemed to have <lb/>been put back to duty within 24 hours of his producing the <lb/>medical certificate from the private medical officer. <lb/>(4) When a Railway employee reports sick away from his/her <lb/>head quarters, the local Railway doctor will, if he considers that <lb/>the Railway employee is sick and unfit to work, issue a sick <lb/>certificate, but as soon as the employee is fit to travel, issue a <lb/>transfer memo and transfer him/her to his/her head quarter <lb/>station and forward the case papers to the Railway doctor at the <lb/>headquarters station for further action. In the case of relieving <lb/>staff whose sickness is likely to be of less than ten days duration, <lb/>the local railway doctor may return the employee to duty issuing <lb/>fit certificate in his favour. <lb/>Note:-Both sick and fit certificates should have the same <lb/>counter-foil and should bear the same number. Serial numbers <lb/>should be printed.&quot; <lb/>18. A perusal of the aforesaid Rules clearly indicates that the Respondents <lb/>have specific Rules dealing with the concept of leave of absence on <lb/>medical certificate. <lb/></body>

			<body>19. Rule 538 (2) of IRMM provides that, in case a railway employee <lb/>residing within the jurisdiction of a railway doctor wants to be attended by a <lb/>non-railway doctor of his own choice, it is not incumbent upon him to be <lb/>treated by the railway doctor. In such a situation it is essential for the <lb/>railway employee who desires to take leave of absence on medical <lb/>certificate, to make such a request along with a sick certificate from the <lb/>railway doctor. Rule 538 (4) of IRMM, deals with a situation where the <lb/>railway employee is residing outside the jurisdiction of railway doctor and <lb/>requires leave on medical certificate. Rule 539 deals with continuation <lb/>sick certificate. This Rule provides for the procedure where a railway <lb/>employee who is on leave on medical certificate, is desirous of seeking <lb/>further extension of leave. <lb/>20. Rule 541 (1) of IRMM provides that railway employee who has been <lb/>on leave on medical certificate shall not be permitted to resume duty till he <lb/>or she has produced a &apos;fit certificate&apos; in the prescribed form from a <lb/>competent railway doctor. Rule 541 (3) of the IRMM provides a remedy for <lb/>a railway employee who was on leave on medical ground for upto three days <lb/>and resumes duty with a fitness certificate from a medical practitioner. The <lb/>second part of Sub-Rule 3 of Rule 541 deals with a situation where the <lb/>duration of sickness is more than three days. <lb/>21. Learned counsel for the Petitioner has made lengthy arguments and <lb/>painstakingly, urged before this Court that Rule 541 (3) of IRMM is <lb/>applicable and that the Petitioner should be considered to have resumed his <lb/></body>

			<body>duty on 15 th March, 1993, on the strength of the fitness certificate issued by a <lb/>private medical practitioner. Learned counsel for the Petitioner strenuously <lb/>argued that the fitness certificate submitted by the Petitioner was sufficient <lb/>compliance of the IRMM Rules and on submission of the fitness certificate, <lb/>Respondents ought to have proceeded to verify the certificate. In the event <lb/>of delay of verification, the Petitioner should have been deemed to have <lb/>been put back to duty within 24 hours of his producing the medical <lb/>certificate from a private medical officer. <lb/>22. In the instant case, it is worth noting that the Petitioner made a request <lb/>vide letter dated 18 th April, 1992 for sanction of 75 days leave. The said <lb/>request reads as under:-<lb/>&quot;No.6BN/B/PF/lnsp-ACC-RVS/921 <lb/>Dated;.18.04.92. <lb/>To <lb/>The Commandant, <lb/>No.6BN/RPSF/DBSI/Delhi-35. <lb/>Through <lb/>the Assistant Commandant-I, 6BN/RPSF/DBSI/Delhi-35. <lb/>Sub:-75 days LAP + LHAP + LWOP application <lb/>ofInsp/ACC <lb/>Raj Vir Singh ofB.Coy. 6BN/RPSF/DBSI/DLI-35. <lb/>********** <lb/>An application with request for sanction of 75 days LAP + <lb/>LHAP + LOWP of theundersigned for self treatment is <lb/></body>

			<body>being sent herewith for favour of your kind information and <lb/>further n/a please. <lb/>Submitted please. <lb/>D.A/One. <lb/>Sd/-dated. 18.4.92. <lb/>( R. V. Singh ) <lb/>Coy. Commander <lb/>6BN/RPSF/B.Coy., <lb/>DBSI/Delhi-35.&quot; <lb/>23. It is therefore clearly evident that by making a request for sanction of <lb/>leave, Petitioner did not obtain a sick certificate under Rule 538 (2) or 538 <lb/>(4) of IRMM. The request as noted above was not on the basis of a sick <lb/>certificate and could not therefore be classified as leave on medical <lb/>certificate. This request for grant of leave was acceded to and sanctioned <lb/>by the Respondent on 14 th May, 1992 which also clearly provides that the <lb/>sanction of leave is as LAP and LWOP. This is evident from the text of the <lb/>sanctioned letter that reads as under:-<lb/>No.6BNIPF I ACC-RVS/9211606 <lb/>Dated. 14.5.92. <lb/>To <lb/>IPF/HQr, <lb/>6BN/RPSF, <lb/>Dayabasti, Delhi-35. <lb/>Sub :-Inspector I ACC Raj Vir Singh of &apos;B&apos; Coy. <lb/></body>

Therefore, it clearly emerges that the leave was not sanctioned as leave <lb/>on medical certificate. Furthermore, extension of 45 days LWOP was <lb/>granted on 16 th August, 1992 and the same was to expire on 30 th September, <lb/>1992. It is also significant to note that no request was made for grant of <lb/>Extraordinary Leave initially or at the time of extension or at any stage <lb/>thereafter. <lb/>25. Apparently, Petitioner applied for further extension on 29 th September, <lb/>1992. This request was rejected vide letter dated 17 th October, 1992. As <lb/>noted above in the said letter, Petitioner was further called upon to report to <lb/>the nearest railway doctor for private treatment of the reported disease of <lb/>&quot;gall bladder stone&quot;. Petitioner did not do so and also did not make any <lb/></body>

			<body>further effort to send any intimation to the Respondent about his inability to <lb/>resume his duty. <lb/>26. A further reminder was sent by the Respondent on 8 th December, 1992 <lb/>but Petitioner failed to take any corrective steps. He neither reported to the <lb/>doctor nor resumed his duty. On 5 th March, 1993, a charge sheet was issued <lb/>against the Petitioner. Thereafter, Petitioner approached the Respondent <lb/>with a purported sickness certificate dated 14 th March, 1993 and decided to <lb/>resume duty. From the above narration of facts, it clearly emerges that the <lb/>Petitioner was initially granted 75 days leave (one day Leave on Average <lb/>Pay (LAP) + 74 days Leave Without Pay (LWOP)) and was also granted <lb/>extension of 45 days as LWOP. The extant leave expired on 30 th <lb/>September, 1992. The Petitioner was thus required to report on duty on 1 st <lb/>October, 1992. Admittedly, he did not do so and did not join duty after the <lb/>expiry of the leaves and instead requested for further extension of 45 days <lb/>leave on the ground that he was undergoing treatment. His request was <lb/>rejected vide letter dated 17 th October, 1992 and he was directed to report to <lb/>nearest Railway Doctor for proper treatment of the reported disease of &quot;gall <lb/>bladder stone&quot;. The Petitioner was also made aware that further extension of <lb/>leave was inadmissible, because he had already availed the maximum leave <lb/>permissible at a time as per the extant rule i.e. 120 days. <lb/>27. After a lapse of 50 days, the Assistant Commandant sent another letter <lb/>dated 8 th December, 1992 advising the Petitioner to report on duty, as the <lb/>Petitioner had failed to report on duty. It thus clearly transpires that beyond <lb/>30 th September, 1992, Petitioner&quot;s absence was unauthorised. When <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">WP(C) No. 23872/2005 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 22 of 30 <lb/></page>

			<body>Petitioner&quot;s request dated 29 th September, 1992 for extension was turned <lb/>down, Petitioner ought to have resumed duty or at least made an effort to go <lb/>before the railway doctor in order to get a confirmation from him regarding <lb/>his purported illness. Till 15 th March, 1993, that is, for a period of nearly six <lb/>month, Petitioner continued to be absent without any sanction of leave. <lb/>Therefore, Petitioner&quot;s contention that when he resumed duty on 15 th March, <lb/>1993, it was incumbent upon the Respondent to have taken him on duty on <lb/>the strength of the fitness certificate is wholly misplaced and legally <lb/>untenable. Since the Petitioner absented himself from duty, without a <lb/>sanctioned leave for such a long period, this prima facie shows lack of <lb/>interest in work. The rules provide for the mechanism for an employee to <lb/>seek prior permission from the Respondents for seeking leave. This is to <lb/>enable the Respondent-Employer to make alternate arrangements and to <lb/>ensure that work does not suffer on account of the absence of the employee. <lb/>Allowing an employee to remain absent without prior permission or <lb/>condoning his unauthorized absence without justifiable reasons, would send <lb/>a wrong message to the disciplined force like the Respondent-RPF. The <lb/>Supreme Court in Delhi Transport Corporation v. Sardar Singh reported at <lb/>(2004) 7 SCC 574 has in fact held that, merely making an application for <lb/>absence from work does not assist the employee concerned, the requirement <lb/>is obtaining leave in advance. The enquiry officer thus rightly concluded <lb/>that the Petitioner was negligent in duties and exhibited lack of interest in <lb/>the employer&quot;s work. The conclusion of carelessness, negligence and lack <lb/>of interest has been arrived at by looking into the conduct of the Petitioner <lb/>and the period of absence, more particularly when the same was <lb/>unauthorized. Rule 104.3 of the Railway Protection Force Rules, 1959 <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">WP(C) No. 23872/2005 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 23 of 30 <lb/></page>

			<body>stipulates that an employee shall not absent himself from his duty without <lb/>first obtaining the permission from the competent authority. In case of <lb/>sudden illness, an employee is expected to send intimation to the office <lb/>immediately. In this context the Supreme Court in Mithlesh Singh v. Union <lb/>of India reported at (2003) 3 SCC 309, held as under:-<lb/>&quot;8. Rule 147(vi) deals with the case of absence without proper <lb/>intimation. A mere application for grant of leave cannot be <lb/>construed to be a proper intimation for absence. Rule 104 <lb/>indicates various modalities governing grant of leave. There is <lb/>prohibition on any member of the Force to leave station even on <lb/>holidays without specific permission of the authority <lb/>empowered to grant casual leave. These modalities having been <lb/>enumerated in Rule 104 clearly bring out the essence of <lb/>discipline, which is required to be observed. Absence from duty <lb/>without proper intimation is indicated to be a grave offence <lb/>warranting removal from service. Therefore, mere making an <lb/>application for leave cannot be construed to be of any <lb/>consequence in the background of the strict requirement of <lb/>giving proper intimation. Even if it is accepted that there was <lb/>intimation, that by no such imagination can be construed to be a <lb/>proper intimation for diluting the requirement of obtaining <lb/>permission before absenting from duty. Stress is on the <lb/>expression &quot;proper&quot;. It means appropriate, in the required <lb/>manner, fit, suitable, apt. The mere making of a request of <lb/>leave, which has not been accepted is not a proper intimation. It <lb/>cannot be said that the said word is a surplusage. The intention <lb/>of the legislature is primarily to be gathered from the language <lb/>used, and as a consequence a construction which results in <lb/>rejection of words as meaningless has to be avoided. It is not a <lb/>sound principle of construction to brush aside word(s) in a <lb/>statute as being inapposite surplusage; if they can have <lb/>appropriate application in circumstances conceivably within the <lb/>contemplation of the statute. In the interpretation of statutes the <lb/>courts always presume that the legislature inserted every part <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">WP(C) No. 23872/2005 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 24 of 30 <lb/></page>

			<body>thereof for a purpose and the legislative intention is that every <lb/>part of the statute should have effect. The legislature is deemed <lb/>not to waste its words or to say anything in vain. The authorities <lb/>were, therefore, justified in holding that he was guilty of the <lb/>offence of absence from duty without proper intimation.&quot; <lb/>28. Petitioner&quot;s reliance on Rule 541 (3) is also misplaced, inasmuch as <lb/>discussed above, initial sanction of leave was not on medical grounds, <lb/>though Petitioner had cited certain reasons for taking the initial leave of 75 <lb/>The said communication also states Petitioner would like to be on <lb/>special diet, undergo certain medical tests etc and therefore this is indicative <lb/>of the fact that Petitioner desired to undergo certain treatment and for that <lb/>reason he had applied for leave. Petitioner did not have a sick certificate <lb/>from the railway doctor or from a non-railway doctor, for applying for <lb/>medical leave. More pertinently, after 1 st October, 1992, when Petitioner <lb/>failed to report on duty, his absence was unauthorised and therefore <lb/>Petitioner&quot;s argument that since on 15 th March, 1993, he had furnished the <lb/>fitness certificate he would be deemed to be on duty, is completely bereft of <lb/>merit. <lb/>29. After an inordinate delay of six months, he cannot be permitted to <lb/>contend that he has an automatic right to resume his duty on the strength of <lb/>a certificate from non-railway doctor, corroborating his treatment from 28 th <lb/>September, 1992 to 14 th March, 1993. Clause 541 (3) of the Indian Railway <lb/>Medical Manual (&quot;IRMM&apos;) requires a certificate from the Railway Medical <lb/>Officer, which was concededly not submitted by the Petitioner. Thus, the <lb/>fitness certificate dated 14 th March, 1993 was of no avail to the Petitioner. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">WP(C) No. 23872/2005 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 25 of 30 <lb/></page>

			<body>30. There was sufficient evidence before the Enquiry Officer, to prove the <lb/>charge of misconduct on part of the Petitioner. Petitioner after availing 120 <lb/>days leave sanctioned to him, failed to report to duty expiry of his <lb/>i.e. on 30 th September, 1992. He also did not inform the administration <lb/>within 48 hours after the date of reporting sick and had sent two PMC&quot;s on <lb/>27 th May, 1993, only after a period of about eight and a half months and <lb/>then submitted additional PMC after a lapse of one year therefrom. The <lb/>PMCs submitted did not meet the requirement prescribed in the Rules and <lb/>the same were not considered as authentic proof of his sickness. It is thus <lb/>evident from the record that after having failed to report on duty on 1 st <lb/>October, 1992, the Petitioner neither visited the Railway Hospital nor did he <lb/>inform the Department. After having failed to report on duty on 1 st October, <lb/>1992, the first communication that was received from the Petitioner was on <lb/>15 th March, 1993. Relying on the fitness certificate dated 14 th March, 1993 <lb/>enclosed with the aforesaid letter, Petitioner contended that he was <lb/>undergoing medical treatment which he submitted on 15 th March, 1993, the <lb/>date when he sought to resume his duties. The said certificate states as <lb/>under:-<lb/>&quot;This is certified that Sh. Rajvir Singh S/o Sh. B. Singh R/o A-<lb/>602 Sector-19 Noida was under my treatment since 28.9.1992 to <lb/>14.3.93 for &quot;Hypertension, LNR disease&quot;. He has recovered <lb/>from his illness and now he is fit to resume all his duties on <lb/>15.3.1993.&quot; <lb/>31. The said certificate curiously does not mention the alleged ailment of <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">WP(C) No. 23872/2005 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 26 of 30 <lb/></page>

			<body>&quot;gall bladder stone&quot;. It refers to the ailment of &quot;Hypertension, LNR disease&quot;. <lb/>The findings of the Enquiry Officer on the of unauthorised absence <lb/>from 1 st October, 1992 to 2 nd January, 1995, therefore, do not appear to be <lb/>on incorrect premise and do not suffer any infirmity thus, Petitioner&quot;s <lb/>challenge is legally untenable. <lb/>32. Petitioner&quot;s contention that the PMC certificate furnished by the <lb/>Petitioner could not have been rejected by the enquiry officer is also an <lb/>argument that is ex facie misconceived. Reliance on Rule 538 (4) and Rule <lb/>539 (2) on the aforesaid ground is also misplaced as noted above, since <lb/>Petitioner did not apply for medical certificate at the first instance and <lb/>therefore on 15 th March, 1993, after a period of six months of unauthorised <lb/>absence, he could not have claimed as a matter of right to join the duty, <lb/>shifting the responsibility to the Respondent to verify the fitness certificate <lb/>in order to allow him to resume duty. <lb/>33. The Petitioner has failed to note that the applicability of the aforesaid <lb/>Rule is for such employees who are on leave on medical certificate/grounds. <lb/>Thus reading of the aforesaid provisions suggests that it&quot;s applicability <lb/>would arise where a railway employee desires to take leave on medical <lb/>certificate or when an employee is on such leave. We are unable to <lb/>appreciate as to how the Petitioner has relied upon the aforesaid Rules.The <lb/>Petitioner&quot;s contention that his unauthorised absence was for justifiable <lb/>reasons and the Respondent authority had complete knowledge of the same <lb/>and therefore he ought to have been granted extension of leave is also <lb/>legally unsustainable. Petitioner&quot;s request for extension was rejected on 17 th <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">WP(C) No. 23872/2005 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 27 of 30 <lb/></page>

			<body>October, 1992 and therefore it was for him to have reported on duty or to at <lb/>least have visited railway doctor. <lb/>34. The other ground of challenge by the Petitioner being that the enquiry <lb/>report was submitted with damaging comments also does not appear to be <lb/>correct. The Enquiry Officer while making the report has used the <lb/>expression &quot;unauthorised absence for two years is quite serious&quot;. This <lb/>comment has to be understood in the context of Article of charge. The <lb/>charge of misconduct and negligence levelled against the Petitioner relatable <lb/>to unauthorized absence cannot be determined without appreciating the <lb/>seriousness of the charges, keeping in mind the period of absence. We also <lb/>note that the Disciplinary Authority has applied its mind and meticulously <lb/>perused the findings of the Enquiry Officer before accepting the same and <lb/>awarding the punishment. This critical evaluation is also visible from the <lb/>orders of the Appellate and Revisional Authorities and thus the comments of <lb/>Enquiry Officer singularly cannot be the ground to hold that the enquiry <lb/>proceedings and the report are vitiated. <lb/>35. Petitioner&apos;s contention that the Respondent could have granted him <lb/>extraordinary leave on the basis of the medical certificate is without merit. <lb/>The relevant Rule for obtaining extraordinary leave is Rule 530, which reads <lb/>as under: -<lb/>530.Extraordinary Leave <lb/>(1) Extraordinary leave may be grabnted to a railway servant in <lb/>special circumstances. <lb/>(a) when no other leave is admissible, and <lb/>(b) When other leave is admissible, but the railway servant <lb/></body>

Petitioner after remaining absent unauthorisedly for six months cannot <lb/>seek regularisation of the overstay period as extraordinary leave. On the date <lb/>of the alleged joining i.e. 15 th March, 1993, he was already facing the <lb/>charges of misconduct. The aforesaid Rule clearly stipulates that for grant <lb/>of extraordinary leave, the employee has to make a request in writing. In the <lb/>present case, no such request was made by the Petitioner. The extraordinary <lb/>leave can be granted to the railway servants under special circumstances, <lb/>when no other leave is admissible. Merely because the upper limit for grant <lb/>of extraordinary leave is five years, does not mean that the Petitioner is <lb/>entitled to extraordinary leave at the asking. Petitioner&quot;s salary was stopped <lb/>in accordance with the relevant rules dealing with &quot;extraordinary leaves&quot;. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">WP(C) No. 23872/2005 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 29 of 30 <lb/></page>

			<body>The leaves granted by the Respondent without pay was only for 120 days. <lb/>Petitioner&quot;s request for extension was rejected and he was directed to report <lb/>for duty or present himself before the railway doctor for his treatment. In <lb/>the absence of any document to establish that railway doctor advised the <lb/>Petitioner to undergo surgery for removal of gall bladder, there is no merit in <lb/>the contention of the Petitioner that the period w.e.f from 30 th September, <lb/>1992 should be regularized as extraordinary leave. <lb/>37. We note yet another contention of the Petitioner that his request for <lb/>documents was wrongly rejected. We have gone through the findings of the <lb/>Enquiry Officer. The request for documents was rejected by the Enquiry <lb/>Officer on the ground that none of the documents requested for by the <lb/>Petitioner were remotely connected with the present case. The articles of <lb/>charge are primarily on the ground of unauthorised absence and this <lb/>misconduct had to be ascertained by the Enquiry Officer on the basis of the <lb/>facts which appear to be undisputed. In order to rebut the charge, Petitioner <lb/>essentially relied upon the legal provisions to assert his right to resume duty <lb/>on the strength of his fitness certificate produced by him, therefore, the <lb/>documents requested by him were found not be of any relevance so as to <lb/>affect the outcome of the enquiry proceedings. Petitioner is also unable to <lb/>show any prejudice caused to him on the account of the refusal by Enquiry <lb/>Officer to provide such documents and thus this ground of challenge is <lb/>misplaced. <lb/>38. The Petitioner&quot;s contention that enquiry conducted should have been by <lb/>the officer where he was posted i.e. NJP does not warrant any <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">WP(C) No. 23872/2005 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 30 of 30 <lb/></page>

			<body>consideration, as the present case has travelled to a stage where Petitioner&quot;s <lb/>appeal as well as revision have been rejected and the aforesaid ground was <lb/>never urged at any stage hereto before. <lb/>39. Lastly, the argument of the Petitioner that the revisional order has been <lb/>signed by the Inspector General and the same is not in compliance with the <lb/>rules, is also completely vague. The revisional order in fact, favours the <lb/>Petitioner. It has reduced his punishment from removal of service to <lb/>compulsory retirement. Moreover, it is to be noted that Inspector General <lb/>has signed on behalf of the Government of India and as per the Rules, the <lb/>Revisional Authority is Government of India. <lb/>40. In view of the foregoing discussion and the judgments noted above, we <lb/>find there is no ground for interference and accordingly the appeal is <lb/>dismissed. <lb/>SANJEEV NARULA, J <lb/>S.
