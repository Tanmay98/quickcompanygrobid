			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
			1. The present Petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
			<lb />
			Act, 1996 (the &quot;Arbitration Act&quot;) has been filed, inter alia seeking grant of
			<lb />
			interim/ ad interim relief of temporary injunction against Respondent no. 1
			<lb />
			from offering or selling its shareholding in Mumbai International Airport
			<lb />
			Limited (&quot;MIAL&quot;) to any person other than the Petitioner.
			<lb />

		<p>
			2. The Petitioner and Respondents No. 1 to 3 (Respondent No. 1 = Bid
			<lb />
			Services Division (Mauritius) Ltd.; Respondent No. 2 = ACSA Global Ltd.;
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 3 = Airports Authority of India, hereinafter &quot;AAI&quot;) (along
			<lb />
			with AAI Nominees)) are shareholders of MIAL in terms of Shareholders
			<lb />
			Agreement dated 4 th April 2006 (&quot;SHA&quot;).

			<lb />
			Private Participant is a special purpose vehicle established
			<lb />
			primarily for the purposes of holding Equity Shares in the JVC
			<lb />
			(such Private Participant being an &quot;SPV PP&quot;), a Transfer of any

			then, it shall:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			make an offer for the sale of the PP Purchase Shares (as
			<lb />

			the PP Offer Price and on the same terms and conditions as
			<lb />
			contained in the PP Offer Notice (the &quot;Second PP Offer
			<lb />
			Notice&quot;);&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			4. To better understand the terminology used in the aforenoted clauses, it
			<lb />
			would be apt to refer to the provisions that define the expressions. The same
			<lb />
			read as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Private Participants are members of a consortium, which had
			<lb />
			bid, were thereafter short listed and eventually selected by AAI
			<lb />
			(with the approval of the Government of India) as the joint
			<lb />
			venture partners for undertaking the Project.
			<lb />
			The Parties listed in Schedule I hereto (hereinafter individually
			<lb />
			referred to as &quot;Private Participant&quot; and collectively referred to as
			<lb />
			&quot;Private Participant&quot;)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(which expression shall, unless it be repugnant or contrary to the
			<lb />
			subject or context thereof, be deemed to mean and include their
			<lb />
			respective nominees, legal representatives and successors) of the
			<lb />
			second part.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			The Private Participants and AAI (along with the AAI Nominees)
			<lb />
			hereinafter collectively referred to as the &quot;Shareholders&quot; and
			<lb />
			individually as &quot;Shareholder&quot;.

			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			THE CONTROVERSY
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			5. In terms of the ROFR Clause, Respondent no. 1 offered its entire
			<lb />
			shareholding of 16,20,00,000 shares constituting 13.5% stake in the
			<lb />
			Company (&quot;Shares&quot;) for sale to the Petitioner. The Petitioner contends that
			<lb />
			the offer was accepted and there is a binding agreement between the parties
			<lb />
			for the sale of shares. It is also inter alia contended that Respondent No. 1 is
			<lb />
			not ready and willing to fulfil its obligations and the shares are not in a
			<lb />
			deliverable state. Respondent No. 1 does not dispute that the Petitioner has
			<lb />
			ROFR in respect of the Shares, but contends that the right has expired/
			<lb />
			lapsed since Petitioner has not completed the transaction within the period
			<lb />
			stipulated in the agreement and that the Shares now have to be offered to
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 3 in terms of Clause 3.7 of the SHA. It is also asserted that
			<lb />
			Petitioner does not have financial capacity to complete the transaction and is
			<lb />
			delaying the matter. Thus, the controversy revolves around the exercise of
			<lb />
			the Petitioner&apos;s ROFR under the Shareholders Agreement dated 4 th April
			<lb />
			2006.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			FACTUAL BACKGROUND
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			6. In terms of the ROFR clause, Respondent No. 1 addressed a letter dated
			<lb />
			26 th January 2019 to Petitioner and Respondent No. 2 (with a copy to the
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 3) communicating that it is desirous of transferring the
			<lb />
			shares for an aggregate consideration of not less than INR 1248,75,00,000/-
			<lb />
			and offering to sell the same to the Petitioner and Respondent No. 2 on the
			<lb />
			above terms. The Petitioner thereafter addressed a letter dated 19 th February
			<lb />
			2019 to Respondent No. 1 (with copies to Respondent No. 2 and Respondent
			<lb />
			No. 3) stating that its letter dated 26 th January 2019 is defective and cannot
			<lb />
			be considered as a valid offer notice under the SHA. Later, Petitioner
			<lb />
			addressed a letter dated 22 nd February 2019 to Respondent No. 1 (with
			<lb />
			copies to Respondent No. 2 and Respondent No. 3) exercising its option to
			<lb />
			purchase Respondent No. 1&apos;s shares and mentioned that it still awaits all
			<lb />
			terms and conditions of the proposed transfer of shares by Respondent No. 1
			<lb />
			as sought by the Petitioner vide its letter dated 19 th February 2019. By the
			<lb />
			said letter, the Petitioner also invited Respondent No. 1 to discuss the
			<lb />
			modalities of closing the transaction at the earliest including but not limited
			<lb />
			to signing a share purchase agreement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7. Respondent No. 1 then addressed a letter dated 4 th March 2019 to the
			<lb />
			Petitioner stating that while it maintains that the letter dated 26 th January
			<lb />
			2019 was not defective, nevertheless a draft share purchase agreement
			<lb />
			(&quot;SPA&quot;) setting out all the terms and conditions on which it is desirous of
			<lb />
			selling the Shares was enclosed. It was further stated in the letter that the
			<lb />
			timeline of 30 days would be considered from the date of this letter, i.e. 26 th
			<lb />
			January 2019. Petitioner vide its letter dated 14 th March 2019 then replied to
			<lb />
			another letter of Respondent No. 3 dated 7 th March 2019 and asserted that
			<lb />
			since Petitioner has already exercised its option under the SHA to purchase
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1&apos;s shares, the question of Respondent No. 1 making an
			<lb />
			offer to Respondent No. 3 for sale of the said shares under the SHA does not
			<lb />
			arise. Around the same time, the Petitioner also addressed a letter dated 16 th
			<lb />
			March 2019 to the Respondent No. 1 enclosing Petitioner&apos;s proposed
			<lb />
			changes to the draft SPA, and called upon Respondent No. 1 to execute the
			<lb />
			SPA at a mutually agreed time and place. On 20 th March 2019, Respondent
			<lb />
			No. 1 addressed a letter to the Petitioner stating that none of the changes
			<lb />
			proposed by the Petitioner to the draft share purchase agreement (&quot;SPA&quot;)
			<lb />
			that was enclosed with the letter dated 4 th March 2019 are acceptable to it. It
			<lb />
			was also reiterated that the sale and purchase of Respondent No. 1&apos;s shares
			<lb />
			has to be consummated within a period of 30 (thirty) days of the Respondent
			<lb />
			No. 1&apos;s letter dated 4 th March 2019. Along with the said letter, Respondent
			<lb />
			No. 1 also enclosed a draft SPA, which included 4 th April 2019 as the &quot;Long
			<lb />
			Stop Date&quot; for completion of the transaction. The Petitioner then addressed a
			<lb />
			letter dated 26 th March 2019 to Respondent No. 1 enclosing a signed copy of
			<lb />
			the same SPA that was enclosed with Respondent No. 1&apos;s letter dated 4 th
			<lb />
			March 2019. The Petitioner addressed an email dated 26th March 2019 to
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1 inter alia stating that the Petitioner has signed and sent the
			<lb />
			SPA to Respondent No. 1 as per Respondent No. 1&apos;s letter dated 4th March
			<lb />
			2019. Post receipt of the signed SPA from Petitioner, Respondent No. 1
			<lb />
			addressed a letter dated 27th March 2019 (i.e. very next day) to State Bank
			<lb />
			of India (&quot;SBI&quot;) and SBICAP Trustee Company Limited. Respondent No.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			1&apos;s lawyers addressed an email dated 27th March 2019 to Petitioner&apos;s
			<lb />
			lawyers inter alia stating that consummation of the sale/ purchase transaction
			<lb />
			on or before 4th April 2019 is one of the conditions on which Respondent
			<lb />
			No. 1 is desirous of selling its shares and that if the same is not acceptable to
			<lb />
			the Petitioner, then Respondent No. 1 is not in a position to execute the
			<lb />
			share purchase agreement. SBI (lender) by way of its letter dated 28th
			<lb />
			March 2019, replied to Respondent No. 1&apos;s letter dated 27th March 2019
			<lb />
			inter alia stating that MIAL has to give 60 (sixty) days&apos; prior notice to SBI
			<lb />
			for granting approval for the proposed transfer. Respondent No. 1 addressed
			<lb />
			a letter dated 29th March 2019 to MIAL inter alia stating that the Petitioner
			<lb />
			vide its letter dated 11th March 2019 has exercised its right of first refusal
			<lb />
			over the purchase of Shares and in connection therewith requested MIAL to
			<lb />
			seek approvals from its lenders. MIAL addressed a letter dated 30th March
			<lb />
			2019 to Respondent No. 1 requesting for certain documents (i.e. a copy of
			<lb />
			the acceptance of the Petitioner along with term sheet for the stake purchase
			<lb />
			from Respondent No. 1). It was further stated that it will submit an
			<lb />
			application for approval for the transaction to SBI and other lenders on
			<lb />
			receipt of the said documents. MIAL addressed another letter dated 30th
			<lb />
			March 2019 to Respondent No. 1, informing them that MIAL will need its
			<lb />
			formal request together with the necessary supporting documents for
			<lb />
			approvals for the transfer under OMDA. According to the Petitioner,
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1 has neither responded to the two aforesaid letters from
			<lb />
			MIAL nor provided the supporting documents required to seek all the
			<lb />
			necessary approvals.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			8. Petitioner then filed the present Petition on 1 st April 2019 seeking interim
			<lb />
			reliefs against the Respondent No. 1. Petitioner has also invoked arbitration
			<lb />
			under Clause 9.4.3.1 of the SHA against the Respondent No. 1 by way of a
			<lb />
			notice dated 25 th April 2019.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			SUBMISSIONS OF PETITIONER [ IN BRIEF]
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			9. The learned counsel for the Petitioner, Mr. Rajiv Nayar, broadly made the
			<lb />
			following submissions:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			a) The scope of powers exercised by this Court under section 9 at the stage
			<lb />
			of grant of injunction as interim relief is limited and the Court is not
			<lb />
			required to go into the questions relating to the aspect of grant of final relief.
			<lb />
			Mr. Nayar relied upon sub-clause (3) of section 9 to state that since the
			<lb />
			Arbitral Tribunal is vested with powers to grant relief similar to those
			<lb />
			provided for under section 9, the scope of powers under section 9 should be
			<lb />
			construed to be restricted. The injunction prayed for by the Petitioner ought
			<lb />
			to be granted because the present interim stage only requires preservation of
			<lb />
			the subject matter of the arbitration (i.e. the Shares) till the arbitral tribunal
			<lb />
			is constituted. During the arbitration proceedings, the parties can invoke
			<lb />
			Section 17 and seek appropriate reliefs including modification or variation
			<lb />
			of the orders passed under Section 9 of the Act.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			b) The ROFR clause in a contract is a negative covenant which can be
			<lb />
			enforced separately to restrict sale of shares to a third party. The Petitioner is
			<lb />
			not seeking specific performance of the affirmative agreement in the present
			<lb />
			Petition. The injunction prayed for is for enforcement of a negative
			<lb />
			agreement not to do a certain act -not to create third party rights or offer to
			<lb />
			sell the subject shares to any other party. Such a negative covenant is
			<lb />
			capable of being enforced under Section 42 of Specific Relief Act and the
			<lb />
			other provisions (section 16 or 41) of the Specific Relief Act are not
			<lb />
			attracted. Therefore, the alleged requirement of having available funds for
			<lb />
			establishing that Petitioner is &quot;ready and willing&quot; is not applicable in the
			<lb />
			present case.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			c) Petitioner has a preferential right to purchase the Shares offered by
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1 and it has in fact exercised this right. There is a concluded
			<lb />
			contract between the Petitioner and Respondent No. 1 for the transfer of the
			<lb />
			Shares in terms of the SHA and the execution of the SPA by Respondent
			<lb />
			No. 1 is only a formality that is required to be completed in order to apply
			<lb />
			for and obtain various approvals/ permissions including approval from
			<lb />
			statutory authorities and lenders which are needed to complete the
			<lb />
			transaction. Relying upon the correspondence between the parties, he argued
			<lb />
			that Respondent no. 1 has conceded to the fact that there is a concluded
			<lb />
			contract between the parties as evidenced from the letters written seeking the
			<lb />
			approval of AAI and the lenders.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			d) The conduct of Respondent No. 1 belies its stand that a Long Stop Date
			<lb />
			of 4 th April 2019 was a key/ material term of its offer. Further, in any event,
			<lb />
			the question of whether time was regarded by the parties to be of the essence
			<lb />
			can only be decided by the arbitral tribunal and at this stage, the conduct of
			<lb />
			the parties reflects that they never treated time to be of essence.On a true and
			<lb />
			proper construction of the SHA, the 30 (thirty) day time period under Clause
			<lb />
			3.7.1(iii) of the SHA has to be computed by excluding the time taken to
			<lb />
			obtain all requisite approvals/ permissions for the transfer and for the seller
			<lb />
			to become capable of delivering the shares to the purchaser in a freely
			<lb />
			transferable form. This follows from the fact that any transfer of shares
			<lb />
			under the SHA to a Private Participant is subject to receipt of various
			<lb />
			approvals/permissions, which cannot be obtained within the period of 30
			<lb />
			(thirty) days.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			e) Respondent No. 1 has delayed completion of the transaction by not
			<lb />
			performing its reciprocal obligations and is still not in a position to deliver
			<lb />
			the shares to the Petitioner in a freely transferable form. Hence, the
			<lb />
			Respondent is not ready and willing to perform his part of the obligations
			<lb />
			under contract and whereas, the Petitioner has always been ready and willing
			<lb />
			to perform its part of the obligations.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			f) The balance of convenience lies in favour of the Petitioner and irreparable
			<lb />
			injury would be caused to it if Respondent No. 1 is not restrained from
			<lb />
			offering its shares to a third party. If Respondent No. 1 is not restrained from
			<lb />
			offering and/or selling the Shares to any person other than the Petitioner,
			<lb />
			pending the conclusion of the arbitral proceedings and implementation of the
			<lb />
			award therein, Respondent No. 1 will proceed to dispose of the Shares to a
			<lb />
			person other than the Petitioner. In such a situation, even if the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal accepts Petitioner&apos;s interpretation of what is the applicable time
			<lb />
			period under the SHA, it will be too late to restore Petitioner&apos;s rights since
			<lb />
			the person to whom Respondent No. 1 would have sold the Shares would
			<lb />
			not be bound by the arbitral award. It would create a situation where shares
			<lb />
			would never be available to the Petitioner as the same are held in a Private
			<lb />
			Company (MIAL) and are not available in the open market.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			CASE OF THE RESPONDENT [IN BRIEF]
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			10. Learned Senior Counsel for the Respondent No. 1, Mr. Amit Sibal based
			<lb />
			his submissions on the following grounds:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			a) The Petitioner cannot argue that it does not need to prove a prima facie
			<lb />
			case for obtaining a relief of specific performance before the arbitral
			<lb />
			tribunal. Petitioner has to necessarily establish a prima facie case by
			<lb />
			showing readiness and willingness to perform its obligations. These are
			<lb />
			requirements of law that cannot be contracted out of by the parties.
			<lb />
			Additionally, such requirements of law do not cease to apply merely because
			<lb />
			the Petitioner seeks relief by way of a petition under Section 9.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			b) Section 41(e) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (&quot;Specific Relief Act&quot;)
			<lb />
			provides that an injunction, as is being prayed for by the Petitioner before
			<lb />
			this Hon&apos;ble Court, cannot be granted &quot;to prevent the breach of a contract
			<lb />
			the performance of which would not be specifically enforced&quot;. Reliance was
			<lb />
			also placed on Section 16 of the Specific Relief Act (as amended by the
			<lb />
			Specific Relief (Amendment) Act, 2018) which provides, under sub-section
			<lb />
			(b) that specific performance of a contract cannot be enforced in favor of a
			<lb />
			person who has become incapable of performing, or violates any essential
			<lb />
			term of the contract that remains to be performed on his part, or acts in fraud
			<lb />
			of the contract, or willfully acts at variance with or in subversion of the
			<lb />
			relation intended to be established by the contract. There is no negative
			<lb />
			covenant distinct from a positive covenant which is envisaged in Clause 3.7
			<lb />
			of the SHA and for Section 42 to operate, a separate and distinct negative
			<lb />
			covenant must exist within the contractual framework and even if Clause 3.7
			<lb />
			of the SHA were a negative covenant within the meaning of Section 42
			<lb />
			Specific Relief Act, an injunction cannot be granted for the asking.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			c) The Petitioner never accepted an essential term of the offer made by
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1. In other words, there was no concluded contract with the
			<lb />
			Petitioner, it having rejected a key term of Respondent No. 1&apos;s offer.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			d) By its very definition, a ROFR has to be a time-bound offer and can never
			<lb />
			be in perpetuity and in contracts for the sale of shares, time is inherently of
			<lb />
			the essence of the contract given that the value of the shares could widely
			<lb />
			fluctuate. Further, only the approval of Respondent No. 3 and the approval
			<lb />
			of lenders is required to be taken and approval of the Competition
			<lb />
			Commission of India (CCI) is not required. Pertinently, clause 3.6 is
			<lb />
			applicable to sale of shares to third parties and not to private participants and
			<lb />
			a separate 90 day timeline is provided in case of sale to third parties. Further,
			<lb />
			it is settled in law that the terms of a contract are to be interpreted as they
			<lb />
			are.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			e) Respondent No. 1 has always been ready and willing to perform its part of
			<lb />
			the transaction whereas, Petitioner does not possess the financial means to
			<lb />
			complete the sale transaction and is hence, delaying the same.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			f) Petitioner&apos;s case, even if taken at face value demonstrates that the balance
			<lb />
			of convenience does not lie in favour of the Petitioner. By the Petitioner&apos;s
			<lb />
			own case, a transfer to Respondent No. 3 would still require all the
			<lb />
			approvals required as with a transfer to the Petitioner (other than approval of
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 3 itself). Transfer to Respondent No. 3 would therefore, per
			<lb />
			Petitioner&apos;s admitted case, not happen instantaneously. Even if Respondent
			<lb />
			No. 3 were to decline the offer and a transfer had to be made to a third party,
			<lb />
			approval requirements would become even more onerous, and the
			<lb />
			consummation of the sale/purchase would not be instantaneous.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			PROCEEDINGS IN THE PETITION
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			11. The petition first came up before this Court on 2 nd April 2019. Notice
			<lb />
			was issued on 11 th April 2019 and on the said date, Mr. Amit Sibal, learned
			<lb />
			counsel for Respondent No. 1, on instructions, made a statement to the effect
			<lb />
			that no adverse action shall be taken till the next date of hearing. Thereafter,
			<lb />
			the matter was heard on a day to day basis and the statement given to the
			<lb />
			Court was extended and continues to remain in operation. The possibility of
			<lb />
			settlement was explored by the parties on multiple dates, however it could
			<lb />
			not be materialized. On 8 th May, 2019, this Court granted an opportunity to
			<lb />
			the parties, to prove their bona fides in an attempt to facilitate settlement
			<lb />
			between the parties. The relevant portion of the said order reads as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;2. ……….On being enquired by the Court whether the
			<lb />
			Respondent No.l is still ready and willing to sell the shares in
			<lb />
			question to the Petitioner, Mr. Sibal on instructions states that
			<lb />
			without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the Respondent
			<lb />
			No.l and without conceding any of the contentions and objections
			<lb />
			raised in the reply, in order to show the bona fides. Respondent
			<lb />
			No.l is agreeable to transfer the shares in Mumbai International
			<lb />
			Airport Limited (MIAL) to the Petitioner, subject to the
			<lb />
			Petitioner itself or through MIAL furnishing the requisite
			<lb />
			documents that are necessary to obtain the requisite approvals
			<lb />
			and certain other conditions set out below. According to him, the
			<lb />
			documents, required for obtaining approvals are (a) request letter
			<lb />
			to Airports Authority of India (AAI), (b) request letter to the
			<lb />
			lenders acting through the State Bank of India as a lead bank and
			<lb />
			the security trustees, (c) term sheet.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			3. Mr. Sibal submits that besides the afore-noted documentation,
			<lb />
			it may also be necessary for the Court to issue directions
			<lb />
			including to MIAL and the lenders, in order to expedite the
			<lb />
			approval process. Mr. Sibal also submits that before the Court
			<lb />
			proceeds to issue such directions and Respondent no. 1 initiates
			<lb />
			the process of taking approvals, having regard to fact that the
			<lb />
			amount involved in the transaction is 1248,75,00,000/-, it is
			<lb />
			essential that the Petitioner should also exhibit its bona fide and
			<lb />
			show the readiness to complete the transaction. The Petitioner
			<lb />
			should thus be called upon to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
			<lb />
			the court and the Respondent no. 1 its financial means and
			<lb />
			capability including readily available funds to purchase the
			<lb />
			shares as of today. He assures that subject to the above,
			<lb />
			Respondent No.l expects that all the requisite approvals would be
			<lb />
			obtained within 20 days from the date of receipt of the necessary
			<lb />
			documentation from the Petitioner (itself or through MIAL) and
			<lb />
			the Respondent no. 1 will keep the shares in a deliverable state
			<lb />
			provided that such documentation is provided within two
			<lb />
			business days of the Petitioner showing readily available funds.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			4. On the basis of the above statement, the court has enquired
			<lb />
			from Mr. Kartik Nayar, learned counsel for the Petitioner,
			<lb />
			whether the above proposal would be acceptable to the Petitioner,
			<lb />
			with the condition that on the approvals being obtained by
			<lb />
			Respondent No.l, Petitioner shall pay the consideration towards
			<lb />
			the purchase of the shares within 5 days from the date of the
			<lb />
			approval. Mr. Nayar seeks time to take instructions from his
			<lb />
			clients.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			5. Mr. Abhinav Vashist, learned senior counsel appearing on
			<lb />
			behalf of Respondent No.3 states that it is the stand of the AAI
			<lb />
			that the Petitioner has lost the right to avail the benefit of the
			<lb />
			ROFR Clause.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			12. However, despite the above order, no compromise could be arrived at
			<lb />
			between the parties. Hence, the learned counsels for the parties have been
			<lb />
			heard at length.
			<lb />

		<p>
			ANALYSIS &amp; FINDINGS
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			Scope of section 9 of the Act
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			13. Mr. Rajiv Nayar, learned senior counsel for the Petitioner has laid
			<lb />
			considerable emphasis on the scope of the present proceedings under Section
			<lb />
			9 of the Act. He opened his arguments by saying that the Court should take
			<lb />
			into consideration the fact that Petitioner has already invoked the arbitration
			<lb />
			clause and appointed its nominee Arbitrator on 25th April 2019 and
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1 in response thereto has also appointed his nominee. The
			<lb />
			two nominee Arbitrators are now in the process of appointing the Presiding
			<lb />
			Arbitrator as per the mandate of the Arbitration Clause. The arbitration
			<lb />
			proceedings are likely to commence shortly between the parties. He then
			<lb />
			contended that in view of the impending arbitration, the subject matter of
			<lb />
			the arbitration agreement should be preserved, failing which the Petitioner
			<lb />
			would be left with no remedy in the event the Petitioner were to succeed in
			<lb />
			the Arbitration Proceedings. Mr. Nayar also referred to the amendment in
			<lb />
			Section 9 introduced by the amending Act of 2015 and urged that Section 9
			<lb />
			(3) of the Act mandates that the Court shall not entertain an application
			<lb />
			under Sub Section (1) of Section 9, unless exceptional circumstances exist
			<lb />
			that may render the remedy provided under Section 17 inefficacious. He
			<lb />
			submitted that pursuant to the amendment introduced under Section 17 of
			<lb />
			the Act, the Arbitral Tribunal has now been bestowed with the power to
			<lb />
			grant interim measures and when the Arbitral Tribunal is so constituted, the
			<lb />
			Courts would ordinarily refrain from entertaining the petition under Sub-
			<lb />
			Section (1) of Section 9 of the Act. In essence, his submission is that the
			<lb />
			Tribunal is in a better position to gauge the scope of the arbitration
			<lb />
			proceedings. This visibility is not there before the Court while deciding a
			<lb />
			petition under Sub Section (1) of Section 9 of the Act, at a stage prior to the
			<lb />
			initiation of the arbitration proceedings. It was further argued that the
			<lb />
			questions relating to the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the
			<lb />
			Contract are to be decided in the arbitration proceedings and not by the
			<lb />
			Court in a petition under Section 9 of the Act and the Court should grant
			<lb />
			interim relief so that the arbitration proceedings are not rendered
			<lb />
			infructuous. It was also stressed that the shares in question are not freely
			<lb />
			available in the market and therefore in the instant case, Petitioner would not
			<lb />
			be in a position to estimate the damages or losses on account of the breach
			<lb />
			committed by the Respondent No. 1 in not transferring the shares to the
			<lb />
			Petitioner as mandated under Clause 3.7.1 of SHA. He also argued that at
			<lb />
			this stage, the requisite tests that are applicable to an injunction application
			<lb />
			in a suit for Specific performance should not be applied and court should
			<lb />
			focus on preserving the subject matter of the arbitration. He also relied upon
			<lb />
			Adhunik Steels (supra) and several other decisions of this Court such as
			<lb />
			National Highways Authority of India v. Elsamex-Tws-Snc Joint Venture
			<lb />
			150 (2008) DLT 215 to buttress the submission that the Court is empowered
			<lb />
			to pass an interim order in the nature of an interim measure for preservation
			<lb />
			of the subject matter of the arbitration till the disposal of the dispute before
			<lb />
			an Arbitral Tribunal.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			14. There is an apparent fallacy in the submissions advanced by Mr. Nayar
			<lb />
			on this issue. The Court while exercising its power under Section 9 of the
			<lb />
			Act for grant of interim measures cannot decide the petition de hors the
			<lb />
			context of the arbitration proceedings. Sub Section (3) of section 9 of the
			<lb />
			Act read along with amended Section 17 of the Act cannot be construed to
			<lb />
			mean that the Court&apos;s jurisdiction under Sub Section (1) of Section 9 is
			<lb />
			reduced or curbed. From the reading of the amended Section 9 and/or
			<lb />
			Section 17 it cannot be interpreted that the Court while deciding the petition
			<lb />
			under Section 9 of the Act should apply a different standard, only because
			<lb />
			the arbitral tribunal is now empowered to pass orders of interim nature that
			<lb />
			are enforceable as an order of the Court. Section 9 of the Act clearly
			<lb />
			provides that while passing an order under the aforesaid provision, the Court
			<lb />
			&quot;shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of,
			<lb />
			and in relation to, any proceedings before it&quot;. Sub Section (3) of Section 9
			<lb />
			does not limit or impede or interfere with the power of the Court to pass the
			<lb />
			order, as is being suggested by the learned counsel for the Petitioner. The
			<lb />
			scope of Section 9 cannot be limited only to the extent of preservation of the
			<lb />
			subject matter. The Court should not ignore the ultimate relief in the instant
			<lb />
			case [specific performance of contract] that a party intends to seek in the
			<lb />
			arbitration proceedings and confine the enquiry only on the aspect of
			<lb />
			preserving the subject matter till the adjudication of the dispute, just because
			<lb />
			there are several disputed contentions between the parties that required
			<lb />
			adjudication. Preservation of the &quot;subject matter&quot; may be necessary,
			<lb />
			however, that cannot be granted on the asking of a party. Furthermore, the
			<lb />
			Court while exercising its jurisdiction is also required to take guidance from
			<lb />
			the relevant provisions of CPC, 1908. It would be apt to refer to the
			<lb />
			judgment of this Court in Modi Rubber ltd v. Guardian International Corp.
			<lb />
			2007 SCC OnLine Del 502, where the Court has succinctly and correctly
			<lb />
			defined the scope of the proceedings under Section 9 of the Act in the
			<lb />
			following words:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;287. It is also necessary to examine the parameters within which
			<lb />
			the Court shall exercise such power. The manner and limits of
			<lb />
			exercise of such discretion have fallen for consideration in
			<lb />
			several judicial pronouncements and the principles laid down can
			<lb />
			be usefully called out thus:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i) Even though Section 9 does not embody the ingredients of
			<lb />
			Order 38 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 nor the
			<lb />
			conditions of the Order 38 Rule 5 can be read into it, however for
			<lb />
			the exercise of discretion thereunder, the Court can take guidance
			<lb />
			from the provisions of Order 39 as well as Order 38 of the Code
			<lb />
			of Civil Procedure, 1908 [Ref. 2004 (4) AD (Delhi) 618 : 2004
			<lb />
			(75) DRJ 104, Rite Approach Group Ltd. v. Rosoboron Export].
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) The scope of Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
			<lb />
			Act, 1996 is in parimeteria with the provisions of Order 39 of the
			<lb />
			Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The power vested in the Court by
			<lb />
			virtue of Section 9 must be exercised in consonance with equity
			<lb />
			which tempers the grant of discretionary relief as the relief of
			<lb />
			interim injunction is wholly equitable in nature. [Ref. (1995) 5
			<lb />
			SCC 545, Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. v. Coca Cola; 2004 (8) AD
			<lb />
			(Delhi) 361, Reliance Infocomm Ltd. v. Bharat Sanchar Nigam
			<lb />
			Ltd.]
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) The intention of the defendant is a sine qua non for invoking
			<lb />
			Section 9 where the claim is to secure the amount in dispute in
			<lb />
			arbitration. The Court can take guidance from Order 38 Rule 5 of
			<lb />
			the CPC and Sections 18 and 41 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 for
			<lb />
			considering whether such a relief as has been prayed for in the
			<lb />
			petition under Section 9 deserves to be granted [Ref. AIR 1998
			<lb />
			Delhi 397 : 1998 (3) RAJ, Global Co. v. National Fertilisers
			<lb />
			Ltd.; 2005 (2) AD (Delhi) 592, Mala Kumar Engineers Pvt. Ltd.
			<lb />
			(MKE) v. B. Seenaiah&amp; Co. (Projects) Ltd.).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iv) Protection under Section 9 can be granted only when a prima
			<lb />
			facie case is made out and balance of convenience and possibility
			<lb />
			of irreparable loss and injury to the petitioner is made out.
			<lb />
			Section 23 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 provides that the
			<lb />
			provision of liquidated damages is not a bar to the specific
			<lb />
			performance of the contract. The general rule of equity is also
			<lb />
			that if a thing is agreed to be done, though there is a penalty
			<lb />
			attached thereto to secure its performance, yet the Court in its
			<lb />
			discretion enforces specific performance thereof. The jurisdiction
			<lb />
			of the Court is discretionary and must be exercised on such
			<lb />
			judicial principles when balance of convenience and possibility
			<lb />
			of irreparable loss and injury is shown to the plaintiff [Ref. 2005
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(120) DLT 387, Geep Batteries (India) Pvt. lid. v. Gillette India
			<lb />
			Ltd.; 2005 (81) DRJ 233, Techno Construction v. Kunj Vihar
			<lb />
			Co-operative Group Housing Society].
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(v) The discretionary power of the Court under Section 9 has to
			<lb />
			be exercised by the Court sparingly and cautiously, bearing in
			<lb />
			mind that the objective of the Court is to create an alternative
			<lb />
			dispute redressal mechanism and, consequently, the interference
			<lb />
			by the Court is not required at every stage [Ref. 2006 (128) DLT
			<lb />
			694 DB, Sanrachna (India) Inc. v. AB Hotels Ltd.].
			<lb />
			Whenever the powers of the Courts are invoked under Section 9
			<lb />
			with the objective of supporting the arbitration, the Court must
			<lb />
			act with alacrity. However, this would not justify grant of interim
			<lb />
			orders and relief on the mere asking [Ref. 2000 (6) AD (Delhi)
			<lb />
			509 : 2000 (55) DRJ 750, CREF Finance Ltd. v. Puri
			<lb />
			Construction Ltd.; 2006 (91) DRJ 83, Sea Transport
			<lb />
			Contractors Ltd. v. Indian Farmers Fertilizers Co-operative
			<lb />
			Ltd.].
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vi) The scope and object of Section 9 of the statute is to grant
			<lb />
			such relief by way of interlocutory injunction so as to mitigate
			<lb />
			the risk or injustice to the petitioner during the period before that
			<lb />
			uncertainty can be resolved. Its object is to protect the plaintiff
			<lb />
			against injury by violation of his right for which he could not be
			<lb />
			adequately compensated in damages which would be recoverable
			<lb />
			in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the
			<lb />
			trial [Ref. (1995) 5 SCC 545 : AIR 1995 SC 2372, Gujarat
			<lb />
			Bottling Co. v. Coca Cola &amp; Co.; 2006 (4) AD (Delhi) 38,
			<lb />
			Country Development &amp; Management Services Pvt. Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Brookeside Resorts Pvt. Ltd.]. In 2006 133 DLT 153, Shaw v.
			<lb />
			Him Neel Brewaries Ltd., learned Single Judge of this Court
			<lb />
			held that the interim orders are calculated to ensure that the assets
			<lb />
			of the party are not dissipated or frittered away and that such
			<lb />
			orders do not fall within the moratorium of Section 22.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(vii) The application seeking interim measures of protection
			<lb />
			under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
			<lb />
			pertaining to the preservation, interim custody or sale of
			<lb />
			equipment which is the subject matter of the agreement would be
			<lb />
			covered under Section 9(ii)(a) as also under Sections 9(ii)(c),
			<lb />
			9(ii)(d) and 9(ii)(e) of the Act [Ref. 2006 (3) AD (Delhi) 168 :
			<lb />
			2006 (87) DRJ 225 : AIR 2006 Delhi 134, National Highways
			<lb />
			Authority of India (NHAI) v. China Coal Construction Group
			<lb />
			Co.].
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(viii) The Court has the power to pass an order under Section 9
			<lb />
			during the pendency of the arbitration or even after the arbitral
			<lb />
			award but before the award is enforced in accordance with
			<lb />
			Section 36. Such order can be passed for preservation, interim
			<lb />
			custody or sale of any goods which are the subject matter of the
			<lb />
			arbitration agreement or securing the amount in the dispute and
			<lb />
			the like [Ref. 2006 (128) DLT 694, Sanrachna (India) Inc. v.
			<lb />
			AB Hotels Ltd.; 2000 (87) DLT 449, CREF Finance Ltd. v.
			<lb />
			Puri Construction].
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ix) The power under Section 9 to grant interim relief is available
			<lb />
			to the Court while under Section 17, such powers to make
			<lb />
			interim measures are made available to the Arbitral Tribunal.
			<lb />
			Even though there may be some degree of overlap between the
			<lb />
			two provisions, however, the powers under Section 9 are much
			<lb />
			wider inasmuch as they extend to the pre and post award period
			<lb />
			as well as with regard to the subject matter and the nature of the
			<lb />
			orders which the Court is empowered to pass. Therefore,
			<lb />
			pendency of an application under Section 17 before the Arbitral
			<lb />
			Tribunal does not denude the Court of its power to make an order
			<lb />
			for interim measures under Section 9 of the statute [Ref. 2006 (3)
			<lb />
			AD (Delhi) 168 : 2006 (87) DRJ 225 : AIR 2006 Delhi 134,
			<lb />
			National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) v. China Coal
			<lb />
			Construction Group Co.]
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(x) It has been held that though Section 9 enables a party, before
			<lb />
			or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of
			<lb />
			the arbitral award but before it is enforced under Section 36 of
			<lb />
			the Act, may apply to the Court for an interim order under
			<lb />
			Section 9, however, without a substantive move for reference or
			<lb />
			declaration on the petitioner&apos;s stand on the substantive relief by
			<lb />
			an appropriate forum, Section 9 cannot be invoked for grant of
			<lb />
			interim relief [Ref. (2004) 3 SCC 155, Firm Ashok Tralers v.
			<lb />
			Gurmukh Das; (1999) 2 SCC 479 : AIR 1999 SC 565,
			<lb />
			Sudarshan Finance Ltd. v. NEPC; 1998 (1) AD (Delhi) 513 :
			<lb />
			1998 (44) DRJ 399, National Building Construction
			<lb />
			Corporation Ltd. (NBCC) v. Ircon International Ltd.].&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			15. No doubt the question as to whether the agreement between the parties
			<lb />
			was validly concluded or whether it was validly terminated has to be
			<lb />
			determined only in the arbitration proceedings and cannot be determined in a
			<lb />
			petition under Section 9 of the statute [Ref. 2002 (8) AD (Delhi) 617 : 2003
			<lb />
			(66) DRJ 239, S. Raminder Singh v. NCT of Delhi].&quot; Nonetheless, the
			<lb />
			Court is of the considered opinion that a party applying under Section 9 of
			<lb />
			the Act, has to establish the well known attributes that are necessary for
			<lb />
			grant of the equitable relief of injunction. The general rules that govern the
			<lb />
			Court while considering the grant of interim injunction, are equally
			<lb />
			applicable while dealing with a petition under Section 9 of the Act. The
			<lb />
			threshold of prima facie case has to be rigidly applied and should be shown
			<lb />
			to exist in favour of the Petitioner. Here, the prima facie case has to be
			<lb />
			understood in some context and cannot be decided in vacuum without
			<lb />
			referring to the facts and circumstances of the case. The Petitioner may be
			<lb />
			correct in saying that the potential claim today has not been crystallized,
			<lb />
			however the relief of interim measure has to be examined and evaluated
			<lb />
			keeping in mind the ultimate relief that the Petitioner is intending to seek in
			<lb />
			the arbitration proceedings which unmistakably inter alia includes relief of
			<lb />
			specific performance of the obligations of Respondent No. 1 under the SHA.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16. The Petitioner thus cannot be relieved of its burden to establish pre-
			<lb />
			requisite obligation to show readiness and willingness to perform its
			<lb />
			obligations for obtaining the relief of specific performance. The present
			<lb />
			petition is one under Section 9 of the Act but nevertheless the rigors of grant
			<lb />
			of interim relief in a case relating to specific performance would since apply
			<lb />
			in the same degree. The Supreme Court in Adhunik Steels Ltd v. Orissa
			<lb />
			Manganese and Minerals (P) Ltd. (2007) 7 SCC 125 has held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;10. It is true that Section 9 of the Act speaks of the court by way
			<lb />
			of an interim measure passing an order for protection, for the
			<lb />
			preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods, which are the
			<lb />
			subject matter of the arbitration agreement and such interim
			<lb />
			measure of protection as may appear to the court to be just and
			<lb />
			convenient. The grant of an interim prohibitory injunction or an
			<lb />
			interim mandatory injunction are governed by well known rules
			<lb />
			and it is difficult to imagine that the legislature while
			<lb />
			enacting Section 9 of the Act intended to make a provision which
			<lb />
			was de hors the accepted principles that governed the grant of an
			<lb />
			interim injunction. Same is the position regarding the
			<lb />
			appointment of a receiver since the Section itself brings in, the
			<lb />
			concept of &apos;just and convenient&apos; while speaking of passing any
			<lb />
			interim measure of protection. The concluding words of the
			<lb />
			Section, &quot;and the court shall have the same power for making
			<lb />
			orders as it has for the purpose and in relation to any proceedings
			<lb />
			before it&quot; also suggest that the normal rules that govern the court
			<lb />
			in the grant of interim orders is not sought to be jettisoned by the
			<lb />
			provision. Moreover, when a party is given a right to approach an
			<lb />
			ordinary court of the country without providing a special
			<lb />
			procedure or a special set of rules in that behalf, the ordinary
			<lb />
			rules followed by that court would govern the exercise of power
			<lb />
			conferred by the Act. On that basis also, it is not possible to keep
			<lb />
			out the concept of balance of convenience, prima facie case,
			<lb />
			irreparable injury and the concept of just and convenient while
			<lb />
			passing interim measures under Section 9 of the Act.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			14. In Nepa Limited Vs. Manoj Kumar Agrawal [AIR 1999 MP
			<lb />
			57], a learned judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court has
			<lb />
			suggested that when moved under Section 9 of the Act for
			<lb />
			interim protection, the provisions of the Specific Relief
			<lb />
			Act cannot be made applicable since in taking interim measures
			<lb />
			under Section 9 of the Act, the court does not decide on the
			<lb />
			merits of the case or the rights of parties and considers only the
			<lb />
			question of existence of an arbitration clause and the necessity of
			<lb />
			taking interim measures for issuing necessary directions or
			<lb />
			orders. When the grant of relief by way of injunction is, in
			<lb />
			general, governed by the Specific Relief Act, and Section 9 of the
			<lb />
			Act provides for an approach to the court for an interim
			<lb />
			injunction, we wonder how the relevant provisions of
			<lb />
			the Specific Relief Act can be kept out of consideration. For, the
			<lb />
			grant of that interim injunction has necessarily to be based on the
			<lb />
			principles governing its grant emanating out of the relevant
			<lb />
			provisions of the Specific Relief Act and the law bearing on the
			<lb />
			subject.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			17. The aforesaid decision has also been consistently followed and upheld in
			<lb />
			several other decisions. I am unable to see as to how the judgment in
			<lb />
			Adhunik Steel Ltd. (supra) is of any assistance to the Petitioner. On the
			<lb />
			contrary, in the said judgment as noted above, the Supreme Court has held
			<lb />
			that it would not be correct to say that the power under Section 9 of the Act
			<lb />
			is totally independent of the well known principles governing the grant of
			<lb />
			interim directions that generally govern the Courts in this direction. The
			<lb />
			other judgments relied upon by the Petitioner in Firm Ashok Traders and
			<lb />
			Anr. v. Gurumukh Das Saluja &amp; Ors, (2004) 3 SCC 155 and of this Court
			<lb />
			in National Highways Authority (supra) and the judgment of the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in N. Srinivasa v Kuttukaran Machine Tools Ltd. (2009) 5 SCC 162,
			<lb />
			lay down a well settled proposition in law that the interpretation of the terms
			<lb />
			and conditions of the Contract is to be decided in the arbitration proceedings
			<lb />
			and not by the Court in the petition under Section 9 of the Act. Although the
			<lb />
			Apex Court in Firm Ashok Traders (supra) has held that the court under
			<lb />
			Section 9 is only formulating interim measures so as to protect the right
			<lb />
			under adjudication before the Arbitral Tribunal from being frustrated,
			<lb />
			however, the same cannot be interpreted to mean that such interim relief has
			<lb />
			to be granted as a matter of fact de hors the final relief sought. In the case of
			<lb />
			Ajay Singh v Kal Airways Private Limited [2018]209CompCas154(Delhi)
			<lb />
			following Films Rover International Ltd. v. Cannon Film Sales Ltd.
			<lb />
			(1986) 3 All ER 772, it has been observed that the principal dilemma about
			<lb />
			the grant of interlocutory injunctions, whether prohibitory or mandatory, is
			<lb />
			that there is by definition a risk that the court may make the &apos;wrong&apos;
			<lb />
			decision, in the sense of granting an injunction to a party who fails to
			<lb />
			establish his right at the trial (or would fail if there was a trial) or
			<lb />
			alternatively, in failing to grant an injunction to a party who succeeds (or
			<lb />
			would succeed) at trial and a fundamental principle is therefore that the court
			<lb />
			should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice,
			<lb />
			keeping in view the final relief sought in the trial if it should turn out to have
			<lb />
			been &apos;wrong&apos; in the sense described.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			18. The above observations lay down fundamental principles to be applied
			<lb />
			when it comes to granting injunctions and from a reading of the several
			<lb />
			judgments relied upon by the Petitioner and the Respondent, it clearly
			<lb />
			emerges that the volley of allegations leveled by both the parties concerning
			<lb />
			their conduct, construction and interpretation of the Contract are within the
			<lb />
			realm of the arbitration proceedings. I do not intend to decide any of several
			<lb />
			disputed questions of fact relating to the conduct, viz. existence of a
			<lb />
			concluded contract; whether time is the essence of the Contract etc. But it
			<lb />
			does not mean that the Court is denuded of its power to delve into the facts
			<lb />
			of the case to ascertain whether the Petitioner fulfills the criteria for grant of
			<lb />
			ad interim injunction. To this limited extent the Court has to necessarily
			<lb />
			form a prima facie view. While undertaking this exercise, the corresponding
			<lb />
			rights of the Respondent would also be required to be examined. The
			<lb />
			principle of balance of convenience would also have to be applied while
			<lb />
			arriving at the just conclusion. The Petitioner&apos;s argument that at this stage
			<lb />
			the test of specific performance and the attending attributes for grant of
			<lb />
			interim order need not be applied is not appealing and I reject the same. I
			<lb />
			would like to make it clear that the opinion expressed later in the judgment,
			<lb />
			is only a prima facie view of the matter and the same would not influence
			<lb />
			the proceedings before the Arbitrator. The examination and evaluation of
			<lb />
			the facts has been done only to the extent it was necessary to determine as to
			<lb />
			whether the Petitioner is entitled to grant of an interim injunction or order.
			<lb />

		<p>
			Enforceability of ROFR as a negative covenant
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			19. Mr. Nayar has strenuously argued that ROFR under the SHA is in the
			<lb />
			nature of a negative covenant. He argued that Petitioner has exercised its
			<lb />
			ROFR under Clause 3.7 of the SHA and Respondent No. 1 is now bound to
			<lb />
			transfer the same to the Petitioner and Respondent No.1&apos;s understanding is
			<lb />
			based on an erroneous interpretation of the SHA, and at this stage since it
			<lb />
			has refused to comply with its obligations, Petitioner is entitled to enforce
			<lb />
			the negative covenant. Mr. Rajiv Nayar also argued that Section 42 of the
			<lb />
			Specific Relief Act, begins with the non-obstante clause &quot;notwithstanding
			<lb />
			anything contained in Clause (e) of Section 41&quot; and the Court is not
			<lb />
			precluded to grant an injunction to perform the negative agreement even if
			<lb />
			there are circumstances that prevent the Court to compel specific
			<lb />
			performance of the affirmative agreement. In support of this contention, Mr.
			<lb />
			Nayar has relied upon several judgments including the decisions of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court of Canada and several other foreign judgments in support of
			<lb />
			his contentions that a right of first refusal in essence is a negative covenant.
			<lb />
			The relevant portions of the said judgments read as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(a) In Canadian Long Island Petroleums Ltd. et al. v. Irving
			<lb />
			Industries Ltd., [1975] 2 S.C.R. 715, the Supreme Court of Canada
			<lb />
			held:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;In my opinion the right conferred by cl. 13 of the agreement in
			<lb />
			question here did not create property rights. Each party agreed
			<lb />
			that upon the occurrence of a certain event, which was within
			<lb />
			its own control, the other party would have a first right of
			<lb />
			purchase for a 30-day period. As mentioned previously, the
			<lb />
			clause is a part of an agreement between joint owners of a
			<lb />
			property, governing the operation and development of it. In
			<lb />
			essence it is a negative covenant whereby each party agrees not
			<lb />
			to substitute a third party as a joint owner with the other,
			<lb />
			without permitting the other party the opportunity, by meeting
			<lb />
			the proposed terms of sale, to acquire full ownership.
			<lb />
			As I have already indicated, the provisions of cl. 13 involve a
			<lb />
			negative covenant not to part with Sadim&quot;s interest in the land
			<lb />
			to any other person without giving a first right of refusal to the
			<lb />
			respondents. This was a restrictive covenant given to the
			<lb />
			respondents for the benefit of their undivided one-half interest
			<lb />
			in the land. In equity the covenant bound the appellant Long
			<lb />
			Island unless it could establish, as clearly on the evidence it
			<lb />
			could not, that it had obtained title without notice of the
			<lb />
			covenant.&quot;

			<lb />

		<item>
			&quot;24. However, I agree with Mr Odgers that a convenient
			<lb />
			starting point is the passage in Halsbury&quot;s Laws of England
			<lb />
			(4 th edn), volume 9(1), Reissue, at paragraph 641:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;641. First refusals
			<lb />
			Similar to the contract of option is the contract of &quot;first
			<lb />
			refusal&quot; or &quot;pre-emption&quot;, whereby one person (A) enters into
			<lb />
			a contract with a second person (B) which provides that if A
			<lb />
			contemplates entering into a certain defined contract or type of
			<lb />
			contract with anyone, he will first offer to do so with B. That
			<lb />
			type of contract differs from the contract of option in that A has
			<lb />
			made no positive offer; his duty will usually be the purely
			<lb />
			negative one of not contracting with any third person (C) in the
			<lb />
			defined respect unless and until he has first offered to do so
			<lb />
			with B, though that offer may be conditional or assignable; but
			<lb />
			it is conceivable that his duty may merely be that, if he does so
			<lb />
			contract with C, he will make that contract subject to B&quot;s right
			<lb />
			of first refusal. Where A in breach of the first refusal contract
			<lb />
			sells to C, it may be that the first refusal becomes an option.
			<lb />
			There may be a contract of option and first refusal, whereby B
			<lb />
			is given an option and a right of first refusal; or where B is
			<lb />
			granted an option in return for his granting A a right of first
			<lb />
			refusal. Similarly, there may be a contract of double option
			<lb />
			where each grants the other an option on the happening of a
			<lb />
			certain event.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			A difficulty with contracts of first refusal is whether the parties
			<lb />
			have completed their negotiations and have reached an
			<lb />
			agreement; if not, there may be no binding contract, merely an
			<lb />
			agreement to negotiate. On the other hand, there may be a
			<lb />
			binding provisional or conditional agreement; or a binding
			<lb />
			collateral agreement not to negotiate with a third party (a
			<lb />
			&quot;lock-out agreement&quot;). Where the parties have not completed
			<lb />
			their negotiations, it seems that a binding &quot;lockout&quot; agreement
			<lb />
			cannot be created by implying a term that A will continue to
			<lb />
			negotiate with B in good faith; but it may be that an express
			<lb />
			agreement to use best endeavours to conclude a contract with B
			<lb />
			is binding, whereas there can be no contract on the basis of
			<lb />
			such an implied term.&quot;

			(c) In Geoffrey John Dear v. Reginald Graham Reeves [2001]
			<lb />
			EWCA Civ 277, the Court of Appeal held:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;38. I am in no doubt that the right of pre-emption conferred by
			<lb />
			the deed of 1 August 1988 is &quot;property&quot; within the definition in
			<lb />
			section 436 of the 1986 Act and that it is accordingly vested in
			<lb />
			the trustee. The judge was wrong in treating it as still vested in
			<lb />
			Mr Reeves.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			41. It is a &quot;thing in action&quot; in the sense that
			<lb />
			i) there exists a negative obligation, which would not exist but
			<lb />
			for the Deed of pre-emption;
			<lb />
			ii) it is binding on the grantor, who obliged not to sell the
			<lb />
			Property to anyone without first making an offer to the grantee;
			<lb />
			iii) in the event of a decision of the grantor to sell the Property,
			<lb />
			the obligation is enforceable by legal action by the grantee or
			<lb />
			his assignee;
			<lb />
			iv) in such an action the grantee could obtain an injunction to
			<lb />
			restrain sale of the Property to another person, until the
			<lb />
			grantor has first made an offer to the grantee and the grantee
			<lb />
			has failed or refused to take up the offer; and, if the grantor
			<lb />
			sells the Property to another person without first offering it to
			<lb />
			the grantee, he may be liable in damages to the grantee for
			<lb />
			breach of contract.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			20. Per contra, Mr. Amit Sibal has sought to distinguish the said judgments
			<lb />
			on facts. He argued that Clause 3.7.1 of the SHA does not envisage any
			<lb />
			negative covenant whether express or implied. On the contrary, the ROFR
			<lb />
			casts upon the share holder, the obligation to offer its share to the other
			<lb />
			shareholders, which is a positive covenant. Petitioner&apos;s interpretation that the
			<lb />
			ROFR is an implied negative covenant is erroneous. The positive obligation
			<lb />
			to offer the shares to existing shareholders before selling the shares to a third
			<lb />
			party, and the perceived negative covenant to not sell the shares to a third
			<lb />
			party during this offer period, are two sides of the same coin.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			21. Before proceeding further, let us first examine the relevant provisions of
			<lb />
			the Specific Relief Act (&quot;SRA&quot;) dealing with the concept of the negative
			<lb />
			covenant. The relevant Sections of the Act read as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;16. Personal bars to relief.-Specific performance of a
			<lb />
			contract cannot be enforced in favour of a person-
			<lb />
			[(a) who has obtained substituted performance of contract under
			<lb />
			section 20; or]
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) who has become incapable of performing, or violates any
			<lb />
			essential term of, the contract that on his part remains to be
			<lb />
			performed, or acts in fraud of the contract, or wilfully acts at
			<lb />
			variance with, or in subversion of, the relation intended to be
			<lb />
			established by the contract; or
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c) [who fails to prove] that he has performed or has always
			<lb />
			been ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the
			<lb />
			contract which are to be performed by him, other than terms of
			<lb />
			the performance of which has been prevented or waived by the
			<lb />
			defendant.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			Explanation.-For the purposes of clause (c),-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i) where a contract involves the payment of money, it is not
			<lb />
			essential for the plaintiff to actually tender to the defendant or
			<lb />
			to deposit in court any money except when so directed by the
			<lb />
			court;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) the plaintiff [must prove] performance of, or readiness and
			<lb />
			willingness to perform, the contract according to its true
			<lb />
			construction.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;41. Injunction when refused.-An injunction cannot be
			<lb />
			granted-
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(a) to restrain any person from prosecuting a judicial
			<lb />
			proceeding pending at the institution of the suit in which the
			<lb />
			injunction is sought, unless such restraint is necessary to
			<lb />
			prevent a multiplicity of proceedings;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(b) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any
			<lb />
			proceeding in a court not subordinate to that from which the
			<lb />
			injunction is sought;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(c) to restrain any person from applying to any legislative body;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(d) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any
			<lb />
			proceeding in a criminal matter;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(e) to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which
			<lb />
			would not be specifically enforced;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(f) to prevent, on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is
			<lb />
			not reasonably clear that it will be a nuisance;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(g) to prevent a continuing breach in which the plaintiff has
			<lb />
			acquiesced;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(h) when equally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by
			<lb />
			any other usual mode of proceeding except in case of breach of
			<lb />
			trust;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(i) when the conduct of the plaintiff or his agents has been such
			<lb />
			as to disentitle him to the assistance of the court;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(j) when the plaintiff has no personal interest in the matter.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;42. Injunction to perform negative agreement.-
			<lb />
			Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (e) of section 41,
			<lb />
			where a contract comprises an affirmative agreement to do a
			<lb />
			certain act, coupled with a negative agreement, express or
			<lb />
			implied, not to do a certain act, the circumstance that the court
			<lb />
			is unable to compel specific performance of the affirmative
			<lb />
			agreement shall not preclude it from granting an injunction to
			<lb />
			perform the negative agreement: Provided that the plaintiff has
			<lb />
			not failed to perform the contract so far as it is binding on him.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			22. Section 16 (c) of SRA, specific performance of a contract cannot be
			<lb />
			enforced in favor of a person who fails to prove that he has performed or has
			<lb />
			always been &quot;ready and willing&quot; to perform the essential terms of the
			<lb />
			contract which are to be performed by him. This provision has to be read
			<lb />
			along with Section 41 (e) of SRA which enjoins the Court not to grant
			<lb />
			injunctions to prevent the breach of a contract, in case the performance
			<lb />
			whereof cannot be specifically enforced. Section 42 has been framed as a
			<lb />
			non-obstante clause, notwithstanding the embargo contained in Section 41
			<lb />
			(e) of the Act. However, it does not mean that it is a mandate to the Court to
			<lb />
			grant an injunction for performance of a negative covenant in every case.
			<lb />
			The principle laid down by the Supreme Court in Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd.
			<lb />
			V. Coca Cola (1995) 5 SCC 545 enunciates the facets which must be borne
			<lb />
			in mind by the Court while granting injunction. Though in the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances of the afore-noted case, an injunction was granted for
			<lb />
			enforcement of a negative covenant, it was observed that the Court must
			<lb />
			exercise its discretion and is not bound to grant an injunction wherever there
			<lb />
			exists a negative covenant. The Petitioner has to necessarily establish and
			<lb />
			base its case on the well known judicial principles relating to grant of
			<lb />
			interlocutory injunction i.e. (i). whether the Petitioner has made out a prima
			<lb />
			facie case; (ii). whether the balance of convenience is in favor of the
			<lb />
			Petitioner;(iii). whether the Petitioner would suffer irreparable loss or injury,
			<lb />
			if the prayer for interlocutory injunction were to be refused. The Supreme
			<lb />
			Court in the said case has held as under:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;42. In India section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963
			<lb />
			prescribes that notwithstanding anything contained in clause (e)
			<lb />
			of Section 41, where a contract comprises an affirmative
			<lb />
			agreement, express or implied, not to do a certain act, the
			<lb />
			circumstances that the court is unable to compel specific
			<lb />
			performance of the affirmative agreement shall not preclude it
			<lb />
			from granting an injunction to perform the negative agreement.
			<lb />
			This is subject to the proviso that the plaintiff has not failed to
			<lb />
			perform the contract so far as it is binding on him. The Court is,
			<lb />
			however, not bound to grant an injunction in every case and an
			<lb />
			injunction to enforce a negative covenant would be refused if it
			<lb />
			would indirectly compel the employee either to idleness or to
			<lb />
			serve the employer. [See: Ethrman v. Bartholomew. (1927)
			<lb />
			W.N. 233; N.S.Golikari (supra) at p. 389].
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			43. The grant of an interlocutory injunction during the pendency
			<lb />
			of legal proceedings is a matter requiring the exercise of
			<lb />
			discretion of the court. While exercising the discretion the court
			<lb />
			applies the following tests -(i) whether the plaintiff has a prima
			<lb />
			facie case; (ii) whether the balance of convenience is in favour of
			<lb />
			the plaintiff; and (iii) whether the plaintiff would suffer an
			<lb />
			irreparable injury if his prayer for interlocutory injunction is
			<lb />
			disallowed. The decision whether or not to grant an interlocutory
			<lb />
			injunction has to be taken at a time when the existence of the
			<lb />
			legal right assailed by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are
			<lb />
			both contested and uncertain and its alleged violation are both
			<lb />
			contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they are
			<lb />
			established at the trial on evidence. Relief by way of
			<lb />
			interlocutory injunction is granted to mitigate the risk of injustice
			<lb />
			to the plaintiff during the period before that uncertainty could be
			<lb />
			resolved. The object of the interlocutory injunction is to protect
			<lb />
			the plaintiff against injury by violation of his right for which he
			<lb />
			could not be adequately compensated in damages recoverable in
			<lb />
			the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the
			<lb />
			trial. The need for such protection has, however, to be weighed
			<lb />
			against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected
			<lb />
			against injury resulting from his having been prevented from
			<lb />
			exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be
			<lb />
			adequately compensated. The court must weigh one need against
			<lb />
			another and determine where the &apos;balance of convenience&apos; lies.
			<lb />
			[see:Wander Ltd.&amp;Anr. v,.Antox India P. Ltd., 1990 (suoo) Scc
			<lb />
			727 at pp. 731-32]. In order to protect the Defendant while
			<lb />
			granting an interlocutory injunction in his favour the Court can
			<lb />
			require the plaintiff to furnish an undertaking so that the
			<lb />
			defendant can be adequately compensated if the uncertainty were
			<lb />
			resolved in his favour at the trial.&quot;
			<lb />
			Whether there is a separate distinct negative covenant?
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			23. Now let&apos;s analyze the ROFR clause to see if it contains a negative
			<lb />
			covenant. A bare reading of Clause 3.7.1 of the SHA shows that this clause
			<lb />
			on its own does not restrict or prohibit Respondent No. 1 to sell its shares to
			<lb />
			a third party. It only gives the Petitioner a right of first refusal, prior to
			<lb />
			affecting a sale to a third party. The question that arises for consideration is
			<lb />
			whether such a right would constitute a negative covenant.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			24. The situation in hand is quite similar to the one in Percept D&apos;Mark India
			<lb />
			Pvt. v Zaheer Khan AIR 2006 SC 3426. In the said case, the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court has inter alia held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;&quot;Clause 31(b) of the agreement merely provides for an
			<lb />
			obligation of respondent No. 1 to give an opportunity to
			<lb />
			the appellant to match the offer, if any, received by
			<lb />
			respondent No. 1 from the third party. This clause does
			<lb />
			not per se restrict or prohibit respondent No. 1 to enter
			<lb />
			into any contract with a third party but at best it
			<lb />
			provides the appellant with an opportunity to gain from
			<lb />
			the advertisements the appellant has made in the process
			<lb />
			of marketing and creation of the image of respondent No.
			<lb />
			1 which was gradually built up by the appellant. This
			<lb />
			clause does not restrict the right of respondent No. 1 to
			<lb />
			accept any offer for endorsement, promotion,
			<lb />
			advertising or other affiliation either on his own or
			<lb />
			through any party in the event of failure of the
			<lb />
			appellant to match the offer of the third party from
			<lb />
			whom respondent No. 1 would receive any offer,
			<lb />
			respondent No. 1 would be free to contract with such
			<lb />
			third party.&quot;
			<lb />
			(Emphasis supplied)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			25. Mr. Amit Sibal is correct in saying that in the agreement there is no
			<lb />
			negative covenant distinct from a positive covenant as envisaged in section
			<lb />
			42 of the Act. The said provision envisages the existence of a contract
			<lb />
			comprising of an affirmative agreement to do a certain act, coupled with a
			<lb />
			negative agreement, expressed or implied not to do a certain act. The
			<lb />
			covenant in the agreement not to sell or transfer the shares to a third party
			<lb />
			stems out of the requirement under the agreement to offer to the existing
			<lb />
			share holders prior to affecting the sale to a third party. The negative
			<lb />
			covenant does not exist independent of the positive covenant. Respondent
			<lb />
			No. 1 has the obligation to offer the shares to the Petitioner and this
			<lb />
			obligation correspondingly also restricts it from offering the shares to a third
			<lb />
			party during the ROFR period. Both the obligations go hand in hand and are
			<lb />
			not separable. I do not agree with the submission of the Petitioner that the
			<lb />
			negative obligation under the SHA is separate, distinct and severable from
			<lb />
			the positive obligation. If Petitioner&apos;s interpretation is allowed to be
			<lb />
			sustained, it would render the entire section meaningless. The enforcement
			<lb />
			of the so called negative covenant is necessarily and intrinsically linked to
			<lb />
			the fact that the Petitioner has a positive right to exercise its ROFR and is
			<lb />
			arising out of the positive obligation. There can be a connection between the
			<lb />
			two, however the standard required for invocation of the negative covenant
			<lb />
			as provided under Section 42 is not fulfilled in the present case. This Court
			<lb />
			is not suggesting that the negative covenant has to be necessarily express. It
			<lb />
			can be implied as well, as stipulated in Section 42 of SRA. Nonetheless the
			<lb />
			contract must have an affirmative agreement coupled with an independent
			<lb />
			negative agreement. The ROFR clause cannot be construed as a negative
			<lb />
			agreement which can be performed by grant of an injunction. In Yogesh
			<lb />
			Radhakrishnan v. Media Networks &amp; Distribution (India) Ltd. An Ors.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			(2013) 135 DRJ 511 has held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;The negative covenant, enforcement whereof is provided for in
			<lb />
			section 42 of the Specific Relief Act has to be distinct from the
			<lb />
			Agreement which is found to be not enforceable. Section 42 of
			<lb />
			the Specific Relief Act provides for a situation where even
			<lb />
			though the agreement may be found to be specifically not
			<lb />
			enforceable but the defendant has separately agreed not to do a
			<lb />
			certain act and permits grant of an injunction restraining the
			<lb />
			defendant from doing that act. It cannot be interpreted as
			<lb />
			making the agreement which is non-enforceable, enforceable.&quot;
			<lb />

			26. In my considered opinion, the ROFR under the SHA is not in the nature
			<lb />
			of a negative covenant. It is at best a restriction that arises correspondent to
			<lb />
			the obligation on the Respondent No. 1 to offer the shares to the Petitioner in
			<lb />
			terms of the ROFR Clause. I have carefully examined the judgments relied
			<lb />
			upon by the Petitioner. The said judgments are distinguishable on facts and
			<lb />
			do not relate to specific performance or injunction in support of specific
			<lb />
			performance. For this Court, the views expressed by the Apex Court in
			<lb />
			Percept D&apos; Mark (supra) and the other judgments referred above are more
			<lb />
			apt. Petitioner has also relied upon other judgments of this Court in support
			<lb />
			of the contention relating to enforceability of the negative covenant being
			<lb />
			Vijaya Minerals Pvt. Ltd. v. Bikash Chandra Deb 1995 SCC OnLine Cal
			<lb />
			181;Image Advertisingv. Anand Prakash176 (2011) DLT 97;Modi Rubber
			<lb />
			Ltd.v. Guardian International Corp. 2007 SCC OnLine Del 502;Indian
			<lb />
			Charge Chrome Ltd.v. Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd., 1995 SCC OnLine
			<lb />
			Cal 28; and Rajasthan Breweries Ltd.v. Stroh Brewery Co.,2000 (55) DRJ
			<lb />
			(DB).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			27. It is also to be noted that the judgment in Vijaya Minerals Pvt. Ltd. V.
			<lb />
			Bikash Chandra Deb (supra), has been held to be not good law in another
			<lb />
			decision of same strength in SVF Entertainment Pvt. Ltd v Anupriyo Sen
			<lb />
			Gupta (2018) 3 Cal LT 115. All the aforenoted judgments are also
			<lb />
			distinguishable on facts, as the negative covenant involved in the said cases
			<lb />
			is distinct and stand alone. In Modi Rubber Ltd. (supra), the negative
			<lb />
			covenant on the basis whereof injunction was granted was a non-compete
			<lb />
			clause of the SHA. The Court, however need not detain itself by discussing
			<lb />
			and distinguishing each case, as there is no quarrel on the principles
			<lb />
			enunciated in the said decisions. The Courts have been granting injunctions
			<lb />
			on the basis of a negative covenant contained in a contract and there is no
			<lb />
			dispute on this. However, each case would turn on its own facts and the
			<lb />
			Courts would be required to critically analyze the Clause which has been
			<lb />
			done as discussed above and the result is against the Petitioner.
			<lb />
			Whether the provisions of Specific Relief Act are not attracted when a party
			<lb />
			is seeking enforcement of a negative covenant?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			28. As noted above, the considered opinion of this Court, there is no
			<lb />
			negative covenant and even for the sake of arguments, if it is assumed that
			<lb />
			there one, it does not mean that the Court while examining the facts of the
			<lb />
			case would not be required to look into the aspects for granting the equitable
			<lb />
			relief of injunction. The Court is not prevented from examining the
			<lb />
			Petitioner&apos;s financial means to conclude the transaction and whether it is
			<lb />
			ready and willing to perform its obligations in terms of Section 16 (e) of the
			<lb />
			SRA. This is more so because the ultimate relief of the Petitioner in the
			<lb />
			arbitration proceedings would be enforcement of Petitioner&apos;s preferential
			<lb />
			shares. It would be incumbent upon the Court to look into the aspects of
			<lb />
			whether the bar under Sections 16 and 41 (e) of the SRA are attracted or not.
			<lb />
			Petitioner has sought to delink the present case with the ultimate claim in the
			<lb />
			arbitration proceedings by contending that the present petition is only for
			<lb />
			maintaining status quo and preservation of the subject matter till the final
			<lb />
			adjudication between the parties. As already discussed above, I find this
			<lb />
			contention to be meritless.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			29. Before parting with the discussion on the plea of negative covenant, it
			<lb />
			would also be relevant to note that Section 42 of the Act also contains a
			<lb />
			proviso which requires the Petitioner to perform its part of the obligation in
			<lb />
			order to seek the relief of injunction which is otherwise prohibited by virtue
			<lb />
			of Section 41 (e) of SRA. Thus, in case the Court were to come to a
			<lb />
			conclusion that the Petitioner has failed to perform the contract in so far as it
			<lb />
			is binding on it, then notwithstanding the fact that there is a negative
			<lb />
			covenant, the Court would still be entitled to decline the relief for injunction.
			<lb />
			Granting an injunction under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act is not
			<lb />
			mandatory merely because there is a negative covenant. The Court would
			<lb />
			exercise its discretion in granting the equitable relief of injunction, having
			<lb />
			regard to the elements of prima facie case, balance of convenience and
			<lb />
			irreparable injury.
			<lb />
			Whether the Petitioner has established the ingredients for grant of
			<lb />
			injunction?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			1. Prima facie case
			<lb />
			A) WHETHER THERE IS A CONCLUDED CONTRACT? WHETHER THE LONG STOP
			<lb />
			DATE OF 30 DAYS IS A MANDATORY CLAUSE AND WHETHER TIME IS OF ESSENCE
			<lb />
			? WHETHER THE RESPONDENT NO. 1 HAS WAIVED THE ENFORCEMENT
			<lb />
			THEREOF? IF YES, WHETHER THE 30 DAY TIME PERIOD IS TO BE CALCULATED
			<lb />
			FROM THE DATE ON WHICH APPROVALS ARE OBTAINED?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			30. Mr. Nayar contended that there is a concluded contract between the
			<lb />
			Petitioner and Respondent No. 1 for the transfer of the shares in terms of the
			<lb />
			SHA and the execution of the SPA by Respondent No. 1 is only a formality
			<lb />
			that is required in order to apply for and obtain the various approvals/
			<lb />
			permissions including from statutory authorities and lenders which are
			<lb />
			needed to complete the transaction. It was contended that the petitioner has
			<lb />
			exercised its option vide its letter dated 19 th February 2019, even though the
			<lb />
			first PP Offer Notice did not mention the terms and conditions, and
			<lb />
			reconfirmed such exercise vide its letter dated 11 th March 2019. Respondent
			<lb />
			No. 1 is bound and liable to abide by the terms of said concluded contract,
			<lb />
			which is in terms of the SHA and complete in all material aspects. In this
			<lb />
			regard, the Petitioner relied on the judgments of the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			Trimex International FZE Limited Dubai v. Vedanta Aluminium India
			<lb />
			(2010) 3 SCC 1 @ Para 49, 50, 58-60, 63, 64, Old World Hospitality
			<lb />
			Private Limited v. India Habitat Centre 1996 SCC Online Del 580 @ Para
			<lb />
			64-67, 69-70, 73, 94-95
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			31. Mr. Nayar further argued that as per the Respondent No. 1&apos;s
			<lb />
			interpretation/ stand that the entire transaction had to be consummated
			<lb />
			within 30 (thirty) days from the date of the offer notice (though denied by
			<lb />
			the Petitioner), the period of 30 (thirty) days expired long time back on 25 th
			<lb />
			February 2019. However, Respondent No. 1 vide its letter dated 4 th March
			<lb />
			2019 immediately allowed the Petitioner 30 (thirty) more days after making
			<lb />
			its purported offer dated 26 th January 2019 and along with the said letter sent
			<lb />
			the SPA which was accepted and signed by the Petitioner. The above is
			<lb />
			further evident inter alia from Respondent No. 1&apos;s letter dated 25th April
			<lb />
			2019 (which it wrote after filing its Reply to the Petition) vide which it
			<lb />
			wrote to the Company&apos;s lenders and inter alia stated that furnishing a term
			<lb />
			sheet is not required under the relevant agreements and once again requested
			<lb />
			the lenders to provide their consent. As such, Respondent No. 1&apos;s conduct
			<lb />
			also belies its alternative position that the 30 days period expired on 4 th April
			<lb />
			2019. Apart from the fact that Respondent No. 1 has delayed the process of
			<lb />
			applying for approvals even though it now continues to treat the agreement
			<lb />
			between the parties as subsisting despite the period of 30 days having been
			<lb />
			purportedly expired on 25 th February 2019. Respondent No. 1&apos;s aforesaid
			<lb />
			position is also contrary to its conduct as well as the documents on record.
			<lb />
			For instance, it wrote to the lenders for the first time only on 27 th March
			<lb />
			2019 asking for the requisite approvals. Respondent No. 1&apos;s letters were
			<lb />
			conspicuously silent about the fact that the period in which the sale
			<lb />
			transaction is to be consummated would expire on 4 th April 2019. Thus, if
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1 genuinely treated time as being of the essence, it ought to
			<lb />
			have treated Petitioner&apos;s right as having expired/ lapsed immediately after
			<lb />
			the expiry of the 30 days&apos; period on 25 th February 2019 (or alternatively on
			<lb />
			4 th April 2019).Reliance was placed on the following cases Keshavlal
			<lb />
			Lallubhai Patel v. LalbhaiTrikum Mills Ltd, AIR 1958 SC 512 ,S.
			<lb />
			Brahmanand v. K Muthugopal, (2005) 12 SCC 764 to contend that it is
			<lb />
			settled law that under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 extension of time for
			<lb />
			performance of a contract may be inferred from the conduct of the parties.
			<lb />
			Thus, even if the time is regarded as of essence, Respondent No. 1, by its
			<lb />
			own conduct has acquiesced to the extension of the 30-day time period.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			32. On the question of interpretation, it is the case of the Petitioner that on a
			<lb />
			true construction of terms of the SHA, the period of 30 (thirty) days as set
			<lb />
			out under Clause 3.7.1 (iii) of the SHA has to be computed by excluding the
			<lb />
			time taken to obtain all requisite approvals/permissions for the transfer and
			<lb />
			for the seller to become capable of delivering the shares to the purchaser in a
			<lb />
			freely transferable form. This follows from the fact that any transfer of
			<lb />
			shares under the SHA to a Private Participant is subject to receipt of various
			<lb />
			approvals/permissions, which cannot be obtained within the period of 30
			<lb />
			(thirty) days. Even as per the timelines prescribed in the SPA sent by
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1 on 4 th March 2019, all requisite approvals/permissions
			<lb />
			cannot be obtained in a period of 30 days. For instance, as per Clause 3.1(e),
			<lb />
			the applications for permissions/approvals prescribed therein will have to be
			<lb />
			filed within 7 and 2 days (as prescribed therein); as per Clause 4.1, Closing
			<lb />
			shall take place within 14 days from completion of the steps prescribed in
			<lb />
			Clause 3.1; as per Clause 4.2 and 5.5.10 of SHA, a minimum of 14 days
			<lb />
			notice shall have to be given for a Board Meeting to approve the transfer of
			<lb />
			Shares. As such, even as per Respondent No. 1&apos;s own draft SPA, the
			<lb />
			transaction cannot be consummated within 30 days. In any event, in terms of
			<lb />
			Facility Agreements read with Clause 3 of the draft SPA, the seller is
			<lb />
			required to give at least a 60 days&apos; prior notice to lenders to seek their
			<lb />
			approval.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			33. Further, the Company is required to give a 60 (sixty) days&apos; prior written
			<lb />
			notice to its lenders under Clause 10.23.3 of the Facility Agreements. In
			<lb />
			terms of Clause 3.7.1(i) of the SHA, both the Remaining Private Participants
			<lb />
			have the preferential right to purchase the Seller&apos;s offered shares in
			<lb />
			proportion to their shareholding. If one of the Remaining Private
			<lb />
			Participants does not want to purchase the offered shares, then the other
			<lb />
			Remaining Private Participant has to purchase all the offered shares. In such
			<lb />
			a situation, such other Remaining Private Participant cannot possibly
			<lb />
			complete the purchase of offered shares within 30 (thirty) days since the
			<lb />
			other Remaining Private Participant has 30 (thirty) days to decide whether to
			<lb />
			purchase its proportion of the offered shares or not. Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul,
			<lb />
			learned senior counsel who initially appeared in the matter had also argued
			<lb />
			that the principle of &quot;business efficacy&quot; is normally invoked to read a term
			<lb />
			in the agreement or contract so as to achieve the result or the consequences
			<lb />
			intended by the parties. He further argued that in business transactions, the
			<lb />
			law desires to give business efficacy to the transaction, intended by the
			<lb />
			parties and not impose peril on the same. Reference was also made to
			<lb />
			several judgments including Boothalinga Agencies v. V.T.C. Poriaswanmi
			<lb />
			Nadar, (1969) 1 SCR 65, Satya Jain (Dead) Through LRs &amp;Ors v. Anis
			<lb />
			Ahmed Rushdie (Dead) Through Lrs, (2013) 8 SCC 131, Novartis
			<lb />
			Vaccines and Diagnostics Inc. v. Aventis Pharma Limited Decided on
			<lb />
			18.12.2009 in Arbitration Petition No. 763 of 2009 and Nabha Power
			<lb />
			Limited (NPL) v. Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) and
			<lb />
			Another, (2018) 11 SCC 508. He also argued that Respondent No. 1&apos;s
			<lb />
			interpretation of 30 days is absurd and contrary to the SPA and SHA.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			34. Per contra, Mr. Sibal submitted that a ROFR is always triggered by a
			<lb />
			desire to ultimately sell to a third party, with the offer to the ROFR-holder
			<lb />
			being a condition precedent to the sale to the third party. With regard to
			<lb />
			contracts for the sale of shares, time is inherently of the essence of the
			<lb />
			contract given that the value of the shares could widely fluctuate. If one
			<lb />
			were to assume that the ROFR was in fact perpetual, then both an
			<lb />
			underlying decrease in the value of the shares (causing a re-negotiation with
			<lb />
			the third party and a re-trigger of the ROFR) and an increase in the value of
			<lb />
			the shares (causing a loss in consideration received since the ROFR-holder
			<lb />
			would buy at lower than fair market value) will effectively turn value
			<lb />
			destructive to the seller. Therefore, this can never be the true or meaningful
			<lb />
			construction of any pre-emptive right, including a ROFR. In support of this
			<lb />
			submission, learned counsel placed reliance on the decisions in Hare v.
			<lb />
			Nicoll [1966] 2 Q.B. 130, In Re Schwabacher ((1908) 98 L.T. 127).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			35. Mr. Sibal further submitted that the interpretation given by the learned
			<lb />
			counsel for the Petitioner to the ROFR clause in 3.7.1 is incorrect. It was
			<lb />
			argued that the actual approvals required for the transaction to proceed are
			<lb />
			not the same as contended by the Petitioner and clause 3.6 of the SHA is not
			<lb />
			applicable to a sale of shares to a private participant. Under Clause 3.7 of the
			<lb />
			SHA, the only approvals required for a transfer from Respondent No. 1 to
			<lb />
			the Petitioner are approvals from Respondent No. 3 (required under Clause
			<lb />
			2.5 of the Operation Management &amp; Development Agreement (&quot;OMDA&quot;),
			<lb />
			and consent from the security trustee (and accordingly, the lenders) under
			<lb />
			the Share Pledge Agreement. Approval from the Competition Commission
			<lb />
			of India (&quot;CCI&quot;) is not required for a transfer of the PP Purchase Shares
			<lb />
			from Respondent No. 1 to the Petitioner, and accordingly, no prior notice
			<lb />
			needs to be provided to the CCI. Under Regulation 4 read with Item 2 of
			<lb />
			Schedule I of the Competition Commission of India (Procedure in regard to
			<lb />
			the transaction of business relating to combinations) Regulations, 2011, an
			<lb />
			acquisition of shares is exempt from approval where an acquirer prior to the
			<lb />
			acquisition has 50% or more shares in the target and the transaction does not
			<lb />
			result in a transfer from joint to sole control, which is the case herein.
			<lb />
			Further, it was submitted that procuring approval prior to issuance of a PP
			<lb />
			Offer Notice to the other shareholders is not within the framework of the
			<lb />
			SHA and any averment to the contrary leads to a preposterous conclusion.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			36. With respect to the interpretation of the ROFR clause and the 30-day
			<lb />
			timeline, it was argued that the interpretation sought to be given by the
			<lb />
			learned counsel for the Petitioner is flawed as the 30-day period set out in
			<lb />
			Clause 3.7.1(iii) of the SHA was the result of a negotiation between
			<lb />
			sophisticated commercial entities in 2006, and reflects the bargain struck by
			<lb />
			the parties. This balanced the risks for the proposed seller (who would not
			<lb />
			want an extended ROFR period), and the buyer (who would want to ensure
			<lb />
			that enough time is available for the purchase to be consummated).
			<lb />
			Moreover, clause 3.7.1(vii) of the SHA contemplates a 90-day period for the
			<lb />
			sale of shares to a Third Party, thereby affording what can clearly be
			<lb />
			perceived as sufficient time for obtaining requisite regulatory and third party
			<lb />
			approvals. Under Clause 3.7.2 of the SHA, Respondent No. 3 has been
			<lb />
			granted the very same 30-day period for sale of its shares to a Private
			<lb />
			Participant in furtherance of a Private Participant&apos;s ROFR. In fact, even if
			<lb />
			Respondent 3 were a seller, the very same 30 day ROFR construct, and 90
			<lb />
			day Third Party sale construct, have been envisaged in the SHA.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			37. Further, with respect to interpretation, it was argued that a &quot;business
			<lb />
			sense&quot; driven interpretation cannot be applied only when it benefits the
			<lb />
			Petitioner. The decision in Satya Jain(supra) in fact affirms the position
			<lb />
			adopted by Respondent No. 1, in that, absent manifest ambiguity in Clause
			<lb />
			3.7.1(iii) of the SHA it has to be interpreted as per its plain terms, without
			<lb />
			any implied terms being read into it. To support the proposition that Clause
			<lb />
			3.7.1 of the SHA is to be read as is (which is the bargain arrived at by parties
			<lb />
			to the SHA), without supplying any further words as is being suggested by
			<lb />
			the Petitioner, Respondent No. 1 relied on the following judgments: City
			<lb />
			Alliance Ltd v Oxford Forecasting Services Ltd [2001] 1 All ER (Comm)
			<lb />
			233, CA, Central Bank of India Ltd. v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. -
			<lb />
			AIR 1965 SC 1288, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Inc. vs. Aventis
			<lb />
			Pharma Limited [2010 (2) BomCR 317] citing the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			M.O.H. Uduman and Ors. v. M.O.H. Aslum (AIR 1991 SC 1020).
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			38. It was further argued by the learned counsel for Respondent No.1 that
			<lb />
			the 30-day timeline set out in Clause 3.7 of the SHA cannot be deemed to be
			<lb />
			extended on account of events subsequent to execution of the SHA in 2006,
			<lb />
			being: (i) the relevant provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 coming into
			<lb />
			force in 2011; and (ii) the agreement being entered into by lenders with
			<lb />
			MIAL in 2017 and 2018 and if the parties (being sophisticated commercial
			<lb />
			entities) thought that the ROFR timelines needed to be amended once
			<lb />
			competition laws came into force and/or lender agreements were executed,
			<lb />
			nothing prevented them from doing so. However, the parties did not.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			39. The Court has given a thoughtful consideration to the arguments raised
			<lb />
			by both the parties. First and foremost, as noted above, the court reiterates
			<lb />
			that it is for the Arbitrator to determine whether there is a concluded contract
			<lb />
			between the parties or not. The other related questions such as whether the
			<lb />
			time is the essence of the contract; whether the long stop date was envisaged
			<lb />
			under the contract between the parties etc. would require oral evidence to be
			<lb />
			led by the parties. Thus, at this stage, bearing in mind the scope of the
			<lb />
			present proceedings, the Court would like to refrain itself from giving its
			<lb />
			finding on such questions. Nevertheless, the contentions of the parties have
			<lb />
			been noted and are also being discussed only to determine whether there is a
			<lb />
			prima facie case made out for the grant of injunction as prayed for.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			40. At this preliminary stage, the Court would have to first construe whether
			<lb />
			the terms of the contract convey the sense that the parties intended, by a
			<lb />
			plain reading of the words actually used therein. Thus it will be apt to note
			<lb />
			the wordings of the clauses which are the fulcrum of the disputes between
			<lb />
			the parties. The said Clauses have been reproduced in para 3 above.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			41. Clause 3.7.1 (iii) of the SHA provides for the sale of PP purchase shares
			<lb />
			to be completed within 30 days of the PP Offer Notice being issued. The
			<lb />
			interpretation of the aforesaid Clause, proffered by the Petitioner is that the
			<lb />
			same has to be given a meaningful construction.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			42. There is no quarrel on the proposition in law advanced by Mr. Neeraj
			<lb />
			Kishan Kaul as to the application of the &quot;business efficacy&quot; test. The effort
			<lb />
			of the Court should no doubt to give a meaning to the contract and not reject
			<lb />
			the same to be meaningless. The meaning of a contract must be gathered by
			<lb />
			adopting a sensible commercial approach. Before interpreting the terms of a
			<lb />
			Commercial Contract, it has to be borne in mind that an unexpressed term
			<lb />
			can be implied if and only if it is found by the reading of the contract that
			<lb />
			parties intended such a term to form part of the contract. From the plain
			<lb />
			reading of the Contract, it should bear that at the time of making of the
			<lb />
			Agreement, the parties intended such a term would apply. The Court would
			<lb />
			not substitute its own views, if the terms are explicit and clear. To put it
			<lb />
			differently, as held in City Alliance Limited v. Oxford Forecasting Services
			<lb />
			and Ltd. 2001 All ER (Comm) 233, &quot;Before the Court can introduce words
			<lb />
			which the parties have not used, it is necessary to be satisfied (i) that the
			<lb />
			words actually used produce a result which is so commercially nonsensical
			<lb />
			that the parties could not have intended it.....&quot;. Petitioner contended that
			<lb />
			Clause 3.7.1 should be interpreted to give a meaningful construction to the
			<lb />
			Contract, as the transfer of shares is permissible only if the requisite
			<lb />
			approvals are in place. Such regulatory approvals are provided in Clause 3.6
			<lb />
			and 3.7 of the SHA. A reading of the aforesaid provision as reproduced
			<lb />
			above, clearly shows that approvals prescribed under Clause 3.6 are
			<lb />
			applicable in case the shares are to be transferred to a third party. Mr. Kaul
			<lb />
			initially argued that as such approvals are also applicable on the transfer to
			<lb />
			the Petitioner who is admittedly a private participant. This contention also
			<lb />
			finds mention in the pleadings. However, much later Mr. Rajiv Nayar,
			<lb />
			during the rejoinder arguments, clarified that Clause 3.6 is not applicable.
			<lb />
			Thus the only approvals envisaged in the Contract that are applicable to the
			<lb />
			Petitioner are those provided in Clause 3.7.1. I am of the prima facie view
			<lb />
			that the wordings of the said Clause do not indicate the exposition given by
			<lb />
			the learned Senior Counsels appearing on behalf of the Petitioner. There
			<lb />
			cannot be any doubt that both the parties are commercial entities having
			<lb />
			expertise in the field and the agreement was a result of negotiations between
			<lb />
			them. There can be a plausible view that the Contract does not expressly
			<lb />
			stipulate that the 30 days ROFR period would apply after the last date of the
			<lb />
			approvals. Prima facie, Clause 3.7.1 (c) of SHA reflects the final
			<lb />
			understanding between the parties. The Contract between the parties also
			<lb />
			does bring out a distinction between the ROFR period that is applicable for a
			<lb />
			private participant and that is applicable to a third party. This is discernible
			<lb />
			from Clause 3.7.1 (vii) of SHA which contemplates a 90 day period for the
			<lb />
			sale of shares to a third party, because in case of sale to third party, there are
			<lb />
			regulatory and third party approvals as prescribed under Clause 3.6 of SHA.
			<lb />
			Under Clause 3.7.2 of the SHA, Respondent No. 3 has been granted the very
			<lb />
			same 30 day period for sale of its shares to private participant in furtherance
			<lb />
			of private participant&apos;s ROFR. At this stage, for the purpose of the present
			<lb />
			petition, the Court is of the prima facie view that allowing the Petitioner to
			<lb />
			interpret Clause 3.7 in the manner it desires, would amount to re-writing the
			<lb />
			terms and conditions of the Contract. The terms are express and clear and
			<lb />
			unambiguous. In this regard, the Court would rely upon the judgment of the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court in Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Inc. vs. Aventis
			<lb />
			Pharma Limited [2010 (2) BomCR 317] citing the Supreme Court in
			<lb />
			M.O.H. Uduman and Ors. v. M.O.H. Aslum (AIR 1991 SC 1020), relating
			<lb />
			to the construction of the Commercial Contracts:
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;It is settled canon of construction that a contract of partnership
			<lb />
			must be read as a whole and the intention of the parties must be
			<lb />
			gathered from the language used in the contract by adopting
			<lb />
			harmonious construction of all the clauses contained therein. The
			<lb />
			cardinal principle is to ascertain the intention of the parties to
			<lb />
			the contract through the words they have used, which are key to
			<lb />
			open the mind of the makers. It is seldom that any technical or
			<lb />
			pedantic rule of construction can be brought to bear on their
			<lb />
			construction. The guiding rule really is to ascertain the natural
			<lb />
			and ordinary sensible meaning to the language through which
			<lb />
			the parties have expressed themselves, unless the meaning leads
			<lb />
			to absurdity.&quot;
			<lb />
			Thus, prima facie there is no merit in the contention of the Petitioner and the
			<lb />
			court cannot interpret the clause as suggested by the Petitioner.
			<lb />

		<p>
			Controversy surrounding the requirement of obtaining approvals for
			<lb />
			transfer of shares
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			43. Mr. Rajiv Nayar has argued that there are certain pre-requisite approvals
			<lb />
			necessary in order to complete the transaction, such as 1) under relevant
			<lb />
			provisions of the Competition Act, 2002; 2) the approval from the Banks/
			<lb />
			lenders on account of an agreement between lenders and MIAL. Both the
			<lb />
			above-noted approvals, that may be necessary, arose on account of
			<lb />
			subsequent events. The necessity of approval, if any, under the provisions
			<lb />
			of Competition Act, 2002, became necessary in 2011 and the agreement
			<lb />
			between the lenders and MIAL was executed in 2017 and 2018. However,
			<lb />
			the parties did not incorporate any such extension of timelines on account of
			<lb />
			the above. Another approval that has been envisaged under Clause 3.7 is the
			<lb />
			approval from Airport Authority of India in terms of Clause 2.5 of OMDA.
			<lb />
			On the question of necessity of taking approval from AAI, Mr. Abhinav
			<lb />
			Vashisht, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of AAI, has drawn the
			<lb />
			attention of this Court to letters dated 22 nd March 2019 written by AAI to
			<lb />
			MIAL and response thereto. The said two letters read as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;Subject: AAI approval in terms of OMDA and
			<lb />
			Shareholder&apos;s Agreement.
			<lb />
			This is with reference to your letter dated 18th March 2018 in
			<lb />
			response to AAI mail dated l5th March 2018 on the subject
			<lb />
			stating that the permission of AAI need to be obtained by the
			<lb />
			Prime members and the evaluated entities for the transfer of the
			<lb />
			shares of MIAL from ACSA and Bid vest to GVK Airport
			<lb />
			Holdings. Ltd. and not MIAL
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			2. In this regard, reference is made to Article 2.5(c) and 2.5(h) of.
			<lb />
			OMDA as per which the permission of AAI needs to be obtained
			<lb />
			by the JVC which would be given subject to AAl ensuring that
			<lb />
			the capabilities of the JVC are not inferior pursuant to the share
			<lb />
			transfer of the JVC than prior to the transfer .
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			3. Keeping in view tile above, it is MIAL whose shares are being
			<lb />
			transferred and whose various capabilities are assessed pursuant
			<lb />
			to the&apos; transfer to obtain permission of AAI.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			4. MIAL is requested to comply with the OMDA provisions and
			<lb />
			seek AAI approval to ensure that the transfer takes place with the
			<lb />
			specified timelines.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			5. This issues with the approval of the competent authority.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;Subject: AAI Approval in terms of OMDA and
			<lb />
			Shareholders Agreement
			<lb />

		<item>
			Ref: 1) Your email dated 15th March, 2019

			2) MIAL letter No. MIAL/CE0/104 dated 181h March,
			<lb />

		<item>
			3) AAI Letter No. AAI/MC/MIAL-07 /EC/2019 dated
			<lb />
			22nd March,
			<lb />
			2019
			<lb />
			With reference to subject above and further to correspondences
			<lb />
			exchanged between AAI and MIAL so far, we would like to
			<lb />
			mention as follows:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			1) MIAL was first intimated about the PP Offer Notices of Bid
			<lb />
			Services Division (Mauritius)Ltd and ACSA Global Ltd by AAI
			<lb />
			vide its letters No. AAI/MC/MIAL-07/EC/2019 dated 7 th March.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			2) your email of 15th March, 2019, we had responded that
			<lb />
			approval is to be obtained by Prime Member(s).
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			3) We are in receipt of your letter no. AAI/MC/MIAL-
			<lb />
			07/EC/2019 dated 22nd March 2019stating that approval under
			<lb />
			the OMDA is to be sought by JVC only. We have not received
			<lb />
			any request from the Prime Member for seeking AAI approval.
			<lb />
			Upon receipt of such request, along with all supporting
			<lb />
			documentation, we are agreeable to make a request for such
			<lb />
			approval to the AAI. Please note that we making such a request
			<lb />
			does not dilute the obligation of the Prime Members (Private
			<lb />
			Participant(s)) under the Shareholders Agreement.
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			4) We stand committed to comply with all applicable provisions
			<lb />
			of OMDA, Shareholders Agreement and Article of Association
			<lb />
			of MIAL in this respect.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			44. Mr. Vashisht has further informed that in furtherance to the said letter,
			<lb />
			MIAL never made a request to AAI for the requisite approval under the
			<lb />
			provisions of OMDA. Since the question of approvals is being discussed, it
			<lb />
			would also be apt to take note of the fact that Mr. Rajiv Nayar has
			<lb />
			strenuously argued that such approval from SBI is a prerequisite and the
			<lb />
			same has not been obtained it indicates that the Respondent No. 1 is not in a
			<lb />
			position to transfer the shares and the same are not in a deliverable state.
			<lb />
			Strong emphasis is also placed on a letter dated 28 th March 2019, written by
			<lb />
			SBI to MIAL, wherein the Bank has indicated that MIAL should give 60
			<lb />
			days prior notice to SBI for the Bank to take a view in the matter. The said
			<lb />
			letter reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;MUMBAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT LIMITED (MIAL):
			<lb />
			Date: 28 .03 .2019
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			PROPOSED TRANSFER OR EQUITY SHAR.E HELD BY
			<lb />
			BID SERVICES DIVISION (MAURITIUS LIMITED)
			<lb />
			With reference to your letter dated March 27, 2019 (received by
			<lb />
			us through email) on the captioned subject, while we have taken
			<lb />
			note of the contents of your letter, we have to advise as under:-
			<lb />
			l. As per the existing terms of sanction, such request should come
			<lb />
			from the borrowing Company
			<lb />
			i.e., MIAL Therefore, we cannot treat .your said letter as formal
			<lb />
			request for approval or notice as per provisions of existing loan
			<lb />
			documents.
			<lb />
			li. Please note that as per the existing terms of sanction, MIAL
			<lb />
			has to give 60 days prior notice to State Bank of India (&quot;SBI&quot; or
			<lb />
			&quot;Bank&quot;) for undertaking such activity to enable the Bank to take
			<lb />
			a view. If, in the opinion of the Bank, the move contemplated by
			<lb />
			the borrower Company is not in the interest of the Bank, the
			<lb />
			Bank will have the right of veto for the activity.
			<lb />
			111. Please also note that MIAL has to take approval of all
			<lb />
			lenders as well as other share holders/AAI/Regulators as per the
			<lb />
			provision of OMDA/Loan Documents.
			<lb />
			iv. Please provide us the copy of acceptance of GVK Airport
			<lb />
			Holding limited along with term sheet for the stake purchase
			<lb />
			from Bid Service Division (Mauritius) limited.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			45. Mr. Nayar also referred to a letter dated 25 th April 2019 written by
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1 to SBI, requesting for consent to transfer the entire
			<lb />
			shareholding of Respondent No. 1. It was argued that the aforesaid letter
			<lb />
			shows that Respondent No. 1 admits that it is not in a position to transfer the
			<lb />
			shares pending the approval of the lender, with whom the shares in question
			<lb />
			are pledged. In absence of this approval, the 30 day ROFR period should be
			<lb />
			applied only after all the approvals have been obtained.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			46. The approval from SBI does not find mention in Clause 3.7 of the SHA
			<lb />
			in question. Moreover, this requirement arose subsequent to the execution
			<lb />
			of the SHA. Pertinently, the request for approval had to be initiated by
			<lb />
			MIAL. The approval is in the nature of the consent of SBI that the shares in
			<lb />
			MIAL that would be acquired from Respondent No.1, would be pledged
			<lb />
			with the Bank in accordance with Clause 2.7 of the Share Pledge
			<lb />
			Agreement. In this background, Respondent No. 1 wrote the letter to SBI
			<lb />
			asking them to reconsider the request for seeking a term sheet setting forth
			<lb />
			the terms and conditions of the proposed sale. The said letter was written by
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1 after the filing of the present petition and was also issued
			<lb />
			without prejudice to its rights [Para 6 of the said letter]. Thus, the said letter
			<lb />
			cannot be construed to mean that Respondent No. 1 took upon itself the
			<lb />
			obligation to obtain the consent of SBI. Be that as it may, it was for MIAL
			<lb />
			to have obtained the consent, as was mentioned in the SBI letter dated 28 th
			<lb />
			March 2019. Concededly, such a request has not been sent till date. There
			<lb />
			is also no such request to AAI, pursuant to the letters reproduced in the
			<lb />
			foregoing paras. The parties have just been playing blame game on this
			<lb />
			issue.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			47. Mr. Sibal has rightly argued that ROFR is always triggered by a desire to
			<lb />
			ultimately sell the shares to a third party, with the preemptory ROFR
			<lb />
			condition for such sale. ROFR, by its very definition, has to be a time
			<lb />
			bound offer and can never be in perpetuity. Extending the ROFR Clause,
			<lb />
			would defeat the purpose and the intent of the Clause itself. In such matters,
			<lb />
			time is inherently of the essence of the Contract. The value of shares can
			<lb />
			skyrocket or nosedive in a short span of time and in case the sale is not
			<lb />
			matured within the short span of time envisaged in the agreement, the
			<lb />
			transaction would be frustrated. In case the timelines are not adhered and
			<lb />
			there is increase in the value of the shares, it can cause/incur
			<lb />
			depreciation/loss in consideration, since the ROFR holder would buy the
			<lb />
			shares at lower than fair market value. Likewise, decrease in the value of the
			<lb />
			shares can cause re-negotiations with the third party requiring the ROFR
			<lb />
			process to be initiated all over again. Respondent No. 1&apos;s right to sell the
			<lb />
			shares would be defeated, in case ROFR is not exercised in a time bound
			<lb />
			manner. Court can also not lose sight of the fact that after the ROFR period,
			<lb />
			the right of the other share holder gets crystallized and they can then acquire
			<lb />
			the underlying shares on the same terms. ROFR is the privilege given to a
			<lb />
			party and in the present case, the Petitioner, ought to have exercised its right
			<lb />
			strictly in accordance to the conditions stipulated in the agreement. It is
			<lb />
			critically important that this contract should be strictly and rigidly enforced
			<lb />
			within the time frame provided for under the Agreement as the subject
			<lb />
			matter of dispute relates to &apos;shares&apos;, which by its nature, is susceptible to
			<lb />
			continual variation unlike other contracts. The approvals prior to the
			<lb />
			issuance of the PP Offer Notice have not been recorded in the terms and
			<lb />
			conditions of the SHA. The Petitioner&apos;s contention that such prerequisite
			<lb />
			approvals ought to have been obtained prior to the PP Offer Notice is thus
			<lb />
			not correct. The Court also does not find merit in the submission of the
			<lb />
			Respondent that the Respondent&apos;s interpretation of 30 days ROFR period is
			<lb />
			absurd. What would be the correct interpretation of the time period
			<lb />
			mentioned in 3.7.1 of SHA and the conduct of the parties evidencing their
			<lb />
			understanding of this Clause would have to be decided by the Arbitral
			<lb />
			Tribunal after considering the evidence that could be led before it.
			<lb />
			Long Stop Date
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			48. The controversy has also been raised with respect to &quot;long stop date&quot;. It
			<lb />
			is Petitioner&apos;s contention that there was no such long stop date specified in
			<lb />
			the shareholder&apos;s agreement. This issue also relates to another bone of
			<lb />
			contention between the parties as to whether there is concluded contract or
			<lb />
			not between the parties. According to the Petitioner, Respondent No. 1 had
			<lb />
			affirmed that there is a concluded Contract. On the other hand, Respondent
			<lb />
			No. 1 had contended that the Petitioner did not accept the offer notice dated
			<lb />
			4 th March 2019 but rather sent a counter offer in response to the same.
			<lb />
			When Respondent No. 1 issued the notice dated 4 th March 2019, the
			<lb />
			Petitioner did not accept the same and instead stated that it would shortly
			<lb />
			send its revision to the draft agreement. It was, however, stated that the
			<lb />
			Petitioner was re-confirming exercise of its option to purchase Respondent
			<lb />
			No. 1&apos;s shares. This was replied by Respondent No. 1 vide letter dated 15 th
			<lb />
			March 2019 pointing out that Petitioner was not entitled to make counter-
			<lb />
			proposals or suggests or negotiate amendments. On 16 th March 2019,
			<lb />
			Petitioner addressed a letter to Respondent No. 1 annexing therewith
			<lb />
			changes to the terms offered. The suggested changes read as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			(i)
			<lb />
			&quot;Deleting, in its entirety, Clause 1.3(k) of the SPA
			<lb />
			(Interpretation Clause), which read: &quot;time is of the essence in
			<lb />
			the performance of the Parties&quot; respective obligations under
			<lb />
			this Agreement. To the extent that any such time periods stand
			<lb />
			extended, the extended time periods shall also be of essence.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(ii) Amending Clause 4.1 of the draft SPA to read &quot;Closing shall
			<lb />
			not occur after the expiry of the applicable time period within
			<lb />
			which the Transfer of the Sale Shares is required to take place
			<lb />
			as set forth in Clause 3.7 of the [SHA]… as extended by the
			<lb />
			time period required to obtain all approvals and consents
			<lb />
			from any Government Authority and third party as may be
			<lb />
			required for the Transaction… &quot; (Text in bold being the
			<lb />
			addition suggested by the Petitioner to the version shared by
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1 on March 4, 2019)
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			(iii) Amending Clause 4.3 of the draft SPA to read that the long stop
			<lb />
			date would be &quot;the earlier later of (i) [•] the applicable time
			<lb />
			period within which the Transfer of the Sale Shares is required
			<lb />
			to take place as set forth in Clause 3.7 read with Clause 3.6 of
			<lb />
			the [SHA]… or (ii) the date falling 14 (fourteen) days after the
			<lb />
			date on which all approvals and consents as are required from
			<lb />
			Government Authorities and third parties for the Transaction
			<lb />
			have been obtained…&quot; (Text in bold being the addition
			<lb />
			suggested by the Petitioner and strikethrough being the
			<lb />
			deletions to the version shared by Respondent No. 1 on March
			<lb />
			4, 2019)&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			49. A perusal of the aforementioned communication exchanged between the
			<lb />
			parties and the terms of the contract suggests that the offer of sale of
			<lb />
			shareholding had to be accepted without terms and conditions and a
			<lb />
			concluded contract could only come into existence by fulfillment of
			<lb />
			obligations on the part of both the parties. The Petitioner ceaselessly tried
			<lb />
			that Respondent No. 1 agrees to the changes in the SPA. However, when the
			<lb />
			Respondent did not relent, the Petitioner signed the unamended draft of the
			<lb />
			SPA to seemingly convey that the offer was accepted and the contract stood
			<lb />
			concluded. It is a fact that the terms offered by Respondent No. 1 were not
			<lb />
			accepted. Thus prima facie there appears to be no consensus on certain key
			<lb />
			terms of the agreement and it is doubtful that the contract stood concluded.
			<lb />
			B) WHETHER THE PETITIONER IS AND HAS BEEN READY AND WILLING TO
			<lb />
			PERFORM THEIR PART OF THE OBLIGATION?
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			50. To determine this question, the Court will have to assess the contentions
			<lb />
			of the parties from the stand point of a case relating to specific performance
			<lb />
			of the contract, as essentially in the arbitration proceedings, the Petitioner
			<lb />
			would be seeking enforcement of its preferential right to purchase the shares
			<lb />
			offered by the Respondent No. 1 by way of specific performance of the
			<lb />
			contract. It is also the stated stand of the Petitioner in the pleadings that the
			<lb />
			Petitioner is and has always been ready and willing to perform his obligation
			<lb />
			to purchase the shares and it cannot escape from showing that it is ready and
			<lb />
			willing to perform its obligations under the agreement.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			51. Petitioner contends that Respondent No. 1 has delayed completion of the
			<lb />
			transaction by not performing its reciprocal obligations and is still not in a
			<lb />
			position to deliver the shares to the Petitioner in a freely transferable form.
			<lb />
			It is further argued that Respondent has deliberately delayed in applying and
			<lb />
			/ or assisting MIAL in applying for approvals from the third Respondent and
			<lb />
			the lenders. In matters relating to Specific Performance, the question of
			<lb />
			readiness has been defined by the Supreme Court in innumerable decisions.
			<lb />
			One such decision which requires to be noted here is Kalawati v Rakesh
			<lb />
			Kumar(2018) 3 SCC 658 wherein the Supreme Court has recently held as
			<lb />
			under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;18. The law on the subject of specific performance of contracts
			<lb />
			is quite clear and it is not necessary to cite the dozens of
			<lb />
			judgments delivered by this Court on the issue. However, it is
			<lb />
			necessary to refer to two decisions which are quite apposite to
			<lb />
			the facts of the case before us.

			19. In His Holiness Acharya Swami Ganesh Dassji v. Sita Ram
			<lb />
			Thapar MANU/SC/0522/1996 : (1996) 4 SCC 526 this Court
			<lb />
			drew a distinction between readiness to perform the contract and
			<lb />
			willingness to perform the contract. It was observed that by
			<lb />
			readiness it may be meant the capacity of the Plaintiff to perform
			<lb />
			the contract which would include the financial position to pay the
			<lb />
			purchase price. As far as the willingness to perform the contract
			<lb />
			is concerned, the conduct of the Plaintiff has to be properly
			<lb />
			scrutinised along with attendant circumstances. On the facts
			<lb />
			available, the Court may infer whether or not the Plaintiff was
			<lb />
			always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. It
			<lb />
			was held in paragraph 2 of the Report:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;There is a distinction between readiness to perform the contract and
			<lb />
			willingness to perform the contract. By readiness may be meant the capacity
			<lb />
			of the Plaintiff to perform the contract which includes his financial position
			<lb />
			to pay the purchase price. For determining his willingness to perform his
			<lb />
			part of the contract, the conduct has to be properly scrutinised......
			<lb />
			The factum of readiness and willingness to perform Plaintiff&apos;s part of the
			<lb />
			contract is to be adjudged with reference to the conduct of the party and the
			<lb />
			attending circumstances. The court may infer from the facts and
			<lb />
			circumstances whether the Plaintiff was ready and was always ready and
			<lb />
			willing to perform his part of the contract. The facts of this case would
			<lb />
			amply demonstrate that the Petitioner/Plaintiff was not ready nor had the
			<lb />
			capacity to perform his part of the contract as he had no financial capacity
			<lb />
			to pay the consideration in cash as contracted and intended to bide for the
			<lb />
			time which disentitles him as time is of the essence of the contract.&quot;
			<lb />

			20. In I.S. Sikandar (Dead) by L.Rs. v. K. Subramani and Ors.
			<lb />
			MANU/SC/1093/2013 : (2013) 15 SCC 27 this Court noted that
			<lb />
			the Plaintiff is required to prove that from the date of execution
			<lb />
			of the agreement of sale till the date of the decree, he was always
			<lb />
			ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. In this case,
			<lb />
			looking the attendant facts and circumstances, the Court upheld
			<lb />
			the view of the Trial Judge that the Plaintiff had no money to pay
			<lb />
			the balance sale consideration and was apparently not capable
			<lb />
			of making necessary arrangements for payment of the balance
			<lb />
			consideration. It was held in paragraph 45 and paragraph 47 of
			<lb />
			the Report:
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			&quot;45.........Further, the Plaintiff is required to prove the fact that right from
			<lb />
			the date of execution of the agreement of sale till the date of passing the
			<lb />
			decree he must prove that he is ready and has always been willing to
			<lb />
			perform his part of the contract as per the agreement......
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			47. Further, there is nothing on record to show that the Plaintiff could have
			<lb />
			made arrangement for payment of the balance consideration amount to
			<lb />
			them. But, on the other hand the trial court has recorded the finding of fact
			<lb />
			to the effect that the correspondence between the parties and other
			<lb />
			circumstances would establish the fact that the Plaintiff had no money for
			<lb />
			payment of balance sale consideration.......&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<item>
			21. In so far as the present appeal is concerned, the material on
			<lb />
			record clearly indicates that Rakesh Kumar did not have the
			<lb />
			necessary funds available with him to pay the balance
			<lb />
			consideration. His low income and low bank balance indicated
			<lb />
			his incapacity to make the balance payment. As far as his
			<lb />
			capacity to arrange for funds is concerned, it has come on record
			<lb />
			that Rakesh Kumar did take a loan from his cousin but that was
			<lb />
			only for his business and not for paying the balance
			<lb />
			consideration for the land in dispute. There is nothing on record
			<lb />
			to indicate that Rakesh Kumar could have not only repaid the
			<lb />
			loan taken from his cousin, but additionally, could have arranged
			<lb />
			sufficient funds to pay the balance consideration. It is very
			<lb />
			doubtful, and it is easy and reasonable to infer this, that Rakesh
			<lb />
			Kumar was incapable of meeting both liabilities.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			52. Mr. Nayar had argued that there is no requirement under the SHA or the
			<lb />
			PP Offer Notice for the Petitioner to show the financial capacity. Petitioner
			<lb />
			is only required to remit the purchase consideration within 14 days after all
			<lb />
			the necessary approvals have been obtained. On acceptance of the PP Offer
			<lb />
			Letter, a right has accrued in its favour to purchase the shares and the Court
			<lb />
			should now preserve the same by granting an injunction. There are obvious
			<lb />
			and glaring inconsistencies in these propositions. A party desirous of
			<lb />
			specific performance of a Contract for purchase cannot merely on the
			<lb />
			strength of an agreement and purported breach, seek an order of injunction.
			<lb />
			The entire case law relating to specific performance of contract ubiquitously
			<lb />
			holds that readiness and willingness is a key feature that is required to be
			<lb />
			met in order to succeed in such action. The Petitioner has remained
			<lb />
			conspicuously silent on this issue in its correspondence and also before this
			<lb />
			Court. Petitioner&apos;s statement that it is ready to fulfill its obligations is not
			<lb />
			enough. The same has to be substantiated by its conduct and by establishing
			<lb />
			the same by means of documentary evidence. This is a pre-requisite for a
			<lb />
			claim for Specific Performance and also for seeking the equitable relief of
			<lb />
			injunction. The failings of the Petitioner to prove and exhibit its readiness
			<lb />
			ends up showing that it was never in a position to fulfill its obligations. The
			<lb />
			Supreme Court has held that the readiness to complete the transaction means
			<lb />
			that the party has the capacity to perform the contract which includes the
			<lb />
			financial position to pay the purchase price. Readiness and willingness to
			<lb />
			perform the Contract has to be scrutinized on the basis of the conduct of the
			<lb />
			parties with attendant circumstances. The party seeking specific
			<lb />
			performance is required to prove that from the date of execution of the
			<lb />
			agreement till the final decision, it was always ready and willing to perform
			<lb />
			his part of the Contract. Mr. Amit Sibal, has all throughout in his arguments
			<lb />
			cast serious doubt on the Petitioner&apos;s financial capacity to fulfill its
			<lb />
			obligations. At the initial stage, the Court nudged the parties to explore the
			<lb />
			possibilities of resolution. There were several rounds of negotiation
			<lb />
			between the parties, however, nothing fructified. In this regard, on 8 th May
			<lb />
			2019, the Court, during hearing of the arguments, queried from the
			<lb />
			Respondent about his willingness to complete the transaction, and pursuant
			<lb />
			thereto, an order was passed recording the stand of the parties. The text of
			<lb />
			the order has been reproduced in the preliminary paragraphs. In response
			<lb />
			thereto, Petitioner did not show any genuine inclination to complete the
			<lb />
			transaction. During the subsequent hearing, Petitioner sought to present
			<lb />
			certain documents in a sealed cover to show its financial capability to
			<lb />
			perform the Contract. Thereafter, as desired by the parties, a Chamber
			<lb />
			hearing was also held in the presence of learned Senior Counsels. In
			<lb />
			chamber hearing, a general discussion took place regarding the manner in
			<lb />
			which the Petitioner proposed to make a payment for the shares, but the
			<lb />
			same was not acceptable to Respondent No. 1. Be that as it may, the
			<lb />
			Petitioner has chosen not to place on record any material to show its
			<lb />
			financial means and capacity to complete the transaction. The Petitioner has
			<lb />
			in fact circumvented the issue of readiness by firstly contending that this
			<lb />
			question cannot be examined in the present petition, being beyond the scope
			<lb />
			of Section 9 of the Act and secondly, on the ground that Petitioner is only
			<lb />
			seeking an injunction to perform the negative covenant and for which the
			<lb />
			Court has not to examine the aspect of readiness and willingness. These
			<lb />
			arguments are nothing but disjointed attempts to avoid scrutiny of the court
			<lb />
			on this question. This exposes the Petitioner and the court can firmly say
			<lb />
			that Petitioner is not ready to go forward with the transaction. There is
			<lb />
			undeniably no genuine exhibition of readiness which could show that the
			<lb />
			Petitioner is serious in completing the transaction. There is not even an iota
			<lb />
			of evidence before the Court to substantiate the plea of readiness. Mr. Sibal
			<lb />
			repeatedly asserted throughout the arguments that the Petitioner should be
			<lb />
			called upon to prove its genuine readiness. Petitioner maintained resolute
			<lb />
			silence on this issue. The facts as they have been unfolded, come across to
			<lb />
			the Court to show that the Petitioner has merely inflated the expectation of
			<lb />
			its readiness. Perhaps, the Petitioner is still struggling to get the ready
			<lb />
			funds. This is the blatant truth of the matter. Petitioner may be extremely
			<lb />
			ambitious to purchase the shares, but the enormity of the transaction amount
			<lb />
			requires the Court to be satisfied that the Petitioner has sufficient funds.
			<lb />
			There may be constraints to show the entire transaction amount of INR
			<lb />
			1248,75,00,000 in its bank account and the court is mindful of this fact. But
			<lb />
			the Petitioner has not even cared to place any material on record to show that
			<lb />
			the funds will be readily available in case there arises a situation to make the
			<lb />
			payments to Respondent No. 1.
			<lb />
			Petitioner has also not shown any
			<lb />
			inclination to erase the doubts about its financial capacity and means to
			<lb />
			complete the transaction. Even if arguably, it is assumed there is a
			<lb />
			concluded contract between the parties, and that Petitioner has exhibited its
			<lb />
			willingness to complete the transaction, in order to seek an injunction, it
			<lb />
			would still entail the Petitioner to show readiness. The conduct of the
			<lb />
			Petitioner appears to validate the apprehension expressed by Mr. Sibal
			<lb />
			regarding the financial distress of the Petitioner. Thus, even if the Court
			<lb />
			were to gloss over all the disputed aspects such as whether there is a
			<lb />
			concluded contract between the parties or whether the Respondent is in
			<lb />
			breach of the agreement, the underlying factor remains that readiness has not
			<lb />
			been proved before the Court. The transfer of shares has to be instantaneous
			<lb />
			with the payment. It is highly improbable that if the Petitioner is genuinely
			<lb />
			desirous of purchasing the shares, it would not have the readily available
			<lb />
			funds with it. It is rather obscure that the Petitioner who still had the option
			<lb />
			to purchase the shares as recorded in the order dated 8 th May 2019, did not
			<lb />
			deem it necessary to present to the Court material that could convincingly
			<lb />
			show that it had the financial means to complete the transaction. It is
			<lb />
			incomprehensible as to why the Petitioner who is purportedly earnest to
			<lb />
			purchase the shares, has chosen not to show to the Court its financial
			<lb />
			capability. At this stage, granting an order of injunction in its favour and
			<lb />
			against the Respondent would amount to incentivizing the Petitioner&apos;s
			<lb />
			speculative interest to purchase the shares. In this regard, the principles as
			<lb />
			laid down in Wander Ltd. Vs. Antox India P. Ltd, 1990 (SUPP) SCC 727
			<lb />
			become relevant. In the said case, the Supreme Court held as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;&quot;9. Usually, the prayer for grant of an interlocutory injunction
			<lb />
			is at a stage when the existence of the legal right asserted by the
			<lb />
			plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and
			<lb />
			uncertain and remain uncertain till they are established at the
			<lb />
			trial on evidence. The court, at this stage, acts on certain well
			<lb />
			settled principles of administration of this form of interlocutory
			<lb />
			remedy which is both temporary and discretionary. The object of
			<lb />
			the interlocutory injunction, it is stated is to protect the plaintiff
			<lb />
			against injury by violation of his rights for which he could not
			<lb />
			adequately be compensated in damages recoverable in the action
			<lb />
			if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. The
			<lb />
			need for such protection must be weighed against the
			<lb />
			corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against
			<lb />
			injury resulting from his having been prevented from
			<lb />
			exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be
			<lb />
			adequately compensated. The court must weigh one need against
			<lb />
			another and determine where the &quot;balance of convenience lies&quot;.
			<lb />
			The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo,
			<lb />
			the rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			53. Mr. Nayar&apos;s reliance on Clause 9.3.1 of the SHA to impress upon the
			<lb />
			Court that it is entitled to an injunctive relief, is also misplaced. The said
			<lb />
			Clause reads as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;9.3.1 The Parties to this Agreement agree that. to the extent
			<lb />
			permitted under ApplicableLaw, the rights and obligations of the
			<lb />
			Parties under this Agreement shall besubject to the right of
			<lb />
			specific performance and may be specifically enforcedagainst a
			<lb />
			Defaulting Party. The Parties acknowledge that any breach of the
			<lb />
			provisions of this Agreement will cause immediate irreparable
			<lb />
			harm to the adversely affected Party (&quot;Affected Party&quot;) for which
			<lb />
			any compensation payable in damages shall not be an adequate
			<lb />
			remedy. Accordingly, the Parties agree that the Affected Party
			<lb />
			still be entitled to immediate and permanent injunctive relief,
			<lb />
			specific performance or any other equitable relief from a court of
			<lb />
			competent jurisdiction in the event of any such breach or
			<lb />
			threatened breach by any other Party. The Parties agree and
			<lb />
			stipulate that the Affected Party shall be entitled to such
			<lb />
			injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief
			<lb />
			without (i) the necessity of proving actual damages; or (ii)
			<lb />
			posting a bond or other security.
			<lb />
			Nothing contained herein shall limit the Affected Parties right to
			<lb />
			any remedies at law or in equity, including without limitation the
			<lb />
			recovery of damages from thedefaulting Party.&quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			54. The aforesaid Clause only emphasizes that the effective party is entitled
			<lb />
			to specific performance or equitable relief without proving actual damages
			<lb />
			or posting a bond or other security. This Clause cannot be interpreted to
			<lb />
			mean that the Petitioner does not have the obligation to meet the criteria of
			<lb />
			exhibiting its readiness to fulfill the transaction. Significantly, the Clause
			<lb />
			contains an expression &quot;to the extent permitted by applicable law&quot; in the
			<lb />
			opening sentence of Clause 9.3. Moreover, the Court while deciding the
			<lb />
			entitlement to the relief would have the jurisdiction to apply the basic test
			<lb />
			for grant of injunction, irrespective of what is stated in the Clause.
			<lb />
			Notwithstanding the said provision, the Petitioner is still required to
			<lb />
			demonstrate availability of funds to satisfy that it is ready and willing to
			<lb />
			perform its obligations under Section 16 (c) of SHA, which it has not done.
			<lb />
			Posting a bond or other security is not the same thing as demonstration of
			<lb />
			availability of funds. The Court&apos;s jurisdiction cannot be impinged or affected
			<lb />
			by the understanding of the parties. It would always remain a discretion of
			<lb />
			the Court when it comes to matters relating to grant of injunction, which has
			<lb />
			to be exercised in accordance with law and judicial precedents.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2. Balance of Convenience and Irreparable injury
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			55. Mr. Nayar&apos;s further arguments that in case the first Respondent is not
			<lb />
			restrained from offering or selling the shares to any person other than the
			<lb />
			Petitioner, would render its claim infructuous and present the Petitioner with
			<lb />
			&quot;fait accompli&quot; which would result in defeating Petitioner&apos;s preferential right
			<lb />
			to purchase the shares is also misconceived. The basic tenets for grant of
			<lb />
			interlocutory injunction require the Court to also examine the question of
			<lb />
			balance of convenience and the question of irreparable loss. In Kashimath
			<lb />
			Samsthan vs. Shri Madsudhindra Thirtha Swamy (2010) 1 SCC 689, the
			<lb />
			Supreme Court holds as under:-
			<lb />
		</p>

		<item>
			&quot;13. It is well settled that in order to obtain an order of
			<lb />
			injunction, the party who seeks for grant of such injunction has
			<lb />
			to prove that he has made out a prima facie case to go for trial,
			<lb />
			the balance of convenience is also in his favour and he will suffer
			<lb />
			irreparable loss and injury if injunction is not granted. But it is
			<lb />
			equally well settled that when a party fails to prove prima facie
			<lb />
			case to go for trial, question of considering the balance of
			<lb />
			convenience or irreparable loss and injury to the party
			<lb />
			concerned would not be material at all, that is to say, if that
			<lb />
			party fails to prove prima facie case to go for trial, it is not
			<lb />
			open to the Court to grant injunction in his favour even if, he
			<lb />
			has made out a case of balance of convenience being in his
			<lb />
			favour and would suffer irreparable loss and injury if no
			<lb />
			injunction order is granted. &quot;
			<lb />
		</item>

		<p>
			56. Bearing in mind the noted principles, the Court notes that the balance of
			<lb />
			convenience would not lie in favour of the Petitioner as granting an
			<lb />
			injunction can lead to a situation where the value of the property/subject
			<lb />
			matter would be altered. On the other hand even if the shares are not freely
			<lb />
			tradeable, the Petitioner would still have the remedy in the form of the
			<lb />
			damages and it is not that the Petitioner would be rendered remediless.
			<lb />
			More importantly, its conduct disentitles it to inequitable relief of injunction
			<lb />
			as it has not exhibited that it possesses adequate financial capacity to
			<lb />
			complete the acquisition of the shares.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			57. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the Court does not find any merit in
			<lb />
			the present petition. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed with no order as
			<lb />
			to costs.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			58. The opinion expressed by the Court is only a prima facie view. Needless
			<lb />
			to say that the same shall not be binding on the Arbitral Tribunal and
			<lb />
			contentions of the parties and merits of the claims and/or counterclaims shall
			<lb />
			be examined uninfluenced by the observations made in the this judgment.
			<lb />
			The interim order stands vacated.
