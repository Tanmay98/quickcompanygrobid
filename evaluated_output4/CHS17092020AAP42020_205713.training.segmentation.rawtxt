9. 
In line with the aforesaid Family Settlements (as the petitioners 

would aver), AGG 

(i) 
resigned from M/s Renu Farms Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter 

referred to as "Renu Farms"), which fell to the share of RGG, 

(ii) resigned from M/s Renu Promoters Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter 

referred to as "Renu Promoters"), which fell to the share of 

DGG, 

(iii) transferred shareholdings, in nine companies, to RGG, 

without consideration, 

(iv) transferred shareholdings, in six companies, to DGG, 

without consideration, and 

(v) liquidated investments, held by AGG in Kotak Mahindra 

Mutual Funds, ICICI Prudential Mutual Funds and Edelweiss 

Mutual Funds (hereinafter referred to, collectively, as "the 

Mutual Funds"), and credited the amounts obtained thereby, in 

the accounts of Anand Gupta (HUF) and Sanchit Gupta (son of 

Anand Gupta), totalling ₹ 19,89,34,500.88, out of which an 

amount of ₹ 19,55,00,000/-was credited into the accounts of 

DGG. 

10. DGG would aver that the aforesaid amount of ₹ 19,55,00,000/-

was "gifted", by AGG to DGG. AGG denies this contention, as the 

facts recited hereinafter would disclose. 

11. Consequent on the aforesaid Family Settlements, Rajesh Gupta 

resigned from seventeen Companies which fell to the lot of DGG, and 

transferred shares in four companies to DGG; DGG, likewise, 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 7 of 82 

resigned from twenty six companies which fell to the lot of RGG, and 

transferred shares in thirteen companies to RGG. These facts, 

however, are not particularly relevant, for the purposes of the present 

appeal. 

12. Thereafter, contends DGG, both RGG and AGG resiled from 

their commitments under the aforesaid Family Settlements, qua DGG. 

The actions of RGG, in this regard, do not seriously impact these 

proceedings, as the present lis is between DGG and AGG; however, 

reference, thereto, is necessary, in order to complete the factual 

recital. 

13. Acts of Rajesh Gupta/RGG, leading to CS (OS) 51/2018 

13.1 As a sequel to earlier communications, between Rajesh Gupta 

and Dinesh Gupta, the former wrote, to the latter, on 10 th January, 

2018, alleging that Dinesh Gupta was illegally trying to encash mutual 

funds of BDR, which, as per the Family Settlements, were vested in 

Rajesh Gupta. Resultantly, it was alleged that Dinesh Gupta was 

liable to reimburse, to Rajesh Gupta, an amount of ₹ 22,44,85,000/-. 

Dinesh Gupta was also called upon to furnish resolutions for pursuing 

actionable claims of companies, which vested in RGG. The 

communication also requested that a reputed accounting/auditing firm 

(the names of KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) were 

suggested), be appointed to resolve the disputes between RGG and 

DGG. 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 8 of 82 

13.2 DGG responded, on 12 th January, 2018, asserting that the 

Mutual Funds in issue were in the personal name of Dinesh Gupta, 

and that Rajesh Gupta was merely the second holder therein. It was 

further asserted that the investments, in the said Mutual Funds, had 

been made by Dinesh Gupta from his personal savings. DGG, 

therefore, denied any monetary liability towards RGG, but assented to 

the appointment of KPMG, to settle the disputes between RGG and 

DGG. 

13.3 On 19 th January, 2018, RGG sent requisitions, under Section 100 

of the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as "the 

Companies Act") to the Board of Directors (hereinafter referred to as 

"BOD") of BDR, for removal of Dinesh Gupta and Shreyansh Gupta 

from the Board of Directors of BDR, alleging that, by their acts, they 

had forfeited the right to continue as Directors, by virtue of Section 

169 of the Companies Act. The requisition requested that an Extra 

Ordinary General Meeting (EGM) of the BOD be called, for the said 

purpose. Similar requisitions, in respect of M/s. Able Management 

Consultants Pvt. Ltd., M/s. Verma Finvest Pvt. Ltd., and M/s. Nishit 

Capinvest Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Nishit"), were issued 

by RGG on 24 th January, 2018, 25 th January, 2018 and 29 th January, 

2018. Admittedly, BDR, Cable Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd., 

Verma Finvest Pvt. Ltd. and Nishit were companies which came to 

the share of DGG, under the Family Settlements. 

13.4 The above acts of RGG/Rajesh Gupta led to the filing, by 

Dinesh Gupta, of CS (OS) 51/2018 (Dinesh Gupta & Ors. v. Rajesh 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 9 of 82 

Gupta & Ors.), before this Court, praying for a permanent injunction, 

restraining Rajesh Gupta/RGG from acting in contravention of the 

Family Settlements dated 2 nd December, 2017 and 9 th December, 

2017, or interfering with the rights of DGG thereunder, and for 

appointment of KPMG, or any other reputed firm, to effectuate the 

said Family Settlements. 

13.5 Holding that DGG had managed to establish a prima facie case 

in its favour, a learned Single Judge of this Court, vide order dated 7 th 

February, 2018, in CS (OS) 51/2018, restrained RGG from giving 

effect to the notices dated 19 th January, 2018, 24 th January, 2018, 25 th 

January, 2018 and 29 th January, 2018, till the next date of hearing. 

14. Acts of Anand Gupta/AGG, leading to CS (OS) 100/2018 

14.1 On 22 nd February, 2018, Anand Gupta (HUF) and Sanchit 

Gupta, son of Anand Gupta, wrote to Shreyansh Gupta, alleging that 

the transfer of ₹ 19.55 crores, earned by liquidation of the investments 

made by AGG in Mutual Funds, to the account of DGG, had been 

effected without the consent of AGG and was, therefore, fraudulent. 

It was alleged that AGG had given signed blank cheques to Shreyansh 

Gupta, in good faith, so that the moneys, resulting from the liquidation 

of the Mutual Funds, could be invested in appropriate securities. 

Instead, it was alleged, Shreyansh Gupta, on behalf of DGG, had 

transferred the said moneys into the personal account of DGG, 

thereby misappropriating the said amount. The communication, 

therefore, required the said amount to be transferred back to AGG.

14.2 On 12 th February, 2018, Anand Gupta wrote to BDR, Dinesh 

Gupta and Shreyansh Gupta, requiring them to repay, to Anand 

Gupta, a loan of ₹ 77,48,870/-, advanced by Anand Gupta, for 

investment in real estate projects and repayable on demand. The 

notice was predicated on the allegation that Dinesh Gupta and 

Shreyansh Gupta had committed various frauds, with which the 

present petition is not really concerned. 

14.3 On 16 February, 2018, Sanchit Gupta issued a requisition, 

under Section 100 (2) of the Companies Act, in respect of Renu 

Promoters. Sanchit Gupta asserted his authority to issue the said 

requisition, as he held 50% of the total paid-up equity share capital in 

Renu Promoters. Alleging that Dinesh Gupta had mismanaged the 

affairs of Renu Promoters and had, thereby, rendered himself 

incapable of continuing as Director of the said Company and liable to 

be removed under Section 169 of the Companies Act, the requisition 

sought convening of an EGM for the said purpose. 

14.4 On 23 rd February, 2018, AGG wrote to Dinesh Gupta and 

Shreyansh Gupta, with respect to the shareholding of AGG in BDR. 

It was asserted, in the said communication, that AGG had never 

transferred, of its own volition, its shares in BDR to DGG. Rather, 

the notice asserted that AGG had agreed to sell its shares in BDR to 

DGG @ ₹ 200/-per equity share and that, for this purpose, AGG had 

affixed signatures on Blank Delivery Instruction Slips, which were 

handed over, to Dinesh Gupta, with the understanding that the slips 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 11 of 82 

would be used to transfer the shares to DGG only after DGG paid, for 

such transfer, at the rate of ₹ 200/-per share. The slips, it was 

alleged, had been misused, by DGG, to fraudulently transfer the 

shares in its favour. As such, the notice called on DGG to pay, to 

AGG, consideration for such transfer, at the rate of ₹ 200/-per share, 

and not to deal with the said shares till such payment was made. 

14.5 These acts, of AGG, were challenged, by DGG, before this 

Court, by way of CS (OS) 100/2018 (Dinesh Gupta & Ors. v. Anand 

Gupta & Ors.). 

Judgement dated 16 th November, 2018 in IAs, under Order XXXIX, 
preferred in CS (OS) 51/2018 and CS (OS) 100/2018, and orders 
passed in FAO (OS) 6/2019 and FAO (OS) 18/2019, filed thereagainst 

15. The interlocutory applications, preferred under Order XXXIX 

of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), for stay -IA 1854/2018 

in CS (OS) 51/2018 (Dinesh Gupta & Ors. v. Rajesh Gupta & Ors.) 

and IA 3238/2018 in CS (OS) 100/2018 (Dinesh Gupta & Ors. v.

(vide paras 53 and 54 of the judgement): 

"53. Accordingly, in the interest of family amity and unity 
and to uphold the family settlement, I confirm the interim 
order passed by this Court dated 7.2.2018 in CS (OS) 
51/2018. Similarly, in IA No 3238/2018 in CS (OS) 
100/2018, I pass an interim order restraining the defendants 
from giving effect to the notice dated 16.02.2018 issued under

passed against the defendants restraining them from giving 
effect to the notice/communication dated 12.02.2018, 
22.02.2018 and 23.02.2018. As far as IA No. 3241/2018 in 
CS (OS) 101/2018 is concerned, an interim order was passed 
restraining defendant No. 2 from giving effect to the notice 
dated 16.02.2018 issued under Section 100 of the Companies 
Act. 

54. 
However, the above interim order shall continue to 
operate during pendency of the accompanying suit provided 
the plaintiff does the following acts within six weeks from 
today: -

(i) 
He will pay to Mr. Rajesh Gupta a sum of Rs. 
11.28 crores plus Rs.5.28 crores which he is seeking to 
withhold on his own interpretation of the family

subject to further orders that may be passed by the 
court. 

(ii)

(v) 
All the companies which are listed in the family 
settlement will ensure that the quarterly statement of 
accounts are regularly provided to the two main 
parties, namely, Mr. Dinesh Gupta and Mr. Rajesh 
Gupta respectively." 

16. The above order, dated 16 th November, 2018, was carried, in 

appeal, both by Dinesh Gupta and Anand Gupta, vide FAO (OS) 

6/2019 (Dinesh Gupta & Ors. v. Rajesh Gupta & Ors.) and FAO 

(OS) 18/2019 (Anand Gupta & Ors. v. Dinesh Gupta & Ors.). 

While issuing notice, in FAO (OS) 6/2019, the Division Bench of this 

Court, on 14 th January, 2019, stayed, till the next date of hearing, 

directions (i) and (iv) in para 54 of the judgement, dated 16 th 

November, 2018 supra, of the learned Single Judge. 

17. Finally, vide order dated 18 th March, 2019, the Division Bench 

disposed of the aforesaid FAO (OS) 6/2019 and FAO (OS) 18/2019, 

by consent, as the parties agreed to reference of the dispute, between 

them, to the arbitration of Hon'ble Mr. Justice A. K. Sikri (retd.). 

All three suits, which were before the learned Single Judge, were 

referred to the learned Sole Arbitrator. The operative paragraphs of 

the order, dated 18 th March, 2019, merit reproduction, thus: 

"Accordingly, the disputes in all three suits are referred to the 
Sole Arbitration of Mr. Justice A. K. Sikri (Retd. Judge, 
Supreme Court), for decision on merits. 

Parties are also agreeable that the interim arrangement 
ordered by the learned Single Judge in the impugned order 
dated 16.11.2018, as modified by the Division Bench in its 
order dated 14.1.2019 in FAO (OS) No. 6/2019 be continued, 
and the present appeal is i.e. FAO (OS) No. 6/2019 and FAO 
(OS) No. 18/2019 and Cross Objections [No. 5947/2019 in 
FAO (OS) No. 6/2019] be also placed before learned 
Arbitrator to be treated as the applications under Section 17 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 14 of 82 

of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, for decision. 
Parties are further agreeable that they may move further 
application, if any, under Section 17 of the Arbitration and 
Conciliation Act, 1996 before the learned Arbitrator. Ordered 
accordingly. 

The learned Arbitrator shall be free to pass orders under 
Section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 after 
hearing the parties, uninfluenced either by the impugned 
order dated 16.11.2018 passed by a learned Single Judge, or 
by the order dated 14.1.2019 passed by the Division Bench. 
The impugned order dated 16.11.2018 passed by the learned 
Single Judge and the order dated 14.1.2019 shall merge in the 
orders that may be passed by the Ld. Arbitrator." 

Proceedings before the learned Sole Arbitrator, and the passing of the 
impugned Order dated 18 th February, 2020 

18. Before the learned Sole Arbitrator, Anand Gupta/AGG filed 

two counter-claims. 

19. Counter-claim by Anand Gupta/AGG related to Mutual Funds, 
claiming a total of ₹ 19,55,00,000/-: 

19.1 This counter claim (hereinafter referred to as "the Mutual 

Funds counter-claim", for the sake of convenience) was 

preferred by Anand Gupta (HUF) and Sanchit Gupta, 

representing, in essence, the interests of AGG. It was 

contended, in the counter-claim, that, on 30 th November, 2017 

and 4 th December, 2017, the counter-claimants liquidated part 

of their investments in their Mutual Funds, and credited the 

amounts in their respective bank accounts. Thereafter, signed 

blank cheques were stated to have been handed over, to 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 15 of 82 

Shreyansh Gupta, for investing the amounts in appropriate 

equity Mutual Funds, which, purportedly, was a practice that 

had been adopted on earlier occasions as well. It was alleged 

that Shreyansh Gupta, taking advantage of the family 

relationship, and without the consent of the counter-claimants, 

fraudulently transferred, to his own account, ₹ 19,55,00,000/-, 

using the said blank cheques. Of the said amount, ₹ 

15,25,00,000/-was stated to have been misappropriated from 

Anand Gupta (HUF), and ₹ 4,30,00,000/-from Sanchit Gupta. 

Emphasising the fact that the counter-claimants (being the 

respondents in the present proceedings) were not party to any 

family settlement between DGG and RGG, and refuting the 

assertion, by DGG, that ₹ 19,55,00,000/-had been "gifted", to 

DGG by AGG, the counter-claimants asserted their right to 

recovery of the said amount of ₹ 19,55,00,000/-, with interest. 

19.2 The counter-claim, therefore, prayed that Shreyansh 

Gupta be directed to pay ₹ 15,25,00,000/-and ₹ 4,30,00,000/-, 

respectively, to Sanchit Gupta and Anand Gupta, with interest 

@ 18% p.a. 

20. Counter-claim by Anand Gupta/AGG relating to 26,86,190 
shares of BDR: 

20.1 This counter-claim, by Anand Gupta, Sanchit Gupta, 

Meena Gupta (wife of Anand Gupta) and Aashna Gupta 

(daughter of Anand Gupta) (referred to, hereinafter, for the sake 

of convenience, as the "BDR Shares counter-claim"), alleged 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 16 of 82 

fraudulent and illegal transfer of 26,86,190 shares of BDR, held 

by the counter-claimants, by DGG, to its DEMAT account. It 

was asserted, in the counter-claim, that, by oral agreement, 

DGG was obligated to pay ₹ 53,72,38,000/-, to the counter-

claimants, against transfer of 26,86,190 equity shares of BDR. 

On the said assurance, the counter-claimants claimed to have 

signed and executed blank Delivery Instruction Slips, which 

were expected to be used, by DGG, for transferring the shares 

only after the consideration, for such transfer, at the rate of ₹ 

200/-per equity share, was paid by it. In violation of the said 

understanding, the counter-claimants alleged that DGG had 

fraudulently transferred the aforesaid 26,86,190 equity shares of 

BDR, to its DEMAT account, without paying the agreed 

consideration therefor. Emphasising the fact that they were not 

party to the purported Family Settlements between DGG and 

RGG, the counter-claimants asserted their right to be paid the 

agreed consideration, for transfer of the aforesaid equity shares 

of BDR, along with interest. 

20.2 The counter-claim, therefore, prayed that DGG be 

directed to pay ₹ 19,02,74,000/-to Anand Gupta, ₹ 

21,07,24,000/-to Sanchit Gupta, ₹ 4,81,20,000/-to Meena 

Gupta and ₹ 8,81,20,000/-to Aashna Gupta, along with interest 

@ 18% p.a. 

Fresh applications, under Section 17, preferred before the learned Sole 
Arbitrator 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 17 of 82 

21. Four fresh applications, under Section 17 of the 1996 Act, were 

preferred, before the learned Sole Arbitrator. Of these, one was 

preferred by DGG and three were preferred by AGG. 

22. Fresh application, under Section 17, preferred before the 
learned Sole Arbitrator by DGG, seeking implementation of the 
Family Settlements: 

22.1 Alleging that, while it had itself implemented the covenants of 

the Family Settlements "to an extent of more than eighty percent", 

RGG had implemented the said covenants only to the extent of thirty 

percent, and that the acts of AGG, prejudicial to the interests of DGG, 

were provoked by RGG, an application, under Section 17 of the 1996 

Act, was moved, before the learned Sole Arbitrator, by DGG. 

Reference was invited to the orders, passed by the learned Single 

Judge, as well as by the Division Bench, cited supra. DGG expressed 

discomfiture at the fact that the shares, transferred by DGG to RGG, 

were being used by RGG for, inter alia, issuing notices under Section 

100 of the Companies Act and filing proceedings before the NCLT. It 

was further contended that Mutual Funds, held by Dinesh Gupta in his 

personal name, were being blocked by Rajesh Gupta on the ground 

that he was the nominee therein. Owing to these obstructions, it was 

pointed out that Dinesh Gupta had not been able to withdraw any of 

the Mutual Funds which, even as per the Family Settlements, 

devolved on DGG. 

22.2 DGG also advanced various reasons, to dispute the allegations 

of AGG, regarding fraudulent transfer of shares into the DEMAT 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 18 of 82 

account of DGG. It was pointed out that the complete exit of AGG, 

from Renu Farms and Renu Promoters, was manifest even by the 

alteration of the authorised signatories of the said Bank accounts. 

Further, DGG pointed out that AGG had never set up any claim, in 

any Court of law, challenging the documents of transfer, and the 

limitation for such challenge had also expired. In view of the 

submissions, it was prayed, in the application, that 

(i) 
the order, dated 16 th November, 2018, passed by the 

learned Single Judge in CS (OS) 101/2018, be continued during 

the pendency of the arbitral proceedings, 

(ii) RGG be directed to deposit, before the learned Sole 

Arbitrator, all shares held by him in Companies/entities which 

came to the share of DGG, under the Family Settlement dated 

9 th December, 2017, 

(iii) RGG be directed to remove the objection in respect of 

encashment of the Mutual Funds in favour of DGG, and 

(iv) RGG be directed to provide authorisation to DGG for 

commencement/prosecution of any actionable claims pertaining 

to the shares of DGG, in Companies which went to RGG under 

the Family Settlement. 

23. Three applications, under Section 17, preferred before the 
learned Sole Arbitrator by AGG/Sanchit Gupta: 

23.1 On 12 th April, 2019, AGG/the members thereof, filed three 

applications, under Section 17, before the learned Sole Arbitrator. For 

the sake of convenience, they would be referred to, hereinafter, as the 

first, second and third Section 17 applications, respectively. 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 19 of 82 

23.2 The first Section 17 application was filed by Sanchit Gupta, 

purportedly for protection of the rights and interests of shareholders in 

Renu Promoters, against the acts of Dinesh Gupta and Shreyansh 

Gupta, in their capacity as Directors in the said Company. The 

application alleged that Dinesh Gupta and Shreyansh Gupta were "not 

handling the issue efficiently with the tenant of the property" of Renu 

Promoters, located at W-12, Greater Kailash Part II, New Delhi. Even 

while judgement was reserved, by the learned Single Judge in CS 

(OS) 100/2018, it was alleged that Dinesh Gupta and Shreyansh 

Gupta had sold the said property, vide Sale Deed dated 18 th May, 

2018, for ₹ 10,50,00,000/-. 

23.3 Pointing out that AGG was not a party to the Family 

Settlements between DGG and RGG, and that the said Family 

Settlements had also been disputed by RGG on various grounds, the 

application asserted that, in issuing notices under Section 100 of the 

Companies Act, for convening of the EGM, Sanchit Gupta was 

merely exercising his statutory rights, in view of the fact that Dinesh 

Gupta was acting against the interests of Renu Promoters. In the 

circumstances, the application prayed that 

(i) 
Dinesh Gupta, Shreyansh Gupta and Renu Promoters be 

directed to maintain status quo, in relation to the immovable 

assets of Renu Promoters, as well as in relation to its 

shareholdings, and that 

(ii) Dinesh Gupta and Shreyansh Gupta be restrained from 

taking any decision in their capacity as Directors in Renu 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 20 of 82 

Promoters, or from utilising any money received on behalf of 

Renu Promoters. 

23.4 The second Section 17 application, by Sanchit Gupta and 

Anand Gupta HUF, sought restraint, against Shreyansh Gupta, in 

respect of M/s. C. R. Farms Pvt Ltd (hereinafter referred to as "C.R. 

Farms"). The prayer was premised on the alleged entitlement, of 

AGG, to recover ₹ 19.55 crores from Shreyansh Gupta. As the share 

capital of CR Farms had been acquired by utilisating of part of the 

alleged fraudulent transferred amount of ₹ 19.55 crores, the 

application sought restraint, against Shreyansh Gupta, from 

(i) 
alienating the said equity shares, 

(ii) creating any charge, encumbrance or third party rights on 

the said equity shares, 

(iii) enjoying any benefits, including exercising of voting 

rights, accruing to Shreyansh Gupta from holding of the said 

shares, and 

(iv) transferring/liquidating any mutual funds, acquired from 

the allegedly fraudulently transferred amount, 

till the amount of ₹ 19.55 crores was repaid to Anand Gupta HUF and 

Sanchit Gupta. 

23.5 The impugned direction was issued in this application. 

23.6 The third Section 17 application was filed by Anand Gupta, 

Sanchit Gupta, Meena Gupta and Aashna Gupta, for restraining 

Dinesh Gupta and Shreyansh Gupta from alienating 26,86,190 shares 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 21 of 82 

of BDR. It was alleged, in the application, that, by oral agreement, 

the applicants had agreed to transfer 26,86,190 equity shares of BDR 

to Dinesh Gupta and Shreyansh Gupta, on condition of payment, by 

the latter, of ₹ 53,72,38,000/-. Acting on the basis of the said 

purported oral agreement, the applicants claimed to have executed 

blank Delivery Instruction Slips, which were to be used by Dinesh 

Gupta and Shreyansh Gupta, for transfer of the said shares to DGG, 

only after payment of consideration, therefor, @ ₹ 200/-per equity 

share. In violation of the said oral agreement, the application alleged 

that Dinesh Gupta and Shreyansh Gupta had fraudulently transferred 

26,86,190 shares, of BDR, to their DEMAT Account. The applicants, 

therefore, claimed that they were entitled to consideration, for the said 

transfer, amounting to ₹ 53,72,38,000/-. The application, therefore, 

sought a restraint, against Dinesh Gupta and Shreyansh Gupta, from 

alienating the aforesaid 26,86,190 equity shares of BDR, or from 

creating any third party rights in respect thereof. 

24. As a result, the learned Sole Arbitrator had, before him, seven 

applications, under Section 17 of the 1996 Act -the three Civil Suits 

filed before the learned Single Judge, i.e. CS (OS) 51/2018, CS (OS) 

100/2018 and CS (OS) 101/2018, one fresh application filed by 

Dinesh Gupta and three fresh applications filed by AGG/its members. 

Besides these, applications had also been preferred, under Section 17, 

by RGG and by Bechu Singh, with which we need not concern 

ourselves. 

The impugned Order 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 22 of 82 

25. Though the grievance of the petitioner is with respect to a 

limited direction in the impugned Order, it is necessary to examine 

how the learned Sole Arbitrator has proceeded, while deciding the 

aforesaid applications, under Section 17, preferred by DGG and 

AGG/their respective members. 

26. The learned Sole Arbitrator has observed, at the outset, that the 

execution of the Family Settlement dated 2 nd December, 2017 and 9 th 

December, 2017, was undisputed, and that it was also an admitted 

position that, even prior to the recording of the said Family 

Settlements, DGG, RGG and even AGG were taking actions to 

detangle their rights in various Companies, in terms thereof. 

Disputes, however, persisted, with respect to implementation of the 

Settlement Agreement qua actionable claims, to be pursued by one, or 

the other, faction, with respect to Companies which fell to the share of 

that faction, though they remained with the other. The learned Sole 

Arbitrator placed reliance on the decisions in Kale v Deputy Director 

of Consolidation 1 , S. Shanmugham Pillai v. K. Shanmugham Pillai 2 

and Hari Shankar Singhania v. Gaur Hari Singhania 3 , to hold that 

arrangements in family settlements were sacrosanct, and commanded 

implicit compliance. 

27. Proceeding, thereafter, to the applications filed by DGG and 

AGG, or their members, under Section 17, the learned Sole Arbitrator 

has, on the application of DGG, continued the order, dated 16 th 

1 (1976) 3 SCC 119 
2 (1973) 2 SCC 312 
3 (2006) 4 SCC 658 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 23 of 82 

November, 2018, of the learned Single Judge, as his own order, in the 

arbitral proceedings. No grievance, with this decision, has been 

expressed by either side. 

28. The learned Sole Arbitrator has, thereafter, proceeded to advert 

to the three applications, under Section 17, preferred by AGG, or its 

members. 

29. Apropos the first Section 17 application, filed by Sanchit Gupta 

on 12 th April, 2019, for a direction, to DGG and Shreyans Gupta to 

maintain status quo in relation to the immovable assets of BDR and 

Nimit Builders Pvt. Ltd., the learned Sole Arbitrator has noticed that 

these Companies fell to the share of DGG, under the Family 

Settlements. Though AGG was not a signatory thereto, DGG, it has 

been noticed, had contended that the Family Settlements had the 

blessings of Anand Gupta/AGG, who/which had acted on the basis 

thereof, by transferring shares, held by it in Companies which had 

fallen to the share of DGG under the Family Settlements, to DGG, and 

also by remitting, to the accounts of the members of DGG, amounts 

realised by encashment of various mutual funds. Observing that these 

actions were in tune with the covenants of the Family Settlements, the 

learned Sole Arbitrator has found that a prima facie case existed, in 

favour of DGG. 

30. The learned Sole Arbitrator has, thereafter, referred to the 

decisions of the Supreme Court in Narendra Kante v. Anuradha 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 24 of 82 

Kante 4 and M. S. Madhusoodanan v. Kerala Kaumudi (P) Ltd 5 , as 

well as of this Court in Satya Pal Gupta v. Sudhir Kumar Gupta 6 , to 

observe that family settlements were enforceable even against non-

signatories thereto. As BDR and Nishit fell, under the Family 

Settlements, to the share of DGG, the learned Sole Arbitrator held that 

it was not appropriate to restrain DGG from dealing with the said 

Companies, especially as they were in the business of real estate, and 

any direction, to them, to maintain status quo in respect of the 

immovable assets of BDR and Nishit would stifle their business. It 

was noticed that the said assets were the stock-in-trade of BDR and 

Nishit. Even so, DGG was directed to maintain status quo in respect 

of those immovable assets which constituted part of its capital assets, 

and were not part of its stock-in-trade. 

31. Adverting to the second and third applications, under Section 

17 of the 1996 Act, preferred by AGG/its members, the learned Sole 

Arbitrator held thus (in para 3.28 of the impugned Order, the 

concluding sentence of which constitutes the subject matter of 

challenge herein): 

"In the other two applications filed by members of AGG, they 
are seeking restitution of the amounts which they have 
remitted. For the reasons given above, such a relief cannot be 
granted at this stage as it needs determination as to whether 
the payments were made by AGG of (sic to?) DGG 
voluntarily pursuant to the Family Settlements or they are 
fraudulently secured by DGG as contended by AGG in these 
applications. At the same time, in order to secure the interest 
of AGG, in the event AGG ultimately succeeds, it would be 

4 (2010) 2 SCC 77 
5 (2004) 9 SCC 204 
6 2016 SCC OnLine Del 2502 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 25 of 82 

appropriate to direct DGG to furnish suitable (security) 
equivalent to the sums involved, to the Tribunal." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

(It may be mentioned, here, that the word "security", as parenthesized 

in the concluding sentence of the afore-extracted para, does not figure 

in the paragraph, as contained in the copy of the impugned Order, 

filed by the petitioner. However, the subsequent clarificatory order, 

passed by the learned Sole Arbitrator on 14 th May, 2020, indicates that 

DGG was directed to furnish security.) 

32. DGG claims, in this appeal, to be aggrieved by the direction to 

it, as contained in the italicised sentence from the afore-extracted para 

3.28 of the impugned Order passed by the learned Sole Arbitrator, to 

furnish security equivalent to the sums involved. This direction, 

contends DGG -as vocalized, on its behalf, by Mr. Rajeev Nayar, 

learned Senior Counsel -was completely unjustified, as well as 

unsustainable in law. It is, therefore, prayed that the said direction be 

quashed and set aside. 

33. DGG, RGG and AGG, thereafter, moved an application, before 

the learned Sole Arbitrator, for clarification of the impugned order, 

dated 18 th February, 2020, in certain respects. All these applications 

were disposed of, by the learned Sole Arbitrator, vide a common order 

dated 14 th May, 2020. Dealing with the clarifications sought by DGG, 

the learned Sole Arbitrator observed, inter alia, that 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 26 of 82 

(i) 
the direction for maintenance of status quo, by DGG, in 

respect of the capital assets of BDR and Nishit, related to the 

assets of Renu Promoters, 

(ii) in addition to continuation, of the order, dated 16 th 

November, 2018 supra, passed by the learned Single Judge, the 

orders of restraint, passed by the learned Single Judge, in 

respect of the notices, under Section 100 of the Companies Act, 

dated 12 th February, 2018, 22 nd February, 2018 and 23 rd 

February, 2018, were also continued, and 

(iii) the prayer for "clarification", of the direction, to DGG, to 

transfer the shares of Nishit by Renu Gupta to BDR, amounted 

to seeking a review of the impugned order, which was not 

permissible. 

Apropos the clarifications sought by AGG, the learned Sole Arbitrator 

only addressed the submission that, qua the impugned direction to 

DGG to furnish security, no time period had been stipulated. The 

learned Sole Arbitrator clarified that security was required to be 

furnished, by DGG, as directed in the impugned para 3.28 of the order 

dated 18 th February, 2020, within four weeks, to the satisfaction of the 

learned Sole Arbitrator. 

34. The findings of the learned Sole Arbitrator, qua the 

clarifications sought by RGG, are not relevant for the purposes of the 

present petition, and are not, therefore, being adverted to. 

Rival Contentions 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 27 of 82 

35. Mr. Rajiv Nayar, on behalf of the appellant, advances the 

following submissions, to assail the impugned direction, in para 3.28 

of the order dated 18 th February, 2020, of the learned Sole Arbitrator: 

(i) 
No prayer, for directing furnishing of security, by DGG, 

had been made by AGG, in any of its applications, under 

Section 17. The prayer was only for restraint, against DGG, 

from dealing with the shares held by DGG in C.R. Farms and 

with the shares of BDR. No prayer, for restitution of any 

amount, was contained in the applications. The impugned 

direction, for furnishing of security, proceeded on the premise 

that AGG had sought restitution/refund, of the amount of ₹ 

19.55 crores. As such, the learned Sole Arbitrator had 

exceeded his jurisdiction in granting a relief, unclaimed by 

AGG. Reliance is placed, for this purpose, on the judgements 

of this Court in Tata Advanced Systems Ltd v. Texcell 

Information Systems Ltd 7 , Captain Guman Singh & Sons v. 

Indian Oil Corporation 8 and NHPC Ltd v. HCC Ltd 9 . 

(ii) Having observed, in para 3.26 of the impugned Order 

dated 18 th February, 2020, that a prima facie case existed in 

favour of DGG, the learned Sole Arbitrator erred in directing 

furnishing of security, by DGG, in favour of AGG. 

(iii) The direction for furnishing of security was also vitiated 

by non-compliance, in the facts of the case, with the ingredients 

7 MANU/DE/1061/2020 
8 2016 SCC Online Del 983 
9 2018 IX AD (Delhi) 1 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 28 of 82 

of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 

(CPC), which were not even pleaded by AGG. The learned 

Sole Arbitrator could not, therefore, have directed furnishing of 

security, by DGG, merely on the basis of an unascertained 

counter-claim. Reliance has been placed, for this proposition, 

on the judgements of the Supreme Court in State Bank of 

India v. Ericsson India Pvt Ltd 10 and of this Court in C.V. Rao 

and Krishnapatnam Port Co. Ltd. v. 
Strategic Port 

Investments KPC Ltd 11 , Lanco Infratech Ltd. v. Hindustan 

Construction Co Ltd 12 , Goodwill Non-Woven (P) Ltd v. Xcoal 

Energy and Resources LLC 13 and BMW India Private Limited 

v. Libra Automotives Pvt Ltd 14 . 

(iv) Even if it were to be presumed that the learned Sole 

Arbitrator has the power to "mould" the reliefs prayed for, such 

moulding had to be informed by reasons, to be contained in the 

order. Relief, not sought in the application under Section 17, 

and not pressed even during arguments before the learned Sole 

Arbitrator, could not have been granted. Least of all could the 

learned Sole Arbitrator have directed furnishing of security, by 

DGG, without putting DGG, in the first instance, on notice in 

that regard. Reliance was placed, in this context, on the 

judgements of the Supreme Court in Om Prakash Gupta v. 

Ranbir B. Goyal 15 (which, according to Mr. Nayar, set out the 

10 (2018) 16 SCC 617 
11 218 (2015) DLT 200 (DB) 
12 234 (2016) DLT 175

Page 29 of 82 

circumstances in which relief could be moulded, none of which 

were satisfied in the present case) and Seshambal v. Chelur 

Corporation Chelur Building 16 . 

(v) No finding of the existence of a prima facie case, in 

favour of AGG, had been returned by the learned Sole 

Arbitrator. Nor has the learned Sole Arbitrator addressed the 

concerns of balance of convenience and irreparable loss, which, 

in conjunction with the existence of a prima facie case, 

constituted the troika for grant of interim relief. Mr. Nayar 

relied, in this context, on the judgement of this Court in 

Intertoll ICS Cecons O & M Co. Pvt Ltd v. N.H.A.I. 17 . 

(vi) AGG was acting with clear dishonesty, as it was 

challenging the actions, taken by it in favour of DGG, without 

challenging similar actions, taken by it in favour of RGG. 

(vii) The liability for security had entirely been fastened on 

DGG, whereas the liability of AGG, if any, would fall on the 

entire estate shared between DGG and RGG. 

36. Responding to the submissions of Mr. Nayar, it was contended, 

by Mr. Sudhir Nandrajog, learned Senior Counsel for AGG, thus: 

(i) 
AGG was neither a party, nor a signatory, to the Family 

Settlement dated 2 nd December, 2017 and 9 December, 2017. 

In fact, it had been conceded by DGG, in CS (OS) 51/2018, that 

16 (2010) 3 SCC 470 
17 ILR (2013) II Del 1018 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 30 of 82 

"all objections, rights and obligations of the third branch i.e. 

Anand Gupta Group stood satisfied and settled prior to the 

execution of the Family Settlement", thus obviating the 

necessity of including the Anand Gupta Group in the Family 

Settlement. 

(ii) The business of AGG was not interconnected, in any 

manner, with that of DGG. There was no reason, therefore, for 

AGG to be part of any settlement between DGG and RGG. 

(iii) The Family Settlements did not address the claims of 

AGG, and limited themselves to settling the estate of DGG and 

RGG. Such a "partial" Family Settlement, excluding the rights 

and claims of other groups, which had legitimate interests, was 

impermissible and unenforceable. There was no inter-se 

Family Settlement between DGG, RGG and AGG. 

(iv) Having asserted, in CS (OS) 51/2018, (as noted 

hereinabove) that all rights and obligations of AGG stood 

satisfied and settled prior to the execution of the Family 

Settlements, DGG was seeking to contend, now, that AGG had 

obligations under the Family Settlements. 

(v) Apropos the submission, of Mr. Nayar, that the learned 

Sole Arbitrator had erred in granting a relief, not sought or 

claimed by AGG, it was contended that a plain reading of the 

impugned Order revealed that the learned Sole Arbitrator had, 

in fact, rejected the relief, sought by AGG, and had granted a 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 31 of 82 

lesser relief, in the form of furnishing of security. The power of 

the learned Sole Arbitrator, to do so, was unexceptionable. Mr. 

Nandrajog drew my attention, in this context, to the prayers of 

AGG, in the applications, preferred by it under Section 17. It 

was also submitted, in this context, that, in fact, the property at 

C.R. Farms had been purchased by DGG using the monies 

realised by liquidation of the Mutual Funds, in which AGG had 

invested. 

(vi) Besides, even on facts, it was submitted that, as the order, 

dated 18 th March, 2019, of the Division Bench in FAO (OS) 

6/2019 and FAO (OS) 18/2019, directed the said appeals to be 

treated as applications under Section 17, it could not be said 

that the learned Sole Arbitrator had exceeded his jurisdiction in 

directing furnishing of security by DGG. My attention was 

invited, in this context, to the reliefs sought in the appeals 

which, according to Mr. Nandrajog, were in excess of mere 

furnishing of security. 

(vii) The reliefs claimed by AGG, in its counter claims, was 

also relevant. The amounts claimed by AGG were in excess of 

₹ 70 crores. 

(viii) Para 3.27 of the impugned Order clearly noted the 

contentions of the parties, and gave reasons for not granting the 

larger relief claimed by AGG. The status quo, as directed to be 

maintained by DGG, was also restricted to its capital assets, and 

did not extend to its stock-in-trade. This direction was not 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 32 of 82 

assailed by DGG. AGG had, in fact, sought restitution. The 

learned Sole Arbitrator held that, while it was not possible to 

grant restitution as claimed, it was equitable to direct furnishing 

of security by DGG. In so directing, the learned Sole Arbitrator 

clearly acted within the confines of the jurisdiction, vested in 

him by clauses (b) and (e) of Section 17 (2) of the 1996 Act. 

(ix) The direction for furnishing of securities effectively 

balanced the equities between the parties. No occasion, for 

interference therewith, therefore, existed. In this context, my 

attention was invited to the fact that the learned Sole Arbitrator 

had stayed all the recovery notices, issued by AGG. 

(x) The reliance, by the appellant, on Order XXXVIII Rule 5 

of the CPC, was misplaced. Section 17 of the 1996 Act was a 

complete code in itself. In view of Section 19 of the 1996 Act, 

the CPC did not apply. The restrictions, which influenced 

exercise of jurisdiction under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the 

CPC, were not incorporated, either expressly or by necessary 

implication, into Section 17. 

(xi) Besides, the invocation of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 was, 

even otherwise, misconceived on facts, as the learned Sole 

Arbitrator had not directed attachment, but only furnishing of 

security. 

(xii) Though DGG, RGG and AGG had all applied for 

clarification of the impugned Order dated 18 th February, 2020, 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 33 of 82 

no clarification, of the direction to furnish security, was sought 

by the appellant. The balance of convenience was also, 

therefore, against the appellant. 

(xiii) It was not open to DGG to rely on the Family 

Settlements, as the validity and scope thereof, were yet to be 

decided by the learned Sole Arbitrator. My attention was 

invited, in this context, to the "Proposed Points of 

Determination", as submitted by the appellant to the learned 

Sole Arbitrator, Points 4 and 7, whereof, read thus: 

"4. 
Where the Anand Gupta Group ('AGG') can be 
allowed to resile from the transactions made by it prior 
to and after the execution of the Family Settlement 
dated 02.12.2017 and 09.12.2017 on the basis that he 
was not a signatory to the said Family Settlements? 

7. 
Whether RGG, DGG, AGG, BSE deserved to 
be directed to comply with the terms of the Family 
Settlement in a manner that valuations which leads to 
the entire capital distributed 50:50 amongst RGG and 
DGG and accordingly be directed to not employ others 
to destroy the letter and spirit of such terms of the 
Family Settlement dated 02.12.2017 and 09.12.2017?" 

(xiv) There was nothing to indicate that the claim of ₹ 19.55 

crores, by AGG, was part of the Family Settlement. Nor was 

there any evidence to indicate that the said amount had been 

gifted by AGG to DGG. The appellant, too, had not averred 

that this amount was shown as gift, in its Tax Returns. 

(xv) Inasmuch as the issue of whether AGG was, or was not, 

part of the Family Settlement, and was bound by the terms 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 34 of 82 

thereof, was yet to be determined, the direction, to DGG, to 

furnish security, was equitable, and did not call for interference. 

If, ultimately, the learned Sole Arbitrator was to reach the 

opinion that the Family Settlements were binding, AGG would 

be left high and dry. 

(xvi) The reliance, by the appellant, on Sections 91 and 92 of 

the Evidence Act, was misplaced, as these provisions applied 

only where a person sought to lead evidence contrary to the 

document to which he was a signatory. No such occasion arose 

in the present case. 

(xvii) The impugned Order had been passed at a preliminary 

stage, and could not be said to suffer from any such perversity, 

as would justify interference, by this Court. 

37. Arguing in rejoinder, Mr. Nayar re-emphasised the fact that, 

having held, in para 3.28 of the impugned Order dated 18 th February, 

2020, that no relief, for restitution of the amounts, as claimed by 

AGG, could be granted, the learned Sole Arbitrator signally erred in 

directing furnishing of security by the appellant. Mr. Nayar 

emphasised, further, that the contentions, advanced by Mr. Nandrajog, 

did not constitute the basis for the impugned direction, of the learned 

Sole Arbitrator. He submitted that the direction to furnish security, if 

issued under Section 17 of the 1996 Act, had necessarily to conform 

to the discipline of Order XXXVIII Rule 5, sub-rule (4) whereof 

rendered void any order for attachment, passed in violation of sub-rule 

(1). Mr. Nayar submitted that the emphasis, by Mr. Nandrajog, on the 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 35 of 82 

impugned direction being equitable in nature, was misguided, as the 

learned Sole Arbitrator was not empowered to act on the basis of 

equity. There was, Mr. Nayar re-emphasised, no prayer, for 

furnishing of security, made by AGG at any stage of the proceedings, 

including the appeals, against the order of the learned Single Judge, 

which had been converted, by this Court, into applications under 

Section 17 of the 1996 Act. 

Analysis 

Scope of interference under Section 37 

38. Before proceeding to examine the submissions of learned 

Senior Counsel, as advanced before me, it would be appropriate to 

address, in the first instance, the scope and ambit of Section 37 of the 

1996 Act, especially apropos the jurisdiction, of this Court, to 

interfere with interlocutory orders passed by the learned Arbitrator 

under Section 17. 

39. Section 37, on its plain reading, provides for an appeal against 

certain orders. The provision does not define the scope and extent of 

the said jurisdiction of the High Court, in the matter of entertaining 

and disposing of the appeal. Nor is there any other provision, in the 

1996 Act, which enlightens on this aspect. For ready reference, 

Section 37 may be reproduced, thus: 

"Section 37. Appealable orders. 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 36 of 82 

(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for 
the time being in force, an appeal shall lie from the following 
orders (and from no others) to the Court authorised by law to 
hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the 
order, namely : --

(a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under 
section 8; 
(b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under 
section 9; 
(c) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral 
award under section 34. 

(2) Appeal shall also lie to a court from an order of the 
arbitral tribunal--
(a) accepting the plea referred to in sub-section (2) or 
sub-section (3) of section 16; or 
(b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure 
under section 17. 

(3) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal 
under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or 
take away any right to appeal to the Supreme Court." 

40. Oftentimes, the question arises as to whether the jurisdiction of 

the High Court, under Section 37, is subject to the same 

circumscriptions as formed by its jurisdiction under Section 34. Mr. 

Nayar had submitted, before me, that it would be folly to restrict the 

jurisdiction of the High Court, under Section 37, by the principles 

which apply to Section 34. He had sought to emphasise that the 

jurisdiction vested in the Court by Section 37 was appellate, unlike 

Section 34. Appellate jurisdiction, by its very nature, Mr. Nayar had 

sought to submit, is wider than the jurisdiction which applies to 

consideration of objections against an arbitral award. Appellate 

jurisdiction encompasses, within its fold, the power to review findings 

of fact and, in fact, the appellate court is, jurisprudentially, an 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 37 of 82 

extension of the original court, the appeal being a continuation of the 

original proceedings. As such, Mr. Nayar had sought to submit, the 

High Court, exercising appellate jurisdiction under Section 37, should 

not feel restricted by the constraints which govern its jurisdiction 

under Section 34. 

41. Empirically viewed, Mr. Nayar's submissions appear attractive. 

There is, undoubtedly, qualitatively, a distinction between appellate 

jurisdiction and "judicial review jurisdiction". Appellate jurisdiction, 

equally, is classically regarded as an extension of original jurisdiction, 

the appellate proceedings being an extension of the original 

proceedings. The appellate court is, therefore, ordinarily, empowered 

to re-appreciate findings of fact entered by the original court. That the 

jurisdiction of the appellate court is much wider than the jurisdiction 

of a Court exercising judicial review, of any other kind, is also, 

classically, well settled. 

42. Legal principles are, however, in every instance, required to be 

applied to the factual scenario, in which their application is invited. 

While, therefore, appreciating the jurisdiction of the High Court, 

under Section 37 of the 1996 Act, we are required to be aware of the 

fact that the order, interference with which is being invited, was 

passed by an arbitrator, or arbitral tribunal. The sanctity attached to 

arbitral awards, especially in the context of the 1996 Act -which is 

based on the UNCITRAL model -has, therefore, necessarily to be 

borne in mind, while exercising jurisdiction over the decision of the 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 38 of 82 

arbitrator, whether in the form of a final award, or an interim award 

under Section 17. 

43. In the opinion of this Court, another important, and peculiar, 

feature of the 1996 Act, which must necessarily inform the approach 

of the High Court, is that the 1996 Act provides for an appeal against 

interlocutory orders, whereas the final award is not amenable to any 

appeal, but only to objections under Section 34. If the submission of 

Mr. Nayar, as advanced, were to be accepted, it would imply that the 

jurisdiction of the Court, over the interlocutory decision of the 

arbitrator, would be much wider than the jurisdiction against the final 

award. Though, jurisprudentially, perhaps, such a position may not be 

objectionable, it does appear incongruous, and opposed to the well 

settled principle that the scope of interference with interim orders, is, 

ordinarily, much more restricted than the scope of interference with 

the final judgement. 

44. Here, yet another peculiar dispensation, in the 1996 Act, 

apropos the scope of interference with the decision of the arbitrator, 

manifests itself. The proviso to Section 36 (3) ordains that the Court, 

while considering an application for grant of stay of a final arbitral 

award for payment of money, shall "have due regard to the provisions 

for grant of stay of a decree under the provisions of the Code of Civil 

Procedure, 1908". By reference, therefore, Order 41 Rule 5 of the 

CPC, which deals with stay, by the appellate court, of original 

decrees, stands incorporated into Section 36(3) of the 1996 Act. 

Though, therefore, the final arbitral award is not made amenable to 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 39 of 82 

appeal, by the 1996 Act, any prayer for stay of the arbitral award, that 

accompanies objections under Section 34, is required to be examined 

in the light of the provisions, in the CPC, governing stay of original 

decrees, in exercise of appellate jurisdiction. Though, for the 

purposes of this judgement, it is not necessary to psychoanalyse the 

legislative intent in providing for such a peculiar dispensation, the fact 

that applications for stay of final arbitral awards, are required to be 

considered on the basis of the principles governing stay, by appellate 

courts, under Order 41 Rule 5 of the CPC, indicate, to an extent, that 

the principles of Order 41 are also required to be borne in mind, while 

exercising appellate jurisdiction, under Section 37. 

45. The 1996 Act is, preambularly, a fallout of the United Nation's 

Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), adopted in 

1995 as the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. The 

Statement of Objects and Reasons, preceding the 1996 Act, stipulates, 

in paras 2 to 5 thereof, as under, in this respect: 

" 

2. 
The United Nations Commission on International 
Trade Law (UNCITRAL) adopted in 1985 the Model Law on 
International Commercial Arbitration. The General Assembly 
of the United Nations has recommended that all countries 
give due consideration to the said Model Law, in view of the 
desirability of uniformity of the law of arbitral procedures and 
the specific needs of international commercial arbitration 
practise. The UNCITRAL also adopted in 1980 a set of 
Conciliation Rules. The General Assembly of the United 
Nations has recommended the use of these Rules in cases 
where the disputes arise in the context of international 
commercial relations and the parties seek amicable settlement 
of the disputes by recourse to conciliation. An important 
feature of the UNCITRAL Model Law and Rules is that they 
have harmonized concepts on arbitration and conciliation of 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 40 of 82 

different legal systems of the world and thus contains 
provisions which are designed for universal applications. 

3. 
Though the said UNCITRAL Model Law and Rules 
are intended to deal with International Commercial 
Arbitration and Conciliation, they could, with appropriate 
modifications, serve as a model for legislation on domestic 
arbitration and conciliation. The present Bill seeks to 
consolidate and amend the law relating to domestic 
arbitration, international commercial arbitration, enforcement 
of foreign arbitral awards and to define the law relating to 
conciliation, taking into account the said UNCITRAL Model 
Law and Rules. 

4. 
The main objectives of the Bill are as under:-
a. to comprehensively cover international and 
commercial arbitration and conciliation as also 
domestic arbitration and conciliation; 
b. to make provision for an arbitral procedure which is 
fair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs of the 
specific arbitration; 
c. to provide that the arbitral tribunal gives reasons for its 
arbitral award; 
d. to ensure that the arbitral tribunal remains within the 
limits of its jurisdiction; 
e. to minimize the supervisory role of the courts in the 
arbitral process; 
f. to permit an arbitral tribunal to use mediation, 
conciliation or other procedure during the arbitral 
proceedings to encourage settlement of disputes; 
g. to provide that every final arbitral award is enforced in 
the same manner as if it were a decree of the court; 
h. to provide a settlement agreement reached by the 
parties as a result of conciliation proceedings will have 
the same status and effect as an arbitral award on 
agreed terms on the substance of the dispute rendered 
by an arbitral tribunal; and 
i. to provide that, for purposes of enforcement of foreign 
awards, every arbitral award made in a country to 
which one of the two international Conventions 
relating to foreign arbitral awards to which India is a 
party applies, will be treated as a foreign awards. 

5. 
The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects." 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 41 of 82 

46. The Supreme Court has, in Chloro Controls (I) Ltd v. Severn 

Trent Water Purification Inc. 18 , held that the legislative intent and 

essence of the 1996 Act "is to bring domestic as well as international 

commercial arbitration in consonance with the UNCITRAL Model 

Rules, the New York Convention and Geneva Convention". The 

afore-extracted passages, from the Statements of Object and Reasons 

of the 1996 Act has, necessarily, to guide the Court, while interpreting 

the provisions thereof. While on the point, it may be noted that, in 

Bharat Sewa Sansthan v. U. P. Electronics Corporation Ltd 19 , the 

Supreme Court has clearly held the "main objective of the (1996) 

Act" as being "to make provision for an arbitral procedure which is 

fair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs of the specific 

arbitration and to minimise the supervisory role of courts in the 

arbitral process and to permit an arbitral Tribunal to use mediation, 

the conciliation or other procedures during the arbitral proceedings in 

settlement of disputes, etc." 

47. There can be no gainsaying the proposition, therefore, that, 

while exercising any kind of jurisdiction, over arbitral orders, or 

arbitral awards, whether interim or final, or with the arbitral process 

itself, the Court is required to maintain an extremely circumspect 

approach. It is always required to be borne, in mind, that arbitration is 

intended to be an avenue for "alternative dispute resolution", and not a 

means to multiply, or foster, further disputes. Where, therefore, the 

arbitrator resolves the dispute, that resolution is entitled to due respect 

18 (2013) 1 SCC 641 

19 AIR 2007 SC 2961 : (2007) 7 SCC 737 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 42 of 82 

and, save and except for the reasons explicitly set out in the body of 

the 1996 Act, is, ordinarily, immune from judicial interference. 

48. Interestingly, while examining, in Snehadeep Structures (P) 

Ltd v. Maharashtra Small Scale Industries Development 

Corporation Ltd 20 , the scope of the expression "appeal" as employed 

in Section 7 of the Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and 

Ancillary Undertakings Act, 1993, the Supreme Court held that , "if 

… the meaning of "appeal" is ambiguous, the interpretation that 

advances the object and purpose of the legislation, shall be accepted." 

Purposive interpretation, as has been noticed in Shailesh Dhairyawan 

v. Mohan Balkrishna Lulla 21 and Richa Mishra v. State of 

Chhattisgarh 22 , has, over time, replaced the principle of "plain 

reading" as the golden rule, for interpreting statutory instruments. 

49. In my opinion, this principle has to guide, strongly, the 

approach of this Court, while dealing with a challenge such as the 

present, which is directed against an order which, at an interlocutory 

stage, merely directing furnishing of security, by one of the parties to 

the dispute. The power, of the learned Sole Arbitrator, to direct 

furnishing of security, is not under question; indeed, in view of sub-

clause (b) of Section 17 (1) (ii) of the 1996 Act, it cannot. The 

arbitrator is, under the said sub-clause, entirely within his jurisdiction 

in securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration. Whether, in 

exercising such jurisdiction, the arbitrator has acted in accordance 

20 (2010) 3 SCC 34 
21 (2016) 3 SCC 619 
22 (2016) 4 SCC 179 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 43 of 82 

with law, or not, can, of course, always be questioned. While 

examining such a challenge, however, the Court has to be mindful of 

its limitations, in interfering with the decision of the arbitrator, 

especially a decision taken at the discretionary level, and at an 

interlocutory stage. 

50. One may also refer, in this context, to Section 5 of the 1996 

Act, which reads as under: 

"5. 
Extent of judicial intervention. -Notwithstanding 
anything contained in any other law for the time being in 
force, in matters covered by this Part, no judicial authority 
shall intervene except where so provided in this Part." 

It is, no doubt, possible to argue that the intent, of Section 5, is to 

restrict judicial intervention, with arbitral proceedings, and orders 

passed therein, to the avenues for such interference, as provided by 

Part I of the 1996 Act, and not to restrict the scope of the Sections and 

the provisions contained in Part I. Perhaps. Section 5 remains, 

however, a clear pointer to the legislative intent, permeating the 1996 

Act, that judicial interference, with arbitral proceedings, is to be kept 

at a minimum. Significantly, in Venture Global Engineering v. 

Satyam Computer Services Ltd 23 , it was opined that the scheme of the 

1996 Act was "such that the general provisions of Part I, including 

Section 5, will apply to all Chapters or Parts of the Act". In State of 

Kerala v. Somdatt Builders Ltd 24 , a Division Bench of the Kerala 

High Court held that the jurisdiction of the Court, under Section 37 of 

23 (2008) 4 SCC 190 
24 2012 (3) Arb LR 151 (Ker) (DB) 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 44 of 82 

the 1996 Act, was also required to be interpreted in the light of the 

legislative policy contained in Section 5. I entirely agree. 

51. The principle of least intervention by courts was held, in 

Enercon (India) Ltd v. Enercon Gmbh 25 , to be well-recognised in 

arbitration jurisprudence, in almost all jurisdictions. In a similar vein, 

earlier in point of time, the Supreme Court held, in P. Anand 

Gajapathi Raju v. P. V. G. Raju 26 , that Section 5 "brings out clearly 

the object of the new Act, namely, that of encouraging resolution of 

disputes expeditiously and less expensively and when there is an 

arbitration agreement, the court's intervention should be minimal." 

Likewise, albeit in the context of Section 34, it was held, in 

McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd 27 , thus: 

"The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of 
courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure 
fairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few 
circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the 
arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. the court cannot 
correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award 
leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is 
desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at keeping the 
supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be 
justified as the parties to the agreement make a conscious 
decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for 
arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered 
by it." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

Though the above exposition of the law is in the context of Section 

34, the principles enunciated therein embody the general philosophy 

underlying the 1996 Act. The italicised words, towards the 

25 (2014) 5 SCC 1 
26 (2000) 4 SCC 539 
27 (2006) 11 SCC 181 


ARB. A. 4/2020

conclusion of the paragraph, especially, would apply, with equal 

force, to challenges to interlocutory orders of arbitral tribunals, under 

Section 37, as they would, to challenges to the final award, under 

Section 34. 

52. Section 37 is, in a sense, a somewhat peculiar provision as, 

against the decision of the arbitrator, it provides for a first appeal, as 

well as a second appeal, to the High Court. Sub-section (1) provides 

for an appeal, to the High Court, from the decision of the Section 34 

Court, before which the final award has, in the first instance, been 

tested. Sub-section (2), on the other hand, provides for a first appeal, 

against interlocutory orders of the arbitral tribunal under Section 16 

or Section 17. There is, necessarily, a qualitative difference between 

these two challenges, though both would lie to the High Court. The 

challenge under Section 37(1), which is directed against a final award 

of the arbitrator/arbitral tribunal, is akin to a second appeal, as was 

observed by this Court in M.T.N.L. v. Fujitshu India Pvt Ltd 28 . The 

challenge under Section 37(2), on the other hand, is directed against 

the decision of the arbitral tribunal and has therefore, in my opinion, 

necessarily to conform to the discipline enforced by Section 5. It 

would, therefore, be improper for a Court to treat an appeal, under 

Section 37 (2) of the 1996 Act, as akin to an appeal under the CPC, or 

as understood in ordinary -or extraordinary -civil law. An appeal 

against an order by an arbitrator, or by an arbitral tribunal, is an 

appeal sui generis, and interference, by the Court, in such appeals, has 

to be necessarily cautious and circumspect. 

28 2015 (2) Arb LR 332 (Delhi) 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 46 of 82 

53. This position would stand especially underscored where the 

order, under challenge, is discretionary in nature. Orders of 

arbitrators, or Arbitral Tribunals, which are amenable to appeal, under 

Section 37(2), have, statutorily, to have been issued either under 

Section 16(2) or (3) or under Section 17. Section 16(2) and 16(3), 

essentially, deal with rulings on the jurisdiction and authority of the 

arbitral tribunal, to arbitrate. Any order, passed under either, or both, 

of these provisions has, therefore, necessarily to partake of a purely 

legal character. Such an order would not, ordinarily, be discretionary 

in nature. 

Section 17(1), and applicability of Order XXXIX, CPC, thereto 

54. 
As against this, orders which are appealable under Section 

37(2)(b) are orders granting, or refusing to grant, interim measures 

under Section 17. Section 17(1), for its part, reads thus: 

"17. Interim measures ordered by arbitral tribunal. -

(1) 
A party may, during the arbitral proceedings, 
apply to the arbitral tribunal -

(i) 
for the appointment of a guardian for 
minor or person of unsound mind for the 
purposes of arbitral proceedings; or 

(ii) 
for an interim measure of protection in 
respect of any of the following matters, namely: 
-

(a) 
the preservation, interim custody 
or sale of any goods which are the 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 47 of 82 

subject-matter 
of 
the 
arbitration 
agreement; 

(b) 
securing the amount in dispute in 
the arbitration; 

(c) 
the detention, preservation or 
inspection of any property or thing which 
is the subject-matter of the dispute in 
arbitration, or as to which any question 
may arise therein and authorizing for any 
of the aforesaid purposes any person to 
enter upon any land or building in the 
possession of any party, authorizing any 
samples to be taken, or any observation 
to be made, or experiment to be tried, 
which may be necessary or expedient for 
the purpose of obtaining full information 
or evidence; 

(d) 
interim 
injunction 
or 
the 
appointment of a receiver; 

(e) 
such other interim measure of 
protection as may appear to the arbitral 
tribunal to be just and convenient, 

and the arbitral tribunal shall have the same 
power for making orders, as the court has for 
the purpose of, and in relation to, any 
proceedings before it." 

55. The concluding caveat, in Section 17 (1), makes it abundantly 

clear that the power of an arbitrator, to grant interim measures, under 

Section 17(1), is analogous and equivalent to the power of a Court, to 

pass such orders. Section 9 of the 1996 Act grants co-equal 

jurisdiction, worded in identical terms, on the Court, to pass interim 

orders, concluding with a parallel caveat, to the effect that "the Court 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 48 of 82 

shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose 

of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it". 

56. The scope and ambit of Section 9, especially in the light of this 

concluding caveat, was examined by the Supreme Court in Arvind 

Constructions Co. (P) Ltd v. Kalinga Mining Corporation 29 and 

Adhunik Steels Ltd v. Orissa Manganese and Minerals (P) Ltd 30 . In 

Arvind Constructions Co. (P) Ltd 29 , it was held thus (in para 15 of the 

report): 

"The argument that the power under Section 9 of the Act is 
independent of the Specific Relief Act or that the restrictions 
placed by the Specific Relief Act cannot control the exercise 
of power under Section 9 of the Act cannot prima facie be 
accepted. 
The 
reliance 
placed 
on Firm 
Ashok 
Traders v. Gurumukh Das Saluja, (2004) 3 SCC 155 in that 
behalf does not also help much, since this Court in that case 
did not answer that question finally but prima facie felt that 
the objection based on Section 69(3) of the Partnership Act 
may not stand in the way of a party to an arbitration 
agreement moving the court under Section 9 of the Act. The 
power under Section 9 is conferred on the District Court. No 
special procedure is prescribed by the Act in that behalf. It is 
also clarified that the court entertaining an application under 
Section 9 of the Act shall have the same power for making 
orders as it has for the purpose and in relation to any 
proceedings before it. Prima facie, it appears that the general 
rules that governed the court while considering the grant of 
an interim injunction at the threshold are attracted even while 
dealing with an application under Section 9 of the Act. There 
is also the principle that when a power is conferred under a 
special statute and it is conferred on an ordinary court of the 
land, without laying down any special condition for exercise 
of that power, the general rules of procedure of that court 
would apply. The Act does not prima facie purport to keep 
out the provisions of the Specific Relief Act from 
consideration. … we may indicate that we are prima facie 

29 (2007) 6 SCC 798 
30 (2007) 7 SCC 125 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 49 of 82 

inclined to the view that exercise of power under Section 9 of 
the Act must be based on well-recognized principles 
governing the grant of interim injunctions and other orders of 
interim protection or the appointment of a Receiver." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

In Adhunik Steels Ltd 30 , P.K. Balasubramanyan, J. (who had also 

authored Arvind Constructions Co. (P) Ltd 29 ), after a somewhat 

longer and more detailed discussion, reiterated the position that "it 

would not be correct to say that the power under Section 9 of the Act 

is totally independent of the well known principles governing the 

grant of interim injunction that generally governed the courts in this 

connection". 

57. The principles governing Order XXXIX of the CPC have, 

therefore, also to guide the Court, while granting interim protection 

under Section 9(1), or the arbitrator, while granting such protection 

under Section 17(1), of the 1996 Act. 

58. Applicability of Order XXXVIII Rule 5, CPC, to Section 
9(1)(ii)(b), and Section 17(1)(ii)(b) of the 1996 Act 

58.1 On the applicability, to Section 9(1)(ii)(b), or Section 

17(1)(ii)(b), of Order XXXVIII Rule 5, CPC, reliance was placed, by 

Mr. Nandrajog, on the judgement of a learned Single Judge of this 

Court in Steel Authority of India Ltd v. AMCI PTY Ltd 31 , to contend 

that Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC has no applicability to 

31 (2011) 3 Arb LR 502 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 50 of 82 

proceedings under the 1996 Act, specifically to the exercise of 

jurisdiction under Section 17. 

58.2 Undoubtedly, Steel Authority of India Ltd 31 says so. That 

position has, however, altered, subsequently, with the judgement, of a 

Division Bench of this Court in Ajay Singh v. Kal Airways Pvt Ltd 32 , 

paras 25 to 28 of which read thus: 

"25. The first question which the court addresses is the one 
adverted to by the appellant, that principles underlying Order 
XXXVIII, Rule 5 CPC have to be kept in mind, while making 
an interim order, in a given case, directing security by one 
party. Indian Telephone Industries v. Siemens Public 
Communication, (2002) 5 SCC 510 is an authority of the 
Supreme Court, which tells the courts that though there is no 
textual basis in the Arbitration Act, linking it with provisions 
of the CPC, nevertheless, the principles underlying exercise 
of power by courts -in the CPC -are to be kept in mind, 
while making orders under Section 9. In Arvind 
Constructions v. Kalinga Mining Corporation (2007) 6 SCC 
798, the court held as follows: 

"The power under Section 9 is conferred on the 
District Court. No special procedure is prescribed by 
the Act in that behalf. It is also clarified that the Court 
entertaining an application under Section 9 of the Act 
shall have the same power for making orders as it has 
for the purpose and in relation to any proceedings 
before it. Prima facie, it appears that the general rules 
that governed the court while considering the grant of 
an interim injunction at the threshold are attracted even 
while dealing with an application under Section 9 of 
the Act. There is also the principle that when a power 
is conferred under a special statute and it is conferred 
on an ordinary court of the land, without laying down 
any special condition for exercise of that power, the 
general rules of procedure of that court would apply. 
The Act does not prima facie purport to keep out the 

32 (2018) 209 Comp Cas 154 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 51 of 82 

provisions of the Specific Relief Act from 
consideration. No doubt, a view that exercise of power 
under Section 9 of the Act is not controlled by the 
Specific Relief Act has been taken by the Madhya 
Pradesh High Court. The power under Section 9 of the 
Act is not controlled by Order XVIII Rule 5 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure is a view taken by the High 
Court of Bombay. But, how far these decisions are 
correct, requires to be considered in an appropriate 
case. Suffice it to say that on the basis of the 
submissions made in this case, we are not inclined to 
answer that question finally. But, we may indicate that 
we are prima facie inclined to the view that exercise of 
power under Section 9 of the Act must be based on 
well recognized principles governing the grant of 
interim injunctions and other orders of interim 
protection or the appointment of a receiver." 

26. 
Interestingly, in a previous decision, Firm Ashok 
Traders v. Gurumukh Das Saluja (2004) 3 SCC 155, the 
Supreme Court observed that: 

"13. ..The Relief sought for in an application under 
Section 9 of the A&C Act is neither in a suit nor a 
right arising from a contract. The right arising from the 
partnership deed or conferred by the Partnership Act is 
being enforced in the Arbitral Tribunal; the court 
under Section 9 is only formulating interim measures 
so as to protect the right under adjudication before the 
Arbitral Tribunal from being frustrated….." 

27. 
Though apparently, there seem to be two divergent 
strands of thought, in judicial thinking, this court is of the 
opinion that the matter is one of the weight to be given to the 
materials on record, a fact dependent exercise, rather than of 
principle. That Section 9 grants wide powers to the courts in 
fashioning an appropriate interim order, is apparent from its 
text. Nevertheless, what the authorities stress is that the 
exercise of such power should be principled, premised on 
some known guidelines -therefore, the analogy of Orders 38 
and 39. Equally, the court should not find itself unduly bound 
by the text of those provisions rather it is to follow the 
underlying principles. In this regard, the observations of Lord 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 52 of 82 

Hoffman in Films Rover International Ltd. v. Cannon Film 
Sales Ltd. (1986) 3 All ER 772 are fitting: 

"But I think it is important in this area to distinguish 
between fundamental principles and what are 
sometimes described as 'guidelines', i.e. useful 
generalizations about the way to deal with the normal 
run of cases falling within a particular category. The 
principal dilemma about the grant of interlocutory 
injunctions, whether prohibitory or mandatory, is that 
there is by definition a risk that the court may make the 
'wrong' decision, in the sense of granting an 
injunction to a party who fails to establish his right at 
the trial (or would fail if there was a trial) or 
alternatively, in failing to grant an injunction to a 
party who succeeds (or would succeed) at trial. A 
fundamental principle is therefore that the court 
should take whichever course appears to carry the 
lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been 
'wrong' in the sense I have described. The guidelines 
for the grant of both kinds of interlocutory injunctions 
are derived from this principle." 

28. 
It was observed later, in the same judgment that: 

"The question of substance is whether the granting of 
the injunction would carry that higher risk of injustice 
which is normally associated with the grant of a 
mandatory injunction. The second point is that in cases 
in which there can be no dispute about the use of the 
term 'mandatory' to describe the injunction, the same 
question of substance will determine whether the case 
is 'normal' and therefore within the guideline or 
'exceptional' and therefore requiring special treatment. 
If it appears to the court that, exceptionally, the case is 
one in which withholding a mandatory interlocutory 
injunction would in fact carry a greater risk of injustice 
than granting it even though the court does not feel a 
'high degree of assurance' about the plaintiff's chances 
of establishing his right, there cannot be any rational 
basis for withholding the injunction." "

58.3 The Special Leave Petition, preferred against Ajay Singh 32 , was 

dismissed, by the Supreme Court on 28 th July, 2017, albeit without 

going into merits, as the order was interlocutory in nature. 

58.4 Steel authority of India Ltd 31 and Ajay Singh 32 were, however, 

both decisions which arose under Section 17 of the 1996 Act, as it 

stood prior to its amendment, with effect from 23 rd October, 2015. 

Lanco Infratech 12 , rendered by a learned Single Judge of this Court, 

however, seriously doubts the applicability of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 

of the CPC, to cases arising under Section 17 of the 1996 Act, after its 

amendment with effect from 23 rd October, 2015. The controversy, in 

that case, arose under the pre-amended Section 17, and paras 12, 14 

and 35 of the report are of stellar significance, in the context of the 

issue of applicability of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC. They 

read thus: 

"12. The above submissions have been considered. The 
submissions revolve around the scope of the powers under 
Section 17 of the Act as it stood prior to the amendment by 
the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 with 
effect from 23 rd October 2015. The unamended Section 17 
reads thus: 

"17. Interim measures ordered by arbitral 
tribunal. -

(1) 
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, 
the arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a 
party, order a party to take any interim measure 
of protection as the arbitral tribunal may 
consider necessary in respect of the subject-
matter of the dispute. 

(2) 
The arbitral tribunal may require a party 
to provide appropriate security in connection 
with a measure ordered under sub-section (1)." 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 54 of 82 

***** 

14. 
It will straightway be seen that while under the 
unamended Section 17 of the Act, there was no specific power 
for the AT to order interim measures to secure the amount in 
dispute, that power has been expressly provided under the 
amended Section 17(1)(ii)(b) of the Act. The other important 
change is in Section 17(2) which states that the interim order 
passed by the AT would be enforceable as if it were an order 
of a Court under the CPC. This makes it explicit that the 
purpose of these changes was to bring the powers of the AT 
under Section 17 of the Act on par with that of the Court 
under Section 9 of the Act. In the amended forms both Section 
9 and Section 17 read alike. This is therefore a significant 
change and not one, as contended by counsel for HCCL, one 
that is clarificatory of an implicit legal position. This 
distinction is necessary to be kept in mind because both 
parties here do not dispute that the application filed by HCCL 
before the AT was governed by Section 17 of the Act as it 
stood prior to its amendment. It is also significant that the 
decisions cited by both parties seek to interpret Section 17 as 
it stood prior to its amendment. 

***** 

35. 
It is also clear from the impugned order that the AT 
failed to come to any conclusion even prima facie that Lanco 
was about to dispose of or remove whole or part of its assets 
from the local limits of the AT which was one of the 
contentions warranting exercise of power under Order 
XXXVIII Rule 5 CPC the underlying principle of which, as 
explained in the decisions examined hereinbefore, apply to 
Section 17 of the Act as it stood prior to the amendment with 
effect from 23 rd October, 2015." 
(Emphasis supplied) 

58.5 The Special Leave Petition, preferred by M/s Hindustan 

Construction Co. Ltd against the aforesaid judgement of the learned 

Single Judge in Lanco Infratech 12 was dismissed, by the Supreme 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 55 of 82 

Court, on 30 th January, 2017, holding that "no ground for interference 

(was) made out". 

58.6 The resultant legal position is that, while the applicability of 

Order XXXVIII Rule 5, CPC, to the amended Section 17(1)(ii)(b) of 

the 1996 Act, may be seriously questionable, even under the pre-

amended Section 17, the provisions of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the 

CPC cannot, bodily, be incorporated into the provision, though the 

principles governing the exercise of jurisdiction under Order 

XXXVIII Rule 5 are required to inform such exercise of jurisdiction. 

Either which way, therefore, while exercising jurisdiction under 

Section 17(1)(ii)(b), the arbitrator is not strictly bound by the confines 

of Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC, but is also proscribed from 

acting in a manner completely opposed thereto. A middling approach 

is, therefore, required, without treating Order XXXVIII Rule 5 as 

entirely inapplicable to Section 17(1)(ii)(b) (as Mr. Nandrajog would 

contend), or as applicable with all its vigour and vitality (as Mr. Nayar 

would contend). 

59. Having said that, it is indisputable that the exercise of 

jurisdiction, by the arbitrator, under Section 17, is fundamentally 

discretionary in nature -as contrasted with Section 16(2) and (3). 

Judicial interference, with the exercise of discretionary power, is, 

classically, limited, and is even more circumscribed, where the 

authority exercising discretion is itself a judicial authority -as 

opposed to a purely administrative or executive functionary. (One 

uses the expression "judicial authority", here, to denote the nature -


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 56 of 82 

rather than the status -of the jurisdiction exercised by the Arbitrator, 

it having been settled, by the Supreme Court, in M.D., Army Welfare 

Housing Organisation v. Sumangal Services (P) Ltd 33 , that an 

arbitrator is not a "Court", and does not exercises judicial functions.) 

Discretionary orders passed by arbitral tribunals have, therefore, to be 

handled with kid gloves, and protected from injury by any over-

zealous administration, by the court, of the law as it perceives it to be. 

If anything, therefore, the jurisdiction of the Court, under Section 

37(2)(b), is even more limited than the jurisdiction that it exercises 

under Section 37(2)(a) or, for that matter, under Section 34. The 

discretionary jurisdiction, as exercised by the arbitrator, merits 

interference, under Section 37(2)(b), therefore, only where such 

exercise is palpably arbitrary or unconscionable. 

60. This position is additionally underscored, where the order of the 

arbitrator is relatable to Section 17(1)(ii)(b) or (e), and directs 

furnishing of security. Direction, to litigating parties, to furnish 

security, is a purely discretionary exercise, intended to balance the 

equities. The scope of interference, in appeal, with a discretionary 

order passed by a judicial forum, stands authoritatively delineated in 

the following passages, from Wander Ltd v. Antox India P Ltd 34 : 

"13. On a consideration of the matter, we are afraid, the 
appellate bench fell into error on two important propositions. 
The first is a misdirection in regard to the very scope and 
nature of the appeals before it and the limitations on the 
powers of the appellate court to substitute its own discretion 
in an appeal preferred against a discretionary order. The 
second pertains to the infirmities in the ratiocination as to the 

33 (2004) 9 SCC 619 
34 1990 Supp SCC 727 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 57 of 82 

quality of Antox's alleged user of the trademark on which the 
passing-off action is founded. We shall deal with these two 
separately. 

14. 
The appeals before the Division Bench were against 
the exercise of discretion by the Single Judge. In such 
appeals, the appellate court will not interfere with the exercise 
of discretion of the court of first instance and substitute its 
own discretion except where the discretion has been shown to 
have been exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely 
or where the court had ignored the settled principles of law 
regulating grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. An 
appeal against exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on 
principle. Appellate court will not reassess the material and 
seek to reach a conclusion different from the one reached by 
the court below if the one reached by that court was 
reasonably possible on the material. The appellate court 
would normally not be justified in interfering with the 
exercise of discretion under appeal solely on the ground that 
if it had considered the matter at the trial stage it would have 
come to a contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been 
exercised by the trial court reasonably and in a judicial 
manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a 
different view may not justify interference with the trial 
court's exercise of discretion. After referring to these 
principles Gajendragadkar, J. in Printers (Mysore) Private 
Ltd. v. Pothan Joseph, (1960) 3 SCR 713 : AIR 1960 SC 
1156: 

"... These principles are well established, but as has 
been observed by Viscount Simon in Charles Osenton 
& Co. v. Jhanaton, 1942 AC 130 '...the law as to the 
reversal by a court of appeal of an order made by a 
judge below in the exercise of his discretion is well 
established, and any difficulty that arises is due only to 
the application of well settled principles in an 
individual case'." 

The appellate judgment does not seem to defer to this 
principle." 

That this principle applies to exercise of appellate jurisdiction, over 

discretionary interlocutory orders, passed by arbitrators, under Section 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 58 of 82 

17 of the 1996 Act, has been reiterated, by this Court, in several

Additionally, parties were granted liberty to file fresh applications, 

under Section 17, before the learned Sole Arbitrator. Acting on the 

liberty thus granted, AGG filed three fresh applications, under Section

17, before the learned Sole Arbitrator. In all, therefore, there were 

four applications, under Section 17, of AGG, before the learned Sole 

Arbitrator, i.e. FAO (OS) 18/2019 and the three fresh applications. 

62.3 The prayer clauses, in FAO (OS) 18/2019, and in the three fresh 

applications filed by AGG before the learned Sole Arbitrator, may be 

reproduced, to the extent relevant, thus: 

FAO (OS) 18/2019 

"It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble 
Court may kindly be pleased to allow the present Appeal: -

a. 
Set aside the Impugned order dated November 
16, 2018 passed in IA No 3238 of 2018 th in CS (OS) 
No. 100 of 2018 to the extent that the Appellants were 
restrained 
from 
giving 
effect

The First Section 17 application 

"It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that Ld. Arbitrator 
may kindly be pleased to allow the present Application and: -

i. 
Direct Claimant Nos. 1, 2 and 12 to maintain

working of the Claimant No. 12. 

iv.

(Claimant No. 1 and Claimant No. 2 were Dinesh Gupta and 
Shreyansh Gupta, and Claimant No. 12 was Renu Promoters.) 

The Second Section 17 application 

"It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that Ld. Arbitrator 
may kindly be pleased to allow the present Application and: -

a. 
Restrain the Claimant No. 2 from alienating 
equity shares held in C.R. Farms Pvt. Ltd. having its

2 to the Counter-Claimant Nos. 2 and 5; 

b. 
Restrain Claimant No. 2 from creating any

Crores and Fifty-five Lakhs only) is paid by the 
Claimant No. 2 to the Counter-Claimant Nos. 2 and 5." 

(Claimant No. 2 and 5 were Shreyansh Gupta and Dinesh 
Gupta, and Counter-Claimants Nos. 2 and 5 were Anand 
Gupta and M/s. Anand Gupta HUF, respectively.) 

The Third Section 17 application 

"It is therefore, most respectfully prayed that the Ld. 
Arbitrator may be pleased to: -

a. 
Restrain the Claimants from alienating the 
26,86,190 (Twenty-Six Lakh Eighty-Six Thousand 
One Hundred And Ninety) equity shares of BDR, 
which 
were 
held 
by 
the 
Counter-
Claimants/Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 and were illegally 
and fraudulently transferred by the Claimant Nos. 1 
and 2, in their favor, until the consideration of Rs. 
53,72,38,000/-(Rupees Fifty-Three Crores Seventy 
Two Lakhs Thirty Eight Thousand only) is paid by the 
Claimant Nos. 1 and 2 to the Counter-
Claimants/Respondent Nos. 1 to 4, for such transfer of 
shares, as explained above; 

b. 
Restrain the Claimants from creating any 
charge, encumbrance or any other third-party rights 
over the above mentioned 26,86,190 (Twenty-Six 
Lakh Eighty-Six Thousand One Hundred And Ninety) 
equity shares of BDR, until the consideration of Rs. 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 62 of 82 

53,72,38,000/-(Rupees Fifty-Three Crores Seventy 
Two Lakhs Thirty Eight Thousand only), for transfer 
of the said shares has been paid by the Claimant Nos. 1 
and 2 to the Counter-Claimants/Respondents Nos. 1 to 
4." 

62.4 On these three applications, the learned Sole Arbitrator has 

ruled, thus (in para 3.27 and 3.28 of the impugned Order): 

"3.27 Having regard to the aforesaid, and when the 
companies have gone to DGG, it may not be appropriate to 
restrain Claimants 1, 2 and 12 from dealing with the 
properties of BDR and Nishit. The two companies are in the 
business of real estate and directing the companies to 
maintain status quo in respect of immovable assets would 
amount to stifling their business. Therefore, these immovable 
properties which are stock-in-trade of the two companies, 
cannot be subject to such restrictions. At the same time, 
Claimants 1, 2 and 12 are directed to maintain status quo in 
respect of those immovable assets which are the capital assets 
of the two companies and do not form part of stock-in-trade. 
Relief only to this extent can be given in this application. 

3.28 In the other two applications filed by members of 
AGG, they are seeking restitution of the amounts which they 
have remitted. For the reasons given above, such a relief 
cannot be granted at this stage as it needs determination as to 
whether the payments were made by AGG of DGG 
voluntarily pursuant to the Family Settlements or they are 
fraudulently secured by DGG as contended by AGG in these 
applications. At the same time, in order to secure the interest 
of the AGG, in the event AGG ultimately succeeds, it would 
be appropriate to direct DGG to furnish suitable equivalent to 
the sums involved, to the Tribunal." 

62.5 The notices, dated 12 th February, 2018, 16 th February, 2018, 

22 nd February, 2018 and 23 rd February, 2018, issued by AGG/its 

members, alleged (i) misconduct, on the part of Dinesh Gupta and 

Shreyansh Gupta, in the affairs of BDR, (ii) mismanagement in the 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 63 of 82 

affairs of Renu Promoters, (iii) fraudulent transfer of shares, held by 

AGG in BDR, to the DEMAT Account of DGG, and (iv) fraudulent 

misappropriation, by DGG, of the amounts earned by liquidation of 

Mutual Funds, held by AGG. Premised on these allegations, AGG 

sought, vide the said notices/communications, (i) repayment, by DGG, 

of the loans advanced by AGG and lying in the accounts of BDR, 

totaling ₹ 81,31,725/-, (ii) convening of an EGM of Renu Promoters, 

to remove Dinesh Gupta and Shivani Gupta from the Directorship of 

the said Company, (iii) repayment, to AGG, of ₹ 19,55,00,000/-, 

earned by liquidation of the Mutual Funds held by AGG and, 

allegedly, fraudulently misappropriated by Dinesh Gupta and 

Shreyans Gupta and (iv) payment, by DGG, of ₹ 53,72,38,000/-, as 

the price for 26,86,190 equity shares of BDR, held by AGG/its 

members and, allegedly, fraudulently transferred by DGG to its 

DEMAT Account. The response of DGG, to these claims, was that 

the shares, held in BDR by AGG, as well as the monies earned by 

liquidation of the Mutual Funds held by AGG, had, voluntarily and 

without consideration, being transferred, and gifted, by AGG to DGG, 

as sequelae to the Family Settlements dated 2 nd December, 2017 and 

9 th December, 2017. Mr. Nandrajog, representing AGG, emphatically 

contended that it was preposterous to imagine that AGG would, willy-

nilly and without any consideration whatsoever, relinquish such huge 

amounts on investments, in favor of DGG. He also pointed out that 

AGG was, in fact, not even a party to the Family Settlements. 

62.6 The learned Single Judge had, vide his order dated 16 th 

November, 2018, stayed the operation of the aforesaid notices, dated 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 64 of 82 

12 th February, 2018, 16 th February, 2018, 22 nd February, 2018 and 23 rd 

February, 2018, issued by AGG. AGG had, in FAO (OS) 18/2019, 

challenged the said order of stay. FAO (OS) 18/2019 was converted 

into an application under Section 17 of the 1996 Act, to be decided by 

the learned Sole Arbitrator. The learned Sole Arbitrator was, 

therefore, seized the of the issue of whether to continue the interim 

order, dated 16 th November, 2018, of the learned Single Judge, 

thereby continuing the injunction against operation of the notices 

dated 12 th February, 2018, 16 February, 2018, 22 nd February, 2018 

and 23 rd February, 2018, or vacate the injunctions, as sought by AGG. 

The learned Sole Arbitrator chose to continue the said orders, thereby 

rendering the notices, as well as the actions proposed therein, by 

AGG, inoperative during the currency of the arbitral proceedings. 

62.7 AGG, in its first Section 17 application, alleged 

mismanagement, by Dinesh Gupta and Shreyansh Gupta, of the affairs 

of Renu Promoters and, therefore, sought that they be directed to 

maintain status quo, in relation to the immovable assets of Renu 

promoters and its shareholdings, and be restrained from taking any 

decision, in their capacity as Directors in Renu Promoters. The 

second Section 17 application alleged illegal acquisition of the share 

capital of C.R. Farms, by DGG, using the ₹ 19.55 crores received by 

liquidation of the Mutual Funds held by AGG. The third Section 17 

application, similarly, alleged illegal misappropriation, by DGG, of 

26,86,190 equity shares of BDR, and consequent liability, by DGG, 

towards AGG, of ₹ 53,72,38,000/-. AGG, therefore, sought a 

restraint, against DGG, from alienating the equity shares in BDR, held 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 65 of 82 

by AGG and allegedly misappropriated by DGG, as well as payment 

of the amount of ₹ 53,72,38,000/-, accompanied by an order of 

restraint, against DGG, from alienating the aforesaid 26,86,190 equity 

shares of BDR. 

62.8 The learned Sole Arbitrator did not grant any of the reliefs, as 

sought by AGG, opining that, as DGG was engaged in the real estate 

business, grant of the said reliefs would result in severe financial 

hardship to it. No restraint, on DGG dealing with the affairs of any of 

these Companies, was, therefore, imposed by the learned Sole 

Arbitrator. Neither was any direction issued, to pay, or repay, any 

amount to AGG, as sought by it. All that the learned Sole Arbitrator 

did, in the circumstances, was, having rejected the prayers of AGG, 

and continued the interlocutory injunction, on the notices issued by 

AGG, as granted by the learned Single Judge in his order dated 16 th 

November, 2018, to secure the claim of AGG, directed DGG to 

furnish Bank Guarantee for the said amount. 

62.9 There is substance in the submission, of Mr. Nandrajog, that the 

concluding sentence, in para 3.28 of the impugned Order dated 18 th 

February, 2020, cannot be torn out of its context, and subjected to 

independent microscopic analysis. As is correctly pointed out, the 

learned Sole Arbitrator did not decide, by the said Order, a single 

application, or even a group of applications filed by AGG under 

Section 17, alone, but disposed of all the applications, under Section 

17, pending before him, whether filed by AGG, DGG or RGG. The 

rationale and raison d'etre, for the decision of the learned Sole 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 66 of 82 

Arbitrator has, therefore, to be discerned by a holistic appreciation of 

the impugned Order, and not by an isolated, or insulated, reading of 

the last sentence in para 3.28, with which DGG claims to be 

aggrieved. It is clear that the learned Sole Arbitrator has not directed 

furnishing of security, equivalent to the disputed amount, as his mere 

ipse dixit, but has arrived at the said decision by a careful process of 

ratiocination, keeping the competing interests of the claims of the 

claimants and the respondents, as well as their legitimate business 

concerns and considerations, in mind. 

62.10 The discussion, hereinabove, has already made it apparent that 

the principles behind Orders XXXVIII and XXXIX of the CPC are 

required to guide the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 9, or 

Section 17 of the 1996 Act, though the provisions themselves are not 

to be regarded as having been bodily incorporated into Sections 9 or 

17. Ultimately, the prevailing consideration, applying the law laid 

down in Ajay Singh 32 is the doing of complete and substantial justice 

between the parties. Where it appears, on the face of it, that the 

impugned direction is loaded in favor of one party and that, therefore, 

the direction cannot be sustained as balancing the equities between the 

litigants before the Arbitral Tribunal, interference on the other hand, 

the Court may legitimately interfere therewith. Where, however, the 

Arbitral Tribunal has balanced the equities, given the fact that the 

jurisdiction, conferred on the Tribunal by Section 17 is fundamentally 

discretionary in nature, the Court has, necessarily, to be slow to 

interfere, lest the autonomy of the arbitral process be imperiled. In 

my view, the restraint, to be exercised by Courts in interfering with 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 67 of 82 

the decision of the arbitrator, has to extend to not seeking to 

substitute, for the exercise of discretion by the arbitrator, what may 

seem, to the Court, to be a "more appropriate" manner of such 

exercise. In other words, even if the Court were to feel that the 

equities could have been better balanced, by some arrangement other 

than that which has appealed to the discretion of the Arbitral Tribunal, 

that would not constitute a legitimate basis, for interfering with the 

exercise of such 

62.11 The impugned Order of the learned Sole Arbitrator does not 

grant any interlocutory mandatory injunction. Nor has the learned 

Sole Arbitrator secured, stricto sensu, the amount, or property, in 

dispute in the arbitral proceedings, by directing deposit, thereof, by 

the appellant/DGG. He has merely directed furnishing of a Bank 

Guarantee, after an examination of the competing stands of the parties 

before him, to ensure that the balancing claims are secured. Directing 

securing of the amount involved in the arbitration, is a power 

statutorily invested in the learned Sole Arbitrator, by Section 

17(1)(ii)(b). No excess of jurisdiction can, therefore, be imputed to 

the learned Sole Arbitrator, in directing furnishing of security by 

DGG. No want of proper application of mind can be imputed to the 

learned Sole Arbitrator, in so directing. The submission, of Mr. 

Nayar, that, in so directing, the learned Sole Arbitrator has granted 

relief in excess of that sought by AGG is also, in the facts, clearly 

misguided, as the impugned direction has been issued after balancing 

the rival claims of both parties. 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 68 of 82 

62.12 The judgements, on which Mr. Nayar sought to place reliance, 

to support his submission that the learned Sole Arbitrator had erred in 

awarding relief in excess of that sought by AGG, do not really 

advance his case. Tata Advanced Systems Ltd 7 did not notice the 

judgement of the Division Bench of this Court in Ajay Singh 32 ; 

besides, there was no application, under Section 17, before the 

arbitrator in that case, and there is a specific finding, by the learned 

Single Judge, to the effect that the direction, for furnishing of Bank 

Guarantee, was not preceded by any reasoning. Captain Guman 

Singh 8 , too, does not help Mr. Nayar, as it merely reiterates the 

principle that a Court cannot grant relief, not sought by the parties 

before it. In the present case, as I have observed, the learned Sole 

Arbitrator was well within his jurisdiction in directing DGG to furnish 

security, of the amount in dispute. Besides, the direction to furnish 

security was an attempt to balance the equities, rejecting the greater 

relief, sought by AGG. The facts in the present case, therefore, are 

peculiar to that extent, and cannot be analogised to those in Captain 

Guman Singh 8 . NHPC Ltd 9 involved a situation in which the Arbitral 

Tribunal was found to have granted an interim measure of protection, 

travelling beyond the confines of the subject matter of the dispute 

before it. In the present case, it has not even been contended, by 

DGG, that the amount, in respect of which Bank Guarantee has been 

directed to be furnished by the learned Sole Arbitrator, was not the 

subject matter of the dispute before him. 

63. Re. Submission that, having found that a prima facie case 
existed in favour of DGG, the learned Sole Arbitrator could not have 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 69 of 82 

granted interim relief to AGG, by directing furnishing of security by 
DGG: 

63.1 Mr. Nayar relies on the observation, in para 3.26 of the 

impugned Order, that DGG has made out a prima facie case. The 

reliance is, in my opinion, out of place. Following on the said 

observation, the learned Sole Arbitrator proceeded to reject the prayer, 

of AGG, for a direction, to DGG not to deal with the properties of 

BDR and Nishit, limiting the relief, in that regard, to maintenance of 

status quo in relation to immovable assets constituting the capital 

assets of the said two companies. The learned Sole Arbitrator, 

thereby, acted on the basis of his finding that DGG had made out a 

prima facie case. The direction, to DGG, to furnish security, for the 

amount in dispute in the arbitral proceedings, does not militate, in any 

manner, against the said finding. At the cost of repetition, it must be 

emphasised that the circumstances, and rationale, behind the said 

direction, are required to be appreciated. Para-3.28 of the impugned 

Order, though brief, is sufficiently evocative in that regard. The 

learned Sole Arbitrator has, initially, noted that, in the Section 17 

applications filed by it, AGG had sought restitution of the amounts 

remitted by it -which, according to AGG, were unlawfully and 

illegally appropriated, by DGG, into its accounts. The learned Sole 

Arbitrator, thereafter, goes on to observe that, "for the reasons given 

above", such a relief could not be granted at that stage. The 

"reasons", to which the learned Sole Arbitrator refers, clearly 

encompass the entire recital prior to the said decision, in the course of 

which the learned Sole Arbitrator has examined, in detail, the facts of 

the case, and has comprehensively analysed the competing equities, 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 70 of 82 

and the claims of the parties before him. The dispute was still at large 

before the learned Sole Arbitrator, and it would have been entirely 

inappropriate, for the learned Sole Arbitrator, at that stage, to opine, 

one way or the other, thereon, with any modicum of finality. The 

learned Sole Arbitrator, therefore, correctly observes that it needed 

determination "as to whether the payments were made by AGG (to) 

DGG voluntarily pursuant to the Family Settlements or they are 

fraudulently secured by DGG as contended by AGG in these 

applications". Even so, while rejecting the relief sought by AGG, the 

learned Sole Arbitrator has, acting within the confines of the 

jurisdiction vested in him by Section 17(1)(ii)(b), deemed it 

appropriate to secure the amount in dispute. 

63.2 Even on facts, the learned Sole Arbitrator was justified in so 

directing. The impugned Order does contain factual justification for 

the direction. The allegation, of AGG, was that their shares, are held 

by it in BDR, and the monies realised by liquidation of the Mutual 

Funds, which undisputedly belongs to AGG, had fraudulently been 

appropriated, by DGG, into its accounts. DGG does not contend, 

either before the learned Sole Arbitrator, or before this Court, that 

there existed any written document, evidencing intention, on the part 

of AGG, to relinquish, gratis, the entire amount of ₹ 19.55 crores, 

earned by liquidation of the Mutual Funds, or the 26,86,190 shares of 

BDR, which, in the price of ₹ 53,72,38,000/-. In the absence of any 

such written document, or registered Gift Deed, the submission of 

AGG, that these amounts had illegally been appropriated, by DGG, 

i.e. by Dinesh Gupta and Shreyansh Gupta, to enrich itself, 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 71 of 82 

undoubtedly deserves consideration. It certainly cannot be regarded 

as moonshine. If, therefore, the learned Sole Arbitrator deemed it 

appropriate to secure the amount in question, that direction adequately 

balanced the rival claims. No injunction, as sought by AGG against 

DGG, was granted. Neither was any direction issued, to DGG, not to 

deal with the finances of Renu Promoters, C.R. Farms or BDR. No 

direction, to secure the amounts credited to the accounts of DGG, 

without any consideration having been paid to AGG therefor, was 

issued. In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that DGG really has 

no cause to complain against the direction to furnish security, which, 

as the learned Sole Arbitrator himself observes, was "in order to 

secure the interest of AGG, in the event AGG ultimately succeeds". 

This is precisely what Section 17(1)(ii)(b) contemplates. 

63.3 The amounts/shares in question having shifted base, from the 

accounts of AGG to those of DGG, without a farthing by way of 

consideration, and with no written document, evidencing intent, on the 

part of AGG, to such transfer gratis, no exception can be taken to the 

decision, of the learned Sole Arbitrator, to secure the amounts, to 

protect the interests of AGG and, thereby, balance the equities. 

64. Re. Order XXXVIII Rule 5, CPC 

64.1 This judgement has, adequately, dealt with Order XXXVIII 

Rule 5, CPC, in the backdrop of the impugned direction, hereinabove. 

Mr. Nayar has, however, placed reliance on several decisions, and, in 

fairness to him, it would be appropriate to examine the import thereof. 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 72 of 82 

64.2 State Bank of India v. Ericsson India Pvt Ltd 10 is a short order, 

of the Supreme Court, which dealt with the challenge to the direction, 

of the Arbitral Tribunal, restraining the claimant's from alienating, 

encumbering or transferring its assets without permission of the 

Arbitral Tribunal. As such, the order in question was injunctive in 

nature, unlike the present case, where injunction has specifically been 

refused. This, even by itself, the said decision entirely 

inapplicable to the facts of this case. It is further observed, in the said 

order, that the Arbitral Tribunal merely cited balance of convenience 

and irreparable injury, as a ground for the injunction. Further, the 

Supreme Court observes that "the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction 

to affect the rights and remedies of the third party secured creditors in 

the course of determining disputes pending before it", as the claim of 

the appellants, before the Supreme Court, was that they were not even 

parties before the arbitrator. The order does not disclose that any 

direction, furnishing security, had been passed by the Arbitral 

Tribunal in that case. As such, the reliance, by Mr. Nayar, on the 

observation, in the concluding para 5 of the order, that the decision of 

the Arbitral Tribunal "does not comply with the mandate of Rules 5 

and 10 of Order XXXVIII CPC", torn out of context, is completely 

misplaced. 

64.3 In C. V. Rao 11 , the Division Bench of this Court was, again, 

dealing with an injunctive direction, by the learned Single Judge, 

under Section 9, restraining the appellant from dealing with its assets. 

The learned Single Judge restrained the appellants from "availing any 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 73 of 82 

additional debt without the specific consent of the respondent No. 1 

and also (restrained) them from selling/transferring/alienating their 

interest in any of the properties" (from para 47 of the report). At the 

cost of repetition, no such injunction has been in the present 

case; rather, the learned Sole Arbitrator has specifically rejected the 

prayer for such injunction, as advanced by AGG. 

64.4 The Division Bench noted that the learned Single Judge had, in 

granting an injunction, proceeded on "the prima facie satisfaction that 

the respondent No. 1 is entitled to realise the put consideration". In 

this context, it was held, in para 55 of the report, that "even if a prima 

facie case is made out by the respondent No. 1 as to the claim for put 

amount, the same will not entitle them to seek an interim measure of 

protection by restraining the appellants from dealing with their assets 

unless it is also established that the appellants are intending to defeat 

the right of the respondent No. 1 to enforce the arbitral award". In 

these circumstances, the Division Bench opined that the learned 

Single Judge erred in issuing orders of prohibitory injunction. The 

order of the learned Single Judge, which was under challenge before 

the Division Bench in C. V. Rao 11 , and the impugned direction, as 

issued by the learned Sole Arbitrator are, therefore, as alike as chalk 

and cheese. 

64.5 Before parting with the point, I deem it appropriate to observe 

that reliance, in a case such as the present, with precedents dealing 

with orders of interlocutory prohibitory injunctions, would be entirely 

misguided. Interim prohibitory injunctions, as a category of relief, are 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 74 of 82 

a specie sui generis. They follow a strict regimen, chalked out, by the 

Supreme Court, in a series of authorities, including Deoraj v. State of 

Maharashtra 40 , Dorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi Sorab Warden 41 

and Hammad Ahmed v. Abdul Majeed 42 . As the present dispute does 

not involve any order of prohibitory injunction, I do not deem it 

necessary to burden this judgement with the law on the point; suffice 

it to state that judgements, involving challenges to orders of interim 

prohibitory injunction, whether under Section 17, or under Section 9, 

of the 1996 Act, may not be of much relevance, while examining a 

challenge to an order directing furnishing of security by way of Bank 

Guarantee. 

65. 
Lanco Infratech 12 is completely inapplicable, as it did with the 

pre-amended Section 17. In fact, the learned Single Judge of this 

Court, while deciding the petition, has clarified, or more than one 

point, that he was adjudicating the matter in the context of the pre-

amended Section 17, and that "the underlying principle" behind Order 

XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC "apply to Section 17 of the Act as it 

stood prior to the amendment with effect from 23 rd October, 2015". It 

has also been observed, in the said decision, that "while under the 

unamended Section 17 of the Act, there was no specific power for the 

AT to order interim measures to secure the amount in dispute, that 

power has been expressly provided under the amended Section 

17(1)(ii)(b) of the Act". The amendment of Section 17, w.e.f. 23 rd 

October, 2015, it was observed, was intended "to bring the powers of 

the AT under Section 17 of the Act on par with that of the Court under 

40 (2004) 4 SCC 697 
41 (1990) 2 SCC 117 
42 (2019) 14 SCC 1 


ARB. A. 4/2020

Section 9 of the Act". This change, held the learned Single Judge, 

was "significant", and not merely "clarificatory of an implicit legal 

position". This judgement, therefore, rather than supporting the 

petitioner, would throw up the issue of whether, in respect of arbitral 

proceedings which were governed by the amended Section 17, Order 

XXXVIII Rule 5 of the CPC would apply at all. 

66. Goodwill Non-Woven (P) Ltd 13 arose, not under Section 17, but 

under Section 9 of the 1996 Act. Pre-arbitral interim directions were 

sought, and para-56 of the judgement reveals that the primary ground, 

urged by the petitioner (in that case) was that, in view of the COVID-

2019 pandemic, it was unable to meet the timelines for invoking 

arbitration, and apprehended that, in the interregnum, the respondent 

would attempt to obstruct satisfaction of a decree which might be 

awarded in the petitioner's favour. No doubt, there is an observation, 

in para-55 of the judgement, that, "for grant of the relief as prayed for 

by the petitioner, the petitioner has to show that; (a) it has a prima 

facie case and balance of convenience in its favour and shall succeed 

in the arbitration proceedings and (b) that the respondent is acting in a 

manner as to defeat the realisation of the future award that may 

ultimately be passed". Besides the fact that the said decision does not 

consider Lanco Infratech 12 , or the difference, if any, which the 

amendment to Section 17, would make to the applicability of Order 

XXXVIII Rule 5, CPC, thereto (no such case having, apparently, been 

urged before the learned Single Judge, before whom Lanco 

Infratech 12 was not cited by either party), the facts, before the learned 

Single Judge in that case are so markedly different from those in the 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 76 of 82 

present, as to render the decision in Goodwill Non-Woven (P) Ltd 13 

an extremely unsafe precedent, while examining the present 

controversy. 

67. Enunciations of the law, in judicial precedents, are not to be 

equated with the Ten Commandments handed down to Moses, or 

even, on a more terrestrial note, the theorems of Euclid, but have to be 

understood in the backdrop of the fact-situation which presented itself 

before the Court, and the precise controversy, with which the Court 

was seized. 43 In the present case, no parallel, whatsoever, can be 

drawn with the facts which presented themselves before this Court in 

Goodwill Non-Woven (P) Ltd 13 . Here, the precise case of AGG was 

that DGG had, in a fraudulent manner, misappropriated, to its own 

unjust advantage, ₹ 19.55 crores, resulting from liquidation of the 

Mutual Funds of AGG, as well as 26,86,190 with the shares of BDR, 

valued at ₹ 53,72,38,000/-. As such, the allegation of AGG was that 

DGG had not only failed to abide by the oral agreement between 

AGG and DVD, on the basis whereof blank Delivery Instruction 

Slips, qua the 26,86,190 shares of BDR, and blank cheques, qua the 

amount of ₹ 19.55 crores, realised by liquidation of the Mutual Funds, 

had been provided by AGG to DGG, but that it had used the said 

blank Delivery Instruction Slips and blank cheques to misappropriate, 

to its own advantage, the shares of BDR, as well as the amount of ₹ 

19.55 crores. It was further alleged that, using the said monies, DGG 

had invested in other corporate concerns as well. These allegations 

have been noticed by the learned Sole Arbitrator, and taken into 

43 U.O.I v. Major Bahadur Singh (2006) 1 SCC 368 ; BGS SGS Soma JV v. NHPC Ltd. (2020) 4 SCC 
234 


ARB. A. 4/2020

account, before issuing the impugned direction. Once that is so, it no 

longer lies within the province of the jurisdiction of this Court, acting 

under Section 37 of the 1996 Act, to examine, further, whether these 

circumstances were sufficient to warrant the direction to furnish 

security. Sufficiency of the grounds on which the learned Sole 

Arbitrator acted, especially where such action was in exercise of 

discretion statutorily conferred on him, cannot be tested by this Court, 

as any such exercise would amount to an attempt to substitute, for the 

discretion exercised by the learned Sole Arbitrator, its own discretion. 

This is an exercise which has been proscribed, time and time again, by 

several judicial authorities, too numerous to mention. 

68. No such occasion arose, before this Court, in Goodwill Non-

Woven (P) Ltd 13 , and the reliance, by Mr. Nayar, on the said decision, 

therefore, fails to impress. 

69. BMW India Private Limited 14 , similarly, was a case which 

arose under Section 9 of the 1996 Act. This decision is, in para-29 of 

the report (in SCC OnLine), observed that, while the Court should not 

ignore the principles all the well-known guidelines, governing Order 

38 Rule 5 of the CPC, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 

9(1)(ii)(b), it should not be unduly bound by the text thereof. 

Observing, further, that an order for securing the amount, prior to an 

arbitral award, was comparable to the nature of relief provided under 

Order 38 Rule 5, the learned Single Judge of this Court has, in the said 

decision, observed that, before directing furnishing of security, the 

Court is required to be satisfied regarding the existence of a prima 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 78 of 82 

facie case in favour of the applicant, and the possibility of the 

opposite party defeating the realisation of the future award that may 

ultimately be passed, were such security not directed. Direction for 

furnishing of security cannot, in the opinion of this Court in the said 

case, be passed mechanically, and has to be informed by the 

"underlying basis of Order 38 Rule 5, CPC". Having thus observed, 

the learned Single Judge has proceeded to note that the sole argument, 

on the basis of which the prayer for security, in the said case, was 

premised, was that the respondent was in financial distress. The 

learned Single Judge observed that the question of whether, in fact, 

such "financial distress" existed, or not, was a disputed question of 

fact, which could not be adjudicated under Section 9. This sole 

ground, therefore, held the learned Single Judge, was insufficient to 

sustain a prayer for directing furnishing of security, by the opposite 

party. In the present case, the learned Sole Arbitrator was exercising 

jurisdiction, not under Section 9, but under Section 17. That apart, as 

the discussion hereinabove amply reveals, the learned Sole Arbitrator 

as set out, in detail, the facts of the case, which disclosed that the 

amount of ₹ 19.55 crores, realised by liquidation of the Mutual Funds 

of the AGG, as well as the 26,86,190 shares of BDR, held by AGG, 

had been appropriated, by DGG, to its bank account, and to its 

DEMAT Account, respectively, without any consideration having 

been paid to AGG therefor. Further, AGG had alleged that part of the 

said amount had also been invested in certain other corporate 

enterprises. This, therefore, is clearly not the case in which the 

prayer, for furnishing of security, was made, solely on the ground of 

financial distress of the opposite party. The learned Sole Arbitrator 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 79 of 82 

has, keeping all these facts in mind, felt that it was necessary to secure 

the claim of AGG, by directing furnishing of security, and, within the 

confines of the appellate jurisdiction of this Court under Section 37, I 

am of the opinion that no occasion arises, to interfere. The decision in 

BMW India Private Limited 14 , too, cannot, therefore, assist the 

appellant. 

70. Mr. Nayar also advanced submissions on the power, of the 

learned Sole Arbitrator, to mould reliefs. I do not deem it necessary 

to traverse that terrain, as Section 17(1)(ii)(b) clearly empowered the 

learned Sole Arbitrator to secure the amount in dispute in the 

arbitration. There is, therefore, no gainsaying the fact that, in 

directing as he did, the learned Sole Arbitrator committed no 

jurisdictional error. The learned Sole Arbitrator referred to the 

"reasons given above", as constituting, inter alia, the basis for this 

decision. Having, for the said reasons, rejected the relief sought by 

AGG, which was undoubtedly much more drastic, the learned Sole 

Arbitrator restricted his order to a direction, to DGG, to secure the 

amount in dispute, by furnishing suitable security. A holistic reading 

of the order reveals that the balance of convenience was kept in mind, 

while passing the impugned direction. No patent illegality can, in my 

view, be discerned, in the impugned decision. 

Conclusion 

71. This Court, while exercising appellate jurisdiction, under 

Section 37 (2) of the 1996 Act, over the interim order of the learned 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 80 of 82 

Sole Arbitrator, is not expected, or even required, to delve deep into 

the facts of the case. Nor is it expected to substitute its own 

discretion, for the discretion of the learned Sole Arbitrator. If the 

exercise of discretion, by the learned Sole Arbitrator, suffers from 

patent illegality, or is otherwise unconscionable in law or on facts, 

interference may be justified; never otherwise. 

72. Judicial intervention, with arbitral proceedings, has necessarily 

to be reduced to a bare minimum, under the 1996 Act. Applying this 

salutary principle, I am of the opinion that, were this Court to set 

aside, or even modify, the direction, of the learned Sole Arbitrator, to 

DGG, to furnish security for the amount in dispute in the arbitration -

which, clearly, is within the province of the jurisdiction of the learned 

Sole Arbitrator, conferred by Section 17(1)(ii)(b) -it would do 

violence to the entire ethos of the 1996 Act, and would militate 

against the avowed objective of the legislation itself. 

73. In my view, any interlocutory order, by the arbitrator, under 

Section 17, to furnish security, if preceded by adequate examination 

and appreciation of the facts, and the rival stands of the parties, should 

remain impervious to judicial interference. The Court is required to 

adopt a holistic, and comprehensive, view in such cases. Any attempt, 

by the Court, to vivisect, microscopically, the order of the arbitrator, 

to find flaws, would be entirely inappropriate. So long as the decision 

is informed by adequate application of mind, it should be allowed to 

prevail, especially as it is in the nature of an interlocutory direction, 


ARB. A. 4/2020 

Page 81 of 82 

and is always subject to the final award, to be passed in the arbitral 

proceedings. 

74. For all these reasons, I am of the opinion that no occasion 

arises, for this Court to interfere with the impugned direction, in para 

3.28 of the Order supra, dated 18 th February, 2020, of the learned Sole 

Arbitrator to DGG, to furnish suitable security, equivalent to the 

amount involved in the dispute. This Court, therefore, upholds the 

said direction. 

75. It is clarified that observations in this judgement are prima facie 

in nature, and do not intend to represent any final expression of 

opinion on any of the issues of which the learned Sole Arbitrator is in 

seisin, including the validity of the Family Settlements, the nature of 

the acquisition, by DGG, of the 26,86,190 shares of BDR and their 

transfer into the DEMAT account of DGG, the transfer of ₹ 19.55 

crores into the account of DGG, or, indeed, any other aspect 

whatsoever. The learned Sole Arbitrator shall, while arbitrating on 

the issues before him, proceed entirely uninfluenced by any 

observation contained in this judgement. This Court is, in the present 

case, essentially concerned with whether a case for interference, with 

the impugned direction of the learned Sole Arbitrator, has, within the 

confines of Section 37 of the 1996 Act, been made out or not, and has, 

for the reasons adduced hereinbefore, answered the issue in the 

negative. 

76. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed, albeit with no orders as 

to costs.
