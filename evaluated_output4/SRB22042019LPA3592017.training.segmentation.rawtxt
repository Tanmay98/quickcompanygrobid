1. 

This judgment will decide two appeals: one from the decision of the 

learned single judge in a writ petition, W.P.(C) No.1971/2014 ["the writ 

petition"], filed by the appellant [hereafter called "Bayer"] against the 

respondent (hereafter "Natco") in LPA No. 359/2017 and the other, in a suit 

decided in CS (OS) (Comm) 1592/2016 filed by Bayer against the 

respondent in RFA(OS)(Comm) 6/2017 (Alembic Chemicals Ltd, the 

defendant in the suit, hereafter called "Alembic"). Both judgments deal with 

an identical issue, concerning the correct interpretation of Section 107A of 

the Patents Act, 1970 ("the Act") which is commonly known as the -Bolar 

provision‖. 

2. 

Facts in the appeal arising out of the judgment in the writ petition (i.e. 

in LPA No359/2107) are that Bayer filed a suit [CS(OS) No.1090/2011] for 

injunction against Natco from making, importing, selling, offering for sale 

"Sorafenib", ‗Sorafenib Tosylate' ("Bayer drugs") or any generic version or 

any other drug or product thereof which was a subject matter of Bayer"s 

Patent No.215758. When the suit was pending, Natco applied to the Patent 

Office for grant of compulsory licence against that patent. This application 

was granted, on 09.03.2012, by the Patent Controller, under Section 84 of 

the Patents Act 1970 (hereafter "the Act"). The compulsory licence granted 

was solely for the purposes of making, using, offering to sell and selling the 

drug covered by the patent within the territory of India. However, inter alia, 

apart from producing the drug for the Indian market, Natco manufactured the 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 3 of 90 

product covered by the compulsory licence for export outside India. Bayer 

filed a writ petition seeking a direction to the Customs Authorities to seize 

the consignments for export containing products covered by compulsory 

Licence including ‗Sorafenat' ("Natco" drugs hereafter) manufactured by 

Natco. Notice of writ petition was issued by a learned single judge of this 

court; the customs authorities were directed to ensure that no consignment 

from India containing ‗Sorafenat' covered by compulsory licence was 

exported. At the same time, Natco was given the liberty to apply to the court 

for permission to export the drug. Later, on 23.05.2014, Natco pointed out 

that in fact it has already been granted a drug license and it was permitted to 

export the drug Sorafenib Tosylate not exceeding 15 gm for development/ 

clinical studies and trials. 

3. 

Natco next applied for permission to export 1 Kg of Active 

Pharmaceutical Ingredient (hereafter "API") Sorafenib to China to conduct 

clinical studies and trials for development of drug for regulatory purposes. 

That application was rejected by Bayer, which argued in its writ petition, that 

if permission were granted to Natco, it would be contrary to Section 107A 

and that such a transaction would be a commercial sale and hence, a patent 

infringement. According to Bayer, Section 107A was not applicable, because 

Natco was not conducting research. The sale of API, therefore, amounted to 

infringement of its patent. Bayer"s interpretation of Section107A was that 

the provision mentions the word "sale" and also "import", but the legislature 

consciously excluded the term "export". Bayer relied on a German 

decision Polpharma as well as the US history of the Bolar Exemption (that 

allows sale only within the United States) and canvassed a restricted -as 

opposed to a liberal interpretation-of Section107A. 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 4 of 90 

4. 

Natco"s counter affidavit in the writ petition among others urged that 

it did not export the finished product Sorafenat to any party outside India for 

commercial purpose. It further argued that the words "sale" for the purpose 

of drug development i.e. -solely for uses reasonably related to the 

development and submission of information required under any law for the 

time being in force, in India, or in a country other than India, that regulates 

the manufacture, construction, use, sale or import of any product‖ clearly 

pointed to the legislative intention that exports, for the purpose of drug 

development, in compliance of regulatory law of a country outside India was 

permissible. 

5. 

The suit, CS(COMM) No. 1592/2016 was filed by Bayer to injunct 

Alembic from making, selling, distributing, advertising, exporting, offering 

for sale and in any manner directly or indirectly dealing in Rivaroxaban and 

any product that infringed its (Bayer"s) patent IN 211300 and for ancillary 

reliefs pleading: (i) that the subject patent is registered in the name of Bayer 

and is titled -Oxazolidinones and their Use; ii) that Alembic is 

manufacturing and exporting Rivaroxaban to the European Union; and that 

Alembic has made multiple Drug Master File submissions to the United 

States Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America for the 

drug Rivaroxaban; iv) that a drug Master File is a submission to the United 

States Food and Drug Administration that is used to provide confidential 

detailed information about the facilities, processes and articles used in the 

manufacturing, processing, packaging and storing of one or more human 

drugs; v) that Alembic has also filed a patent application for grant of a 

process patent for Rivaroxaban which specifically referred to Bayer"s patent 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 5 of 90 

and said that Rivaroxaban is disclosed by Bayer"s patent; thus, clearly 

showing that Alembic infringed Bayer"s patent. 

6. 

During the hearing, Alembic stated that the exports being effected by 

it are covered by Section 107A. Thereafter, on 15.12.2016, Alembic 

categorically stated that till then it had not commercially launched 

Rivaroxaban and had only exported it within the meaning of Section 107A; 

further, that in the event Alembic, in the future, intended to launch 

Rivaroxaban, it would give one month"s notice to Bayer to enable the latter 

to avail of its remedies. Bayer argued on that date that Alembic exported at 

least 90 Kg. Rivaroxaban worth ` 3 crores and export of such quantity could 

not be within the meaning of Section 107A. 

7. 

Parties in the Alembic suit were informed during the hearing, on 

15.12.2016, that the Natco"s writ petition had been heard, (involving an 

identical issue of law) in which judgment had been reserved; in the 

circumstances, since only the legal question of interpretation of Section 

107A of the Act was to be decided, there was no need for pleadings; the 

court bound Alembic to its statement aforesaid and with the direction that 

Alembic thereafter will not effect any export without giving 15 days" notice 

to Bayer. Arguments in addition to those already addressed in the writ 

petition, were permitted. Alembic later applied stating that it was effecting 

exports to Brazil and Palestine; that application was adjourned. Arguments 

were concluded on 14.02.2017 and judgment reserved. 

8. 

After a detailed analysis of the contentions and the facts, the impugned 

judgment rejected Bayer"s arguments. The court found that firstly, the 

quantity sought to be exported by Natco was just enough for 1000-2000 

tablets, and, therefore, cannot be termed a commercial activity. The court 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 6 of 90 

then said that the intention of the legislature in interpreting Section 107 must 

be gathered from the plain meaning, which clearly does not exclude sale 

outside India. Further, there was nothing in Section 107A that implies that 

only the manufacturers themselves can avail of the exemption and cannot 

sell it to a third party. The only requirement is that the sale must be 

"reasonably related to" the submission of information under the law (in this 

case, Chinese law). The court also pointed that the WTO Panel had expressly 

upheld such a wide interpretation of the similarly-worded Canadian Bolar 

Exemption to be TRIPs compliant and, therefore, not unfairly prejudicial to 

the patent holder. 

9. 

On the text of Section 107A, the learned single judge noticed the 

difference between the wordings of that provision and Section 48, noting that 

the terms "constructing" in Section 107A and "offering for sale" in Section 

48 were not important. The learned single judge then held that: 

-It is thus the purpose for which the said acts are done‗ which 
distinguishes, whether the acts constitute infringement of patent 
or not. If the said purpose is within the confines of Section 
107A, the acts so done would not constitute infringement and 
the patentee cannot prevent a non-patentee from doing them. 
However, if the purpose of doing the acts of making, using, 
selling or importing a patented invention is not solely for the 
purposes prescribed in Section 107A, the said acts would 
constitute infringement of patent and patentee can prevent non-
patentee from doing them.‖ 

10. 

The learned single judge then held: 

-27. The point of difference between Bayer and Natco / 
Alembic is qua selling outside India. While Bayer contends that 
the word -selling‖ in Section 107A is confined to within the 
territory of India and selling of patented invention outside India 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 7 of 90 

even if for purposes specified in Section 107A would constitute 
infringement which can be prevented by patentee, the 
contention of the senior counsels for Natco / Alembic is that use 
of the word -selling‖ under Section 107A is without any such 
restriction of being within India only and would include selling 
outside India also, so long as solely for the purposes prescribed 
in Section 107A. 

28. The counsels for Bayer, to explain why Section 107A 
refers to the purpose of development and submission of 
information required under law in a country other than India 
that regulates manufacture, construction, use and sale of 
pharmaceutical products, if selling referred to in Section 107A 
was to be within the confines of India contend that the 
information generated in India and required under law of a 
country other than India to be submitted for obtaining approval 
for manufacture and marketing of any pharmaceutical product 
in that country can be submitted without the sale of patented 
invention outside the country. According to them, transfer from 
India to any other country can be only of information gathered / 
collected in India and required to be submitted under the laws 
of any other country for obtaining approvals for manufacture 
and sale of pharmaceutical products in that country. 

29. According to me, to uphold what Bayer contends, would be 
contrary to the natural / literal / textual interpretation of 
Section 107A of the Patents Act. To ascribe natural / literal / 
textual meaning to the language of Section 107A of the Patents 
Act, I proceed to dissect clause (a) thereof as under: 

(i) Any act of making, constructing, using, selling or importing 
a 
patented 
invention 
(ii) solely for uses reasonably related to development and 
submission of information required under any law for the time 
being in force, in India, or in a country other than India, that 
regulates the manufacture, construction, use, sale or import of 
any product 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 8 of 90 

(iii) shall not be considered as infringement of patent rights. It 
becomes immediately evident that ‗selling' permitted by Section 
107A is of a patented invention‗i.e. a ̳ 
product‗ and not of 
‗information'. The word ‗information' is in the context of 
‗required to be submitted to any authority under any law of 
India or of a country other than India regulating the 
manufacture and marketing of any product'. Section 107A, as 
per its natural / literal / textual meaning requires selling of a 
patented invention solely for submission of information 
required under any law for the time being in force in a country 
other than India that regulates the manufacture, construction, 
use and sale of any product, to be not considered as 
infringement of patent right. The counsels for Bayer are unable 
to dispute that Section 107A envisages development and 
submission of information required under any law of a country 
other than India for obtaining approvals for manufacture and 
marketing of pharmaceutical products in that country. However 
contend that development of the information, required to be 
submitted in a country other than India, by making, using and 
constructing and selling of patented invention in India only. 
Significantly, the counsels for Bayer, qua ‗selling' within India, 
admit can be of patented invention i.e. of the product, by Fine 
Chemical Producers of India to manufacture or producers of 
pharmaceutical products in India and do not insist, should be of 
information only. However when it comes to ‗selling' outside 
India, they insist cannot be of patented invention or product 
and can be of information only. I am unable to read such 
dichotomy in the language of Section 107A. It is not found to 
distinguish between making, constructing, using, selling for 
submission of information required under law in India and 
under the law of a country other than India. 

31. I am also unable to accept the contention of Bayer that, 
use of the word -selling‖ refers to selling‗ within India' only. 

32 
‗Sale', in Black‗s Law Dictionary, 10 th Edition, is 
defined as transfer of property or title having the elements of i) 
parties competent to contract; ii) mutual assent; iii) a thing 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 9 of 90 

capable of being transacted; and, iv) a price in money paid or 
promised to be paid. Thus, use of the word ‗sale'/ ‗selling' 
entails transfer of property or title in a thing and does not 
contain any territorial limitations viz. of being within the 
country or State. 

XXXXXX 
XXXXXX 
XXXXXX 

35. The words ‗sale'/ ‗selling' thus, as per their literal / natural 
/ textual meaning are without any geographical limitations and 
in Section 107A are not to be understood as ‗within India' only 
and if such sale / selling were to involve transfer of the patented 
invention / product to a country other than India though would 
also qualify as export / exporting but would not cease to be sale 
/ selling. 

XXXXXX 
XXXXXX 
XXXXXX 

37. As far as Section 107A is concerned, use therein of the 
words -law for the time being ‗in a country other than India' is 
evidence of, obtaining regulatory approvals in countries other 
than India being contemplated by the legislature. With such 
contemplation, the legislature provided that certain acts 
mentioned in Section 107A, required to be done for the purpose 
of obtaining such approval, would not be considered as 
infringement of patent rights. One of such acts is of selling of 
patented invention. The plain meaning of Section 107A is that 
selling of patented invention for obtaining regulatory approval 
in country other than India would entail transfer of patented 
invention i.e. product from India to that country. There is 
nothing in the language of Section 107A to suggest that only the 
information generated / collected in India could be transported 
out of India and not the patented invention. Information 
generated in India, unless accepted under the law of any other 
country for granting regulatory approvals for manufacture, 
sale and import in that country, would be of no use. There is 
nothing in the language of Section 107A to indicate that the 
legislature applied itself that the regulatory laws of countries 
other than India would accept the information generated and 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 10 of 90 

collected in India. The counsels for Bayer during the hearing 
also could not demonstrate that information collected / 
generated in India would be acceptable for grant of regulatory 
approvals for manufacture and sale of drugs in other countries. 
Even otherwise, the interpretation of laws of India cannot be 
dependent on foreign laws. I have not found any provision 
elsewhere in the Patents Act requiring the word ‗selling' in 
Section 107A to be restricted to ‗within India' only.‖ 

Contentions of parties: Bayer 

11. 

Mr. Sudhir Chandra, Senior Advocate (for Bayer) argues that Section 

48 of the Act implicitly defines infringement by listing the exclusive rights 

of the patentee. Section 107A of the Act describes a particular set of 

circumstances in which acts that are largely those named in Section 48 

would "not constitute infringement". Thus, Section 107A of the Act clearly 

provides for circumstances/actions which, but for its existence, would be 

covered as an infringement under Section 48. Therefore, it is clearly a 

proviso/exception. But for Section 48, Section 107 has no purpose. 

Therefore, the latter constitutes an exception to Section 48 and does not 

confer a right. He relies on the Supreme Court decision in S. Sundaram 

Pillai v. V.R. Pattabiraman AIR1985 SC 582 that the nature of a proviso is 

such that it: 

-it is meant to be an exception to something within the main 
enactment or to qualify something enacted therein which but for 
the proviso would be within the purview of the enactment.‖ 
[Emphasis supplied] 

12. 
Furthermore, the nature of Section 107A of the Act as a 

proviso/exception can be seen from its placement in the statute by the 

legislature. It finds mention in Chapter XVIII which is titled "suits 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 11 of 90 

concerning infringement." This means that Section 107A of the Act is 

intended to be used as a defence that may be claimed in the course of a suit 

for infringement rather than form the basis for an independent right or 

separate actionable claim. Moreover, Section 107A of the Act is placed just 

after, and along with, Section 107 which is titled "Defences etc. in suits for 

infringement". This gives yet another indication of the legislative intent 

behind the manner in which Section 107A of the Act was envisioned to be 

applied. The learned single judge"s finding that the provision is not an 

exception and that it confers an independent right, is impugned as erroneous. 

It is also stated that the observations in the impugned judgment that the 

interpretation furthers the right of the exporter, under Article 19(1)(g) of the 

Constitution of India does violence to the plain reading of Section 107A 

which neither uses such language nor envisages the commission of such acts 

beyond the exhaustively defined situation that it lays out. It is also argued 

that the existence of a right implies the creation of an actionable claim. The 

absence of a legislative prescription of a remedy clearly shows that it is not 

the legislative intent to confer an independent right to a party under section 

107A of the Act. 

13. 
Learned Senior Counsel relied on the rule that a proviso should be 

interpreted narrowly, unlike a right which warrants liberal interpretation. 

Specifically, a proviso must be interpreted keeping in mind the scope of the 

main enactment to which it forms a proviso. This was recognised by the 

Supreme Court in The Commissioner of Income Tax v the Indo-Mercentile 

Bank Ltd. [AIR 1959 SC 713]. 

14. 
Mr. Chandra argued that the legislative intent behind Section 107A 

of the Act is only to ensure the availability of a competitor's product 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 12 of 90 

immediately after the expiry of patent in the Indian market without having to 

wait for regulatory approval post patent expiry. However, this intent does 

not extend to ensuring the availability of the same in other countries. He 

relies on the Notes on Clauses of the Patents (Amendment) Act 2002 as well 

as the Joint Parliamentary Committee Report pertaining to the insertion of 

Section 107A of the Act. Learned Senior Counsel stated that the phrase "in a 

country other than India‖ refers to the submission of information in 

countries other than India so that the data generated in India may be 

submitted around the world, as is an accepted practice in the pharmaceutical 

industry. In fact, India is becoming a favoured global destination for 

conducting clinical trials and the data generated in this process is often used 

before regulatory regimes around the world. The expression in Section 107A 

(i.e. sale, construct etc.) is qualified by the word "law" with the phrase "in a 

place other than India'. The latter phrase has clearly not been used to 

describe the acts of "making, selling using", etc., i.e. it cannot possibly 

intend to authorise the commission of acts outside the territory of India. The 

phrase has merely been included so that companies in India may avail the 

Bolar exemption not only to obtain approvals in India but around the world, 

without having to conduct separate clinical trials for every instance of 

submission of data. It is argued that Section 107 has three important 

elements, i.e. the activities (selling, making, constructing) the purpose, 

which can only be "development and submission of information"; and the 

law i.e. that such development (and submission of information) should be 

"required by any law in India or in a country other than India". Learned 

Senior Counsel argued therefore, that the phrase in "a country other than 

India" refers to the law that requires development and submission of 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 13 of 90 

information and the law that -regulates the manufacture, construction, use, 

sale or import of any product‖. The policy of the provision is, therefore, met 

if activities are permitted in India for the purpose of generating data which 

may then be submitted before the regulatory authority in India or a country 

other than India. It is argued that this construction only would be consistent 

with the legal requirement of not placing any fetters on the patentee's 

exclusive rights beyond the fulfillment of the legislative purpose or intent. 

15. 
Mr. Chandra highlighted that the expression "exports" occurs in 

various other provisions of the Act: reference is made to Sections 84, 90(1) 

and 92A in this regard. They prescribe restrictions and export of a patented 

product may be allowed only within the ambit of such restrictions. All these 

show that the legislature has consciously used the expression "export" 

whenever it was necessary. However, no such explicit mention of export or 

corresponding restriction as found in these provisions can be seen in Section 

107A of the Act. It is urged that this is significant, given the background of 

the fact that the term "importing" was specifically included in Section 107A 

of the Act by the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005, without any mention of 

the word export" or "offering for sale". This clearly indicates that the 

legislature did not intend to include these activities within the ambit of the 

said Section. The inclusion of "importing" in Section 107A of the Act also 

reinforces the legislative intent which is to ensure the availability of the drug 

in the Indian market. Learned Senior Counsel also relied on the Joint 

Parliamentary Report which clearly states that the purpose of Section 107A 

of the Act is to bring India's Bolar exemption in line with the global 

requirements. 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 14 of 90 

16. 
It is next submitted that the word "selling" does not include exports, 

because firstly the Act is territorial in nature and explicitly states in Section 

1 that it "extends to the whole of India". Clearly, the Act only seeks to 

regulate activities which take place in India and hence, does not deal 

with/permit sale outside India. Moreover, as was held in the judgment of the 

Supreme Court in GvkInds Ltd. & Anr. v The Income Tax Officer & 

Anr.(2011) 4 SCC 36 only those extra-territorial aspects which have an 

impact or nexus with India and are enacted with the intent of creating some 

benefit for India would fall within the constitutionally sanctioned idea of 

legislative competence. Next, the nature and purpose of the Act is primarily 

to safeguard the interests of the patentee and the nature and purpose of 

Section 107A of the Act is an exception to the patentee's rights so that the 

generic versions of the drug may be made available immediately upon 

expiry of the patent in the Indian market. Inclusion of "export" within this 

provision would not serve the Indian market as envisioned by the Legislature 

and therefore, the same would be impermissible as per the law on extra-

territorial legislative action. Thus, making, constructing and using of the 

product are permitted in India alone and export for that purpose is not 

contemplated. 

17. 
Moreover, since the act of selling in Section 48 refers to sale "in 

India" only (as can be seen from the provision), it cannot be said that Section 

107A of the Act, can enlarge the scope of this term and grant an additional 

right to the defendant. Counsel derives support from the judgment in Indo-

Mercantile Bank Ltd (supra). It is argued, moreover, as untenable that the 

legislature would use the word "selling "in one sense as part of Section 48 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 15 of 90 

but accord to it a different meaning in an exception to the same Section 

within the same Act i.e. Section 107A of the Act. 

18. 
It is argued that the expression "exports" has a clear meaning in the 

general sense, and statutorily. "Export" as defined in Black's Law Dictionary 

means:"To send or carry abroad, to send, take or carry (a good or 

commodity) out of the country; to transport (merchandise) from one country 

to another in the course of trade; to carry out or convey goods by sea". 

Thus, the act of sale which may occur in the course of an export can be 

concluded upon transfer of title in the goods which may happen outside 

India, however, the word "selling" referred to in both Section 48 and Section 

107A of the Act is clearly territorial in nature whereas the term "export" is, 

by definition, extra-territorial in nature. Thus, the learned Single Judge has 

grievously erred in conflating the two terms. 

19. 
It is argued that "sale" by "export" is mentioned in the Central Sales 

Tax Act, 1956 ("CST Act") which deals with a -sale said to take place in 

the course of export". While considering the import of this phrase in Article 

286, the Supreme Court held in The Stale of Travancore-Cochin and Ors. v. 

The Bombay Company Ltd. AIR 1952 SC 366and The State of Travancore-

Cochin v. The Shanmugha Vilas Cashew Nut Factory & Ors AIR 1953 SC 

333that two types of sales or purchases would fall within this category: (a) a 

sale or purchase which itself occasions the export and (b) a sale or purchase 

affected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods after the goods are 

put in the export stream (i.e. after they have crossed the customs frontiers of 

India). Such an interpretation suggests that "sale" per se does not 

comprehend in itself export, which is a distinct activity, and that sale which 

occurs in the course of exports is extra-territorial in nature. 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 16 of 90 

20. 
It is argued that the impugned judgment erroneously found that a 

plain reading of section 107A of the Act would include the word "exports" 

as the same would fall within the meaning of the word "selling". The 

construction placed by the learned Single Judge to the provision really 

amounts to supplying casus omissus. This is contrary to the settled principles 

of statutory interpretation. 

21. 
It is argued that the Section must be read in accord with global 

standards applicable to the Bolar Exemption. Reference is made to the Joint 

Parliamentary Committee Report which clarifies that Section 107A of the 

Act was meant to be in line with the global standards in respect of the Bolar 

exemption. Furthermore, allowing export under Section 107A of the Act 

would be in violation of Article 30 of the TRIPS (Annexure14) which allows 

for exceptions to patent rights so long as the exception is (a) limited ; (b) 

does not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of the patent ; 

and (c) does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the 

patentee. It is pertinent to note that these were the very issues that were 

considered in the case of Canada-Patent Protection of Pharmaceutical 

Products [DS 114, hereafter "Canada Dispute" or "Canada Patent Dispute] 

decided by the WTO Dispute Settlement Panel ("DSP" hereafter) when 

adjudicated the legality of Canada's Bolar provision. Notably, both sides 

in this dispute readily acknowledged that such a provision was in the nature 

of an exception to the patentee's rights. While the WTO upheld the validity 

of the Bolar exemption, it did not consider whether an export would be 

permissible within the ambit of this exception. In fact, Canada's contentions 

with respect to the issue of submission of information before foreign 

regulatory regimes clearly indicates that the Canadian provision envisioned 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 17 of 90 

the testing itself to be carried out domestically while the information 

generated therefrom could be used for submission abroad. This case 

therefore, underscores the approach which the appellant is canvassing for the 

consideration. Furthermore, allowing exports under Section 107A of the Act 

would also be in disregard of Article 31 of the TRIPS which states in clause 

(f) that the any use of a non-patentee should be predominantly for the supply 

of the domestic market of the member country authorizing such use. 

22. 
Bayer argues that reading exports into Section 107A of the Act 

would be contrary to the general interpretation of "Bolar Provisions" around 

the world. Those countries which do permit export explicitly provide for the 

same in their statute and do so with a specific purpose. For instance, 

Australia permits exports explicitly for patents which have received an 

extension in their term. Several jurisdictions have also recognised the blatant 

prejudice this would cause to the rights of the patentee such as the Polish 

Supreme Court in A.P. Inc. v. SFP SA [IV CSK 92/13] and the German 

Appellate Court in Astellas v. Polpharma [12-U 68/12]. Therefore, the 

learned Single Judge returned findings which are not in line with the 

legislative intent and also in the teeth of the global standards with respect to 

the Bolar exemption. 

23. 
It is submitted that arguendo if Section 107A of the Act permits 

exports, the burden of proof must fall on the non-patentee. In this regard, it 

is stated that it is an established position under the law of evidence that the 

burden of proof must lie on the party who relies on a fact. This can be seen 

from Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 [Annexure 19], which 

provides that any fact(s) must be proved by the party which seeks to rely on 

the same. This also follows naturally from the fact that Section 107 of the 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 18 of 90 

Act is a defence/exception, as shown above. The burden of proof must 

clearly lie on the party who relies on the exception to justify their acts. 

Consequently, the non-patentee who relies on the fact that their export is for 

the purposes allowed by Section 107A of the Act must be the one who is 

required to prove the same, because it is the exporter/non-patentee who is 

privy to all the details relevant to proving the applicability of Section 107A 

of the Act such as manner of export, quantities, identity of the importing 

party etc. Learned Senior Counsel faults the impugned judgment which held 

that 

-this court cannot proceed to interpret the laws of the countries 
of intended export to determine whether the export intended in 
a given case is for the purposes prescribed in Section 107A of 
the Act. All exports by a non-patentee of a patented invention 
are deemed to be for the said purpose and only if proved to be 
otherwise, can make the exporter liable for consequences 
thereof in an appropriate legal proceeding.‖ 

24. 
It was submitted that this approach effectively shifts the burden of 

proof on the patentee to show that the non-patentee's acts are not covered by 

Section 107A of the Act. This, in substance and effect, results in placing a 

reverse burden which is legally impermissible. Further, this results in the 

plaintiff not only having to establish that the defendants' acts overlap with 

the exclusive rights of the patentee but that Section 107A of the Act is 

inapplicable. Moreover, a consistent application of this approach would also 

mean that the burden of proof stands reversed in respect of all activities 

contemplated by Section 107A. By extension, it could also be argued that 

the plaintiff must prove non-applicability of every section which sets out 

situations of non-infringement such as Section 47, 49, etc. 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 19 of 90 

25. 
It is argued further that even if Section 107A is interpreted to permit 

exports, the safeguards implicit in Section 107A of the Act cannot be 

ignored. Here Bayer urges that the phrase "reasonably related..." in Section 

107A of the Act clearly implies that compliance with the foreign regulatory 

regime must be proven and adjudicated upon by the court. It is clear that the 

court, in order to ensure the non-patentee's compliance with this phrase, 

would be required to undertake an analysis of the foreign regulatory 

requirements which the non-patentee uses as a justification for their acts. 

Counsel stated that this position is augmented by the prior judicial 

interpretations of Section 107A of the Act such as in Teva API India Pvt. 

Ltd, v Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. [FAO (OS) (COMM) 34/2 016 before 

DHC (DB)] where the defendants' undertaking in respect of compliance with 

the foreign regulatory regime as well as the export quantities were taken into 

consideration. It was submitted that the learned Single Judge, by finding that 

the court cannot get into an analysis of foreign regulatory regimes, has 

rendered the phrase -reasonably related to the development and submission 

of information‖ otiose. Furthermore, the various safeguards which were 

pointed out by Bayer before the learned single judge were not taken into 

consideration and in fact, it has been held by the latter in paragraph 56 of the 

impugned judgment that: 

".... Even if it were to be believed that the patented invention 
once exported from this Country for the purposes prescribed in 
Section 107A of the Act may be used for other purposes, it is for 
the patentee to enforce its rights if any in that country. The laws 
of this country are only concerned with the sale by way of 
export from this country being for the purposes prescribed," 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 20 of 90 

26. 
Bayer stated that this completely prejudices the interests of the 

patentee, which cannot be in congruence with the object of the Act. The 

patentee's interests are prejudiced because: 

(i) The patentee may not have a patent in the country of export which would 

leave the patentee completely remedy-less. 

(ii) Even if the activities undertaken in the destination country post-export 

may not be actionable in India, the original act of intention to export or offer 

for sale itself certainly falls within the judicial scrutiny of the courts in India. 

By deigning to scrutinise and thus permitting, an unqualified entitlement to 

export, the potential for future abuse increases manifold. This would surely 

prejudice the rights of the patentee. 

(iii)The patentee will have to undertake a global surveillance, tracking the 

products exported to establish what purpose they are being used for and then 

enforce their patents (if any) in multiple countries. This will give the 

defendants a free reign to export patented products without fear of 

prosecution. This could not have been the purport and intent of Section 

107A of the Act. 

27. 
It is argued lastly that in any event, the learned single judge failed to 

even consider the quantities sought to be exported by the respondent. They 

have to be compared with the quantities that are required by the regulatory 

regime to which information is to be submitted. This is crucial in confirming 

the purpose for which the non-patentee is undertaking the export. For 

instance, in the present case, more than 90 kgs of the patented product has 

been exported by the respondent. Non-consideration of the same runs 

contrary to the requirements of Section 107A of the Act as held in the 

pronouncement of Teva (supra). 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017

Contentions of Natco 

28. 
The learned senior counsel, Mr. Anand Grover submitted that Natco 

disputed Bayer"s factual assertion and contends that it had nothing to do 

with the alleged exports of the formulations. It is urged that anybody can 

buy the formulated drug in the market and send it out of the country. It is 

submitted that Bayer proposes selling the API (bulk drug) of Sorafenib 

Tosylate to M/s Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd ("Hisun" hereafter) in China, 

solely for generating data in China through Hisun to submit it to Chinese 

drug regulatory authorities. In any event, the issue of export under Section 

107A applies both to API and formulations. Pertinently, on 13.05.2011, i.e. 

before the issuance of the compulsory license, the Drugs Control 

Administration of Govt. of Andhra Pradesh granted a license to Natco to 

manufacture Sorafenib Tosylate API for domestic and export purposes. This 

raw material/bulk form is not covered by the compulsory license issued to 

Bayer. It is urged that Chinese law does not permit any non-Chinese entity to 

submit regulatory dossiers based on data and information generated in a 

country other than China. Similar laws exist in other countries. The studies 

are required to be conducted in China by a Chinese entity to the satisfaction 

of Chinese regulatory authorities. Reference is made to the SFDA Order No. 

28-Provisions for Drug Registration-Article 10-Provisions of Drug 

Registration. 

29. 
Mr. Grover submits that Bayer"s patent expires on 12.01.2020; 

Article 19 of the Chinese drug registration law enables an entity other than 

the patentee to apply for patent registration two years prior to the expiry of 

its term. Natco denies Bayer"s allegation that, under the guise of the grant of 

compulsory license, it is exporting the formulation to diverse countries, as 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 22 of 90 

baseless. It is argued that Bayer concedes that a generic manufacturer in 

India can carry on activities of making, constructing, using, selling or 

importing the patented invention for the development and generation of data 

to Indian authorities or foreign authorities, but however, contends that the 

patented article cannot be exported for development and generation of data 

abroad for submission to the foreign regulatory authorities. Natco submits 

that i) The TRIPS Agreement took note of the global nature of the 

pharmaceutical industry, the global need of access to affordable medicines. 

(ii) TRIPS also took note of extant practice under the US Bolar provision of 

exporting a patented article abroad for, developing and generating data 

abroad for submission to the US regulatory authorities, as exemplified by the 

US Supreme Court in Intermedics Inc. v Ventrilex, 775 F. Supp. 1269 (N. D. 

Cal. 1991). Mr Grover argued that Section 107A is enacted pursuant to 

Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement (Providing for limited exceptions to 

exclusive rights conferred by the grant of a patent) and after the decision of 

the WTO Dispute Panel decision in Canada-Patent Protection of 

Pharmaceutical Products dispute (WTO/DS114/R) (hereinafter, the "Canada 

Dispute"). It is submitted, furthermore, that Section 107A takes into account 

the unique position of the Indian generic pharmaceutical industry in the 

international market and its role as the key supplier of affordable generic 

medicines. Therefore, Section 107A goes beyond the Canadian provision in 

this behalf. 

30. 
Natco urges that rights under Section 48 are subject to the acts 

exempted under Section 107A. Section 107A read with Section 48 do not 

prohibit export if the person concerned otherwise satisfies the conditions of 

Section 107A. Natco argues that sale under Section 107A includes export 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 23 of 90 

out of India. It therefore says that export of API for purposes -reasonably 

related to development and submission of information‖ to Chinese 

authorities is legitimate. It is furthermore argued that the rights under 

Section 107A and under Section 84 are independent but can be exercised by 

the same person. 

31. 
Explaining the drug innovation and patent life cycle, when a product 

with beneficial effect is developed, its patent is sought by the inventor. But, 

a pharmaceutical drug can be introduced in the market only after conducting 

animal toxicity studies which are Phase I, II, and III human clinical trials 

generating information and data which is submitted to the satisfaction of 

drug regulatory authorities. To avoid repeated clinical trials on patients, 

regulatory authorities over world permit generic companies to carry on 

studies such as bioequivalence, bioavailability and stability studies to 

establishing chemical and functional equivalence of their product with the 

originator product. This is done on a partial scale commercial production 

run. Based on such studies, a drug has to satisfy requirements of 

bioequivalence, bioavailability and stability studies. The precise needs, in 

terms of quantity of production, is specified by regulatory authorities in 

various countries; they differ from each other. 

32. 
Mr. Grover emphasizes that patent regimes do not countenance 

continuation of monopoly even a single day more than the permitted patent 

term. Thus, generic companies need to only conduct development studies, 

generation of information and data before the expiry of the patent, i.e. during 

a patent"s term, to launch the product in the market immediately on expiry or 

invalidation of the patent. It is submitted that the global nature of the 

pharmaceutical industry is so structured that such generic producers are in a 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 24 of 90 

few countries; in some countries there are no generic producers at all. At 

times, even developed countries procure fine chemicals from other countries. 

Countries without generic industries do not necessarily have domestic 

markets that support operation of the industry on an economic scale. In such 

situations, the economies of scale for the generic manufacturers would be 

achieved if the product is also exported. Learned Senior Counsel also 

highlighted the leadership role played by Indian generic pharmaceutical 

entities in the global pharmaceutical market and flagged the support given to 

developing nations in Africa, South America, Central Asia and Eastern 

Europe stating that they supply over 90% of Anti Retro Viral Drugs to the 

developing countries. He also quoted a leading author, Brenda Waning, 

(Journal of AIDS Studies, 2010, 1335, A lifeline of treatment: the role of 

Indian generic maufacturers in supplying Antiretroviral medicines) 

33. 
It was contended that the TRIPS Agreement carves out an exception 

under Article 30, permitting regulatory exception activities prior to the 

expiry of patent. In this regard, it is stated that several countries including 

India, Canada and the US have fashioned their patent laws to carve out such 

exception. It is submitted that the Canadian provision, Section 55. 2(1), 

enabling use of a patented product for generation of data and information to 

be submitted to regulatory authorities, was the subject matter of a complaint 

lodged by the US and Europe at the Dispute Settlement Body (hereafter 

"DP") of the WTO (in the Canada Dispute). It was contended that Section 

55.2(1) violated TRIPS. The other challenge was to Section 55.2(2), the 

stock-piling exception of the Canadian law. Mr Grover submitted that the 

TRIPS dispute panel in the Canada dispute upheld the Canadian provisions. 

He contrasted the language of Section 55.2(1) of the Canada Patent law with 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 25 of 90 

Section 107A of the Act, highlighting that the former only contemplates 

"development and submission of information required under any law of 

Canada, a province or a country other than Canada that regulates the 

manufacture, construction, use or sale of any product'. However, Section 

107A of the Act of India, contemplates -... Development and submission of 

information required under any law for the time being in force... In a 

country other than India, that regulates the manufacture, construction, use, 

sale or import of any product.‖It is submitted that hence, Section 107A 

recognizes that export (of a patented product) to another country for 

development and submission of information (in that country), is not 

infringement. In the Canada Dispute, the DSP recognized that the general 

language of Article 30 was agreed to by the US on the understanding that it 

would help the US secure the Bolar exemption which was already in place 

there. The DSP also noted that foreign pre-expiry testing is accepted by the 

FDA and noted by the US Supreme Court in Intermedix Inc. (Supra). The 

DP found that such a provision was a "limited exception" within the 

meaning of Article 30 of TRIPS (Ref. Paras 7.2 to 7.6 DP order). Therefore, 

the key is not the quantity but the purpose for which production is carried. 

The DP also noted that the Canadian provision was a "limited exception", 

irrespective of the quantity involved, because of the narrow scope of its 

curtailment of Article 28.1 choices (under TRIPS).So long as the exception 

is confined to conduct necessary to comply with the requirements of the 

regulatory approval process, the extent of the acts unauthorized by the right 

holder that are permitted by it are small and narrowly bounded. Though 

regulatory approval processes may require substantial amounts of test 

production to demonstrate reliable manufacturing, the patentee's rights are 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 26 of 90 

unimpaired, by the size of such production runs, so long as they are solely 

for regulatory purposes and no commercial use is made. (Ref para 7.45 at of 

the Canada Dispute). Hence, the DSP clarified that there would be no 

infringement of Patent, regardless of the amount so used or exported, 

provided the use or export is solely for regulatory purposes and not 

commercial use of final product. 

34. 
Mr. Grover next dwelt on the legislative history of Section 107A, 

stating that it was introduced after the DSP decision in Canada Dispute. In 

1999, the Patents Act (Second Amendment) Bill, 1999 ("1999 Bill") was 

introduced in the Rajya Sabha to meet India's obligations under the TRIPS 

Agreement (required to be met by 01.01.2000). The Bill proposed the 

introduction of a new section i.e. Section 107A. Section 107A was sought to 

be amended in 2002 and 2003; but was finally amended in 2005, taking into 

account the decision in the Canada Dispute. However, it went beyond that 

decision. The changes brought about by the 2005 amendment are: a) 

abolition of the three year period prior to patent expiry; b) addition that the 

act of selling had to be "solely related to the development and submission of 

data‖ in law; and c) addition that the law referred in the section could be of 

India "or any country other than India‖; d) going beyond the Canadian law 

in that the expression "importing" and "import" were added in Section 

107A. Learned Senior Counsel also referred to the Joint Committee on 

Patents" note of December, 2001, and said that it clarifies that the object of 

Section 107A is ensuring that regulatory approvals are not limited to only 3 

years before the patent term expiry and allow prompt availability. 

35. 
It is urged that Section 107A and Section 84 operate in different 

fields; the former operates on the submission of data generated in 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 27 of 90 

development of the drug to Regulatory authorities for marketing approval, 

that is the patented product is not sold in the market, Section 84 operates on 

marketing of the patented product for commercial purposes. Referring to 

Intermedics, counsel urged that the Federal Circuit court considered the 

scope of the Bolar provision. The case involved the sale of stents to a party 

outside the US for development purposes and held that sales to foreign 

distributors for development studies reasonably related to developing 

information could be submitted to the FDA and that such development of 

information need not be restricted to the period just before patent expiry. 

Thus, export of the patented article to another country was very much part of 

the patent law in the US at the time of coming into force of the TRIPS 

Agreement. Likewise, this position was noted in Canada Dispute case, 

which ruled on Section 55.2 of the Canadian Act. (Ref para 4.38(a) of the 

decision). 

36. 
Learned Senior Counsel urged that Section 107A should be 

interpreted in accordance with TRIPS and the interpretation placed on that 

by the DSP. Furthermore, considering that the Indian law, uses the phrase 

"in a country other than India," which is absent in the US law, a fortiori 

India permits export to other countries in accordance with their law for 

submission of data of development studies. As a result, Section 48 does not 

prohibit, but allows export. Indian law would apply to the territory to which 

the medicines are imported by the expression "importing" which needs to be 

in every patent law by virtue of the minimum standards of TRIPS compliant 

intellectual property regime. Therefore, the expression "import" for another 

country, in so far as Section 107A is concerned, would mean an export from 

India. Therefore, export is actually contemplated under Section 107A. 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 28 of 90 

37. 
Mr. Grover states that it is an established position in law that any 

term in a provision should be given plain meaning. Bayer"s reading into 

Section 107A, limitations is therefore impermissible. Non-existent 

limitations in a statute cannot be read into it. Reference is made to GP 

Singh"s Principles of Statutory Interpretation 12th Edition and State of 

Orissa v Joginder Pattjoshi (2004) 9 SCC 278. Also, "sale" is a 

compendious term that includes "export"; in any event, importantly, patent 

law is territorial in nature and does not control any high seas transaction. 

Export is actually embraced in and controlled through a sale. The learned 

single judge too noted that "sale" is not to be understood as being within 

India. 

38. 
It is contended that entities such as Bayer are not prejudiced because 

if a drug is imported into a territory in which in respect of that drug, a patent 

is granted, then the patentee would be able to interdict any unauthorized use 

of the patented article, barring the import for regulatory exception. This is 

the accepted position in TRIPS. (Ref para 7.46 Canada Dispute). It is stated 

that the Parliament was conscious of the role the Indian generic companies 

play in access to affordable medicines around the world and in particular in 

developing countries. Mr. Grover urges that Bayer incorrectly claims that 

the learned single judge did not appreciate the difference between API and 

the finished product. It is stated that after differentiating between API and 

the finished formulation, the learned single judge detailed the difference 

between Fine Chemical Producers and other manufacturers/producers of 

medicines, and concluded that the term "selling" used in Section 107A is to 

facilitate selling of API/formulations to the manufacturers of medicines. 

Further, the learned single judge noted that even after the 2002 Amendment, 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 29 of 90 

Section 107A was not added as a proviso to Section 48, rather it was 

included under the Chapter titled "suits concerning infringement of patents" 

under Section 107 titled "Defences, etc., in suits for infringement". He 

concluded correctly that Section 48 does not confer a right to prevent 

making and selling patented product for purposes solely prescribed in 

Section 107A. 

39. 
It is urged that Section 48 of the Patents Act is subject to the 

provisions of Section 84 and 107A of the Patents Act. Section 107A is not 

subject to the operation of Section 84 or of Chapter XVI of the Act. Thus, 

Section 84 does not control Section 107A. Section 48 would yield to other 

provisions of the Patents Act, including Section 107A and, its operation 

cannot be curtailed by Section 84. In this regard, it is submitted that the 

effect to both the provisions, Section 107A and 84, has to be given in 

appropriate circumstances. Both operate in different fields. Section 107A 

operates on the submission of data generated in the development of the drug 

to regulatory authorities for marketing approval, that is the patented product 

is not sold in the market, whereas Section 84 operates on marketing of the 

patented product for commercial purposes. Stressing on the need to 

harmoniously interpret all parts of the statute, it is stated that such consistent 

reading excludes the idea that one provision can trump the other and render 

it otiose, unless specifically provided. Counsel referred to Padma Ben 

Banushali & Another v Yogendra Rathore and Others, (2006) 12 SCC 138. 

Reference is also made to High Court of Gujarat v Gujarat Kishan Mazdoor 

Panchayat (2003) 4 SCC 712. It is urged that the argument with respect to 

the relationship between Section 107A and Section 84 is flawed. The learned 

single judge noted that the purpose of Section 107A is different from Section 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 30 of 90 

84, which is only for obtaining the regulatory approvals under the laws of 

India or in a country other than India. 

40. 
Without prejudice, it is submitted that the compulsory license under 

Section 84 operates as a deed or contract between the Controller and Natco, 

the grantee of compulsory licence (Section 93). Such a deed being a 

contract, cannot override a provision of law. Hence, the condition imposed 

by learned Controller must be read down to give way to Section 107A. 

Learned Senior Counsel also highlighted that pursuant to the impugned 

judgment, Natco filed an affidavit that during the life of the patent, it would 

not export the patented product for purposes other than spelt out by Section 

107A. It is urged that the undertaking allows Bayer to revoke an order in 

case of breach of undertaking by Natco. This is apart from the remedy that 

Bayer has in the form of an infringement suit in the country, where the 

patented article is sent to for the purposes of development studies, 

generating data on a semi production run for submission to the regulatory 

authorities. 

41. 
On behalf of Alembic, Ms. Saya Chaudhary highlighted that Bayer 

filed the suit despite knowledge and admission that the defendant (i.e 

Alembic) had not launched any commercial product in the Indian market, 

and in the absence of any pleadings indicating that the patent was 

commercially exploited by Alembic, or any party procuring Rivaroxaban 

through Alembic outside India. A suit for infringement was filed solely on 

the basis that:(i) a process patent application being PCT/1B2013/055062 

pertaining to process of manufacturing Rivaroxaban was filed by Alembic, 

which according to Bayer, indicated its (Alembic's) intent to launch a 

commercial product in India (ii) a Drug Master File (DMF) was applied by 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 31 of 90 

Alembic, before the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); (iii) a no-

Objection Certificate was obtained by Alembic for exporting Rivaroxaban to 

Europe. Bayer, however could not prove or establish even prima facie that 

the acts complained of, fell within the purview of section 48 of the Act, i.e. 

commercial exploitation of the patented product as opposed to regulatory 

use. Initially, in the suit, Alembic made a categorical statement that it had 

neither launched nor commercialized the suit patent in India and that all acts 

conducted by it pertaining to Rivaroxaban were solely for regulatory 

purposes in India, and abroad as enumerated under section 107A of the Act. 

As a result, Alembic committed no act contemplated under section 48. No 

allegation of diversion of exports too was alleged in the pleadings or 

documents. Accordingly, the first question arising for consideration is 

whether based on acts covered under Section 107A, can a party be regarded 

as an infringer, who is then required to plead Section 107A as a defense to 

Section 48 of the Act. 

42. 
It is urged that the placement of Section 107A in the Act, as a 

separate and distinct section, different from Section 107 which deals with 

defences, etc., in suits for infringement is evidence of the intent of the 

Legislature that Section 107A ought not to be treated as a defence to Section 

48, but is required to be treated as an independent section which specifically 

provides for certain acts not to be considered as infringement. 

43. 
Ms. Chaudhary said that the shift in Indian Patent law is evident 

upon a plain reading of Sections 107A and Section 48 of the Act, both of 

which were inserted/substituted simultaneously by Act 38 of the 2002 so as 

to make India TRIPS compliant. Section 48 of the Act, in comparison to 

other legislative provisions pertaining to protection of IP Rights in India 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 32 of 90 

such as trade mark, copyright etc., is peculiar in nature inasmuch as it is a 

negative right, whereby a patentee is legally entitled under the Act 'to 

prevent third parties, who do not have his consent, from the act of making, 

using, offering for sale, selling or importing for those purposes that product 

in India'. This aspect coupled with the fact that the said provision by clear 

and express language has been made 'subject to the other provisions 

contained in this Act and the conditions specified in Section 

47......'establishes that it is the rights of a patentee enumerated under Section 

48 which yield to the rights of third parties under Section 107A of the Act. 

Thus, no fetters or restrictions can be placed on the acts enumerated under 

section 107A, especially by making parties liable to infringement action. In 

other words, patentee cannot prevent third parties from dealing with patented 

invention for regulatory use and no infringement action can be 

maintainedagainst such regulatory use. This legislative intent is evident upon 

a bare perusal of Section 107 of the Act, to which no amendments were 

made in 2002, or thereafter so as to label the rights of third parties to use 

patented inventions for acts detailed in Section 107A as a 'defence to a suit 

for patent infringement'. In fact, in Section 107(2), acts detailed in Section 

47 are specifically regarded as a ground for defence as opposed to Section 

107A. This intent, not to make Section 107A subservient to Section 48, 

cannot be overlooked and nullified by a patentee to label it as nothing but a 

defense and a "proviso" to Section 48. 

44. 
It was urged that a known principle of law is that any party who 

asserts a specific claim is required under law to establish/prove it. Even 

under Section 107A of the Act, save cases which deal with process patents, 

the onus to establish infringement, both at the prima facie stage and at the 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 33 of 90 

final stage, with clear and cogent evidence is on a patentee, and not on the 

defendant or for that matter a duty of the court, especially as patents rights 

are private rights. This is reaffirmed upon perusal of Section 106 of Act, 

which deals with power of courts to grant relief in cases of groundless 

threats of infringement proceedings wherein again it is for the patentee to 

prove that "…..the acts in respect of which the proceedings were threatened 

constitute or, if done, would constitute, an infringement of a patent.' If, 

therefore, a third party claims that on the basis of its regulatory use, a 

patentee is groundlessly threatening to sue such party, then, the patentee has 

establish that the acts of the third party constitute commercial exploitation 

and is outside the purview of section 107A i.e. regulatory use. If, and only if 

a patentee can succeed in proving that a complained act results in 

commercial use or exploitation, can a regulatory use defence fail. The mere 

fact that a pharmaceutical product/drug is developed into a finished 

formulation form and is sold in India or abroad for the purpose of procuring 

regulatory approval is however, insufficient to establish infringement; a 

plaintiff patentee has to establish how the act complained of falls within the 

purview of Section 48 due to which a suit for infringement is maintainable. 

This is especially important because Section 107A permits third parties to 

carry out trade by way of -any act of making, constructing, using, selling or 

importing a patented invention‖ thereby allowing such parties to profit with 

the only limitation being that such trade is be solely for uses reasonably 

related to the development and submission of information required under 

any law for the time being in force, in India, or in a country other than 

India, that regulates the manufacture, construction, use, sole or import of 

any product. 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017

45. 
Ms. Chaudhary supported and reiterated the submissions made by 

Mr. Grover that interpretation of Section 107A cannot be cut down by 

Section 48. It was submitted that to establish infringement, the threshold is 

nothing short of proving that the use is commercial. Furthermore, it was 

argued that exports are not per se infringement and submitted that a bare 

perusal of Section 107A reveals that its application and operation travels 

beyond India especially in view of the fact that it seeks to allow certain acts 

for -uses reasonably related to the development and submission of 

information required under any law for the time being in force, in India, or 

in a country other than India...‖. The plain words of the statute itself 

provides for acts to be conducted outside India. It is a well settled principle 

of law that words of a statute must be given their plain literal meaning. 

Bayer"s interpretation, however, would result in a dichotomy whereby the 

term 'selling' would be interpreted as the selling of the 'product' itself in 

India, but for the purposes of seeking regulatory approvals outside India, it 

would be interpreted as selling of 'information'. Such dichotomy was never 

the intention of the legislature, as is evident from a plain literal interpretation 

of Section 107A, and it is not open to Bayer to bring in such a dichotomy by 

way of judicial interpretation. It was urged that therefore, no territorial 

restriction ought to be imposed upon the term "sale" contained in Section 

107A as it is being sought to be done by Bayer by way of judicial 

interpretation, which in effect amounts to seeking legislative enactment. 

46. 
It was argued that if one applies a purposive interpretation to the 

present case, the fact that other nations/countries have expressly or 

specifically provided for a bar to export for seeking regulatory approvals in 

other countries as is the case in the USA and Australia, supports Alembic's 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 35 of 90 

contention that it was never the intention of the Act to prevent export of 

patented invention for regulatory purposes under section 107A of the Act. 

Further, even though the application of the Bolar Provision in the USA 

under Section 35 U. S. C.  § 271 (e) (1) is limited only to the US, yet, in 

Intermedics Inc (supra), export of patented product was allowed and held to 

be non-infringing in nature as it was for the purpose of conducting tests and 

procuring requisite data which was exclusively used to seek regulatory 

approval in the USA. Accordingly, in view of the fact that Section 107A 

specifically provides for uses reasonably related to seeking regulatory 

approval in countries other than India, it cannot be argued that Section 107A 

prohibits exports. 

47. 
Bayer"s reliance on the 'Notes on Clause' of the Patents (Second 

amendment) Bill, 1999 which first sought to introduce section 107A, was 

contested and it was submitted that the Joint Parliamentary Committee made 

numerous changes to the provision, which is evident from a bare perusal of 

the final provision which was enacted as also the Notes on Clauses detailed 

in the Joint Parliamentary Committee Report of the 1999 Bill. Therefore, it 

is evident that the scope of the said Section was expanded beyond India and 

the limitation of only the Indian market were specifically removed. 

48. 
Ms. Chaudhary urged that a look at Section 107A reveals that it does 

not impose any restriction on the quantity which can be made, constructed, 

used, sold or imported as long as all such quantity is utilized solely for uses 

reasonably related to development and submission of information required 

under any law for the time being in force in India or in a country other than 

India that regulates the manufacture, construction, use, sale or import of any 

product. Different countries have different regulatory regimes and 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 36 of 90 

requirements whereby the data required to be submitted at the time of 

seeking any regulatory approval varies from region to region based on local 

testing required which may vary anywhere from redoing complete clinical 

trials or certain phases of it. For example, in India, Phase III clinical trials 

have to be undertaken in India under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, 

bioavailability/bio equivalent studies, stability data which covers both 

accelerated and real time data are to be performed in India. Such testing 

requires different quantities depending on the drug, the dosage, the mode of 

delivery (tablets, capsules, injection, Intravenous Therapy etc.) and may vary 

from, for example, one pilot scale batch of 100,000 tablets to 3 pilot scale 

batches of 100,000 tablets. These, coupled with the fact that an entity may 

have multiple clients in a country, who would want to procure the patented 

product for testing, establishes that placing any restriction on the quantity to 

be used under Section 107A of the Act would result in impinging upon the 

fundamental rights of drug makers/manufacturers in complete contravention 

of the legislative intent behind incorporating Section 107A of the Act. It is 

urged that it is a well settled principle of law that it is not open for a party to 

seek legislative enactments from a court of law under the guise of judicial 

interpretation. Accordingly, it is not open for the court to put in multiple 

restrictions while interpreting Section 107A as is sought by Bayer inasmuch 

as the entire exercise under the present litigation is: (a) to impose 

unreasonable restrictions on export under Section 107A to the effect of 

completely excluding it from the purview of the said provision (b) to create 

an automatic presumption of infringement immediately upon any use, sale or 

export of patented product even though the same is declared to be for 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 37 of 90 

regulatory purposes and there is nothing to prove otherwise, so as to 

completely shift the onus of infringement from the plaintiff to the defendant. 

Relevant provisions of the Patents Act: 

49. 
Sections 48, 84, 92A, 107 and 107A of the Act read as follows: 

-48. Rights of patentees 
Subject to the other provisions contained in this Act and the 
conditions specified in section 47, a patent granted under this 
Act shall confer upon the patentee-

(a) where the subject matter of the patent is a product, the 
exclusive right to prevent third parties, who do not have his 
consent, from the act of making, using, offering for sale, selling 
or importing for those purposes that product in India: 

(b) where the subject matter of the patent is a process the 
exclusive right to prevent third parties, who do not have his 
consent, from the act of using that process, and from the act of 
using, offering for sale, selling or importing for those purposes 
the product obtained directly by that process in India:‖

84. Compulsory licences 

(1) At any time after the expiration of three years from the date 
of the 1 [grant] of a patent, any person interested may make an 
application to the Controller for grant of compulsory licence on 
patent on any of the following grounds, namely:-

(a) that the reasonable requirements of the public with 
respect to the patented invention have not been satisfied, 
or 

(b) that the patented invention is not available to the 
public at a reasonably affordable price, or 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 38 of 90 

(c) that the patented invention is not worked in the 
territory of India. 

(2) An application under this section may be made by any 
person notwithstanding that he is already the holder of a 
licence under the patent and no person shall be estopped from 
alleging that the reasonable requirements of the public with 
respect to the patented invention are not satisfied or that the 
patented invention is not worked in the territory of India or that 
the patented invention is not available to the public at a 
reasonably affordable price by reason of any admission made 
by him, whether in such a licence or otherwise or by reason of 
his 
having 
accepted 
such 
a 
licence. 

(3) Every application under sub-section (1) shall contain a 
statement setting out the nature of the applicant's interest 
together with such particulars as may be prescribed and the 
facts upon which the application is based. 

(4) The Controller, if satisfied that the reasonable requirements 
of the public with respect to the patented invention have not 
been satisfied or that the patented invention is not worked in the 
territory of India or that the patented invention is not available 
to the public at a reasonably price, may grant a licence upon 
such terms as he may deem fit. 

(5) Where the Controller directs the patentee to grant a licence 
he may, as incidental thereto, exercise the powers set out in 
section 88. 

(6) In considering the application filed under this section, the 
Controller shall take into account,-

(i) the nature of the invention, the time which has elapsed since 
the sealing of the patent and the measures already taken by the 
patentee or any licensee to make full use of the invention; 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 39 of 90 

(jj) the ability of the applicant to work the invention to the 
public advantage; 

(iii) the capacity of the applicant to undertake the risk in 
providing capital and working the invention, if the application 
were granted; 

(iv) as to whether the applicant has made efforts to obtain a 
licence from the patentee on reasonable terms and conditions 
and such efforts have not been successful within a reasonable 
period as the Controller may deem fit: PROVIDED that this 
clause shall not be applicable in case of national emergency or 
other circumstances of extreme urgency or in case of public 
non-commercial use or on establishment of a ground of anti-
competitive practices adopted by the patentee, but shall not be 
required to take into account matters subsequent to the making 
of the application. 

[Explanation : For the purposes of clause (iv), "reasonable 
period" shall be construed as a period not ordinarily exceeding 
a period of six months.] 

(7) For the purposes of this Chapter, the reasonable 
requirements of the public shall be deemed not to have been 
satisfied-

(a) if, by reason of the refusal of the patentee to grant a licence 
or licences on reasonable terms,-

(i) an existing trade or industry or the development thereof or 
the establishment of any new trade or industry in India or the 
trade or industry in India or the trade or industry of any person 
or class of persons trading or manufacturing in India is 
prejudiced; or (ii) the demand for the patented article has not 
been met to an adequate extent or on reasonable terms; or 

(iii) a market for export of the patented article manufactured in 
India is not being supplied or developed; or 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 40 of 90 

(iv) the establishment or development of commercial activities 
in India is prejudiced; or 

(b) if, by reason of conditions imposed by the patentee upon the 
grant of licences under the patent or upon the purchase, hire or 
use of the patented article or process, the manufacture, use or 
sale of materials not protected by the patent, or the 
establishment or development of any trade or industry in India, 
is prejudiced; or 

(c) if the patentee imposes a condition upon the grant of 
licences under the patent to provide exclusive grant back, 
prevention to challenges to the validity of patent or coercive 
package licensing; or 

(d) if the patented invention is not being worked in the territory 
of India on a commercial scale to an adequate extent or is not 
being so worked to the fullest extent that is reasonably 
practicable; or 

(e) if the working of the patented invention in the territory of 
India on a commercial scale is being prevented or hindered by 
the importation from abroad of the patented article by-

(i) the patentee or persons claiming under him; or 

(ii) persons directly or indirectly purchasing from him; 
or 

(iii) other persons against whom the patentee is not 
taking or has not taken proceedingsfor infringement.

Terms and conditions of compulsory licences. -
(1) In settling the terms and conditions of a licence under 
section 84, the Controller shall endeavour to secure-


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 41 of 90 

(i) that the royalty and other remuneration, if any, reserved to 
the patentee or other person beneficially entitled to the patent, 
is reasonable, having regard to the nature of the invention, the 
expenditure incurred by the patentee in making the invention or 
in developing it and obtaining a patent and keeping it in force 
and other relevant factors; 

(ii) that the patented invention is worked to the fullest extent by 
the person to whom the licence is granted and with reasonable 
profit to him; 

(iii) that the patented articles are made available to the public 
at reasonably affordable prices; 

(iv) that the licence granted is a non-exclusive licence; 

(v) that the right of the licensee is non-assignable; 

(vi) that the licence is for the balance term of the patent unless 
a shorter term is consistent with public interest; 

179 [(vii) that the licence is granted with a predominant purpose 
of supply in the Indian market and that the licensee may also 
export the patented product, if need be in accordance with the 
provisions of sub-clause (iii) of clause (a) of sub-section (7) of 
section 84; 

(viii) that in the case of semi-conductor technology, the licence 
granted is to work the invention for public non-commercial use; 

(ix) that in case the licence is granted to remedy a practice 
determined after judicial or administrative process to be anti-
competitive, the licensee shall be permitted to export the 
patented product, if need be.] 

(2) No licence granted by the Controller shall authorise the 
licensee to import the patented article or an article or 
substance made by a patented process from abroad where such 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 42 of 90 

importation would, but for such authorisation, constitute an 
infringement of the rights of the patentee. 

(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), the 
Central Government may, if in its opinion it is necessary so to 
do, in the public interest, direct the Controller at any time to 
authorise any licensee in respect of a patent to import the 
patented article or an article or substance made by a patented 
process from abroad (subject to such conditions as it considers 
necessary to impose relating among other matters to the royalty 
and other remuneration, if any, payable to the patentee, the 
quantum of import, the sale price of the imported article and 
the period of importation), and thereupon the Controller shall 
give effect to the directions.

TRIPS-Relevant provisions 

50. The relevant TRIPS provisions are extracted below: 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 44 of 90 

"Article 30 

Exceptions to Rights Conferred 

Members may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive 
rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do 
not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the 
patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate 
interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate 
interests of third parties.‖ 

Emergence of the research exception 

51. Much before the evolution of the Bolar doctrine (through the decision 

in Roche) non-commercial, academic research of the art underlying a patent, 

or the determination of the use of the patent, was recognized. Thus, for 

instance in Whittemore v Cutter, 29 F. Cas. 1120, 1121 (No. 17,600) (C.C.D. 

Mass. 1813) Justice Joseph Story articulated the principle as follows: 

"[i]t could never have been the intention of the legislature to 
punish a man who constructed such a machine merely for 
philosophical experiments, or for the purpose of ascertaining 
the sufficiency of the machine to produce its described effects." 

52. The next phase in the development of this branch was in Roche where 

the patentee plaintiff Roche Products, Inc. (Roche), a large research-oriented 

pharmaceutical company, wanted the United States district court to enjoin 

Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. (Bolar), a manufacturer of generic drugs, 

from taking, during the life of a patent, the statutory and regulatory steps 

necessary to market, after the patent expired, a drug equivalent to a patented 

brand name drug. Roche argued that the use of a patented drug for federally 

mandated premarketing tests is a use in violation of the patent laws. The 

district court recognized that the issue in the case was narrow: did limited 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 45 of 90 

use of a patented drug for testing and investigation strictly related to FDA 

drug approval requirements during the last 6 months of a patent"s term 

constitute a use which, unless licensed, was infringement. The district court 

held that it was not an infringement. The Federal Circuit Appellate court 

reversed the trial court"s order, holding that: 

-Bolar may intend to perform "experiments," but unlicensed 
experiments conducted with a view to the adoption of the 
patented invention to the experimentor's business is a violation 
of the rights of the patentee to exclude others from using his 
patented invention. It is obvious here that it is a misnomer to 
call the intended use de minimis. It is no trifle in its economic 
effect on the parties even if the quantity used is small. It is no 
dilettante affair such as Justice Story envisioned. We cannot 
construe the experimental use rule so broadly as to allow a 
violation of the patent laws in the guise of "scientific inquiry," 
when that inquiry has definite, cognizable, and not 
insubstantial commercial purposes.‖ 

53. Soon after this judgment, the US Congress enacted a law permitting 

use of patented products in experiments for the purpose of obtaining Food 

and Drug Administration (FDA) approval [Section 271(e)(1)]. This 

provision, known as the research exemption, consolidated the Bolar research 

exception articulated by the US District Court, which was reversed in the 

Federal Circuit decision. The new provision (Section 271 (e)(i)) reads as 

follows: 

-(e) (1)It shall not be an act of infringement to make, use, offer 
to sell , or sell within the United States or import into the 
United States a patented invention (other than a new animal 
drug or veterinary biological product (as those terms are used 
in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Act 
of March 4, 1913) which is primarily manufactured using 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 46 of 90 

recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA, hybridoma technology, 
or other processes involving site specific genetic manipulation 
techniques) solely for uses reasonably related to the 
development and submission of information under a Federal 
law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs or 
veterinary biological products.‖ 

54. It is noticeable that the provision does not expressly enable 

development and submission of information under a law other than a 

-Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs or 

veterinary biological products‖ implying that the use of the patented 

invention in relation to regulatory approval abroad was not authorized. Yet, 

in Intermedics, Ventritex used the clinical trial data obtained under the 

protection of Section 271(e)(1) to solicit money to fund further clinical trials 

after the patent term expired; Ventritex also used this data to obtain patent 

rights in other countries. The court noted that an otherwise infringing 

activity is exempt if: 

-It [would] have been reasonable, objectively, for a party in 
defendant's situation to believe that there was a decent prospect 
that the "use" in question would contribute (relatively directly) 
to the generation of kinds of information that was likely to be 
relevant in the processes by which the FDA would decide 
whether to approve the product.‖ 

55. The court, therefore, held that Ventritex's uses did not infringe the 

patent, and the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's decision, 

suggesting that Congress intended that Section271(e)(1) be used to shelter 

all products seeking FDA approval, regardless of their projected 

commercialization date. 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 47 of 90 

56. In Merck KGaA v. Integra Lifesciences Ltd., 545 U.S. 193, 200 

(2005), the US Supreme Court had the occasion to consider the experimental 

exception. Integra owned several patents, including a "short tri-peptide 

segment of fibronectin" with the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Arg, known 

as the RGD peptide. The defendant, Merck hired one Dr. Cheresh, a scientist 

at a research institute, to investigate compounds with the same receptor 

blocking capability as the RGD peptides. Integra offered to license their 

patents to Merck, which declined the offer. Integra sued Merck, Scripps, and 

Dr. Cheresh for patent infringement. The district court rejected the 

defendant"s research exception based argument. This ruling was affirmed by 

the Federal Circuit court, which held that: 

"the Scripps work sponsored by Merck was not clinical testing 
to supply information to the FDA, but only general biomedical 
research to identify new pharmaceutical compounds." 

57. The US Supreme Court judgment unanimously reversed the Federal 

Circuit judgment and disapproved the narrow interpretation of the 

experimental use provision, stating that: 

"as an initial matter, we think it apparent from the statutory text 
that  §271(e)(1)'s exemption from infringement extends to all 
uses of patented inventions that are reasonably related to the 
development and submission of any information under the 
FDCA." 

58. The Supreme Court further said 

"this [information] necessarily includes preclinical studies of 
patented compounds that are appropriate for submission to the 
FDA in the regulatory process." 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 48 of 90 

And that to construe  § 271(e)(1) what the Federal Circuit did: 

"is effectively to limit assurance of exemption to the activities 
necessary to seek approval of a generic drug.‖ 

59. In Japan, acts relating to the marketing approval of pharma products 

were deemed by the Supreme Court covered by its Patents law"s 

experimentation exception. In a unanimous decision, the court in Ono 

Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. v Kyoto Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd 1999 (30) 

IIC 448, held that tests during the patent term for obtaining data needed for 

regulatory approval were not infringing acts, under section 69(1) of the 

Japanese Patent law. 

60. In the UK, the experimental use exception followed an unusual 

trajectory of development. The experimental use exemption was inserted by 

Section 60(5)(b) of the Patents Act 1977. This is still in force and it applies 

to all patent subject matter, including medicines, medical devices and 

agrochemicals. In Monsanto v Stauffer 1985 RPC 515, the defendants 

sought the modification to an injunction that had been ordered against the 

manufacture and sale of their Touchdown herbicide for agricultural use. The 

Court of Appeal permitted limited modifications to the injunction so that it 

did not prevent the defendants from conducting experiments on Touchdown 

in laboratories or glasshouses in the UK to find out more about it. But the 

court did not permit field trials for the purpose of commercial clearance from 

the Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme and approval from the Agricultural 

Chemicals Approval Scheme (that existed under legislation at the time). 

Explaining, where the line is to be drawn between exempted and non-


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 49 of 90 

exempted experiments under the Original Experimental Use Exemption, the 

court stated: 

-Trials 
carried 
out 
in 
order 
to 
discover 
something unknown, or to test an hypothesis, or even in 
order to find out whether something which is known to 
work in specific conditions, e.g. of soil or weather, will 
work in different conditions can fairly … be regarded as 
experiments. But trials carried out in order to demonstrate 
to a third party that a product works or, in order to amass 
information to satisfy a third party, whether a customer or 
a [regulatory] body such as the PSPS or ACAS, that the 
product works as its maker claims are not to be regarded 
as acts done for 'experimental purposes'‖ 

61. Exempted experiments therefore, are those that generate new 

knowledge, but not those that verifying existing knowledge, for example for 

getting regulatory clearance. The later decision of the Court of Appeal in 

Auchinclossv Agricultural and Veterinary Supplies and Others [1999] 

RPC 397 is in line with this, as it holds that making and experimenting with 

a patented invention merely for the purposes of gaining official approval 

would not fall within the Original Experimental Use Exemption. The facts of 

the Auchincloss case again concern agrochemicals: a sample of a dry water-

soluble biocidal composition sent by the defendant to MAFF, the old 

Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Here, the Court of Appeal held 

that supplying a sample to MAFF in order to obtain official approval rather 

than to discover something unknown or to test a hypothesis, was not covered 

by the exemption. The UK courts thus distinguish between application of the 

experimental use exemption to activity conducted for the purpose of 

discovering something new (about the subject matter of the invention), and

mere verification of what is already known. If trials and tests on a substance 

for regulatory approval of that substance are not discovering something new, 

the exemption is inapplicable. It is accepted that this is the case as regards 

bioequivalence studies for an abridged application -they cannot be 

protected; there is also lack of clarity that full clinical trials would be 

protected. 

62. The new exemption was enacted in the wake of concerns that the UK 

was losing opportunities to conduct work in support of getting marketing 

authorizations, such as trials, because of the limited UK Bolar Exemption. It 

is therefore concerned specifically with medicinal products. This new 

Exemption came into force on 01.10.2014, by way of addition to the 

Original Exemption. However, as stated above, the Original Experimental 

Use Exemption and the Bolar Exemption, remain intact. A medicinal product 

assessment is defined as 

"any testing, course of testing or other activity undertaken with 
a view to providing data for purposes which include the 
following: 

 obtaining or varying an authorisation to sell or supply, 
or offer to sell or supply, a medicinal product (whether 
in the United Kingdom or elsewhere); 
 complying with any regulatory requirement imposed 
(whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) in 
relation to such an authorisation; 
 enabling a government or public authority (whether in 
the United Kingdom or elsewhere), or a person 
(whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) with 
functions of-
 providing health care on behalf of such a government 
or public authority, 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 51 of 90 

63. Therefore, in addition to activities covered by the Bolar Exemption, 

the preparation and running of clinical trials on innovative drugs for 

marketing authorisation are also exempt. Furthermore, work undertaken in 

the UK in support of a regulatory filing in a country outside of the EU is also 

now covered. 

64. The statutory exemption to infringement under Canadian law is 

embodied in Section 55.2(1) of its Patent Act which provides that: 

-It is not an infringement of a patent for any person to 
make, construct, use or sell the patented invention solely 
for uses reasonably related to the development and 
submission of information required under any law of 
Canada, a province or a country other than Canada that 
regulates the manufacture, construction, use or sale of any 
product.‖ 

65. This provision concerns activities relating to the development and 

submission of information required by a regulatory body. The Canadian 

provision is agnostic and sector neutral, in that it concerns with regulatory 

approval for inventions in all areas of technology and is not restricted to 

pharmaceuticals. The disputes before the Canadian courts are primarily in 

the pharmaceutical area, most often in the context of generic manufacturers 

performing tests in respect of a patented drug. Also, this provision relates to 

information that may be required by a regulatory body anywhere (and not 

just in Canada). 

66. A leading Canadian decision, Merck et al. v. Apotex (2006) FCA 

323, (Federal Court of Appeal), was in the context of a generic drug 

development. The court held that the defendant prepared and tested the 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 52 of 90 

patented Lisinopril drug for the purposes of filing abbreviated new drug 

submissions necessary to sell Lisinopril in Canada and the USA. Some of 

the data was referenced in Apotex's submissions, directed to that purpose. 

Apotex also had stored samples in the event that they were required for 

future reference by the government. The court held that Section 55.2(1) was 

broad enough to exempt such generic drug development activities from 

infringement. The safe-harbour provision can protect activities reasonably 

related to development and submission of information required by law, 

either before or after market approval. The court also found that Apotex's 

use of Lisinopril in ongoing research and development of alternate 

formulations and alternate techniques for tablet-making fell within 

the common law exemption to infringement. This was because they did not 

proceed beyond an experimental (testing) phase and did not take steps to 

manufacture, promote and sell the product. 

67. In the opinion of the court, the course of the experimental exception-

both before and after the TRIPS has shown the adoption, generally of a 

broad approach, to permit use of all kinds. Broadly, the courts" approach has 

been not to enjoin or prohibit purely experimental or scientific activity, as 

long as it does not have any primary commercial undertones. 

Legislative history of Section 107A 

68. Curiously, predating Section 107A the Indian Parliament had enacted 

a research exception, Section 47 which stated, inter alia,[by Section 47 (3)] 

that: 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 53 of 90 

"47. Grant of patents to be subject to certain conditions.-The 
grant of a patent under this Act shall be subject to the condition 
that-
***** 
(3) any machine, apparatus or other article in respect of which 
the patent is granted or any article made by the use of the 
process in respect of which the patent is granted, may be made 
or used, and any process in respect of which the patent is 
granted may be used, by any person, or the purpose merely of 
experiment or research including the imparting of instructions 
to pupils…‖ 

69. This provision has been retained in the statute book. This was 

suggested by the committee, constituted in 1957, under the chairmanship of 

Justice N. Rajagopala Ayyangar to take a fresh look at patent law to suggest 

the best way to best sub-serve the contemporary needs of India. Justice 

Ayyangar"s Report on Patent Law Revision of September 1959 was the basis 

of the Patents Act, 1970. The report noticed that the right of researchers, to 

use the invention -whether it be an article or a process -for the purposes of 

carrying out experiments -in the course of research, as distinguished from 

use for a commercial purpose is one matter in connection with the right of 

patentees had to be clarified. In this connection, while taking note of the 

uncertainty of the law on this topic in the U.K., Justice Ayyangar took the 

view that: 

"I consider it desirable that the law should specifically exempt 
use of the patented articles or processes or the use of articles or 
products made by the use of the patented process or patented 
machine or apparatus for experimental purposes from being 
actionable as an infringement." 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 54 of 90 

70. The amendment of 1999 to the Patents Act was pre-dated by a report 

of the Joint Parliamentary Committee. It recommended introduction of a 

Bolar exemption provision. The report explained the reason for Clause 51 

(which was to be the amendment): 

-Clause 51: this clause seeks to insert a new Section 107A in 
the principal Act, relating to certain acts which are not to be 
considered as infringement. This provision has been made to 
ensure prompt availability of products, particularly generic 
drugs, immediately after the expiry of the term of the patent. 
The amendment in this clause has been made to make a 
provision in consonance with the Bolar Provisions at the global 
level. The other amendment in this clause is correction of a 
typographical error.‖ 

71. The Notes on clauses, amending the Act, through the Bill reads as 

follows: 

"this clause seeks to insert a new section 107A in the Act, 
relating to certain acts which are not to be considered 
infringements. It is proposed that the act of making or using a 
patented product for the purpose of development and 
submission of information to a regulatory authority regulating 
marketing approval of the product, shall not constitute an 
infringement. This provision is proposed to ensure that generic 
drug should be available in Indian market immediately after the 
expiry of the term of the concerned patents.‖ 

72. The Patents (Second Amendment) Bill, 1999 reads as follows: 

-After section 107 of the principal Act. the following section 
shall be inserted, namely: 

Clause 51. After section 107 of the principal act, the following 
section shall be inserted, namely 

-107A For the purposes of this Act,-


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 55 of 90 

(a) 

Any act of making or using a patented invention within 
three years before the expiry of the term of the patent by any 
person for the purpose of development and submission of the 
information to any regulatory authority responsible for grant of 
marketing approval for the product of invention.‖ 

73. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons (introducing the Amending 

Act), it was stated that: 

-4. Some of the salient features of the Bill are…. 
-(h) to make a provision enabling persons other than patent 
holder to obtain marketing approval from the appropriate 
regulatory authorities within three years before the expiration 
of the term of the patent‖ 

74. Eventually, the Patents Amendment Act of 2002 was enacted; it stated 

as follows: 

-44. After section 107 of the Principal Act, the following 
section shall be inserted namely, 

107A: For the purposes of this Act 

(a) Any act of making, constructing, using or selling a patented 
invention solely for uses reasonably related to the development 
and submission of information required under any law for the 
time being in force, in India or in a country other than India, 
that regulates the manufacture, construction, use or sale of any 
product‖ 

75. The Patent (Amendment) Bill, 2003 proposed insertion of the 

expression "import" as follows: 

-107A: For the purposes of this Act 

(a) any act of making, constructing, using selling or importing 
a patented invention solely for uses reasonably related to the 
development and submission of information required under any 
law for the time being in force, in India or in a country other 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 56 of 90 

than India, that regulates the manufacture, construction, use or 
sale of any product‖ 

76. Eventually, the Patents Amendment Act, 2005 which proposed the 

amendment in its present form, was enacted; it reads as follows: 

-107A: For the purposes of this Act 

(a) any act of making, constructing, using selling or importing a 
patented invention solely for uses reasonably related to the 
development and submission of information required under any 
law for the time being in force, in India or in a country other 
than India, that regulates the manufacture, construction, use or 
sale or import of any product‖ 

77. These stages in the amendment of the Act and the introduction of 

India"s Bolar exemption demonstrate that Parliament took a careful and 

nuanced view of the matter; it also had the benefit of provisions enacted in 

other countries, including the US and Canadian law. 

A Interpretation of "sale" and whether it encompasses "exports" 

78. Rival arguments were addressed with respect to the expression "sale" 

and whether it comprehends "export". Bayer contended that the use of "sale" 

along with "import" excluded the term "export" from the meaning of the 

expression "sale" which is otherwise wide. In aid of this, it was contended 

that Section 84 and Section 92A used the term "export" expressly and that, 

given this clear internal clue from the statute, the court should not accept 

Natco"s contention that an export transaction is covered by sale. According 

to Bayer, the learned single judge erred in writing into the statute an 

expression which was omitted by resorting to an over liberal interpretation of 

a causus omissius. A third argument made was that only those extra-

territorial aspects which have an impact or nexus with India and are enacted 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 57 of 90 

with the intent of creating some benefit for India would fall within the 

constitutionally sanctioned idea of legislative competence; since none can be 

said to accrue to India, the term "export" should not be read into the 

expression "sell". Lastly it was argued that Section 107A is in the nature of a 

proviso or exception to Section 48, which defines the content and rights of a 

patentee and that the court should, consistent with the interpretation of any 

proviso, ensure that it is kept within the bounds of what is sought to be 

excepted. Natco disputed each of these contentions, urging that "sell" should 

not be juxtaposed with other provisions which expressly talk of export and 

that the court should consider the context of Section 84 and Section 92A the 

underlying purposes of which are entirely different from Section 107A. It 

was highlighted that the references to "other country" in Section 107A 

would be meaningless if export is not construed to be part of "sell" and that 

an export is but a species of sale. Also, Natco relied on the term "construct" 

occurring in Section 107A and stated that the use of "sell" "import" and 

"construct" permit all range of transactions and uses covered by the 

provision. It was contended that considerations of extra territorial impact of 

any provision do not arise. Lastly it was urged that Section 107A -in its 

placement and having regard to its legislative history is clearly not an 

exception or proviso, but a special provision which must be given full 

meaning and effect. 

79. Two clear strands of reasoning have prevailed in various judgments of 

the Supreme Court, while interpreting the meaning and purport of general 

words. One, that plain and natural meaning should be preferred ordinarily, 

and two, that the context and purpose of the provision should always be kept 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 58 of 90 

in mind. Thus, in Polestar Electronic (Pvt.) Ltd. v Additional Commissioner, 

Sales Tax and Anr. (1978) 1 SCC 636, it was held: 

-11. ... If the language of a statute is clear and explicit, effect 
must be given to it, for in such a case the words best declare the 
intention of the law-giver. It would not be right to refuse to place 
on the language of the statute the plain and natural meaning 
which it must bear on the ground that it produces a consequence 
which could not have been intended by the legislature. It is only 
from the language of the statute that the intention of the 
Legislature must be gathered, for the legislature means no more 
and no less than what it says. It is not permissible to the Court to 
speculate as to what the Legislature must have intended and 
then to twist or bend the language of the statute to make it 
accord with the presumed intention of the legislature. ...‖ 

80. Central Bank of India v State of Kerala and Ors. (2009) 4 SCC 94, a 

three-Judge Bench judgment, quoted Professor H.A. Smith (as quoted in 

Justice G.P. Singh"s Principles of Statutory Interpretation) to the following 

effect: 

-'No word', says Professor H.A. Smith 'has an absolute 
meaning, for no words can be defined in vacuo, or without 
reference to some context'. According to Sutherland there is a 
'basic fallacy' in saying 'that words have meaning in and of 
themselves', and 'reference to the abstract meaning of words', 
states Craies, 'if there be any such thing, is of little value in 
interpreting statutes'. ... in determining the meaning of any word 
or phrase in a statute the first question to be asked is -'What is 
the natural or ordinary meaning of that word or phrase in its 
context in the statute? It is only when that meaning leads to 
some result which cannot reasonably be supposed to have been 
the intention of the legislature, that it is proper to look for some 
other possible meaning of the word or phrase.' The context, as 
already seen, in the construction of statutes, means the statute as 
a whole, the previous state of the law, other statutes in pari 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 59 of 90 

materia, the general scope of the statute and the mischief that it 
was intended to remedy.‖ 

81. Speaking of the use of an expression or term in different parts of a 

statute, the court held in Central Bank of India v Ravindra & Ors. (2002) 1 

SCC 36 that: 

-42. ...Ordinarily, a word or expression used at several places 
in one enactment should be assigned the same meaning so as to 
avoid "a head-on clash" between two meanings assigned to the 
same word or expression occurring at two places in the same 
enactment. It should not be lightly assumed that "Parliament 
had given with one hand what it took away with the other" (see 
Principles of Statutory Interpretation, Justice G.P. Singh, 7th 
Edn. 1999, p. 113). That construction is to be rejected which 
will introduce uncertainty, friction or confusion into the 
working of the system (ibid, p. 119). While embarking upon 
interpretation of words and expressions used in a statute it is 
possible to find a situation when the same word or expression 
may have somewhat different meaning at different places 
depending on the subject or context. This is however an 
exception which can be resorted to only in the event of 
repugnancy in the subject or context being spelled out. It has 
been the consistent view of the Supreme Court that when the 
legislature used same word or expression in different parts of 
the same section or statute, there is a presumption that the 
word is used in the same sense throughout (ibid, p. 263). More 
correct statement of the rule is, as held by the House of Lords 
in Farrell v. Alexander All ER at p. 736b, "where the draftsman 
uses the same word or phrase in similar contexts, he must be 
presumed to intend it in each place to bear the same meaning". 
The court having accepted invitation to embark upon 
interpretative expedition shall identify on its radar the 
contextual use of the word or expression and then determine its 
direction avoiding collision with icebergs of inconsistency and 
repugnancy.‖ 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 60 of 90 

82. It is, therefore, clear that whilst there is one rule generally speaking, 

use of a term or expression in a statute, carries upon it to be interpreted in the 

same manner in all provisions of that statute, the rule is neither inflexible 

admitting no exception nor of universal application. The object of the 

concerned provision is one of the important factors which weigh in while 

interpreting whether the same meaning has to be attributed to all parts of the 

statute. Given these circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that "exports" 

is used in different contexts in Sections 84, 90 and 92A. Section 84 is the 

provision which enables compulsory licensing of certain conditions. Section 

84(7) spells out what are reasonable requirements of the public. These are 

deemed not to have been satisfied if under Section 84(7)(a)(iii), a market for 

the patented article manufactured in India is not being supplied or developed. 

Section 90(1)(vii) is in a sense, complimentary to Section 84 and has to be 

read with it: it guides the Controller to ensure inter alia that the license 

granted under Section 84(7)(a)(c)(iii) is with the predominant purpose of 

supply to the Indian market and that the licensee may also export the 

patented product. 

83. Section 92A is a species of compulsory license. The principles in one 

sense are even an exception to it. The provision dealing with compulsory 

licensing [Section 84] is concerned only with the availability of patented 

market, of reasonable terms for users in India. Therefore, the question of 

reasonable requirements of other countries does not arise and yet the 

Parliament, in keeping with TRIPS, (cognizant of the broad classification of 

nations as developed, developing and least developed countries), envisioned 

Section 92A which enables licensing for export of patented pharmaceutical 

products in exceptional circumstances, i.e. whether the country concerned 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 61 of 90 

has insufficient or no manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector. 

Really speaking, this provision, i.e. Section 92A constitutes an exception to 

the general rule that compulsory licensing is only resorted primarily and 

predominantly to cater to the needs of the domestic market of the host 

country with regard also being had to export potential from that country. 

84. Having regard to all these factors, it cannot be held that the Parliament 

intended to per se exclude "exports" from the sweep and width of the term 

"sale" in Section 107A regard being had to the disparate and differing 

objectives of Sections 84, 90 and 92A all of which in some way or the other 

primarily deal with compulsory licensing and on the other hand, Section 

107A is the only provision that allows an exception to be used-construction 

and sale of a patented article only for research purposes and subject to 

fulfillment of the conditions specified therein. The next argument which 

Bayer strongly advanced with respect to exclusion of exports from the term 

"sale" is that patent rights are territorial in nature, specific allusion was made 

to Section 48 in this regard. Elaborating, it was contended that the grant of a 

patent constitutes a negative right to prevent third parties from making, 

using, forwarding for sale, selling or importing the patented product in India. 

Secondly, it was urged that the research exception, can be accepted, and 

needs to be carried out in India if the benefit of that provision is to be 

secured. 

85. It was submitted that Section 107A(a) really constitutes an exception 

and its effect has to be strictly confined to the extent the terms of the 

expression spelt out and no more. Reliance was placed upon Mohan Kumar 

Singhania v UOI AIR 1992 SC 1. There are a line of judgments which state 

that a particular provision of an enactment cannot be said to nullify or set at 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 62 of 90 

nought the main or substantive provision. In Dwarka Prasad v Dwarka Das 

Saraf 1976 (1) SCC 128, it was stated as follows: 

-18. We may mention in fairness to Counsel that the following, 
among other decisions, were cited at the Bar bearing on the 
uses of provisos in statutes: CIT v. Indo-Mercantile Bank Ltd., 
AIR 1959 SC 713]; Ram Narain Sons Ltd. v. Asstt. (1955) 2 
SCR 483, 493:]; Thompson v. Dibdin [(1912) AC 533, 541; Rex 
v. Dibdin [1910 Pro Div 57, 119, 125] and Tahsildar Singh v. 
State of U.P. AIR 1959 Supp (2) SCR 875,]. The law is trite. A 
proviso must be limited to the subject-matter of the enacting 
clause. It is a settled Rule of construction that a proviso must 
prima facie be read and considered in relation to the principal 
matter to which it is a proviso. It is not a separate or 
independent enactment. "Words are dependent on the principal 
enacting words to which they are tacked as a proviso. They 
cannot be read as divorced from their context" 
(Thompson v. Dibdin, 1912 AC 533). If the Rule of construction 
is that prima facie a proviso should be limited in its operation 
to the subject-matter of the enacting clause, the stand we have 
taken is sound. To expand the enacting clause, inflated by the 
proviso, sins against the fundamental Rule of construction that 
a proviso must be considered in relation to the principal matter 
to which it stands as a proviso. A proviso ordinarily is but a 
proviso, although the golden Rule is to read the whole section, 
inclusive of the proviso, in such manner that they mutually 
throw light on each other and result in a harmonious 
construction. 

The proper course is to apply the broad general Rule of 
construction which is that a Section or enactment must be 
construed as a whole, each portion throwing light if need be on 
the rest. 

The true principle undoubtedly is, that the sound interpretation 
and meaning of the statute, on a view of the enacting clause, 
saving clause, and proviso, taken and construed together is to 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 63 of 90 

prevail.(Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Edn., p. 
162)‖ 

86. In S. Sundaram Pillai v V.R. Pattabiraman1985 (1) SCC 591, it was 

held that: 

"27. The next question that arises for consideration is as to 
what is the scope of a proviso and what is the ambit of an 
Explanation either to a proviso or to any other statutory 
provision. We shall first take up the question of the nature, 
scope and extent of a proviso. The well-established Rule of 
interpretation of a proviso is that a proviso may have three 
separate functions. Normally, a proviso is meant to be an 
exception to something within the main enactment or to qualify 
something enacted therein which but for the proviso would be 
within the purview of the enactment. In other words, a proviso 
cannot be torn apart from the main enactment nor can it be 
used to nullify or set at naught the real object of the main 
enactment.(Emphasis supplied)‖ 

87. Likewise, in J.K. Industries Ltd. v Chief Inspector of Factories and 

Boilers 1996 (6) SCC 665, it was held as follows: 

-33. A proviso to a provision in a statute has several functions 
and while interpreting a provision of the statute, the court is 
required to carefully scrutinise and find out the real object of 
the proviso appended to that provision. It is not a proper Rule 
of interpretation of a proviso that the enacting part or the main 
part of the Section be construed first without reference to the 
proviso and if the same is found to be ambiguous only then 
recourse may be had to examine the proviso as has been 
canvassed before us. On the other hand an accepted Rule of 
interpretation is that a Section and the proviso thereto must be 
construed as a whole, each portion throwing light, if need be, 
on the rest. A proviso is normally used to remove special cases 
from the general enactment and provide for them specially. 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 64 of 90 

34. A proviso qualifies the generality of the main enactment 
by providing an exception and taking out from the main 
provision, a portion, which, but for the proviso would be a part 
of the main provision. A proviso must, therefore, be considered 
in relation to the principal matter to which it stands as a 
proviso. A proviso should not be read as if providing something 
by way of addition to the main provision which is foreign to the 
main provision itself. 
(Emphasis supplied)‖ 

88. In the present case, this court notices that Section 107A is not made 

subject to the other provisions of the Act -on the other hand, Section 48, 

which talks of the rights of a patent holder is subject to other provisions of 

the Act that includes Section 107A. Furthermore, Bayer"s argument that 

Section 107A constitutes an exception, cannot be accepted. It is an 

independent provision with a specific history behind it and was subject to 

intensive Parliamentary debate and scrutiny by a Joint Committee report. 

Furthermore, it was enacted in response to the TRIPS enabling provision to 

the member countries to evolve national legislation facilitating research and 

progress in fields covered by the patents. The judgments cited, all generally 

and invariably contended by Bayer deal with provisos embodied in the main 

provision that constituted exceptions to the general rule. However, in this 

case, the court is not called upon to interpret the proviso to Section 48; nor 

even an exception. Bayer"s argument that Section 107A has to be read as 

subordinate to the main provision of Section 48 has to, therefore, fail. This 

Court is also fortified in its conclusions. In Indian Oil Corporation v the 

Chief Inspector of Factories and Ors. (1998) 5 SCC 738, the Supreme Court 

had to decide whether one of the Directors only could recognise his occupier 

and whether Section 2(n)(iii) of the Factories Act, 1948, applied to the IOC"s 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 65 of 90 

factories and if it was open to the Central Government to nominate any 

person other than the Director or the occupier. Section 2(n) was amended to 

say that "occupier" meant the person who had ultimate control over the 

affairs of the factory and also that in the case of firms or associations; and as 

to who could be occupiers in the case of firms and association in the case of 

company (any of the Directors) and in the case of factory owned by the 

Central Government, "person or persons nominated to manage the affairs of 

the factory by the State Government, Central Government etc.‖. Prior to the 

amendment, the "occupier" did not include the specific designated officials 

or employees of the company or firms. The Supreme Court held that the 

requirement of third proviso could really constitute a separate provision, and 

had to be read as such. The Supreme Court held as follows: 

-20. Apart from the main part of Section 2(n), the first proviso 
also indicates that the Legislature intended that the person 
having ultimate control over the affairs of the factory has to be 
regarded as occupier of the factory. The proviso to the Section 
is not in the nature of an exception. In order to avoid any 
ambiguity, to plug loopholes and to seal the escape routes a 
deeming provision has been made in a mandatory form. In the 
case of a firm obviously the partners of the firm have ultimate 
control over the affairs of the partnership. In case of other type 
of association the members thereof will have such control. In 
the case of a company the directors have the ultimate control, 
as the power to manage the affairs of the company vests in the 
Board of Directors. What clauses (i) and (ii) of the proviso 
provide is that they shall be deemed to be 'occupiers'. Thus they 
merely restate the position which is obvious even otherwise. 
The position of the government and the local authority is quite 
different from that of a firm or an association or a company not 
only with respect to the person who can be said to be in 
ultimate control but also with respect to the object for which 
factory is set up. In a democratic set-up of Government, it may 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 66 of 90 

not be possible to say with certainty as to who is having the 
ultimate control. In a welfare state, the government does not 
carry on such activity for its own profit or benefit but for the 
benefit of the people as a whole. Moreover, it is the government 
which looks after the successful implementation of the 
provisions of the Factories Act and, therefore, it is not likely to 
evade implementation of the beneficial provisions of the 
Factories Act. That appears to be the reason why the 
legislature though it fit to make a separate provision for the 
Government and the local authorities. Ordinarily, for running 
the factories owned or controlled by the Central Government or 
any State Government, or any local authority, a person or 
persons would be appointed by it to manage the affairs of the 
factory, because the Government or the local authority as a 
whole would not run the factory. Therefore, the legislature 
appears to have provided that in case of a factory owned or 
controlled by the Central Government, the State Government or 
the local authority the person or persons appointed to manage 
the affairs of the factory by the Central Government, State 
Government or the local authority, as the case may be, shall be 
deemed to be the occupier. Therefore, if it is a case of a factory 
in fact and in reality owned or controlled by the Central 
Government or the State Government or any local authority 
then in case of such a factory the person or persons appointed 
to manage the affairs of the factory shall have to be deemed to 
be the occupier, even though for better management of such a 
factory or factories a corporate form is adopted by the 
government. 

21. Before 1987, when Section 100 was the governing 
provision, any one of the individual partners of a firm or any 
one of the members of association of individuals could be 
punished under Sub-section (I) thereof for any offence for 
which the occupier of the factory was punishable. The firm or 
association was given an option to nominate one of its members 
as the occupier of the factory and if such an option was 
exercised by giving a notice to the Inspector then he alone was 
to be deemed to be the occupier of the factory for the said 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 67 of 90 

purpose. Under Sub-section (2) if the occupier of the factory 
was a company then any one of the directors thereof could be 
prosecuted and punished. A similar option was available to the 
company, as in the case of a firm and an association of 
individuals. It is significant to note that it was by way of a 
proviso to Sub-section (2) which dealt with case of a company 
that the provision was made for deciding who should be 
deemed to be the occupier of a factory in case it belonged to the 
Central Government or any State Government or any local 
authority and a similar option is made available to them. The 
said proviso though enacted as an exception to the main part of 
Sub-section (2) is truly by way of a separate provision made in 
the case of a factory belonging to the Central Government or 
any State Government or any local Authority. While making the 
amendment in 1987 in Section 2(n) and deleting Section 100 at 
the same time the Legislature made the proviso to subsection 
(2) of Section 100 an independent proviso to Section 2(n). That 
also clearly indicates the intention of the Legislature that it 
wanted to make a separate provision for deeming who should 
be the occupier of a government factory.‖ 

89. In the light of the above discussion, the court is of the opinion that 

there is no question of treating Section 107A(a) as an exception to Section 

48. Its history of interpretation by TRIPS, the discussion in the 

Parliamentary Joint Committee Report, all clearly point to its being a special 

provision that deals with the rights of the patented invention for research 

purposes. 

90. As far as the question of territoriality is concerned, Bayer"s argument 

is twofold: that the reference to regulatory requirements of other countries 

and its reference to reasonable regulations or laws of other countries, for the 

purpose of development of the product and its making, construction, use or 

sale, is to be understood as meaning that the overseas requirements are to be 

met with through experimental use in India. Explaining further, it is 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 68 of 90 

contended that the reference to overseas or other nations" laws or regulations 

with respect to research requirements is to be understood in such a way that 

information development in India can be exported. 

91. This Court is of the opinion that the interpretation canvassed by Bayer 

is strained and artificial. Once it is held that patented inventions can be sold 

for the purpose of carrying on research which fulfils the regulatory 

requirements of India, there cannot be any bar or an interpretation narrowing 

the scope of such sale. What is important is the purpose of the sale, i.e. 

objective of carrying on experiment, research and developing information (in 

the form of reports, outcomes etc.). If the purpose of the sale is to ultimately 

exploit the patented invention and either work upon it or "work around" or 

work it through research so as to be prepared to apply for the patent for 

approval to market it once the patent tenure ends, there can be no impairment 

of the patentee"s rights. The natural consequence of that sale cannot be 

curtailed by a contrived interpretation to say that it is only information that 

can be sold or exported, not the patented invention. Likewise, the reference 

of another country i.e the export for reasonably complying with the laws of 

another country in relation to the kind of research and experimentation 

needed is something that cannot be dictated by interpretation of Indian law 

alone. It is plausible-even reasonable-that many nations may require 

experimentation or research to be carried on in their soil nationally so as to 

be able to supervise the process and then oversee the outcome. It is, 

therefore, not possible to dictate the behaviour and legal requirements of 

other nations by confining the research exception within the territory of 

India. 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 69 of 90 

92. The natural interpretation of the expression "use" is in all its senses. In 

this context, it would be necessary to recognize that in regard to various 

products, especially those concerning the pharmaceutical, medicinal 

preparations, surgical and diagnostic purposes and those relating to the 

agriculture or bio-chemical sector, it may be critical for a database of 

populations, drugs and co-relation, with disease and its relationship with 

characteristics that are predominantly local. National regimes might well 

insist that such research and experimentation in regard to those aspects be 

either entirely or at least in part be carried on in their territory. In this 

context, therefore, it is held that the expressions, -making, constructing, 

using, selling or importing patented articles solely for uses reasonably 

related to development and submission of information required under any 

law for the time being in force…… or in a country other than India that 

regulates the manufacturing, construction, use, sale or import of any 

product‖, consequently, has to be given a wide import. It is, therefore, open 

that the sale of the article or invention for the purpose of development of 

information in compliance with the reasonable requirements of developing 

countries, solely for purposes of research or development falls within 

Section 107A(a). 

93. There is one more manner of looking at the issue. A patent owner"s 

interests are clearly injured if the invention or the product or the method 

which is the subject matter of the patent is worked for purely commercial 

purposes and the ensuing product is offered in the market. Such products 

would be competitors to the patented invention and because of their copycat 

nature, one can reasonably expect them to be significantly lower in cost, in 

the marketplace. However, in the case of sale, construction or use of the 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 70 of 90 

patented article, either within India or outside the territory of India, the 

question of such injury cannot ordinarily arise if the object or purpose of that 

transaction is solely to experiment or research and develop information that 

is reasonably related to the requirements of the law (Indian or overseas). If 

one considers this aspect, it is clear that the fullest effect ought to be given to 

the research exception embodied in Section 107A(a). The objections with 

regard to the territoriality of patents or the strained interpretation given to the 

provision of construing export (i.e. the export sale) only to sale of 

information overseas, is unwarranted. Bayer"s argument, therefore, is 

rejected on this aspect. 

94. This Court also finds unpersuasive, Bayer"s subsidiary submission that 

Rule 122B of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 permits the licensing 

authority to grant permission (for a product) on the basis of data available 

from other countries. Thus, Bayer"s argument here was that the act of 

importation in Section 107A refers to all such information which can be used 

for regulatory purposes of the research and development in India. Here 

again, the court is of the opinion that the broad nature of the provision -

which enables development and research of the product and information 

related thereto, on fulfilling the regulatory or other legal requirements of 

India, and other countries-cannot be construed narrowly as to permit 

development and research of the product only in India, even though the 

backup research is conducted elsewhere. The object and underlying purpose 

of Drugs and Cosmetics Act is entirely different from those of the Patent 

Act. The former deals with the range of regulatory provisions necessary for 

various classes of drugs to receive licensing, marketing approvals etc. On the 

other hand, the patent regime is premised solely upon the regulation of the 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 71 of 90 

intellectual property right relating to patents. The court is also of the opinion 

that Natco"s status as compulsory licensee did not place it under any 

additional statutory bar from exporting the product, as long as the underlying 

condition in Section 107A was satisfied, as held by the learned Single Judge. 

95. It is therefore, clear that the submissions with respect to 

impermissibility of exportation of the product cannot be accepted. Bayer"s 

arguments are rejected. 

Submissions in respect of the Canada Dispute 

96. Bayer had relied on the Canada Dispute (supra) ruling by the WTO 

DSP. Two important issues in that case involved questions of public policy 

(societal public interest v. private rights). They were permissible exceptions, 

under Articles 30 and 31 of TRIPS, to the use of patented products or 

processes, without permission of the patent-owner (a patentee"s rights are 

detailed in Article 28.1 and 29), having regard to TRIPS principles in 

Articles 7 and 8. The provisions of Canadian Patent Law-i.e. the regulatory 

review exception and the stockpiling exception were challenged by the EU. 

The Regulatory Review Exception, in Section 55.2(1) of Canada"s patent 

law, allows the generic industry without authorization, to develop the 

product and submit it to regulatory authorities for market approval so that 

they could market the product when the patent expires; no permission of the 

patent owner was essential. The stockpiling exception in Section 55.2(2) of 

Canada"s law permitted generic manufacturers to produce and stockpile 

(store) generic products for which marketing approval has been obtained, 

during a six-month period before expiry of the patent, and market the generic 

products as soon as the patent has expired. The first exception (regulatory or 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 72 of 90 

research exception) to patent rights has been held legal, but the stockpiling 

exception was held to be illegal. 

97. Bayer"s argument was that Canada"s plea was that the reference to 

"selling" the invention was necessitated by the fact that a generic drug 

manufacturer had to usually purchase the active ingredient for its product 

from a "fine chemical producer". Bayer relied upon footnote 49 on page 21 

of the award, which reads as follows: 

-In response to a question from the Panel, Canada explained 
that, if the patentee claimed that a fine chemical manufacturer 
was infringing the patent, i.e. was manufacturing fine chemicals 
for purposes which were outside the exception, the patentee 
would commence infringement litigation against the 
manufacturer under Sections 54 and 55 of the Patent Act. The 
manufacturer would then be obliged to prove that it would have 
been reasonable, objectively, for a party in its position to 
believe 
that the use made of its manufactured active 
ingredients related to the development and submission of 
information required by law. It would be common commercial 
practice for the supply contract with the manufacturer to 
specify the purposes for which the chemicals were being 
manufactured and to provide an appropriate indemnity against 
infringement liability. While the matter had not been decided in 
the courts, the effect of the exception of Section 55.2(2) for the 
fine chemical producer would appear to be that a third party 
could acquire intermediate products, or -inputs‖, such as the 
bulk fine chemical constituting the active ingredient of a 
generic drug, for manufacturer and storage during the last six 
months of the patent term. In other words, both the third party 
and manufacturer would appear to be covered by the 
exception.‖ 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 73 of 90 

98. It was submitted that the DSP in its findings stated that "selling" in the 

provision was under challenge. Para 7.4 of the award was also relied on; it 

states that: 

-The structure of the generic pharmaceutical industry 
illustrates the actual operation of the regulatory review 
exception. Production of generic pharmaceuticals often 
involves a two-tier production arrangement. The firm that 
assembles and markets the final generic product often does not 
have the technological capacity/expertise or the commercial 
motivation to produce the so called -active ingredient‖ -the 
chemical product that generates the desired medicinal effect. 
The active ingredient is thus often manufactured by a 
specialized producer of fine chemicals, and then sold to the 
generic producer which assembles the active ingredient with 
other agents to create the final product in a form that can be 
used by the ultimate consumer. In such cases, both producers 
must engage in conduct that, in the absence of a regulatory 
review exception, would be potentially infringing, if they are to 
satisfy the requirements of the regulatory review process -the 
fine chemical producer in developing, making and selling the 
necessary amounts of the active ingredient to the generic 
producer, and the generic producer in combining the various 
elements to make the final product and then demonstrating its 
safety, stability and effectiveness by appropriate tests. The 
regulatory review exception applies to these activities of both 
producers.‖ 

99. In view of these submissions, Bayer argued that Parliament inserted 

the term "selling" in Section 107A(a) with intent to exempt the activities of 

the contract manufactures and any entity selling within the territory of India 

for the purposes as contemplated under the said section. 

100. Several countries, including India, Canada and the US have fashioned 

their patent laws to carve out such an exception. The Canadian provision, 

Section 55.2(1), which enabled use of a patented product for generation of 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 74 of 90 

information to be submitted to regulatory authorities was the subject matter 

of a complaint lodged by the US and Europe at the Dispute Settlement Body 

of the WTO. It was contended that Section 55.2(1) violated TRIPS. 

101. The DSP under TRIPS in the Canada dispute case (supra) discussed 

the issue; it found that such a provision (i.e. Canada"s regulatory exception) 

was a "limited exception" within the meaning of Article 30 of TRIPS, and 

that the size of production would not violate patent rights so long as it is 

solely for regulatory purposes. The DSP flagged the purpose of use in its 

award, relevant portions of which are extracted below: 

-7.3 Because of the regulatory review exception's importance to 
the pharmaceutical industry, the operation of the exception with 
regard to new pharmaceuticals was explained in some detail by the 
parties. Information supplied by Canada in the proceedings before 
the Panel on the process of regulatory approval in Canada for 
patented and generic drugs can be found in paragraphs 2.2 to 2.7 
above and Annexes 3 and 4 to this Report. The information has not 
been contested by the European Communities. Since patent 
applications are generally filed as quickly as possible after the 
invention has been made, actual marketing of the patented product 
is frequently delayed for a certain period of time because time is 
required for development of the product in commercial form, after 
which additional time is required to complete the testing required 
for government approval. According to the information supplied by 
Canada, the process of development of the drug and regulatory 
approval for new patented pharmaceuticals normally takes 
approximately eight to 12 years. The long development and 
approval process means that, for most patented pharmaceuticals, 
the 20-year patent term results in an actual period of market 
exclusivity of only some 12 to eight years. After a pharmaceutical 
patent expires, it is common for other producers to enter the 
market supplying copies of the patented product at lower prices. 
These lower-priced copies, known as "generic" pharmaceuticals, 
often constitute a large part of the supply of pharmaceuticals in 
national markets. Generic pharmaceuticals must also comply with 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 75 of 90 

the government approval process. According to Canada's 
information, for generic producers the process of developing their 
version of the drug and obtaining regulatory approval takes 
approximately three to six-and-a-half years, with development 
taking some two to four years and the regulatory process itself one 
to two-and-a-half years. If none of the development process could 
be performed during the term of the patent, generic producers 
could be forced to wait the full three to six-and-a-half years after 
the patent expires before being able to enter the market in 
competition with the patent owner. To the extent that some 
development activity might be permitted, consistently with Article 
30 of the TRIPS Agreement, under other exceptions such as the 
traditional exception for experimental use of the patented product, 
the delay in entering the market would be correspondingly less. 
The regulatory review exception in Section 55.2(1) would allow 
generic producers to complete both development and regulatory 
approval during the term of the patent, thus allowing them to enter 
the market as soon as the patent expires. 

7.4 The structure of the generic pharmaceutical industry 
illustrates the actual operation of the regulatory review exception. 
Production of generic pharmaceuticals often involves a two-tier 
production arrangement. The firm that assembles and markets the 
final generic product often does not have the technological 
capacity/expertise or the commercial motivation to produce the so-
called "active ingredient" -the chemical product that generates the 
desired medicinal effect. The active ingredient is thus often 
manufactured by a specialized producer of fine chemicals, and 
then sold to the generic producer which assembles the active 
ingredient with other agents to create the final product in a form 
that can be used by the ultimate consumer. In such cases, both 
producers must engage in conduct that, in the absence of a 
regulatory review exception, would be potentially infringing, if 
they are to satisfy the requirements of the regulatory review 
process -the fine chemical producer in developing, making and 
selling the necessary amounts of the active ingredient to the 
generic producer, and the generic producer in combining the 
various elements to make the final product and then demonstrating 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 76 of 90 

its safety, stability and effectiveness by appropriate tests. The 
regulatory review exception applies to these activities of both 
producers. 

7.5 To qualify for exemption under Section 55.2(1), such 
activities by either fine chemical producers or generic producers 
must be "solely for uses reasonably related to the development and 
submission of information required" by any law, Canadian or non-
Canadian, that "regulates the manufacture, construction, use or 
sale of any product". In answer to a question from the Panel, 
Canada stated that, although Canadian marketing regulations for 
generic producers did not require production runs to demonstrate 
the applicant's ability to maintain quality production in 
commercial volumes373, the statute would allow either fine 
chemical manufacturers or generic producers to undertake such 
production runs if they were required by regulations in other 
countries.‖ 

102. Later, in its decision, the DSP held as follows: 

-7.45 In the Panel's view, however, Canada's regulatory review 
exception is a "limited exception" within the meaning of TRIPS 
Article 30. It is "limited" because of the narrow scope of its 
curtailment of Article 28.1 rights. As long as the exception is 
confined to conduct needed to comply with the requirements of the 
regulatory approval process, the extent of the acts unauthorized by 
the right holder that are permitted by it will be small and narrowly 
bounded. Even though regulatory approval processes may require 
substantial amounts of test production to demonstrate reliable 
manufacturing, the patent owner's rights themselves are not 
impaired any further by the size of such production runs, as long 
as they are solely for regulatory purposes and no commercial use 
is made of resulting final products. 

7.46 The Panel found no basis for believing that activities seeking 
product approvals under foreign regulatory procedures would be 
any less subject to these limitations. There is no a priori basis to 
assume that the requirements of foreign regulatory procedures will 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 77 of 90 

require activities unrelated to legitimate objectives of product 
quality and safety, nor has the EC provided any evidence to that 
effect. Nor is there any reason to assume that Canadian law would 
apply the exception in cases where foreign requirements clearly 
had no regulatory purpose. Nor, finally, is there any reason to 
assume that it will be any more difficult to enforce the 
requirements of Canadian law when Canadian producers claim 
exceptions under foreign procedures. With regard to the latter 
point, the Panel concurred with Canada's point that the 
government is not normally expected to regulate the actual 
conduct of third parties in such cases. The enforcement of these 
conditions, as with other enforcement of patent rights, occurs by 
means of private infringement actions brought by the patent owner. 
The patent owner merely has to prove that the challenged conduct 
is inconsistent with the basic patent rights created by national law. 
Once that initial case is made, the burden will be on the party 
accused of infringement to prove its defence by establishing that its 
conduct with respect to foreign regulatory procedures was in 
compliance with the conditions of Section 55.2(1). 
7.47 In reaching this conclusion, the Panel also considered 
Canada's additional arguments that both the negotiating history of 
Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement and the subsequent practices of 
certain WTO Member governments supported the view that Article 
30 was understood to permit regulatory review exceptions similar 
to Section 55.2(1). The Panel did not accord any weight to either 
of those arguments, however, because there was no documented 
evidence of the claimed negotiating understanding, and because 
the subsequent acts by individual countries did not constitute 
"practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the 
agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation" within the 
meaning of Article 31.3(b) of the Vienna Convention. 

7.48 A final objection to the Panel's general conclusion remains to 
be addressed. Although the point was raised only briefly in the 
parties' legal arguments, the Panel was compelled to acknowledge 
that the economic impact of the regulatory review exception could 
be considerable. According to information supplied by Canada 
itself, in the case of patented pharmaceutical products 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 78 of 90 

approximately three to six-and-a-half years are required for 
generic drug producers to develop and obtain regulatory approval 
for their products. If there were no regulatory review exception 
allowing competitors to apply for regulatory approval during the 
term of the patent, therefore, the patent owner would be able to 
extend its period of market exclusivity, de facto, for some part of 
that three to six-and-half year period, depending on how much, if 
any, of the development process could be performed during the 
term of the patent under other exceptions, such as the scientific or 
experimental use exception. The Panel believed it was necessary to 
ask whether measures having such a significant impact on the 
economic interests of patent owners could be called a "limited" 
exception to patent rights.‖ 

103. This Court notices that the phraseology of the Canadian provision 

(Section 55.2.1) is closely similar to Section 107A(a). Given this fact, the 

DSP ruling assumes significance. It noticed that firms which -assemble and 

market the final generic product‖ oftentimes do not have technological 

expertise or capacity to produce the active ingredient (the chemical product 

that generates the desired medicinal effect or "API"). This API is produced 

by a specialized manufacturer and sold to the generic producer. The latter 

assembles the API with other agents and creates the final product in a form 

that can be used by the ultimate consumer. The DSP stated that the conduct 

of such generic manufacturer and the API producer"s activities are covered 

by the regulatory or research exception. 

-7.5 To qualify for exemption under Section 55.2(1), such 
activities by either fine chemical producers or generic producers 
must be "solely for uses reasonably related to the development and 
submission of information required" by any law, Canadian or non-
Canadian, that "regulates the manufacture, construction, use or 
sale of any product". In answer to a question from the Panel, 
Canada stated that, although Canadian marketing regulations for 
generic producers did not require production runs to demonstrate 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 79 of 90 

the applicant's ability to maintain quality production in 
commercial volumes373, the statute would allow either fine 
chemical manufacturers or generic producers to undertake such 
production runs if they were required by regulations in other 
countries.‖ 

104. The Panel"s view on this aspect is clear and unambiguous: 

-7.45 In the Panel's view, however, Canada's regulatory review 
exception is a "limited exception" within the meaning of TRIPS 
Article 30. It is "limited" because of the narrow scope of its 
curtailment of Article 28.1 rights. As long as the exception is 
confined to conduct needed to comply with the requirements of the 
regulatory approval process, the extent of the acts unauthorized by 
the right holder that are permitted by it will be small and narrowly 
bounded. Even though regulatory approval processes may require 
substantial amounts of test production to demonstrate reliable 
manufacturing, the patent owner's rights themselves are not 
impaired any further by the size of such production runs, as long 
as they are solely for regulatory purposes and no commercial use 
is made of resulting final products. 

7.46 The Panel found no basis for believing that activities seeking 
product approvals under foreign regulatory procedures would be 
any less subject to these limitations. There is no a priori basis to 
assume that the requirements of foreign regulatory procedures will 
require activities unrelated to legitimate objectives of product 
quality and safety, nor has the EC provided any evidence to that 
effect. Nor is there any reason to assume that Canadian law would 
apply the exception in cases where foreign requirements clearly 
had no regulatory purpose. Nor, finally, is there any reason to 
assume that it will be any more difficult to enforce the 
requirements of Canadian law when Canadian producers claim 
exceptions under foreign procedures.‖ 

105. 
It is clear, therefore, that neither the quantity used nor the place of 

research and development or information (i.e. within the country granting 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 80 of 90 

patent or on foreign soil) is per se conclusive that the claim to use the Bolar 

or research exception has to be rejected. Instead, the conduct or action of the 

individual or entity making, using, constructing or selling the patented 

product or invention and the purpose for which it sought to be used (i.e. end 

use and that it should not be commercial) would be important and decisive 

whether the exporting or purchasing entity intends to use the patented 

product for commercial purposes. 

Tests necessary to regulate the use of the Section 107A exemption 

106. 
This Court, in the previous parts of the present judgment, has 

rejected Bayer"s argument with respect to the interpretation of Section 107A. 

Nevertheless, the court is also cognizant of the fact that export of patented 

invention can potentially be troublesome to the patent owner; an unregulated 

export activity can result in exploitation of the Bolar exemption beyond what 

can be considered "reasonably" related to obtaining approval under laws of 

India or another country. The wide nature of reliefs claimed by Bayer in the 

writ petition, i.e direct seizure of export consignment, direction to customs 

authorities to insist on labelling of products to facilitate their seizure and 

other such reliefs, in the opinion of the court, cannot be granted in a writ 

proceeding because whether the research provision has been invoked 

correctly can be determined by an examination of facts and also seeking 

expert opinion wherever needed. Equally, directing the executive to ensure 

labelling of the products sought to be exported, cannot be the subject matter 

of judicial review proceedings. 

107. 
That brings the question to what is use, sale, etc "reasonably related" 

for the purpose of developing information, ultimately used for in compliance 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 81 of 90 

with regulatory processes and laws in or outside India? Ultimately, on this 

aspect, there cannot be an ironclad rule or bright line as to what acts are 

reasonably related to the use or sale of the product, with the object of using 

the developed information to satisfy the regulations. 

108. The Canada dispute case (supra) is a clear authority which instructs 

that the volume of use, sale, construction, etc of a patented invention -or the 

quantum is itself inconclusive on the issue. Some guidance is, however, 

available in this regard by the UK Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) and 

Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The 

guidelines issued in this regard are extracted below: 

 

-The carrying out of chemical and biological synthetic 
processes suitable for the making, disposal or keeping of the 
active substance(s) including the manufacture or the import of 
batches in quantities sufficient to provide material for 
preparing investigative batches of the medicinal product and to 
validate the processes to the satisfaction of the competent 
authorities. 

 

The development, testing and use of the associated 
analytical techniques for the above. 

 

The development of the final pharmaceutical composition 
and manufacturing processes for the medicinal product to be 
marketed including the making, disposal or keeping or import 
of product batches in quantities sufficient to conduct the 
necessary pre-clinical tests, clinical and bioavailability trials 
and stability studies of the medicinal product and to validate 
the processes to the satisfaction of the competent authorities. 

 

The development, testing and use of the associated 
analytical techniques for the above. 

 

The manufacture and supply to the competent authorities 
of samples of active substances, their precursors, intermediates 
or impurities and of finished product samples. 

 

The compilation and submission of an MA or Variation 
application and application for an MA. 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 82 of 90 

(The acronym -MA‖ refers to marketing approval of a 
pharmaceutical product). 

109. During end of 2012, the UKIPO consulted stakeholders on whether 

the Act should be changed to include an exemption from patent infringement 

for activities involved in preparing or running clinical or field trials which 

use innovative drugs. The changes became effective from 01.12.2014. The 

new guidelines are extracted below: 

 

-obtaining or varying an authorisation to sell or supply, 
or offer to sell or supply, a medicinal product (whether in 
the United Kingdom or elsewhere); 

 

complying with any regulatory requirement imposed 
(whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) in relation 
to such an authorisation 

 

enabling a government or public authority (whether in the 
United Kingdom or elsewhere), or a person (whether in the 
United Kingdom or elsewhere) with functions of: 

 

providing health care on behalf of such a 
government or public authority, or 

 

providing advice to, or on behalf of, such a 
government or public authority about the provision 
of health care, to carry out an assessment of 
suitability of a medicinal product for human use for 
the purpose of determining whether to use it, or 
recommend its use, in the provision of health care.‖ 

110. Thus, the volume of the patented product and its use for research and 

development of information cannot be prescribed by any one norm. Each 

case merits an analysis of the evidence, the proof regarding the regulatory 

concerns is to be based on it. At the same time, this cannot be short circuited 

by approaching and seeking relief under Article 226 of the Constitution. 

Bayer"s claim that the court should have directed the authorities to seize or 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 83 of 90 

prohibit quantities of articles which Natco, or someone else sought to export, 

is not based on any obligation cast upon Customs authorities, in law. Further, 

even for the court to issue blanket directions of the kind, sought by Bayer, in 

its writ petition, is not feasible, because whether such seizure or prohibition 

or labelling ought to be mandatory, are aspects to be worked out, at the 

policy level, by the executive government, and not upon the court"s 

understanding. If Bayer"s claim were to succeed on this score, not only 

would the court become a proactive institution in framing policy and 

evolving normative standards in respect of spheres that have public 

repercussions, but would be exposed to the criticism that it would do so at 

the interests of private parties; moreover the episodic nature of writ 

jurisdiction is such that at the behest of a patent proprietor, sometimes even 

on its apprehension, the court would be in effect legislating policy in the 

guise of interpretation of law. Equally, the direction given for permission to 

export, in the course of writ proceedings, (in Natco"s case of howsoever 

miniscule an amount of API) was inappropriate. 

111. The approach of the learned single judge in permitting export, without 

any inquiry and holding that export of 1000 or 2000 tablets constituted 

reasonable use, in this case, cannot be countenanced. In such case, upon the 

patent proprietor alleging the infringement was to institute legal proceedings 

to injunct the alleged exporter or seller, it is equally possible for the seller or 

exporter to seek a declaration or appropriate relief (including in a suit for 

groundless threat, if such action lies) that its overseas sales are for research 

and purposes covered by Section 107A. This Court is of the opinion that the 

inquiry and adjudication in such cases would be in regard to the following: 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 84 of 90 

(1) The patent granted; 

(2) The nature of the product or elements sought to be exported; 

(3) The details of the party or party importing the product, 

(4) The quantity sought to be exported 

(5) Other particulars with respect to the end use of the product, to 

establish that it is solely for research and development of information to 

regulatory authorities in the other country; 

(6) All particulars regarding the relevant regulations, covering the kind 

and scope of inquiry, including the quantities of the product (i.e the patented 

product or compound, API or fine chemical needed). These details must be 

supplied by the exporter/seller of the product to the overseas buyer. In case 

the defendant is not the seller, it should disclose who had purchased the 

product in the relevant quantities, to facilitate its impleadment in the 

proceedings. In the event it cannot do so, the consequences of such result 

ought to be considered by the court. 

(7) If the regulations are in the language of that country, an authentic 

English translation to facilitate a speedy resolution; 

(8) Appropriate interim order, including undertaking by way of affidavit 

to compensate the plaintiff, in the event the suit were to be decreed and the 

extent of such monetary compensation. The affidavit should be of an 

authorized personnel, and kept alive during the pendency of litigation, duly 

authenticated by the board of director or other controlling body of the 

defendant-and whenever the company or entity undergoes amalgamation or 

transfer, suitable undertaking from the successor organization; 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 85 of 90 

(9) If necessary, verification through the Indian mission (and its trade 

division) abroad regarding the authentication of the third party and/ or its 

facilities abroad. 

(10) If it is held by the court that the exporter is not involved in sale or 

export of any patented product, but a generic article, unprotected by patent 

law, when denying relief, suitable restitutionary relief should be awarded to 

the defendants in monetary terms, to preclude litigation that prevents trade or 

competition. 

The above aspects are only indicative of the matters that need 

examination, they are in no way exhaustive and the court may consider any 

other matter relevant to the subject. 

Postscript 

112. The TRIPS Agreement (1994) mentions in Article 7, as an objective, 

the need to balance IP rights: 

-The protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 
should contribute to the promotion of technological innovation 
and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, [...] in a 
manner conducive to a balance of rights and obligations.‖ 

113. The Doha Declaration-(i.e. the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement 

and Public Health, adopted on 14.11.2001) does not contain any express 

mention of such need to strive for balance. It, however alludes, significantly 

the role necessary through -balanced rules "thereby recognizing the need 

for all people to benefit from the increased opportunities and welfare gains 

that intellectual property -as part of the multilateral trading system -can 

generate. The 2005 Decision of the General Council on the amendment of 

the TRIPS Agreement also impliedly flags the concern of balancing 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 86 of 90 

humanitarian and development goals on the one hand, and right-holder 

interests, on the other, in the public health field. 

114. In the context of IP rights, the concept of balance was explained 

eloquently in the dissenting opinion of Judge Kozinski in White v Samsung 

Electronics America, Inc. 989 F.2d 1512 (Ninth Circuit, 1993) where he 

stated: 

-intellectual property law is full of careful balances between 
what's set aside for the owner and what's left in the public 
domain for the rest of us: The relatively short life of patents; 
the longer, but finite, life of copyrights; copyright's idea 
expression dichotomy; the fair use doctrine; the prohibition on 
copyrighting facts; the compulsory license of television 
broadcasts and musical compositions; federal preemption of 
overbroad state intellectual property laws; the nominative use 
doctrine in trademark law; the right to make soundalike 
recordings. All of these diminish an intellectual property 
owner's rights. All let the public use something created by 
someone else. But all are necessary to maintain a free 
environment in which creative genius can flourish.‖ 

115. The history of the Bolar provision highlights that the interest in 

creativity and progress was not to be undermined by the seemingly wide 

nature of patent rights; in the context of essential products such as drugs, 

diagnostic aids, medical devices and other articles, the teachings in the 

patent necessarily do not lead to its use by the public, upon their lapse to the 

public domain. To fulfill drug acceptability standards prescribed by 

regulatory authorities, further tests are to be conducted. The Roche v 

Bolar decision elicited immediate Congressional response and the Hutch 

Waxman Act was enacted, in effect, nullifying that decision. TRIPS 

recognised the need for Bolar like research provisions, enabling research and 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 87 of 90 

development in numerous ways which relieve those involved in such 

activities, of the charge of patent infringement. Therefore, a constricted and 

narrow textual interpretation of such provisions is not called for. 

116. This court notes, furthermore, that as early as in 1946, the Constitution 

of the World Health organization (WHO) recognized that the -the enjoyment 

of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights 

of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, 

economic or social condition.‖ Later, the International Covenant on 

Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, by Article 12 stated that: 

-1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health. 
2. The steps to be taken by the States Parties to the present 
Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall 
include those necessary for: 
(a)The provision for the reduction of the still birth rate and of 
infant mortality and for the healthy development of the child; 
(b) The improvement of all aspects of environmental and 
industrial hygiene; 
(c) The prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, 
occupational and other diseases; 
(d) The creation of conditions which would assure to all 
medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness..‖ 

117. This Court is of the opinion that it is necessary for national courts to 

be aware and cognizant of these obligations, even while considering the 

assertion of property rights which it has to enforce. It is here that the 

concerned national courts" constitutional ethos and the values embodied in it 

also need consideration: whether they can be given primacy or not is to be 

decided on a case to case, fact dependent basis. Article 47 of the Indian 

Constitution obliges the State to ensure that the standards of public health of 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 88 of 90 

all are ensured and maintained and policies are to be fashioned appropriately. 

Article 21, which ensures the right to life and liberty, has been interpreted by 

our Supreme Court as including certain guarantees to health care access. 

Given these paradigms, an interpretation that furthers the objectives of 

Section 107A (and the previous research enabling existing in the Patents Act, 

i.e. Section 47) and Article 30 of TRIPS is to be preferred. This court has 

added these as a postscript-rather than in the main body of its findings,-

inasmuch as these aspects too need to be discussed appropriately, in the 

context of patent infringement claims, which generally tend to be confined in 

the "silo" of assertion and negation of private rights and their enforcement, 

despite (at times) larger implications to the general public in terms of 

outcomes. 

Conclusions 

"Each generation stands on the shoulders of those who have 
gone before them, just as I did as a young PhD student in 
Cambridge, inspired by the work of Isaac Newton, James Clerk 
Maxwell and Albert Einstein.‖

118. The Bolar exemption is the global community"s thought out design to 

ensure that the enclosure of intellectual property rights, granted to 

inventions, does not last beyond the term assured and that the general public 

is afforded with the end of the bargain which every society guarantees while 

sealing a patent i.e. access to the technology or invention for generations to 

come. But for a Bolar exemption, a third party manufacturer would not be 

able to start experimentation and ready a product, for its availability to the 

general public after the expiry of the patent term. 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 89 of 90 

119. In the light of the above discussion and findings, it is held and directed 

as follows: 

(a) Sale, use, construction of patented products (by individuals and 

entities that do not hold patents) in terms of Section 107A of the Act for 

purposes both within the country and abroad is authorized and legal provided 

the seller ensures that the end use and purpose of sale/export is reasonably 

related to research and development of information in compliance with 

regulations or laws of India (or the importing country), for its submission in 

accordance with such laws. The impugned judgment of the learned single 

judge and the findings recorded on this aspect are accordingly affirmed. 

(b) A dispute about the sale, i.e. whether it is legitimately related to the 

reasonable end use or purpose of research etc. for submission of information 

is properly the subject matter of a civil suit in which the full range of reliefs 

available in law can be granted having regard to the circumstances and the 

evidence led; 

(c) The court trying the suit would suitably take into account the factors 

that need to be examined (which are elaborated in the previous part of this 

judgment) and other relevant factors; 

(d) Such disputes are not ordinarily the subject of public law proceedings, 

as they involve investigation into facts and also result in reliefs to private 

parties for enforcement of private property entitlements. Therefore, such 

disputes should not be the subject matter of writ proceedings; petitions under 

Article 226 of the Constitution of India should not be entertained and 

wherever filed, the parties should be relegated to civil remedies. 

(e) CS(OS) No.1090/2011-subsequently renumbered as CS(Comm) 

33/2017 (Bayer"s suit against Natco) is pending. Issues were framed in the 


FAO (OS) (COMM) 169/2017 

Page 90 of 90 

said suit, on 09.01.2017. In these circumstances, no separate orders are 

called for. 

(f) 
CS(OS) (Comm) 1592/2016 filed by Bayer against Alembic is 

restored to the file of this Court. The concerned learned single judge would 

proceed to try it. 

(g) Both the above suits shall be decided in accordance with law, keeping 

in mind the discussion in this judgment and the factors indicated above. 

120. For the above reasons, the letters patent appeal has to fail; LPA 

359/2017 is dismissed, subject to the observations in this judgment. 

RFA(OS)(Comm) 6/2017 is for the reasons indicated above and subject to 

the directions, allowed. In the peculiar circumstances of the case, there shall 

be no order on costs.
