MEHTA <lb/>1. <lb/>Whether Reporters of Local newspapers may be <lb/>allowed to see the Judgment? <lb/>2. <lb/>To be referred to the Reporter or not? <lb/>3. <lb/>Whether the Judgment should be reported in the <lb/>Digest? <lb/>A.K. SIKRI, J. <lb/>1. <lb/>These appeals pertain to the same assessee and involve <lb/>different assessment years. There are certain questions of law <lb/>raised. However, admittedly other questions stand decided in the <lb/>case of the assessee itself in ITA 574/2007 decided on 9 th March, <lb/>2011 by this Court. The only question which survives in these <lb/>appeals and is common to all these appeals pertains to the nature <lb/>of the expenditure on account of advertising and marketing <lb/>incurred by the assessee in different assessment years. The AO <lb/>was of the view that the expenditure which was incurred on neon <lb/>signs and glow signs was capital in nature as these signs are semi-<lb/>permanent fixtures fixed at numerous retail outlets of the <lb/>assessee and providing enduring benefit. Therefore, out of the <lb/>total expenditure incurred on advertising and publicity, <lb/></body>

			<body>expenditure which was specifically attributed to the glow signs and <lb/>neon signs (it was major component of advertising and marketing <lb/>expenditure) was disallowed as the revenue expenditure. Instead <lb/>treating this to be the capital in nature depreciation thereof was <lb/>allowed. The CIT (A), however, reversed the aforesaid decision of <lb/>the Assessing Officer holding it to be the business expenditure and <lb/>assessee being entitled to deduction as per the provisions of <lb/>Section 37 (1) of the Act. <lb/>He was of the view that such <lb/>expenditure was recurring expenditure and essential for running of <lb/>the assessee&apos;s business. Further, this type of expenditure was <lb/>incurred in future years as well and contention of the assessee <lb/>was accepted by the AO in earlier assessment years as well. The <lb/>CIT (A) took support of the judgments in the cases of the Empire <lb/>Jute Vs. CIT, 124 ITR 1, L.H. Sugar Factory and Oil Mills P. <lb/>Ltd.,125 ITR 293 and Hindustan Times Ltd. 122 ITR 977 and <lb/>few other judgments referred to by the assessee. The Tribunal <lb/>vide its order dated 7 th November, 2008 accepted the contention <lb/>of the Revenue holding that the expenditure incurred on glow <lb/>signs and neon signs had a long life thus expenditure incurred on <lb/>of maintainable of glow signs and neon signs may be termed as an <lb/>expenditure of revenue nature, but putting up of glow signs and <lb/>neon signs gives an advantage to enduring nature in the field of <lb/>advertisement and promotion of the business of the assessee <lb/></body>

			<body>and, therefore, it could not be termed as expenditure of revenue <lb/>nature. In this behalf, the Tribunal observed as under: <lb/>&quot;The material used for neon signs and glow signs <lb/>by the assessee is a capital asset to be used for the <lb/>purpose of advertisement of the business that the <lb/>assessee was carrying. Even if such expenditure is <lb/>said to be in assessed wholly and exclusively for the <lb/>purpose of business of the assessee, it was capital <lb/>expenditure and not revenue expenditure. This view <lb/>also finds support from the judgment of the Bombay <lb/>High Court in the case of CIT Vs. Patel Intl. Films Ltd. <lb/>102 ITR 219. In that case the assessee company <lb/>purchased a film for the purpose of advertisement in <lb/>order to attract customers for its business of doing <lb/>colour processing work at the film centre laboratory. <lb/>The Court, while regarding it as capital expenditure <lb/>observed as under: <lb/>&quot;In our view, it cannot be disputed that even for <lb/>advertisement purpose assets can be acquired <lb/>by incurring expenditure in that behalf and, in <lb/>the instant case, the film, &quot;Pomposh&quot;, will have <lb/>to be regarded as having been acquired as a <lb/>capital asset by the assessee-company by <lb/>incurring expenditure of Rs. 60,000 in that <lb/>behalf. The asset, viz., the film, &quot;Pomposh&quot;, <lb/>could not be said to have been acquired as an <lb/>asset in which the assessee-company was <lb/>dealing. Nor was it going to deal with this item <lb/>as a stock-in-trade, but it had acquired this <lb/>asset for advertisement purposes with the help <lb/>of which the assessee-company was going to <lb/>carry on its business and in that sense the <lb/>expenditure incurred for acquiring this asset will <lb/>have to be regarded as a capital expenditure <lb/>and not a revenue expenditure. It is true, as has <lb/>been pointed out by Mr. Kolah, that whatever <lb/>expenditure <lb/>is <lb/>normally <lb/>incurred <lb/>for <lb/>advertisement purpose by an assessee is <lb/>regarded as revenue expenditure and is allowed <lb/>as business expenditure. But the question in the <lb/>instant case in whether the expenditure incurred <lb/>for acquiring the film, &quot;Pomposh&quot;, could be <lb/>regarded as an advertisement expenditure, and, <lb/>in our view, it cannot be so regarded. By <lb/></body>

			<body>purchasing the film the assessee-company did <lb/>not indulge in any advertisement at all, but <lb/>advertisement was to be indulged in after the <lb/>asset was acquired by the assessee-company <lb/>was a capital asset to be used for the purpose of <lb/>advertisement of the business that the <lb/>assessee-company was going to carry on in <lb/>future and, therefore, the expenditure will have <lb/>to be regarded as a capital expenditure and not <lb/>revenue expenditure.&quot; <lb/>In the case of the assessee also the glow signs <lb/>and neon signs are used by the assessee for <lb/>promotion of its business. Once they are fixed <lb/>they are of durable nature. Expenses on their <lb/>maintenance may be terms as revenue <lb/>expenditure but expenditure on installation of <lb/>neon signs and glow signs fail in the domain of <lb/>capital expenditure.&quot; <lb/>2. <lb/>However, on application filed by the assessee under Section <lb/>254 (2) of the Act seeking rectification of the aforesaid order on <lb/>the ground that a mistake had allegedly crept in the order, the <lb/>Tribunal recalled the said order allowing the Misc. Application <lb/>partly vide orders dated 7 th November 2008. Vide impugned <lb/>orders dated 31 st March, 2009, the view of the CIT (A) was affirmed <lb/>and the appeal of the revenue has been dismissed. The two <lb/>reasons given by the Tribunal for recalling the order and thereafter <lb/>dismissing the appeal of the Revenue are as under:-<lb/>(1) Similar expenditure incurred by the <lb/>assessee on glow signs and neon signs in the <lb/>assessment years 1996-07 and 1997-08 had <lb/>been allowed by the AO himself in the <lb/></body>

			<body>assessment year under Section 143 (3) of the <lb/>Act. Though for the assessment year 1998-99, <lb/>the Assessing Officer had disallowed the <lb/>expenditure, this disallowance was deleted by <lb/>the CIT (A) and against the order of the CIT (A) <lb/>no appeal was preferred by the Department. <lb/>Going by this past history, the Tribunal allowed <lb/>the expenditure as revenue holding that <lb/>undoubtedly, this was a recurring expenditure <lb/>which the assessee had necessary to incur to <lb/>carry out its business activity. <lb/>(2) As per the ratio of decision of Amritsar <lb/>Bench of the Tribunal in the case of JCIT Vs. <lb/>Diva Singh and Shyam Singh, 95 ITD 235, the <lb/>Himachal Pradesh High Court in the case of <lb/>Mohan Meakin Breweries Ltd. Vs. CIT, 118 <lb/>ITR 101, the advertisement expenditure was <lb/>capital in nature and <lb/>that deductibility or <lb/>otherwise and the expenditure depends upon the <lb/>provisions of the Act. <lb/>3. <lb/>Spearheading a scathing attack on the aforesaid approach <lb/>of the Tribunal, the learned counsel for the Revenue argued that <lb/>in the first instance, the Tribunal <lb/>had itself treated the <lb/></body>

			<body>expenditure as capital in nature holding that taking into <lb/>consideration long span life of neon signs and glow signs and <lb/>treating it to be a benefit of enduring nature, he submitted that <lb/>this aspect was altogether ignored by the Tribunal in the <lb/>impugned decision. Learned counsel also pointed out that there <lb/>was a difference between the glow signs and neon signs and in so <lb/>far as neon signs are concerned, with the advancement in <lb/>technology that these neon sign having long life could not be <lb/>disputed. The learned counsel produced the following literature in <lb/>support:-<lb/>&quot;Neon tube signs are produced by the draft of <lb/>bending glass tubing into shapes. A worker <lb/>skilled in this craft is known as a glass bender, <lb/>neon bender or tube bender. The neon tube is <lb/>made out of 3-4&apos; straight sticks of hollow glass <lb/>sold by sign suppliers to neon shops worldwide, <lb/>where they are manually assembled into <lb/>individual custom designed and fabricated <lb/>lamps. <lb/>There are many dozens of colours <lb/>available, determined by the type of glass <lb/>tubing and the composition of the gas filling. <lb/>It is the wide range of colours and the ability to <lb/>make a tube that can last for years if not <lb/>decades without replacement, that makes this <lb/>an art. Since these tubes require so much <lb/>custom labour, they would have very little <lb/>economic viability if they did not have such a <lb/>long lifetime when well processed. The intensity <lb/>of neon light produced increases slowly as the <lb/>tube diameter grows smaller, that is, the <lb/>intensity varies inversely with the square root of <lb/>the interior diameter of the tubing and the <lb/>resistance of the tube increases as the tubing <lb/>diameter decreases accordingly because tube <lb/>ionization is greatest at the center of the tube, <lb/>and the ions migrate to and are recaptured and <lb/></body>

			<body>neutralized at the tube walls. The greatest <lb/>cause of neon tube failure is the gradual <lb/>absorption of neon gas by high voltage ion <lb/>implantation into the interior glass walls of the <lb/>tubes which depletes the gas, and eventually <lb/>causes the tube resistance to rise to a level that <lb/>it can no longer light at the rated voltage, but <lb/>this may take 7-10 years. <lb/>Pure materials <lb/>and careful manufacturing <lb/>processes are required n order to produce a <lb/>properly operating neon sign. A well-built neon <lb/>sign should have a life of over 30,000 hours. As <lb/>a comparison, the average 100 watt light bulb <lb/>has a rated life of 750-1,000 hours. <lb/>This long lifetime has created a practical market <lb/>for neon use for interior architectural cove <lb/>lighting in a wide variety of uses including <lb/>homes, where the tube can be bent to any <lb/>shape, fitted in a small space, and can do so <lb/>without requiring tube replacement for a decade <lb/>or more.&quot; <lb/>4. <lb/>He further argued that relying upon the judgment of <lb/>Himachal Pradesh High Court in the case of Mohan Meakin <lb/>Breweries Ltd. (supra) was totally misplaced as that was a <lb/>decision of the year 1979. The technology over a period of time <lb/>has totally changed and the manner in which the neon signs and <lb/>glow signs were manufactured due to advancement of technology <lb/>now give much longer life. <lb/>5. <lb/>The aforesaid argument of learned counsel for the Revenue <lb/>may be attractive in first blush. However, it loses its sheen when <lb/>we examine it with some deeper insight. In the first place, we <lb/>may point out that no such distinction between glow sign and <lb/></body>

			<body>neon signs have been made by the AO whereas learned counsel <lb/>has conceded that expenditure on glow signs may be revenue in <lb/>nature because of their span of life and has confined his <lb/>argument only qua neon signs. As far as AO is concerned, he did <lb/>not distinguish between the two and clubbed the expenditure <lb/>incurred on both glow signs and neon signs. There is no statistics <lb/>or details before us to segregate the expenditure qua glow sign <lb/>and neon signs which exercise is required, if we accept the <lb/>argument of the Revenue. Such a question, therefore, cannot be <lb/>put for the first time in this Court, that too, in an appeal under <lb/>Section 260-A of the Act which lies only on the substantial <lb/>question of law and not on the facts. Secondly, no argument was <lb/>raised by the learned counsel for the revenue on the aspect that in <lb/>the year 1998-99, though, CIT (A) had allowed this expenditure as <lb/>revenue expenditure, Department had not challenged the decision <lb/>and accepted the position. Thirdly and more importantly, even on <lb/>merits, the core question to be decided is as to whether the <lb/>expenditure incurred <lb/>on glow signs and neon signs is the <lb/>expenditure on advertisement and publicity or marketing, and if <lb/>so, whether it qualifies for deduction under Section 37 of the Act. <lb/>When we examine the matter from this angle, we come to the <lb/>conclusion that the expenditure of this nature needs to be allowed <lb/>as the Revenue expenditure. <lb/>It is not in dispute that the <lb/></body>

			<body>expenditure in question was infact incurred. It is also not in <lb/>dispute that it was infact in furtherance of the business of the <lb/>assessee and had thus direct nexus with the business of the <lb/>assessee. Therefore, the provisions of Section 37 (1) of the Act are <lb/>satisfied. In this scenario, whether it would make any difference if <lb/>the expenditure is of enduring benefit. <lb/>6. <lb/>The argument of the Revenue is based on the judgment of <lb/>the Supreme Court in Madras Industrial Investment Corporation <lb/>Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, 225 ITR 802. The ratio of <lb/>the aforesaid case was discussed in detail by the Division Bench <lb/>of this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Industrial <lb/>Finance Corporation of India Ltd. 185 Taxman 296. This very <lb/>argument was rejected explaining the ratio of the said case in the <lb/>following manner:-<lb/>&quot;Thus, the first thing which is to be noticed is <lb/>that though the entire expenditure was <lb/>incurred in that year, it was the assessee who <lb/>wanted the spread over. The Court was <lb/>conscious of the principle that normally <lb/>revenue expenditure is to be allowed in the <lb/>same year in which it is incurred, but at the <lb/>instance of the assessee, who wanted <lb/>spreading over, the Court agreed to allow the <lb/>assessee that benefit when it was found that <lb/>there was a continuing benefit to the business <lb/>of the company over the entire period.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 12 of 18 <lb/></page>

			<body>7. <lb/>This Court thus explained in no uncertain terms that the <lb/>normal rule accepted by the Supreme Court in the said judgment <lb/>was that the expenditure is to be allowed in the year in which it <lb/>was incurred. Only at the instance of the assessee who wanted to <lb/>spread over, the court had agreed to allow the assessee the <lb/>benefit after finding that there was a continuing benefit to the <lb/>company over the entire period. The ratio of this judgment was <lb/>thus summaried in the following manner:-<lb/>&quot;What follows from the above is that normally <lb/>the ordinary rule is to be applied, namely, <lb/>revenue expenditure incurred in a particular <lb/>year is to be allowed in that year. Thus, if the <lb/>assessee claims that expenditure in that year, <lb/>the Income Tax department cannot deny the <lb/>same. However, in those cases where the <lb/>assessee himself wants to spread the <lb/>expenditure over a period of ensuing years, it <lb/>can be allowed only if the principle of matching <lb/>concept is satisfied, which upto now has been <lb/>restricted to the cases of debentures.&apos; <lb/>8. <lb/>At this stage, it would be of advantage to discuss the <lb/>judgment of Supreme Court in Empire Jute (supra) which <lb/>repelled the theory of expenditure of enduring nature, in a great <lb/>measure. In that case, the Supreme Court noted that by decided <lb/>cases, the courts evolved various tests for distinguishing between <lb/>the capital and revenue expenditure but no test is paramount or <lb/>conclusive. Every case has to be decided on its facts keeping in <lb/></body>

			<body>mind the broad picture of whole operation in respect of which the <lb/>expenditure has been incurred. At the same time, few tests <lb/>formulated by the Courts were taken note of. One such test which <lb/>was specifically spelled-out and may be relevant for our purpose <lb/>was &quot;when an expenditure is made not only once and for all, but <lb/>with a view to bringing into existence or an advantage for which <lb/>enduring benefit of a trade, the expenditure can be treated as <lb/>capital in nature and not attributable to revenue&quot;. However, <lb/>cautioned the Court, it would be misleading to suppose that in all <lb/>cases securing a benefit for business expenditure would be <lb/>capital expenditure. The Court added the caution in the following <lb/>words:-<lb/>&quot;There may be cases where expenditure, even <lb/>if incurred for obtaining advantage, of enduring <lb/>benefit, may, none-the-less, be on revenue <lb/>account and the test of enduring benefit may <lb/>break down. It is not every advantage of <lb/>enduring nature acquired by an assesses that <lb/>brings the case within the principle laid down in <lb/>this test. What is material to consider is the <lb/>nature of the advantage in a commercial <lb/>sense and it is only where the advantage <lb/>is in the capital field that the expenditure <lb/>would be disallowable on an application of <lb/>this test. If the advantage consists merely in <lb/>facilitating the assessee&apos;s trading operations or <lb/>enabling the management and conduct of the <lb/>assessee&apos;s business to be carried on more <lb/>efficiently or more profitably white leaving the <lb/>fixed capital untouched, the expenditure would <lb/>be on revenue account, even though the <lb/>advantage may endure for an indefinite future. <lb/>The test of enduring benefit is therefore not a <lb/></body>

			<body>certain or conclusive test and it cannot be <lb/>applied blindly and mechanically without regard <lb/>to the particular facts and circumstances of a <lb/>given case.&quot; <lb/>9. <lb/>The similar issue has been decided by us in the judgment <lb/>pronounced today titled The Commissioner of Income Tax-V <lb/>Vs. Citi Financial Consumer Finance Ltd. [ ITA 1820 &amp; other <lb/>connected matters) and all the relevant judgment including noted <lb/>above are discussed in detail and position summed up is as <lb/>under:-<lb/>&quot;Applying the aforesaid principle to the facts <lb/>of this case, it clearly emerges that the <lb/>expenditure on publicity and advertisement is <lb/>to be treated as revenue in nature allowable <lb/>fully in the year in which it was incurred. <lb/>Concededly, there is no advantage which has <lb/>accrued to the assessee in the capital field. <lb/>The expenditure was incurred to facilitate the <lb/>assessee&apos;s trading operations. No fixed capital <lb/>was created by this expenditure. We may also <lb/>add here that in the Income-Tax laws, there is <lb/>no concept of deferred revenue expenditure. <lb/>Once the assessee claims the deduction for <lb/>whole amount of such expenditure, even the <lb/>year in which it <lb/>is incurred, <lb/>and the <lb/>expenditure fulfills the test laid down under <lb/>Section 37 of the Act, it has to be allowed. Only <lb/>in exceptional cases, the nature mentioned in <lb/>Madras Industrial Corporation (supra), the <lb/>expenditure can be allowed to be spread over, <lb/>that too, when the assessee chooses to be so.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>10. The submission of learned counsel for the Revenue qua <lb/>judgment of Himachal Pradesh High Court in Mohan Meakin, <lb/>(supra) is misplaced. The decision was not based on the issue as <lb/>to whether expense incurred on neon signs was of enduring <lb/>nature. The Court rather specifically stated that the question <lb/>whether the expenditure was capital or revenue in nature was <lb/>wholly irrelevant. The issue was whether such an expenditure was <lb/>allowable under Section 37 of the Act. In that context, the <lb/>question of law was decided in favour of the assessee in the <lb/>following words: <lb/>&quot;It is obvious from the provisions of Sub-<lb/>section (3) quoted above that it contemplates <lb/>an altogether separate and distinct head of <lb/>deduction, <lb/>namely, <lb/>expenditure <lb/>on <lb/>advertisement. It is further clear that this <lb/>deduction on account of expenditure on <lb/>advertisement is admissible &quot;notwithstanding <lb/>anything contained in Sub-section (1)&quot;. The <lb/>use of the non obstinate clause in Sub-section <lb/>(3) clearly excludes the considerations which <lb/>are contemplated by Sub-section (1) of Section <lb/>37. It, therefore, follows that if once it is found <lb/>that a particular deduction can be claimed as <lb/>on account of expenditure on advertisement <lb/>the said deduction squarely falls within Sub-<lb/>section (3) and that being so the question <lb/>whether the said expenditure is of capital <lb/>nature or of revenue nature falls wholly out of <lb/>consideration. Deduction on account of <lb/>expenditure <lb/>on <lb/>advertisement <lb/>is <lb/>qua <lb/>advertisement and not qua its revenue or <lb/>capital nature. The Tribunal seems to have <lb/>missed this aspect of the matter. We, <lb/>therefore, find that this expenditure falling <lb/>under Sub-section (3) of Section 37 should be <lb/>treated as expenditure on advertisement and <lb/></body>

			<body>deduction on that account should be given not <lb/>on consideration of the question whether it is <lb/>of revenue or capital nature but on <lb/>considerations <lb/>of <lb/>the <lb/>conditions <lb/>and <lb/>restrictions contemplated by Sub-section (3) <lb/>itself.&quot; <lb/>11. The question was answered in favour of the assessee on the <lb/>touch stone of the provisions contained in Section 37 of the Act in <lb/>the following manner:-<lb/>&quot;After considering the rival submissions made <lb/>by learned Counsel for the parties, we are of <lb/>the opinion that the Tribunal was right in <lb/>confirming the order of the QT(A) and treating <lb/>the expenditure incurred on glow sign boards <lb/>as of revenue nature. <lb/>Section 37(1) of the Act provides that &quot;any <lb/>expenditure (not being expenditure of the <lb/>nature described in Sections 30 to 36 and not <lb/>being in the nature of capital expenditure or <lb/>personal expenses of the assessee), laid out or <lb/>expended wholly and exclusively for the <lb/>purposes of the business or profession shall be <lb/>allowed in computing the income chargeable <lb/>under the head &apos;Profits and gains of business or <lb/>profession.&quot;&apos; For claiming deduction under this <lb/>section, one of the conditions is that the <lb/>expenditure should not be in the nature of <lb/>capital expenditure. The question whether a <lb/>particular expenditure incurred by the assessee <lb/>is of capital or revenue nature is always a <lb/>complex and intricate issue. Such a question <lb/>has to be considered and answered in the facts <lb/>and circumstances of each case. In Assam <lb/>Bengal Cement Co. Ltd. v. CIT <lb/>[1955] <lb/>27ITR34(SC) , it was held that if the <lb/>expenditure is made for acquiring or bringing <lb/>into existence an asset or advantage for the <lb/>enduring benefit of the business, it is properly <lb/>attributable to capital and is of the nature of <lb/></body>

			<body>capital expenditure. If on the other hand it is <lb/>made not for bringing into existence an asset or <lb/>advantage but for running the business or <lb/>working it with a view to produce the profits it <lb/>is a revenue expenditure. If any such asset or <lb/>advantage for the enduring benefit of the <lb/>business is thus acquired or brought into <lb/>existence it would be immaterial whether the <lb/>source of the payment was the capital or the <lb/>income of the concern or whether the payment <lb/>was made once and for all or was made <lb/>periodically. The aim and object of the <lb/>expenditure would determine the character of <lb/>the expenditure whether it is a capital <lb/>expenditure or a revenue expenditure. It was <lb/>further held that the expressions &apos;enduring <lb/>benefit&apos; or &apos;of a permanent character&apos; were <lb/>introduced to make it clear that the asset or the <lb/>right acquired must have enough durability to <lb/>justify its being treated as a capital asset.&quot; <lb/>12. No doubt in that case the Court has also observed that the <lb/>glow signs boards have a short life, they decay with the effect of <lb/>weather, and require frequent replacement. These observations <lb/>may not be entirely correct having regard to the literature qua neo <lb/>sign board produced by the learned counsel for the Revenue. <lb/>However, this fact would not alter the ultimate decision as it is still <lb/>obvious that no asset of permanent nature is brought into <lb/>existence. <lb/>13. Here, by putting the neon signs and glow signs, no asset of <lb/>permanent nature is created. Simply because self-life of such <lb/>neon signs is more, may not be of any significance once we keep <lb/></body>
