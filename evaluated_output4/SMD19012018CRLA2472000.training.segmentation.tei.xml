			<body>(iii) for the offence under Section 201 IPC to undergo RI for three years and <lb/>pay a fine of Rs,1,000/-and in default, to undergo SI for 1 month. All <lb/>sentences were directed to run concurrently. <lb/>1.3 There were eight other co-accused (A-2 to A-9, with A-10 remaining <lb/>absconding during the trial) who were, by the same judgment, acquitted of <lb/>all the offences they were charged with. Aggrieved by the aforementioned <lb/>acquittal of A-2 to A-9, and the acquittal of A-1 for the offence under <lb/>Section 120-B IPC and Section 216 read with Section 34 IPC, the State has <lb/>filed Criminal Appeal No.81/2003. <lb/>1.4 A-1 to A-10 were charged with conspiring to kill and pursuant thereto <lb/>murdering Dr. Sunil Kaul (hereafter &apos;SK&apos;), the Director of Personal Point <lb/>Ltd.

According to the prosecution, A-1 fell in love with SS which, <lb/>he claimed, was reciprocated by her. As a result of A-1 being persuaded by <lb/>SS, A-1 agreed to give a loan of Rs.12 lakhs to PPL on interest. DG was <lb/>managing the finances of PPL. The interest payments by PPL for the <lb/>aforementioned loan were made through her to A-1. SK was the Director of <lb/>PPL. <lb/>3. The case of the prosecution is that A-1 was infatuated with SS and, <lb/>although he was married, he told SS that if she did not become his, he would <lb/>even go to the extent of killing her. A-1 is said to have been maintaining a <lb/>diary with writings to the above effect. A-1 also suspected that SS was <lb/>having an affair with SK. A-1 hired a private detective, Vikram Singh (PW-<lb/>8), on 20 th March 1996 to investigate the movements of SS on the pretext of <lb/>a potential matrimonial alliance for his brother Anil Gupta with her. Despite <lb/>PW-8 telling A-1, after 15 days of investigation, that SS had a good moral <lb/>character, A-1 insisted that SS was having an affair with SK and insisted on <lb/>continuing the surveillance on SS. <lb/>4. A-1 planned to have a franchise of PPL opened in Bombay and that SS <lb/>should run that franchise. On 5 th June 1996, A-1 contacted PW-8 to tell him <lb/>not to subject SS to surveillance on 6 th June 1996 as it was her birthday but <lb/>to continue it thereafter. <lb/>5. Meanwhile, in January 1996, air tickets were arranged by A-1 for SS and <lb/>her family for travel to Bangalore and back. However, it transpired that this <lb/></body>

In the middle of <lb/>February 1996, A-1 and his brother, Anil Gupta, accompanied by Arvind <lb/>Malik (PW-33) tried to follow SS to Tirupati Balaji. On 20 th April 1996, SS <lb/>and Shobha Kaul, wife of SK, visited Shirdi via Bombay and returned on <lb/>30 th April 1996.

The further case <lb/>of the prosecution is that, under the pretext of discussing the opening of a <lb/>new franchise of PPL at Vikas Marg, which would be financed by A-1, A-1 <lb/>called for a meeting of SS, SK and DG at the MCD office at Okhla, from <lb/>where A-1 used to operate, at 7.30 pm on 6 th June 1996. According to the <lb/>prosecution, A-1 to A-10 conspired to stage a kidnapping of A-1 and the <lb/>three deceased SS, SK and DG. According to their plan, while SS, SK and <lb/>DG would be forcibly injected with sedatives by Dr. Hemant Kalra (A-5), <lb/>A-1 would not.

			<body>MCD office, the co-accused came there, forcibly injected the three accused <lb/>with the sedatives as planned. A-1 was also injected, but not with a sedative. <lb/>The case of the prosecution, as set out in the charge sheet, was that SS, DG <lb/>and A-1 were taken away in the steel-grey BMW car of A-1 bearing the <lb/>registration No. DL 1C E 4725 which was being driven by co-accused <lb/>persons, Kamal Kumar @ Pinki (A-9) and Vibhore Singh @ Lavi @ <lb/>Chaudhary (A-3). They were first taken to Meerut. SK was taken away in <lb/>his own car, a Maruti 1000 having the registration No. DL 1C E 1565. A <lb/>third car, a Maruti 800, having registration No. UP 80 A 3581 was also used <lb/>by the accused in the commission of the crime. <lb/>Murder of the deceased and disposal of the bodies <lb/>8. A-1 is stated to have initially reached Meerut at the house of one Mintoo <lb/>(A-4) at Shastri Nagar. By this time SK had been murdered near Hodal in <lb/>Haryana and his car abandoned somewhere there. Thereafter, along with the <lb/>two other deceased, i.e. SS and DG, A-1 and the other accused proceeded to <lb/>Agra and reached the house of one Ashwani Saini. There DG was killed by <lb/>strangulation and her body was kept in the boot of the BMW car of A-1. <lb/>Thereafter, SS was also murdered by strangulation; her dead body was also <lb/>kept in the car of A-1 in a gunny bag.

Both bodies were <lb/>found in a highly decomposed state and had been partially eaten by animals. <lb/>A-1 travelled to Bombay <lb/>11. According to the prosecution, A-1 and the other accused thereafter <lb/>reached Bombay in A-1&apos;s BMW car. They first stayed at Centaur Hotel at <lb/>Room No.466. While some of the accused returned, A-1 along with A-8 and <lb/>Kamal Kumar (A-9) stayed at hotel Leela Kempinski in Room No.408. <lb/>However, A-8 and A-9 also left there soon after leaving behind A-1. <lb/>FIR by son of A-1 and seizures made <lb/>12. In the meanwhile, A-1&apos;s son Nitin Gupta, who was examined as DW-1, <lb/>received a message from his mother at around 7:30 pm on 6 th June 1996 on <lb/>his mobile phone No. 9811018640 stating that A-1 had not reached home. <lb/>According to DW-1, he then returned home and waited for A-1 for about <lb/>two hours. During that time, he also called his uncle Anil Gupta (the <lb/>younger brother of A-1). Thereafter, DW-1 and Anil Gupta went to PS <lb/>Okhla where Sub-Inspector Bal Kishan (PW-133) met them. The SI assured <lb/>them that an FIR regarding A-1 having gone missing would be registered. <lb/>13. According to DW-1, after 6 th June 1996, he started receiving threatening <lb/>calls at his house for ransom money. Similar calls were also received by <lb/>Anil Gupta. DW-1 is also supposed to have produced before the IO, the <lb/>Driver&quot;s License (&quot;DL&quot;) of SK which he stated he found at the site of his <lb/>father&quot;s office at MCD, Okhla. Acting on the above complaint, FIR <lb/>No.340/1996 (Ex.PW-4/B) was registered by PW-133. An inspection was <lb/></body>

These seizures were affected in the presence of a Constable Ashok <lb/>Kumar (PW-4) and ASI Siri Upadhyay (PW-6). Meanwhile, Shobha Kaul <lb/>(PW-83), wife of Dr. Kaul, was informed by the wife of A-1 that the DL of <lb/>SK had been found at the MCD office and that DW-1 had lodged a missing <lb/>report. PW-83 stated that her husband left in a Maruti 1000 on 6 th June 1996 <lb/>to Noida to shoot a serial. <lb/>15. The father of SS, Sukumar Saha (PW-10), told the police that SK and <lb/>DG had come to his house between 6:30 and 7 pm on 6 th June 1996 and SS <lb/>had left with them in a car being driven by SK. He later called Shobha Kaul <lb/>(PW-83) between 11 and 11.30 pm and told her that he was not aware of the <lb/>whereabouts of SK, SS and DG after making enquiries. He later informed <lb/>her of SK&apos;s DL having been found in the MCD office of A-1. <lb/>16. Rajesh Gupta (PW-11), the husband of DG, also called PW-83 when DG <lb/>did not return by 7 pm on 6 th June 1996 and there was no reply on the phone <lb/>at her office. PW-11 was directed to PS C.R.

			<body>directed to PS Okhla where an FIR was registered. <lb/>Arrest of A-1 and his medical examination <lb/>17. It is further the case of the prosecution that on the intervening night of <lb/>9 th and 10 th June 1996, information was received that A-1 was staying in <lb/>Room No.408 at Hotel Leela Kempinski, Bombay. SI Balwant Singh (PW-<lb/>141) who was the Station House Officer (&quot;SHO&quot;) at PS Okhla Industrial <lb/>Area contacted the SHO of PS Sahar, Bombay asking him to keep a watch <lb/>on A-1. The SHO of PS Sahar, Bombay was also informed about the BMW <lb/>car of A-1. <lb/>18. Thereafter, PW-141, along with SI R.S. Dhaka (PW-100) reached PS <lb/>Sahar, Bombay around 2.30 pm and contacted the SHO of PS Sahar. In the <lb/>meanwhile, Assistant Police Inspector (&quot;API&quot;) D.G. Sankhe who was posted <lb/>at PS Sahar, Bombay and who had been asked not to arrest A-1 but keep a <lb/>guard, reached the Leela Kempinski Hotel and contacted Sameer, the <lb/>Manager there, who also confirmed that he had received a message to that <lb/>effect. API D.G. Sankhe (who was examined as DW-16 on behalf of A-1) <lb/>then came back to PS Sahar. It appears that DW-16 in fact recorded a <lb/>statement of A-1 (DW-16/A). <lb/>19. It has come in the evidence of PW-141 that when he, along with PW-<lb/>100, reached PS Sahar at around 2:30 pm on 10 th June 1996, A-1 was <lb/>already found present there and he was interrogated there. Thereafter, A-1 <lb/>was taken to Room No.408 at Hotel Leela Kempinski where four glasses <lb/>and a bottle of whiskey were found on a table.

			<body>was parked in the parking lot of the hotel, PW-141 directed PW-100 to take <lb/>the car into possession. Leaving PW-100 back in Mumbai for further <lb/>investigation, PW-141 returned to Delhi along with A-1. <lb/>20. A-1 was formally arrested on 11 th June 1996 in Delhi. At 3.30 pm on <lb/>11 th June 1996, PW-141 brought A-1 to the casualty ward at AIIMS, New <lb/>Delhi for examination. Dr. S.K. Gupta, the Senior Resident who was posted <lb/>there (and who was later examined as DW-13 on behalf of A-1), stated that <lb/>A-1 was complaining of pain over the back of the chest and the sacrum area. <lb/>A-1 also complained of chest pain and a phobia of living alone. On <lb/>examination, DW-13 found tenderness over the back, injection prick marks <lb/>on both arms of A-1. He found bruises on the posterior aspect of the chest <lb/>and swelling on the back of the chest. He opined that the injuries were more <lb/>than 48 hours old and were caused by blunt force. He described them as &apos;true <lb/>bruises&apos; which were not &apos;self-inflicted&apos;. <lb/>Investigation and framing of charges <lb/>21. During the course of investigation, A-1 is stated to have made a <lb/>disclosure which led to the police searching the room of SS at PPL and <lb/>recovering the six unused air tickets. The call detail records (&quot;CDRs&quot;) of the <lb/>cell phone of DW-1, which was used by A-1, were collected. PW-10, the <lb/>father of SS, produced a diary on 18 th June 1996 which also contained two <lb/>envelopes and hand-written papers. The other co-accused persons were <lb/>thereafter arrested and ultimately a charge sheet was filed on <lb/>6 th September 1996 for the offences already noticed hereinbefore. A <lb/>supplementary charge sheet was filed on 29 th November 1996. <lb/></body>

			<body>23. There were separate additional charges under Section 411 IPC qua some <lb/>of the co-accused being found in possession of stolen property. A total of <lb/>143 witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution. <lb/>A-1&apos;s statement under Section 313 Cr PC <lb/>24. As far as the statement of A-1 under Section 313 Cr PC is concerned, it <lb/>is relevant to note that A-1, apart from denying many of the circumstances <lb/>put to him by the prosecution, gave certain specific replies to some of the <lb/>questions. For e.g., he stated that he had been arrested on 10 th June 1996 in <lb/>Bombay by the Delhi Police and that the bill of Hotel Leela Kempinski was <lb/>paid by the Delhi Police. He denied that the mobile phone of DW-1, used by <lb/>A-1, was seized from A-1. He maintained that it had been seized from his <lb/>house as informed to him by his son, DW-1. <lb/>25. A-1 submitted a written statement under Section 233 Cr PC in the trial <lb/>court where inter alia he admitted that due to the good behaviour of SS &quot;I <lb/>started loving her but there was no lust involved. She also respected me and <lb/>showed affection towards me. Consequently she had virtually a hold over <lb/>me.&quot; According to A-1, as they got closer, SS advised him that he should <lb/>invest a big sum of money for a new branch of PPL at Vikas Marg; that he <lb/>was promised to be paid 36% interest thereon and alternatively, he should <lb/>operate a franchise at the new project. His statement thereafter reads as <lb/>under: <lb/>&quot;After Sujata Saha consulted Dr. Sunil Kaul and Deepa <lb/>Gupta, it was decided that they would visit the MCD office <lb/>Okhla to meet me at 7.30 p.m on 6.6.96. I had kept the draft <lb/>agreement &quot;Agreement for Project Associate&quot; ready. I had <lb/>also with me my cheque book and in the brief case there <lb/></body>

At the <lb/>request of Dr. Sunil I drew a cheque for Rupees twelve lacs <lb/>seventy-five thousand. The writing work has not yet <lb/>complete, when suddenly four young men who were aged <lb/>25-26 years entered the room and surrounded us all at Pistol <lb/>point. I did not know those young men. They stated beating <lb/>us. Thereafter, they asked me to write a note on a paper <lb/>&quot;Mera Apharan Ho Gia hain Pachas Lakha Rupia De Dena <lb/>Nahi to Yeh Log Mujhe Jan se Maar Denge&quot;. <lb/>Two young men gave an injection to Dr. Sunil and <lb/>thereafter one injection each to Sujata and Deepa. They <lb/>gave me an injection after which I lost senses. My car BMW <lb/>was standing outside. They took me and my car at different <lb/>places, which due to sedatives, which were given to me, I <lb/>could not find out. Thereafter I was taken to some Hotel by <lb/>three of them. Due to fear and sedatives I did not and could <lb/>not raise any hue and cry, but I found that some doctor had <lb/>attended me in that hotel. Thereafter as I was completely <lb/>exhausted they forcibly gave me liquor. As I had never <lb/>taken liquor in my life I lost senses due to intoxication. I <lb/>was awaken by Bombay Police and I came to know that I <lb/>was in a hotel at Bombay. I was escorted by Bombay Police <lb/>to P.S. Sahar. My car was also taken to police station. <lb/>Bombay police interrogated me and I told them the <lb/>aforesaid true story. On the same day Delhi Police arrived <lb/>there and Inspector Balwant Singh interrogated me and I <lb/>gave him the whole incident truly. He took me to Leela <lb/>Hotel where some glass tumblers were lying on the table in <lb/>room No.408. I was asked to give those glasses to him, <lb/>which I did. <lb/>The robbers had taken away my Rs.7,25,000/-which I had <lb/>brought for Dr. Sunil.&quot; <lb/>26. In the above statement, A-1 also referred to his medical examination at <lb/></body>

He admitted to giving SS a diary &quot;in which she expressed <lb/>her feelings towards me and she sometimes used to show me those verses <lb/>and prose.&quot; A-1 alleged that, while in custody, he was coerced to give his <lb/>specimen handwriting by PW-141. <lb/>Defence witnesses examined <lb/>27.

In the impugned judgment of the trial Court, as many as 85 <lb/>circumstances were culled out as forming a continuous chain and sought to <lb/>be proved by the prosecution as pointing unmistakably to the guilt of the <lb/>accused. Specific to the issue of motive, the following ten circumstances <lb/>were attributed to A-1: <lb/>&quot;(i) Subash Gupta a member of Personal Point and Sujata <lb/>Saha was his counsellor. <lb/>(ii) Purchase of Diamond Ring by Subash Gupta for Sujata <lb/>Saha to be presented to her on her birthday. <lb/>(iii) Purchase of air tickets for Sujata Saha and her family. <lb/>(iv) Kept vigil on Sujata Saha through private detective in <lb/></body>

			<body>order to ascertain her antecedents. <lb/>(v) Followed Sujata Saha at Balaji. <lb/>(vi) Got followed Sujata Saha at Shirdi by Ravi Prakash <lb/>where Sujata Saha visited in the month of April, 1996. <lb/>(vii) Calls made from Cell Phone No. 9811018640 at <lb/>residence of Sujata Saha on number of occasions. <lb/>(ix) Writing letters showing his love for Sujata Saha. <lb/>(x) Threat to kill her as reflected form writing in diary <lb/>recovered later on after the death of Sujata Saha from her <lb/>almirah which was presented to Sujata Saha by accused <lb/>Subash Gupta.&quot; <lb/>29. The trial Court held that circumstance (i) above was proved by the <lb/>prosecution. However, as regards the circumstance (ii) above, the trial Court <lb/>held that what was proved was that a diamond ring was purchased but not <lb/>that it was purchased by A-1. As regards circumstance (iii) above, it was <lb/>held that while A-1 got purchased the air tickets for the journey from Delhi <lb/>to Bangalore and back in the name of SS and her family, the journey was <lb/>never undertaken by her and only the torn tickets were recovered from her <lb/>office drawer. <lb/>30. Circumstance (iv) was held by the trial Court not to be proved. The trial <lb/>Court was not inclined to believe that A-1 ever engaged PW-8 for keeping <lb/>SS under surveillance. Likewise, circumstance (v), regarding A-1 having <lb/>followed SS to Tirupati Balaji, was held not to be proved. Circumstance (vi) <lb/>above was held again to be not proved. It was held that even if A-8 had <lb/>stayed at Hotel Tirath, it did not mean that A-8 had followed SS and that too <lb/></body>

			<body>at the instance of A-1. <lb/>31. As regards circumstance (vii), the trial Court held that though, from the <lb/>mere fact that calls were made, it could not be concluded that A-1 had <lb/>threatened SS or expressed his love for her, in his statement under Section <lb/>313 Cr PC, A-1 had admitted that he had a soft corner for SS and she had a <lb/>hold over him. Therefore, this showed that A-1 was in love with SS. <lb/>However, the trial court did not accept that SS had reciprocated it. It <lb/>observed: <lb/>&quot;It has to be kept in mind that the position of Sujata Shah <lb/>was vulnerable as she was merely an employee in a private <lb/>concern in which accused Subash Gupta had made <lb/>investment. She was not in a position to annoy or rebuke to <lb/>a good client of the concern in which she was working. She <lb/>could not have reflected her disappointment by throwing <lb/>tantrums and could not convey her disapproval of the <lb/>attempts made by Subash Gupta for developing an intimacy <lb/>by maintaining silence.&quot; <lb/>32. As regards circumstance (viii) regarding letters written by A-1 to show <lb/>his love for SS, the trial Court discussed the depositions of PWs-103, 108, <lb/>133 and 143. It analysed the writings themselves in depth and concluded as <lb/>under: <lb/>&quot;It is established on record that accused Subash Gupta was <lb/>obsessed with Sujata Shah and have a crush over her and <lb/>with whom he wanted to develop intimacy and the efforts <lb/>made by him in this regard were unfruitful but nothing <lb/>beyond that. Even in the statement under section 313 <lb/>Cr.P.C. accused Subash Gupta had admitted that he had an <lb/>inclination short of lust and infatuation towards Sujata <lb/>Shah.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>Other findings of the trial Court <lb/>33. The trial Court concluded that there was nothing to show that all the <lb/>accused had met at Hotel Mohan at Ashok Vihar on 5 th June 1996 to plan a <lb/>conspiracy. On the question of Subash Gupta having a meeting at the MCD <lb/>office and being &quot;last seen&apos; in the company of the deceased, the trial Court <lb/>concluded that the evidence did lend credence to the fact that a meeting did <lb/>take place at the MCD office at Okhla on 6 th June 1996 between A-1 and the <lb/>three deceased. However, there was no evidence to show the presence of Dr. <lb/>Hemant Kalra (A-5) at the MCD office or that he administered the injections <lb/>to the deceased as alleged by the prosecution. It was held that: <lb/>&quot;Though, presence of accused Subash Gupta, Doctor Suneel <lb/>Kaul, Deepa Gupta and Sujata Shah at the MCD office at <lb/>Okhla stands established and it also stands established that <lb/>whereabouts of Suneel Kaul, Deepa Gupta, Sujata Saha not <lb/>known thereafter and only their dead bodies were recovered <lb/>later on, yet, presence of other accused persons at MCD <lb/>office is not proved and there is no evidence on record in <lb/>this regard.&quot; <lb/>34. As a result, the trial Court concluded that &quot;it stands proved on record <lb/>that it is accused Subash Gupta who was last seen in the company of the <lb/>three deceased.&quot; <lb/>35. On the issue of association between the accused persons, the trial Court <lb/>came to the conclusion that although some of the accused may have been <lb/>associated with each other, their involvement in the commission of the crime <lb/>of killing the three deceased could not be established by the prosecution <lb/>beyond all reasonable doubt. In this process, the trial Court examined the <lb/>testimonies of the forensic witnesses and finger print experts. <lb/></body>

			<body>36. The trial Court then discussed the circumstance of recovery of the BMW <lb/>car from Hotel Leela Kempinski, Bombay belonging to A-1. In particular, <lb/>the trial Court discussed the recovery of the fibres (Ex.P-27 to P-30) from <lb/>the car which matched with the fibre of the bed sheets on which bodies of <lb/>SS and DG were wrapped. As regards the stay of A-1 and A-8 at the Leela <lb/>Hotel, the trial Court concluded that while it stood established from the <lb/>chance prints recovered from the glass in Room No.408 that A-1 stayed <lb/>there and he had also been seen by a security guard, there was no evidence <lb/>to show that A-8 was found in that room. The stay of the co-accused persons <lb/>at the hotel during the period of the commission of the crime and their arrest <lb/>was held not to have been proved in the manner alleged by the prosecution. <lb/>Circumstances proved and not proved <lb/>37. The trial Court summarised the position regarding the proof of the 85 <lb/>circumstances identified by it as under: <lb/>&quot;1. Accused Subash Gupta a member of PPL and Sujata Shah was <lb/>her counseller. This circumstance is proved. <lb/>2. Subash Gupta infatuated with Sujata Shah.

			<body>without caring for her reaction. Thus, the motive qua A-1 stood <lb/>established. <lb/>(2) A-1 was last seen in the company of the three deceased. <lb/>(3) A-1 was thereafter traced to Hotel Leela Kempinski, Bombay <lb/>along with his car after the police was informed by Anil Gupta <lb/>regarding his stay there. <lb/>(4) A-1 made a disclosure about using the phone of STD booth near <lb/>Hotel Chetan. Since he had pointed out the said place, this portion of <lb/>his disclosure statement was admissible under Section 27 of the <lb/>Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (IEA). The pointing out was also relevant <lb/>as conduct under Section 8 IEA. <lb/>(5) Recovery of blood stained threads and fibres matching with the <lb/>bed sheets which were used to wrap SS and DG from the BMW car of <lb/>A-1. <lb/>39. The trial Court held that the above circumstances formed a complete <lb/>chain, consistent with the guilt of A-1. The trial Court disbelieved the <lb/>defence put forth by A-1. It was inter alia observed that the two police <lb/>officers from PS Sahar who deposed in his favour as DWs had colluded with <lb/>him. <lb/>The present appeals <lb/>40.

			<body>remain as such. Effectively therefore, the State&quot;s appeal is against A-1, A-3 <lb/>to A-7 and A-9. <lb/>Submissions on behalf of A-1 <lb/>41. Mr. Mohit Mathur, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of A-1 <lb/>(Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 247/2000 and Respondent No. 1 in <lb/>Criminal Appeal No. first referred to the charges framed. He <lb/>submitted that: <lb/>(i) the entire case of the prosecution was projected as beginning with a <lb/>conspiracy between all the accused to eliminate the three deceased <lb/>whereas the charge sheet depicted it as conspiracy to only eliminate <lb/>SK whom A-1 saw coming in the way of having sole access to the <lb/>deceased SS. It is submitted that there was in fact no clear delineation <lb/>of the motive of all the accused to conspire to kill the three deceased. <lb/>(ii) In any event, the charge of conspiracy completely failed as there <lb/>was no evidence to prove it. In other words, the prosecution was <lb/>unable to prove the first charge, viz., that on 5 th June 1996 a meeting <lb/>took place at Mohan Hotel in Ashok Vihar in which all the accused <lb/>participated and where a conspiracy was hatched to kill the three <lb/>deceased by staging a kidnapping of the three deceased and A-1. Once <lb/>this charge failed, the very basis of the prosecution case had to fail as <lb/>in a case based wholly on circumstantial evidence, motive formed an <lb/>important circumstance without which the chain would not be <lb/>complete. <lb/>(iii) Even if A-1 had admitted to his being in love with SS, there was <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.A.247/2000 &amp; Crl.A.81/2003 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 29 of 55 <lb/></page>

			<body>absolutely no evidence to show that he wanted her killed. Even <lb/>according to the prosecution, A-1 had purchased a ring for her for her <lb/>birthday, i.e. the day he called her and SK and DG at the MCD Office. <lb/>Therefore, it was improbable that he also wanted to somehow kill her. <lb/>On the contrary, the charge sheet stated that in the staged kidnapping, <lb/>the plan was to have A-1 and SS kept together and to eliminate SK. <lb/>Therefore, what was sought to be proved by the prosecution at the <lb/>trial was not what was stated in the charge sheet. Therefore, there was <lb/>no motive for the crime proved by the prosecution, for A-1 to kill SS. <lb/>(iv) In any event, there was absolutely no motive for the killing of the <lb/>third deceased DG. <lb/>(v) Of the 85 circumstances outlined by the trial Court, only 15 were <lb/>held to be proved qua A-1. These 15 circumstances did not form a <lb/>complete chain and did not unerringly point to the guilt of A-1 for the <lb/>four charges framed against him. <lb/>(vi) The last seen evidence held by the trial Court to have been proved <lb/>was in fact not proved. While the evidence put forth by the <lb/>prosecution sought to prove that A-1 and the three deceased were at <lb/>the MCD Office at Okhla on the evening of 6 th June 1996, by no <lb/>means did the prosecution prove that it was A-1 alone who was with <lb/>the three deceased to the exclusion of everyone else. This was not <lb/>even the case of the prosecution. <lb/>(vii) The trial Court failed to appreciate how, on his own, without the <lb/></body>

			<body>involvement of the other accused (who were acquitted by the trial <lb/>Court), A-1 could have possibly abducted the three deceased, killed <lb/>each of them, thrown their bodies at different places and then reached <lb/>Mumbai with injection prick marks in both his arms and injuries in <lb/>front and rear of his chest. There was a huge, yawning gap in the <lb/>prosecution story which, according to the trial Court, formed the <lb/>complete chain of circumstances qua A-1 and, therefore, the trial <lb/>Court gravely erred in convicting him for the offence under Sections <lb/>302/364/411 IPC. <lb/>42. Mr. Mathur then focussed on each of the circumstances held to be <lb/>proved by the trial Court and pointed out that the analysis of the evidence by <lb/>the trial Court was flawed in relation to some of them. Certain crucial details <lb/>were either left out or presumed by the trial Court. For instance, when the <lb/>trial Court concluded that the accused had made a disclosure statement <lb/>regarding his making a call outside Chetan Hotel, the trial Court in fact erred <lb/>because that disclosure was not made by A-1 but by A-8. The pointing out <lb/>was also by A-8 and not by A-1. <lb/>43. Mr. Mathur further submitted that the trial Court failed to examine <lb/>whether the alternate theory put forth by the accused was plausible, <lb/>particularly with reference to the BMW car being found at Hotel Leela <lb/>Kempinski, Mumbai. There were some circumstances, according to Mr. <lb/>Mathur, which were not discussed at all in the judgment. For instance, <lb/>circumstances 17 and 65 to the effect that A-1 had absconded after the <lb/>meeting at the MCD office at Okhla on 6 th June 1996 was not discussed in <lb/></body>

			<body>the judgment, while the circumstance of the other accused absconding was <lb/>discussed. <lb/>44. Mr. Mathur pointed out that the 17 defence witnesses examined included <lb/>certain crucial witnesses who ought to have been examined by the <lb/>prosecution. These included Dr. S.K. Gupta (DW-13) who had medically <lb/>examined A-1 at AIIMS on 11 th June 1996 soon after he was brought <lb/>Delhi and two police officers of PS Sahar in Mumbai, DW-15 and DW-16. <lb/>Even Nitin Gupta, the son of A-1, who had given the complaint in the first <lb/>instance on the basis of which the case-FIR was registered was, for some <lb/>reason, not examined as a prosecution witness. He had to be examined as <lb/>DW-1. Further, the brother of A-1, Anil Gupta, who is supposed to have <lb/>informed the police about the presence of A-1 at Hotel Leela in Mumbai was <lb/>named as PW but finally dropped by the prosecution. There was no <lb/>satisfactory explanation for this. If the evidence of DWs was carefully <lb/>analysed, then the defence was probablised. There was no reason why the <lb/>defence evidence should be discarded. <lb/>Submissions on behalf of the prosecution <lb/>45. Ms. Anita Abraham and Ms. Radhika Kolluru, the learned Additional <lb/>Public Prosecutors (APPs), appeared on behalf of the State in both the <lb/>appeals and submitted as under: <lb/>(i) While motive was an important circumstance, the mere failure to <lb/>prove motive would not be fatal to the case of the prosecution if all <lb/>the other circumstances were established beyond reasonable doubt. <lb/>(ii) The statement of A-1 under Section 313 Cr PC itself was an <lb/></body>

			<body>admission of his being infatuated with SS and being under her control. <lb/>This was an important element of the motive concerning his <lb/>involvement in the crime. <lb/>(iii) The evidence clearly showed that A-1 had called for a meeting <lb/>with the three deceased at the MCD office in Okhla from where he <lb/>operated. Therefore, the prosecution was able to successfully show <lb/>that it was A-1 who was last seen with the three deceased. <lb/>(iv) The recovery of the car of SK near P.S. Hodal, the recovery of the <lb/>Maruti 800 outside the IGI airport used in the commission of the <lb/>crimes, and the recovery of the BMW car of A-1 outside Hotel Leela <lb/>in Mumbai were all clearly proved by the prosecution. <lb/>(v) That the death of the three deceased was homicidal and unnatural <lb/>was also clearly proved by the prosecution. <lb/>(vi) The BMW car belonging to A-1 was found with a blood-stained <lb/>mat. Although the blood group was unable to be matched with any of <lb/>the deceased, the blood-stained fibres and the fibre found in the BMW <lb/>car matched with the fibres of the cloth in which body of DG was <lb/>wrapped. This was an important circumstance linking A-1 with the <lb/>offence. <lb/>(vii) The prosecution was able to prove that it was A-1 who stayed at <lb/>Room No.408 in Hotel Leela, Mumbai. It was able to prove that his <lb/>specimen finger prints matched the chance prints found on the glass in <lb/></body>

			<body>Room No.408 at Hotel Leela. The bills for his stay were paid for by <lb/>the credit card of A-1. Further, A-1 was identified by security guard, <lb/>Prabhakar Raghu Dhote (PW-25). Apart from this, in his statement <lb/>under Section 313 Cr PC, A-1 did not dispute that he was at Hotel <lb/>Leela in Mumbai. <lb/>(viii) Qua each of the other accused, there was sufficient evidence to <lb/>show their involvement and the trial Court erred in holding those <lb/>circumstances to not to be proved. <lb/>Submissions on behalf of A-3 to A-5 <lb/>46. On behalf of Vibhore Singh @ Lavi, Vijay Mohan Sharma @ Mintoo, <lb/>Dr. Hemant Kalra (A-3 to A-5 and Respondent Nos. 3 to 5 in the State&quot;s <lb/>appeal), submissions were made by Mr. Ravinder Tyagi, the learned counsel <lb/>as under: <lb/>(i) From the statement of the witnesses examined by the prosecution <lb/>to prove the first charge of meeting being held by the accused at Hotel <lb/>Mohan in Ashok Vihar on 5 th June 1996, no evidence emerges to <lb/>show that any of the accused persons was staying at Hotel Mohan, <lb/>Ashok Vihar at any point of time. <lb/>(ii) As regards meeting at the MCD office, Okhla the relevant <lb/>witnesses were PWs 1, 4, 6, 10, 11, 22, 28, 82, 83. These witnesses <lb/>did not speak about seeing any of the accused with the A-1 at the <lb/>MCD Office. Seema Shah Ahuja (PW-28), an employee of PPL, <lb/>Sukumar Saha (PW-10), father of SS, Rajesh Gupta (PW-11), <lb/>husband of DG, and Dr. Shobha Kaul (PW-83), wife of SK, all only <lb/></body>

			<body>deposed that the three deceased had left for MCD office. They were <lb/>not witnesses to prove who else was present at the MCD office. <lb/>(iii) What was found in the MCD office by the police also did not <lb/>connect any of the accused as far as their presence in the MCD office <lb/>was concerned. Even the presence of A-5 could not be proved. DW-<lb/>16 who was in charge of the medical store could not say whether it <lb/>was A-5 who had purchased the injections from his shop. The <lb/>prosecution had failed to collect any evidence from the LNJP Hospital <lb/>where A-5 was supposed to be working. There was no evidence to <lb/>show that the injection vials that were recovered from the MCD office <lb/>on 6 th -7 th June 1996 were in fact deposited in the police malkhana till <lb/>8 th June 1996. Even in the scaled site plan, the presence of ampoules <lb/>of saline outside the site office of MCD office was not shown. <lb/>(iv) No examination of SK&apos;s body for presence of diazepam was <lb/>undertaken. There were also no injection prick marks on the body of <lb/>SK recovered a day after the murder. <lb/>(v) As far as A-4, Vinay Mohan, was concerned, it is a case of wrong <lb/>person being roped in. One Vijay Mohan from Baroda ought to have <lb/>been arrested and not Vinay Mohan. The evidence of PW-13 and PW-<lb/>16 show that A-8 and A-9 were arrested together and Deepak Das @ <lb/>Kamal @ Shailey (A-2) and Vinay Kumar were arrested. The two <lb/>prosecution witnesses examined to show the association of the <lb/>accused, i.e. PW-16 and PW-38 (Dr. Yash Rawat) were both declared <lb/>hostile and did not support the prosecution. <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 35 of 55 <lb/></page>

			<body>(vi) There was also discrepancy in the time of arrest of these accused. <lb/>It is pointed out that A-6 was already lodged in a jail in Meerut <lb/>between 20 th March 1996 and 11 th June, 1996 and, therefore, the <lb/>question of his absconding or being arrested by the prosecution in the <lb/>manner indicated did not arise. <lb/>(vii) Vijay Mohan was, in fact, in a lock up between 22 nd and 23 rd <lb/>June 1996 and it is at that time that the mobile phone used by A-1 is <lb/>supposed to have been recovered from him. This contradicts the fact <lb/>that even on 13 th June 1996 the police knew the cell number and had <lb/>sent SI Ram Lal to collect the CDRs. This proved that the phone and <lb/>battery chargers were planted on accused Vijay Mohan and it in all <lb/>probability were recovered from the residence of A-1 since it was <lb/>throughout in the possession of DW-1. <lb/>Law relating to circumstantial evidence <lb/>47.1 Before commencing the discussion of the submissions, this Court <lb/>would like to recapitulate the well settled principles governing <lb/>circumstantial evidence. In State of Tamil Nadu v. Rajendran (1999) 8 SCC <lb/>679 it was held: <lb/>&quot;... the law is fairly well settled that in a case of circumstantial <lb/>evidence, the cumulative effect of all the circumstances proved, must <lb/>be such as to negative the innocence of the accused and to bring home <lb/>the charge beyond reasonable doubt. It has been held by a series of <lb/>decisions of this Court that the circumstances proved must lead to no <lb/>other inference except that of guilt of accused.&quot; <lb/>47.2 In Trimukh Maroti Kalan v. State of Maharashtra (2006) 10 SCC <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.A.247/2000 &amp; Crl.A.81/2003 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 36 of 55 <lb/></page>

			<body>681, the Supreme Court held: <lb/>&quot;The normal principle in a case based on circumstantial evidence is <lb/>that the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be <lb/>drawn must be cogently and firmly established; that those <lb/>circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing <lb/>towards the guilt of the accused; that the circumstances taken <lb/>cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape <lb/>from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was <lb/>committed by the accused and they should be incapable of <lb/>explanation on any hypothesis other than that of the guilt of the <lb/>accused and inconsistent with his innocence. <lb/>47.3 The importance of their having to be a continuity in the chain of <lb/>circumstances and their having to be viewed as a whole was emphasissed in <lb/>Ram Avtar v. State 1985 Supp SCC 410 in the following words: <lb/>&quot;...circumstantial evidence must be complete and conclusive before an <lb/>accused can be convicted thereon. This, however, does not mean that <lb/>there is any particular or special method of proof of circumstantial <lb/>evidence. We must, however, guard against the danger of not <lb/>considering circumstantial evidence in its proper perspective, e.g., <lb/>where there is a chain of circumstances linked up with one another, <lb/>it is not possible for the court to truncate and break the chain of <lb/>circumstances. In other words where a series of circumstances are <lb/>dependent on one another they should be read as one integrated whole <lb/>and not considered separately, otherwise the very concept of proof of <lb/>circumstantial evidence would be defeated.&quot; <lb/>Analysis and Reasons <lb/>48. The Court would first like to discuss the first charge, viz., that all the <lb/>accused met at Hotel Mohan in Ashok Vihar on 5 th June 1996 to hatch a plan <lb/>to eliminate the three deceased. The trial Court has, after a very detailed <lb/>analysis of the evidence, come to the conclusion that this circumstance is not <lb/>proved. <lb/></body>

			<body>49. A careful perusal of the charge sheet as well as the supplementary <lb/>charge sheet shows that the case put forth by the prosecution is only that all <lb/>the accused met to plan to eliminate SK. There was no plan, even according <lb/>to the prosecution, to eliminate SS or DG. In order to prove this charge, the <lb/>prosecution had to first prove that A-1 was madly in love with SS and <lb/>wanted to get her at any cost. He was prepared to eliminate SK who was <lb/>seen by him as coming in the way. The Court finds that in outlining the <lb/>circumstances in this regard, the trial Court has not followed any particular <lb/>chronological sequence. The circumstances as outlined by the trial Court in <lb/>this regard, read as under: <lb/>&quot;1. Accused Subash Gupta a member of PPL and Sujata Saha <lb/>was her counseller. <lb/>2. Subash Gupta infatuated with Sujata Saha. <lb/>3. Subash Gupta purchased a diamond ring for Sujata Saha to <lb/>be presented on her birthday on 6.6.96. <lb/>4. Subash Gupta purchased air tickets for Sujata Saha and her <lb/>family. <lb/>5. Subash Gupta engaged a private detective to have <lb/>surveillance on her and ascertain her relations, if any, with <lb/>Doctor Kaul. <lb/>6. Followed Sujata Saha at Balaji. <lb/>7. Got followed Sujata Saha at Shirdi by accused Ravi Prakash <lb/>8. Subash Gupta used to make calls to Sujata Saha from his cell <lb/>phone at her office as well as at her residence. <lb/>9. Wrote letters to Sujata Saha expressing her love. <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 38 of 55 <lb/></page>

			<body>10. Accused Subash Gupta threatened to kill Sujata Saha if he <lb/>does not get her, which threat was conveyed through writings <lb/>made in a diary presented by him to Sujata Saha. <lb/>11. The accused persons met at Hotel Mohan to carry out <lb/>conspiracy of kidnapping and murdering Sujata Saha, Deepa <lb/>Gupta and Doctor Kaul.&quot; <lb/>50. Apart from the fact that the above circumstances do not follow any <lb/>chronological sequence, it can immediately be seen that the circumstance of <lb/>purchasing the diamond ring for SS to be presented to her on 6 th June 1996 <lb/>is actually subsequent to the purchase of the air tickets and following SS to <lb/>Tirupati Balaji. The circumstance of keeping her under surveillance by <lb/>engaging PW-8 is subsequent to following her at Shirdi. The circumstance <lb/>of making calls and writing letters to SS did not follow any particular <lb/>sequence. There are no particular dates. <lb/>51. While circumstance No.1, that A-1 was a member of PPL and SS was <lb/>his Counsellor definitely stands proved, inasmuch as it is not even denied by <lb/>A-1, what is not proved is that he in fact threatened to kill her. This threat is <lb/>supposed to be found written in diary (Ex.PW-10/A) which is produced by <lb/>Sukumar Saha (PW-10) on 18 th June 1996 while searching for documents of <lb/>his daughter in the almirah of his elder daughter Swarna Saha. The other <lb/>witness who deposed about the recovery of this diary was Rakesh Manocha <lb/>(PW-143), the brother-in-law of SS. Further, as pointed out by the trial <lb/>Court, this circumstance was only partly proved. Two hand-writing experts <lb/>were examined, one by the prosecution (PW-108) and the other by the <lb/>defence (DW-2). <lb/></body>

			<body>52. As noted by the trial Court, the questioned writings to the effect &quot;If you <lb/>do not become mine, I will murder you and same time I will make to suicide <lb/>myself&quot; are Q-31 and Q-29. In the report of PW-108 (Ex.Q-108/F-1) it was <lb/>opined to be in the handwriting of A-1. In this regard, specific finding of the <lb/>trial Court is as under: <lb/>&quot;So far as Q. 31 is concerned where it written that if you not <lb/>becomes mine I murdered you and same time I meet to suicide <lb/>myself is concerned: in my opinion the same cannot be read in <lb/>isolation from the contents of the rest of the diary and should <lb/>not be extracted and read separately so as to constitute a threat. <lb/>As in the entire diary and in the question writing the accused <lb/>Subash Gupta has not used any harsh words against Sujata Shah <lb/>and has only expressed his fondness and obsession and <lb/>intention to have intimacy with her. Even in Q.31 besides <lb/>stating that he will murder her he has also written that he will <lb/>also commit suicide which at best can be expression of <lb/>frustration because of love. Literal meaning to such words <lb/>cannot be extended as it is only by way of expression of one&quot;s <lb/>feelings. More important in this regard is the fact that this diary <lb/>as per the prosecution was found in the almirah of Sujata Shah <lb/>and naturally it is she who must have placed it there and to <lb/>whom the diary it can be said, was handed over by Subash <lb/>Gupta himself or through some other person. But the very fact <lb/>that Sujata Shah kept that diary in an almirah and herself had <lb/>not taken the wordings in Q. 31 in its literal sense as P.W.10. <lb/>The father of Sujata Shah had admitted that Sujata Shah never <lb/>complained with regard to any threat on behalf of accused <lb/>Subash Gupta, and had rather taken it at best to be an <lb/>overreaching by a customer with the concern where she was <lb/>employed.&quot; <lb/>53. The above analysis appears to be plausible and reasonable. In fact, when <lb/>these writings are seen in the proper context, it is not as if A-1 wanted to <lb/>eliminate SS. It rather depicted his infatuation with her. Even otherwise, it <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">Crl.A.247/2000 &amp; Crl.A.81/2003 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 40 of 55 <lb/></page>

			<body>seems completely contradictory that if A-1 wanted to eliminate SS, he <lb/>would be purchasing a diamond ring to present it to her as a gift on her <lb/>birthday i.e. 6 th June 1996. All that it does show, as already noticed by the <lb/>trial Court, is that A-1 was in fact obsessed with SS but not to the extent of <lb/>wanting to eliminate her. Therefore, the Court is unable to agree with the <lb/>trial Court that there was a motive for A-1 to eliminate SS. <lb/>54. As far as the motive for eliminating DG is concerned, there is not a shred <lb/>of evidence anywhere in the entire record, whereby the prosecution has been <lb/>able to prove that such a motive did exist. The trial Court also failed to find <lb/>any motive whatsoever for the killing of DG much less any conspiracy <lb/>between the accused persons to that effect. <lb/>55. None of the 11 circumstances regarding the motive of A-1 to eliminate <lb/>SS was proved. As pointed out by the trial Court. the prosecution was only <lb/>able to show that A-1 was infatuated with SS but that this was short of lust <lb/>as admitted by himself in his statement under Section 313 Cr PC. <lb/>56. With this background, if one revisits the first charge, viz., the conspiracy <lb/>at Hotel Mohan, one of the witnesses to prove this was the Manager of the <lb/>hotel, PW-121, Anil Saluja. A careful perusal of his evidence reveals that a <lb/>person in the name of Sharad Gupta had stayed on 5 th June 1996 giving his <lb/>address as 186 Civil Lines, North Muzaffarnagar U.P. He was only able to <lb/>prove the bills dated 26 th April, 27 th April, 3 rd May 1996 relating to Room <lb/>No.110 which was booked in the name of Sharad Gupta. He said nothing <lb/>about the stay of any of the accused persons at the hotel at any point in time. <lb/></body>

			<body>57. The second witness from Hotel Mohan was Ganga Sagar Shukla (PW-<lb/>122). He did not recognise any of the accused as being present at the hotel. <lb/>He was working there as a waiter. In other words, he turned hostile and <lb/>failed to support the prosecution. The third witness was Sandeep Rana (PW-<lb/>123) who worked as a Cashier at the same hotel. All he could say is that the <lb/>police took into possession the Booking Register. He too did not support the <lb/>prosecution in any other manner. As a result, none of the three witnesses <lb/>examined by the prosecution to prove the first charge supported the case of <lb/>the prosecution. <lb/>58. The learned APPs for the State were unable to show what was the <lb/>substantial evidence led by the prosecution, and ignored by the trial Court, <lb/>as far as the first charge is concerned. The above evidence clearly was <lb/>wholly inadequate to prove the first charge. <lb/>59. If the said charge, viz., the charge of conspiracy to kill the three accused, <lb/>punishable under Section 120-B IPC, fails then the entire edifice of the <lb/>prosecution case gets severely shaken. This was a case involving the murder <lb/>of three adults, one male and two females. If the accused, 10 in number, had <lb/>not come together to plot their killing as was alleged by the prosecution, <lb/>then the motive for the crime itself disappeared. This is a glaring aspect <lb/>which cannot be overlooked. <lb/>60. Even before this Court, the prosecution has not been able to improve <lb/>upon what was placed before the trial Court. It has not been able to show <lb/>that the analysis of the evidence of the trial Court and its conclusion that the <lb/>charge of conspiracy is not proved suffers from perversity. The Court is, <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 42 of 55 <lb/></page>

			<body>therefore, unable to come to a conclusion different from that reached by the <lb/>trial Court in this regard. <lb/>61. With there being no proof of the motive for the crime, the Court is <lb/>unable to appreciate how when it came to discussing the role of A-1, the <lb/>trial Court could simply conclude that there was motive for A-1 to eliminate <lb/>SS. In this regard it must be pointed out, at the cost of repetition, that the <lb/>prosecution story was not that A-1 had motive to kill SS but that he had a <lb/>motive to kill SK. There is nothing in the charge sheets which even remotely <lb/>points to any conspiracy to kill either SS or DG. Therefore, the starting point <lb/>for the trial Court to convict A-1, viz., that he had a motive to kill the three <lb/>deceased is itself flawed. <lb/>62. As regards the motive to kill SK, the trial Court itself found that the <lb/>prosecution story that A-1 suspected that SK was having an affair with SS <lb/>and engaged PW-8 to undertake a surveillance of her activities was held by <lb/>the trial Court not to be proved. The learned APP for the State relied on the <lb/>evidence of Kamal Singh (PW-8) in this regard. <lb/>63. This Court has, with the assistance of learned counsel of the parties, <lb/>perused the evidence of PW-8. He is unable to explain how no form was <lb/>filled by A-1 for engaging his services. This despite stating that &quot;normally <lb/>all columns, when a form is filled for engaging us, are filled up&quot;. There is <lb/>not even a signature of A-1 on the form. PW-8 was unable to produce any <lb/>income tax returns filed by him. The Form Ex.PW-8/A which was produced <lb/>by him to show that he was engaged by A-1 was filled in his own hand. It is <lb/>further strange that PW-8 states that he handed over the reports to A-1 and <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 43 of 55 <lb/></page>

			<body>that he did not retain any copy thereof. No such report was recovered from <lb/>A-1. PW-8 further states that &quot;I have not carried the investigation of my <lb/>own. It is my employees who have carried out the investigations. I do not <lb/>know whether those persons who were carrying out the investigations were <lb/>examined by the police or not.&quot; All these raise serious doubts as to whether <lb/>in fact any such investigation was undertaken by PW-8 at the behest of A-1. <lb/>If indeed the employees of PW-8 had carried out such investigations, then <lb/>the prosecution had to explain why such employees were not examined as <lb/>prosecution witnesses. <lb/>64. Further, although PW-8 states that he charged Rs.4,000/-per day and <lb/>was engaged for 15 days, he was able to prepare a report only after receiving <lb/>Rs.30,000/-from A-1. PW-8 was also unable to produce copies of any <lb/>receipt that he may have issued for the payments made to him by A-1. His <lb/>understanding of who could be said to be of a good character also raises <lb/>serious doubts on whether in fact PW-8 carried out any investigation. <lb/>65. On an analysis of the evidence of PW-8, the Court is inclined to concur <lb/>with the trial Court that this is not at all a trustworthy or reliable witness. He <lb/>has been rightly disbelieved by the trial Court. The net effect is that the <lb/>circumstance put forth by the prosecution that A-1 was upset or suspected <lb/>that SK was having an affair with SS and was coming in the way, has not <lb/>been proved at all by the prosecution. The important element of a motive for <lb/>A-1 to eliminate SK has not been proved by the prosecution. <lb/>66. It must be recalled that according to A-1, he was lured into investing <lb/>more money into PPL by SS. His incentive was that he was going to be paid <lb/></body>

			<body>36% interest. It was for this reason that a draft agreement was drawn up and <lb/>was going to be discussed on 6 th June, 1996 in the evening at the MCD <lb/>office at Okhla. This is perfectly plausible but is clearly inconsistent with the <lb/>prosecution story that a meeting was called only to stage a kidnapping of <lb/>three deceased. The evidence on record in fact does not prove that the <lb/>meeting was called by A-1 for staging a kidnapping. <lb/>67. As regards the meeting at the MCD office, the evidence of Seema Shah <lb/>(PW-28) an employee of PPL proves that DG had informed her that she, <lb/>along with SK and SS, had to meet A-1 at 7 pm. Likewise, Sukumar Saha <lb/>(PW-10) also proves that SK and DG had come to his house to pick up SS <lb/>between 6.30 and 7 pm on 6 th February, 1996. This is concurred with by <lb/>PW-11, Rajesh Gupta and PW-83, Shobha Kaul. All of this is consistent <lb/>with the statement of A-1 in Section 313 of Cr PC that he did call for a <lb/>meeting at the MCD Office to discuss the agreement regarding opening of a <lb/>new branch of PPL at Vikas Marg. Therefore, this hardly advances the case <lb/>of the prosecution as far as the conspiracy to stage a kidnapping is <lb/>concerned. There is no shred of evidence to prove that. <lb/>68. The presence of SK at MCD Office is also strengthened by the fact that <lb/>his driving license (DL) was found there. This is spoken to by ASI CB <lb/>Upadhyay (PW-6). It must, however, be noted that the prosecution case is <lb/>that DW-1 handed over to the police the DL of SK. However, this is denied <lb/>by DW-1. Be that as it may, the fact remains that there is nothing to show <lb/>that all the accused were present at the MCD Office at the time when so-<lb/>called staged kidnapping happened. The version of A-1, on the other hand, is <lb/></body>

			<body>that they were suddenly surrounded by 2/3 young men at pistol point who <lb/>started beating them and asked A-1 to write a ransom note. He further stated <lb/>that two of them gave a poisonous injection to SK and one each to SS and <lb/>DG. They also gave A-1 an injection, which was not poisonous. <lb/>69. The medical examination of A-1 at the AIIMS on 11 th June 1996 after <lb/>his arrest, was done by DW-13 who has clearly spoken about noticing two <lb/>injection pricks on both his arms. It also showed the presence of diazepam in <lb/>his blood. The injuries on his front chest and the rear of his chest are also <lb/>consistent with the fact that he himself would have been under sedation and <lb/>not aware of what was happening till he became conscious and found <lb/>himself at Hotel Leela. The Court is, therefore, not able to agree with the <lb/>trial Court when it states that A-1 is last seen in the company of the three <lb/>deceased to make it appear that there was no one else at that time. The case <lb/>of the prosecution is not that it is A-1 alone who was with the three deceased <lb/>at the MCD Office. The case of the prosecution is that all of the ten accused <lb/>were there pursuant to the conspiracy hatched by them on 5 th June 1996 at <lb/>Hotel Mohan in Ashok Vihar. Therefore, it is futile for the prosecution now <lb/>to try and demonstrate that A-1 could have done the entire crime on his own <lb/>to the exclusion of all the accused. <lb/>70. To be fair to the State, it is in appeal before this Court only because it <lb/>sees the futility of the above result brought about by the judgment of the trial <lb/>Court. It is either that all the accused did get together to commit the murder <lb/>of the three deceased or that none of them did. It does not stand to logic that <lb/>A-1 could somehow have, on his own, got the three deceased abducted, <lb/></body>

			<body>murdered and their dead body disposed of. It is inconceivable how such a <lb/>result could have been arrived at by the trial Court which runs contrary to <lb/>the entire story of the prosecution. <lb/>71. Where there are multiple murders involved and a complex set of facts <lb/>where abduction happened at one place and the murders in different <lb/>locations and the bodies being thrown in different locations, it is impossible <lb/>for one person to single-handedly do all of those acts. Therefore, even for <lb/>this reason, the judgment of the trial Court insofar as it convicts A-1 for the <lb/>aforementioned offences does not stand to reason at all. <lb/>72. The third circumstance that has been held by the trial Court to be proved <lb/>against A-1 is about his being absconding and being traced ultimately at <lb/>Hotel Leela Kempinski in Mumbai. In this regard the conclusion drawn by <lb/>the trial Court that the two policemen at PS Sahar, i.e., DW-15 and DW-16 <lb/>were colluding with A-1 is, to say the least, completely without any basis. <lb/>The evidence of both those witnesses shows that there was no need for them <lb/>to be supporting A-1 against the Delhi Police. They appeared to be speaking <lb/>from the report. Indeed, they had recorded the statement of A-1 which was <lb/>marked in evidence. Whether recording of such a statement was necessary is <lb/>solely beside the point. The fact of the matter was that such a statement was <lb/>in fact recorded. <lb/>73. In that statement, A-1 explains that he was unconscious and unaware of <lb/>what transpired between 6 th and 10 th June 1996 when he was being <lb/>examined by them. This is completely consistent with the version of A-1 and <lb/>could not have been simply brushed aside by the trial Court. Even the <lb/></body>

			<body>learned counsel for the State has no logical or convincing explanation for the <lb/>failure of the Delhi Police -who admit to going to Bombay and meeting the <lb/>officials of PS Sahar as seen through the evidence of PW-141 and DW-100 -<lb/>to produce the witnesses from PS Sahar. Why the prosecution also did not <lb/>produce DW-13 as its witness when he was the Doctor who examined A-1 at <lb/>AIIMS on 11 th June 1996 soon after his arrest is again not satisfactorily <lb/>explained. This was a crucial piece of evidence which would have <lb/>completed the chain and given a clear picture as to the circumstances under <lb/>which A-1 was apprehended at Hotel Leela in Mumbai. <lb/>74. The Court repeatedly enquired of the learned APP for the State whether <lb/>there existed a possibility that someone else, other than A-1, could have <lb/>driven the BMW car from the MCD office to Hotel Leela in Bombay. The <lb/>Court has not been given a satisfactory answer in this regard. <lb/>75. As regards the recovery of blood stained mat from the car and fibres <lb/>which purportedly were similar to the bed sheet in which the dead body of <lb/>DG was wrapped, the fact to be noticed is that the car remained in the <lb/>custody of the police between 10 th June 1996 (when it was found) and 13 th <lb/>June 1996 (when it was brought back to Delhi) and examined by the CFSL <lb/>at Delhi. That the BMW car has been in the custody of the police and that <lb/>the recoveries of these articles, namely, blood stained mats and fibres being <lb/>made not in the presence of A-1 or any independent witnesses, such <lb/>recoveries lose all significance. <lb/>76. This could not be said to be recoveries pursuant to any statement made <lb/>or disclosure made by A-1 under Section 27 of the Act. It was made at the <lb/></body>

			<body>time when the vehicle was entirely in the control and custody of the police. <lb/>Therefore, not much importance can be attached to such recoveries. While <lb/>on this circumstance, it should also be noticed that the blood stains on the <lb/>mat are not shown to match the blood group of any of the deceased persons. <lb/>The report of Dr. O.S. Srivastava (PW-96) is relevant in that regard. Further <lb/>Dr. J.D. Gupta, CFSL (PW-93) examined the fibres lifted from the BMW <lb/>car. While he said that these fibres were similar with those in the bed sheet <lb/>in which DG&apos;s body was wrapped, he did not state that the fibres were <lb/>&quot;identical&quot;. To a similar effect is the opinion of C.K. Jain which was sought <lb/>to be proved by Investigating Officer (PW-141) under Section 293 Cr.P.C. <lb/>77. Consequently, merely because the above blood stained mat and fibres <lb/>were recovered from the car belonging to A-1, it cannot be said that A-1 was <lb/>the one who drove the car with those articles in the car and with the <lb/>knowledge of the incriminating nature of those articles. There is a huge gap <lb/>in the prosecution story in this regard which is not sought to be filled up <lb/>with any cogent evidence. <lb/>78. As regards the chance prints on the glass in Room No.408 of Hotel <lb/>Leela, the mere fact that it matched the specimen prints of A-1, did not go to <lb/>show that he was linked with the crime of the murders of the three deceased. <lb/>All it showed was that he was in the room No. 408. He does not explain the <lb/>circumstances under which he was in that room. <lb/>79. Learned APP for the State pointed out that huge bills in the sum of <lb/>Rs. 14,000 were run up by A-1 during his stay in Hotel Leela and he himself <lb/>paid these bills using his credit card. In this regard, it seems that A-1 was <lb/></body>

			<body>arrested on 10 th October 1996 itself. From the evidence of DWs 15 and 16, it <lb/>is plain that he was taken to the police station there. When PW-141 and PW-<lb/>100 reached P.S. Sahar at 2:30 p.m., A-1 was already there. The payment of <lb/>the bill is shown to be made at 5:37 p.m. in the evening which was much <lb/>after A-1 was taken away by the police of PS Sahar. Any payment made <lb/>during the time he was already in custody of the police cannot be said to be <lb/>a voluntary payment made by A-1 of the bills of Leela Hotel. Merely <lb/>because the bills were paid using his credit card would not mean that it was <lb/>A-1 who booked the room at Leela Hotel. There is no proof that A-1 himself <lb/>signed the register when the room was booked in the first instance. <lb/>80. PW-145 was a guard of Leela Hotel. He is supposed to have identified <lb/>A-1, whereas another employee, PW-129 could not. Be that as it may, the <lb/>mere fact that he was seen by one of them in the hotel room will again not <lb/>satisfactorily explain the circumstances under which he was found in that <lb/>room. This did not prove that A-1 somehow absconded after he was last <lb/>seen at the MCD Office and emerged at Leela Hotel on his own by driving <lb/>the BMW car himself from the MCD Office to Leela Hotel. <lb/>81. In this context, it must be noticed that in the charge sheet the prosecution <lb/>states that it was A-2, Pinky and A-3, Chaudhary who in fact drove the <lb/>BMW car having A-1, SS and DG from there to Meerut, in the first instance. <lb/>It is not the case of the prosecution that A-1 somehow alone drove the BMW <lb/>car from the MCD Office together with the dead bodies of SS and DG. <lb/>82. The further circumstance that is said to have been proved against A-1 is <lb/>his making the call using the phone at the STD booth in front of Hotel <lb/></body>

			<body>Chetan. There has been a total misreading of the evidence by the trial Court <lb/>in this regard. Nand Kishore (PW-75) was working at the said STD Booth <lb/>outside Hotel Chetan in District Duliya in Maharashtra. On 8 th June 1996 a <lb/>call was made from there at 9.45 pm to phone number 6470435. The print <lb/>outs of the calls made was exhibited as Ex. PW75/A. There was nothing to <lb/>show that it was A-1 who made these calls. <lb/>83. PW-64 Vijay Singh of MTNL only proved that the said telephone <lb/>number 6470435 was installed at Dish Restaurant in Greater Kailash-II <lb/>whose proprietor was Subash Gupta. What was overlooked is the evidence <lb/>of the IO, PW-141 and ASI Shiv Singh (PW-103) who stated that it was <lb/>A-8, Ravi Prakash who led the police to the STD booth pursuant to his <lb/>disclosure statement. Therefore, it was not the disclosure statement of A-1 <lb/>that led the police to the STD booth as wrongly noticed by the trial Court. <lb/>Therefore, this pointing out by A-8 could not be read as evidence against <lb/>A-1 by any stretch of imagination. There was nothing in fact to show that it <lb/>is A-1 who made the call from the STD booth. <lb/>84. Consequently, none of the circumstances which the trial Court has held <lb/>as proved against A-1, in fact, stand proved against him. The Court is, <lb/>therefore, unable to concur with the conclusion of the trial Court as regards <lb/>the guilt of A-1 for the offence with which he was charged. He is entitled to <lb/>the benefit of doubt. <lb/>85. As regards each of the other accused, there has been a very detailed <lb/>discussion in the trial Court judgment of the circumstance qua each of them. <lb/></body>

			<body>The Court would only like to discuss the evidence as far as A-3 (Vibhore <lb/>Singh), A-4 (Vijay Mohan) and A-5 (Hemant Kalra) are concerned. As far <lb/>as A-3 is concerned, although he refused the TIP, all that was the only <lb/>evidence against him is that six finger prints lifted from the Maruti 800 Car <lb/>matched with the left thumb mark (S3) of A-3. <lb/>86. It is sought to be contended that the Maruti 800 car which was found <lb/>outside IGI Airport contained digital diaries with the numbers of A-1 and <lb/>A-5. The said digital diaries do not appear to have been proved in <lb/>accordance with law and, therefore, has rightly not been relied upon by the <lb/>trial Court. The mere fact that one Gold Bangle having daanedar design <lb/>(Ex.P-27) was found in possession of A-3 is again insufficient to link him to <lb/>the crime. Interestingly, there was no TIP for identifying the said bangle as <lb/>belonging to either SS or DG. The mere fact that A-3 was arrested from <lb/>Delhi Cantonment is again an insufficient circumstance. It has come in the <lb/>evidence of ASI Saheb Singh (PW-21) that from noon on 22 nd June 2006 to <lb/>23 rd June 2006, Vibhore Singh, Hemant Kalra and Vijay Mohan were in the <lb/>police lock up. Since they were already in the lock up, the question of A-3 <lb/>being arrested on 22 nd June 2006 from Gopinath Bazar at 5 pm was not <lb/>proved. <lb/>87. As regards Hemant Kalra (A-5) his purchase of ampoules from the Super <lb/>Bazar of LNJP, whose in-charge was Subash Oberoi (PW-16), was not <lb/>proved. PW-16 could not recognize Hemant Kalra as the person who had <lb/>purchased the ampoules. No name of the purchaser on the bill (Ex.PW-16/C) <lb/>was mentioned. There was a name of Hemant Kalra on the other bill <lb/></body>

			<body>(Ex.PW-16/B). Apart from this, there was nothing to show the presence of <lb/>Hemant Kalra at the MCD Office. The police also failed to collect any <lb/>evidence from LNJP where A-5 is stated to have been working. The non-<lb/>deposit of the ampoules immediately at the malkhana also gave reasonable <lb/>suspicion as regards the linking of the said ampoules with A-5. Even in the <lb/>scaled site plan (Ex.PW-77/C) the location of the ampoules was not shown <lb/>at the MCD Office. In the considered view of the Court, the trial Court was, <lb/>therefore, justified in coming to the conclusion that there was insufficient <lb/>evidence as far as A-5 was concerned. <lb/>88. As regards Vijay Mohan (A-4), he is shown to have been in custody at <lb/>Meerut from 20 th March 1996 to 11 th June 1996. He is mistaken for A-6 <lb/>(Vinay). There is a wrong mention of the name of Vijay Mohan instead of <lb/>Vinay Kumar who is stated to have been arrested from Baroda on <lb/>19 th June 1996. The evidence in regard to these two accused were, therefore, <lb/>rightly disbelieved by the trial Court. <lb/>89. There is no sufficient evidence linking any of these accused to the crime <lb/>and in particular even to the recovery of the stolen articles. None of the <lb/>recoveries were in the presence of any independent witness and when <lb/>viewed in the overall context, these recoveries cannot be believed. This <lb/>Court has examined the evidence in respect of each of the other accused, <lb/>that is, Deepak Das and Kamal @ Shailey and Vinay Kumar and concurs <lb/>that the conclusion reached by the trial Court that the evidence against each <lb/>of them is wholly insufficient to bring home their guilt. <lb/></body>

			<body>Failure of investigation <lb/>90. This was a case of circumstantial evidence with the police having to <lb/>investigate the murder of three adults in peculiar circumstances. The police <lb/>filed a charge sheet and then a supplementary one, setting out to prove that <lb/>there was a conspiracy by ten persons to kill the three deceased. The trial <lb/>Court found no evidence of conspiracy. Neither did it find any evidence to <lb/>convict nine of the ten accused persons put on trial. Yet it held A-1 guilty of <lb/>committing the three murders all by himself although this was never the case <lb/>of the prosecution. As this Court has reasoned, the evidence placed on <lb/>record does not even remotely substantiate such a conclusion. <lb/>91. The murder of three persons in the &quot;Personal Point&quot; case attracted <lb/>considerable media attention when it happened in 1996. The details of the <lb/>investigation, to which the media was privy, shaped public perception about <lb/>the guilt of those put on trial. Two decades later, when that perception is not <lb/>borne out, it invites a reflection on the criminal justice process. Courts must <lb/>test the evidence gathered during investigation in the calm interiors of court <lb/>halls, uninfluenced by the discussions in the media. Objective criteria, <lb/>evolved over the years and fine tuned by judicial precedents, are applied by <lb/>the Court to evaluate the credibility of the prosecution&quot;s case and the <lb/>defence of the accused. Not infrequently, the Court disagrees with the <lb/>prosecution about the guilt of those put on trial. This is because, as the <lb/>Supreme Court pointed out long ago in Kashmira Singh v. State of Madhya <lb/>Pradesh AIR 1952 SC 159, if a murder is &quot;a particularly cruel and revolting <lb/>one&quot;, then &quot;for that reason it will be necessary to examine the evidence with <lb/>more than ordinary care lest the shocking nature of the crime induce an <lb/></body>

			<body>instinctive reaction against a dispassionate judicial scrutiny of the facts and <lb/>law&quot;. <lb/>92. Also, as cautioned in Akhilesh Hajam v. State of Bihar 1995 Supp (3) <lb/>SCC 357, &quot;though it appears to us that in all probability the appellant may <lb/>be the culprit but probabilities and moral convictions have no place or any <lb/>role to play to convict a person in the absence of legal evidence. There is a <lb/>long distance to be travelled between the expression &quot;may be&quot; and &quot;must <lb/>be&quot;. However strong emotional considerations may be, but the same cannot <lb/>take the place of proof.&quot; <lb/>93. Unless the evidence presented before the Court passes legal muster, it <lb/>will not be possible for the Court to agree with the conclusions reached in <lb/>the charge sheets presented by the prosecution before it. The process of trial <lb/>tests whether the distance from &quot;may have committed the crime&quot; to &quot;has <lb/>beyond reasonable doubt committed the crime&quot; has been covered. In this <lb/>case, the prosecution has failed to complete that journey. Suspicion, <lb/>however strong, cannot and should not substitute proof. A dispassionate <lb/>adjudication should be impervious to public perceptions of who might or <lb/>might not be guilty. The present case points to a failure of investigation <lb/>which has the inevitable result of acquittal of those put on trial. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>94. For all the aforementioned reasons, the Court sets aside the impugned <lb/>judgment dated 28 th March 2000 of the trial Court as far as it convicted A-1 <lb/>for the offences with which he was charged and the impugned order on <lb/></body>

			<body>sentence dated 30 th March 2000 by which A-1 was sentenced in the manner <lb/>indicated. <lb/>95. The bail bonds and surety bonds of A-1 stand discharged. A-1 will fulfil <lb/>the requirements of Section 437-A Cr PC to the satisfaction of the trial Court <lb/>not later than two weeks from today. <lb/>96. As far as the State&quot;s appeal is concerned, the Court finds no reason to <lb/>disagree with the reasoning and conclusion of the trial Court holding that A-<lb/>3 to A-7 and A-9 were not guilty of the offences with which they were <lb/>charged and, therefore, deserved to be acquitted. It also concurs with the <lb/>impugned judgment of the trial Court acquitting all the accused of the <lb/>offence of conspiracy under Section 120-B IPC and A-1 under Section 216 <lb/>read with Section 34 IPC. <lb/>97. Crl. A. No. 247/2000 of A-1 is allowed and Crl.A.No.81/2003 of the <lb/>State is dismissed in the above terms. However, there will be no order as to <lb/>costs. <lb/>98. The trial Court record be returned forthwith together with a certified <lb/>copy of this judgment. <lb/>S. MURALIDHAR, J. <lb/>I.S. MEHTA, J. <lb/>JANUARY 19, 2018 <lb/>dn/&apos;anb&apos; </body>
