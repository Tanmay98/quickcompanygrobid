			<p>
				1. Impugned order of 27 th January, 2017 (Annexure P-1) rejects
				<lb />
				petitioner&apos;s application for allotment of alternate plot in lieu of acquired
				<lb />
				land on the ground that the requisite documents have not been supplied.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				2.Learned counsel for petitioner draws attention of this Court to
				<lb />
				petitioner&apos;s letter of 30 th September, 2016 (Annexure P-7) wherein
				<lb />
				petitioner had sought time to obtain and furnish the requisite documents.
				<lb />
				Learned counsel for petitioner submits that after the receipt of the
				<lb />
				requisite documents, the same have been supplied to respondent on the
				<lb />
				day of the passing of the impugned order i.e. 27 th January, 2017.
				<lb />
				However, it appears that the documents have been filed by petitioner after
				<lb />
				passing the impugned order. May be on the same day.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				3.It is also submitted on behalf of petitioner that though the
				<lb />
				documents sought by respondent have been furnished, yet if there is still
				<lb />
				any deficiency, then the documents sought would be furnished to
				<lb />
				respondent.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				4.At this stage, learned counsel for respondent points out that copy of
				<lb />
				petitioner&apos;s Aadhaar Card and Identity Card duly attested by a gazetted
				<lb />
				officer is also required to be furnished by petitioner. Learned counsel for
				<lb />
				petitioner submits that the needful would be done within four weeks from
				<lb />
				today.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>
				5. In the facts and circumstances of this case, it is deemed appropriate
				<lb />
				to set aside the impugned order while subjecting petitioner to costs of
				<lb />
				rupees ten thousand to be deposited with the Prime Minister&apos;s National
				<lb />
				Relief Fund within a period of four weeks from today. After the receipt of
				<lb />
				deposit of costs is produced by petitioner before respondent, petitioner&apos;s
				<lb />
				application be reconsidered by respondent within a period of twelve
				<lb />
				weeks. The fate of the said application be made known to petitioner
				<lb />
				within two weeks thereafter, so that petitioner may avail of the remedies
				<lb />
				as available in law, if need be. It is made clear that if there is any
				<lb />
				deficiency, it be communicated to petitioner within two weeks, so that
				<lb />
				petitioner can make good the deficiency and supply the requisite
				<lb />
				documents within four weeks thereafter.
				<lb />
			</p>

			<p>6. With aforesaid directions, this petition is disposed of.</p>
