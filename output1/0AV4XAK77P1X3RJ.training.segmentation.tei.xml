			<lb />
			Aggrieved by the order dated 7 th September, 2016 framing notice
			<lb />
			against the petitioners under Section 251 Cr.P.C. in complaint case nos.
			<lb />
			4993626/2016, 4993627/2016 and 4995507/2016 all titled as Intergen
			<lb />
			Energy Limited Vs. SMS Paryavaran Limited &amp; Others pending before the
			<lb />
			learned Metropolitan Magistrate-1 (Negotiable Instrument Act), South West,
			<lb />
			Dwarka, New Delhi, the petitioners preferred three revision petitions before
			<lb />
			the Learned ASJ, which were dismissed vide the impugned order dated 25 th
			<lb />
			November, 2016. Hence, the present petitions.
			<lb />
			2.
			<lb />
			Complaints were filed by the respondent as noted above inter-alia
			<lb />
			alleging that the petitioners approached the complainant representing that
			<lb />
			they had been awarded a project work by Nashik Municipal Corporation
			<lb />
			(NMC) for carrying out design, construction, supply etc. of sewerage
			<lb />
			treatment plants, thus requiring investments. Therefore, on the request of the
			<lb />
			petitioners, respondent advanced a loan of ₹3.5 crores @19% per annum,
			<lb />
			which was to be repaid on 15 th March, 2014 along with the total interest of
			<lb />
			₹42 lacs accruing over a period of eight months as described in the
			<lb />
			Page 3 of 8
			<lb />
			resolution. It was further provided that further default interest of 25% per
			<lb />
			annum would be levied on delayed payment. Thus on 12 th July, 2013 a Loan-
			<lb />
			cum-Hypothecation Deed was executed between the petitioner no. 1 and the
			<lb />
			respondent No.1 with petitioners no. 2 to 4 as guarantors/confirming parties
			<lb />
			to the loan agreement. Separate personal guarantees were also issued by
			<lb />
			petitioners no. 2 to 4 on 12 th July, 2013 for repayment of loan. The loan of
			<lb />
			₹3.5 crores was transferred in two installments of ₹2.1 crores on 20 th July,
			<lb />
			2013 and ₹1.4 crores on 27 th August, 2013. However, the petitioners failed to
			<lb />
			repay the amount of loan. The payment was rescheduled. Even thereafter, the
			<lb />
			petitioners failed to repay the loan amount. Extension of time for repayment
			<lb />
			was granted and Third Amendment Agreement was entered into between the
			<lb />
			parties on 5 th August, 2014. However again, no payment was made. In terms
			<lb />
			of the Third Amendment Loan Agreement dated 5 th August, 2014, the
			<lb />
			petitioners gave fifteen post dated cheques drawn on State Bank of India and
			<lb />
			Dena Bank in discharge of the loan amount/debt liability. When seven
			<lb />
			cheques totalling for a sum of ₹1,37,96,251/-were presented, they were
			<lb />
			returned with the memos &quot;FUNDS INSUFFICIENT&quot; on 22 nd November,
			<lb />
			2014 and 27 th November, 2014 for which complaint case No.4993626/2016
			<lb />
			was filed which is the subject matter of Crl.M.C. 4724/2016. Similarly,
			<lb />
			Complaint case No.4993627/2016, subject matter of Crl.M.C. 4746/2016,
			<lb />
			was filed when four cheques totalling for a sum of `83,38,438/-drawn on
			<lb />
			Dena Bank were returned with the memos &quot;STOP PAYMENT&quot; on 21 st
			<lb />
			November, 2014 and 22 nd November, 2014. Another Complaint case
			<lb />
			bearing No.4995507/2016 subject matter of Crl.M.C. 4747/2016 was filed

			3.
			<lb />
			In reply to the legal notices, the petitioners denied their liability on the
			<lb />
			pretext that Sub-contractor Agreements were entered into with the
			<lb />
			complainant. According to the complainant, the Sub-contractor Agreements
			<lb />
			had no nexus with the loan agreement. After summons were issued and
			<lb />
			petitioners entered appearance on 2 nd September, 2016, the learned
			<lb />
			Metropolitan Magistrate framed the following notice under Section 251
			<lb />
			Cr.P.C. in Complaint case No.4993626/2016 against the petitioner no.1
			<lb />
			besides the petitioners no. 2 to 4 and in the other complaints which were also

			Q. Do you plead guilty or claim trial?

			Q. Do you have any defence to make?

			A. We did receive the legal notice. The cheques in question bear
			<lb />
			my signature as director of the company i.e. accused no. 1. The

			cheques in question were issued as guarantee cheques. The
			<lb />
			amount has already been paid to the complainant in excess. The

			<lb />
			The grievance of the petitioners is that while directing framing of
			<lb />
			notice, no detailed order was passed discussing the pleas of the petitioners as
			<lb />
			to why notice should not be framed and merely because the petitioners had
			<lb />
			the right to lead defence evidence, the same could not be a ground to deny
			<lb />
			discharge at the stage of framing of notice. Arbitration proceedings between
			<lb />
			the parties had been initiated and the respondent was asked not to present the
			<lb />
			said cheques however it presented the same to implicate the petitioners. In
			<lb />
			the order dated 2 nd September, 2016 passed by learned Metropolitan
			<lb />
			Magistrate, it was not reflected that the petitioners had argued the issues
			<lb />
			raised before it resulting in the learned ASJ noting in the impugned order
			<lb />
			dated 25 th November, 2011 that the issues raised before him were not argued
			<lb />
			before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate. The revision petitions were
			<lb />
			dismissed by noting that advancement of loan, issuance of cheques and the
			<lb />
			legal notice were not disputed and the defences if any be taken up in the
			<lb />
			cross-examination.
			<lb />

			<lb />
			The order directing framing of notice passed by learned Metropolitan
			<lb />
			Magistrate reads as under:-

			<lb />
			Notices U/s 251 Cr.P.C framed against all the accused persons
			<lb />
			to which theypleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Plea of defence of
			<lb />
			the accused persons have also been recorded.
			<lb />
			At this stage, it has been pointed out by the Ld. Counsel for the
			<lb />
			accused thatthe application u/s 145(2) N.I Act has already been filed
			<lb />
			Submissions on the application heard. Record perused.
			<lb />
			Since the accused persons have disclosed the plausible defence
			<lb />
			therefore,they are afforded an opportunity to cross examine the
			<lb />
			complainant on the NDOH.
			<lb />
			In compliance of directions in circular No. 255/DLSA/Estt./DLSA
			<lb />
			/2015/5207, theparties are referred to the daily continuous Lok
			<lb />
			Adalat scheduled to be held on 24.09.2016 at 4:00 PM.
			<lb />
			Parties are directed to appear before the Lok Adalat on
			<lb />
			the said date. Ahlmad is directed to send the file complete
			<lb />
			in all respect to the daily Lok Adalat immediately.

			<lb />
			6.
			<lb />
			Indubitably learned Metropolitan Magistrate in the order directing
			<lb />
			framing of notice has not recorded the satisfaction whether a case for
			<lb />
			framing of notice is made out, however this aspect has been noted by the
			<lb />
			learned Metropolitan Magistrate while framing notice. In the reply to the
			<lb />
			plea of guilt, the petitioners admitted issuance of cheques and service of
			<lb />
			legal notice. Though it would have been in the interest of fair procedure if
			<lb />
			Page 8 of 8
			<lb />
			the learned Metropolitan Magistrate had recorded a prima facie satisfaction,
			<lb />
			but be that as it may, having heard the learned counsel for the petitioners,
			<lb />
			this Court finds that the complaints disclose case for proceeding against the
			<lb />
			petitioners by framing a notice for offence punishable under Section 138
			<lb />
			Negotiable Instruments Act and merely because a detailed reasoned order
			<lb />
			was not passed on 2 nd September, 2016 by the learned Metropolitan
			<lb />
			Magistrate, matter is not required to be remanded back. Pleas of the
			<lb />
			petitioners are that they had no liability to pay, they had instructed the
			<lb />
			respondent not to present the cheques, the cheques in question were issued as
			<lb />
			guarantee cheques, amount had been paid in excess and that the sub-contract
			<lb />
			was not performed. All these pleas can be ascertained either by cross-
			<lb />
			examination of the respondent&apos;s witnesses or if the petitioners&apos; lead the
			<lb />
			defence evidence. At the stage of framing of notice, the Court was only
			<lb />
			required to see that on the complaint, statements of the complaint&apos;s witnesses
			<lb />
			and documents exhibited whether ingredients of offence punishable under
			<lb />
			Section 138 NI Act were made out. Having satisfied thereon, the learned
			<lb />
			Magistrate was not required to enter into an exercise of appreciating the
			<lb />
			defence of the petitioners at this stage.
			<lb />
			7.
			<lb />
			Petitions and applications are accordingly dismissed.
