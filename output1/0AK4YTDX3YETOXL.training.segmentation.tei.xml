			1.
			<lb />
			This is an appeal under Section 19 of the Family Court Act against the
			<lb />
			order dated 07.06.2018 and order dated 23.07.2018 seeks review
			<lb />
			passed by the family court. The appellant is aggrieved by the interim
			<lb />
			order vide which the custody of the minor girl child (4 years old) born
			<lb />
			on 16.09.2014 has been handed over to the mother.

			<lb />
			The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the Family Court
			<lb />
			has failed to take into account the fact that the respondent is not
			<lb />
			physically and mentally fit to look after the child. It is submitted that
			<lb />
			the respondent is mentally sick and sometimes behaves in an abnormal
			<lb />
			manner. It is further submitted that the violent behavior of the
			<lb />
			respondent may have an adverse impact on the well being of the child.
			<lb />
			Additionally, learned counsel for the appellant contends that the
			<lb />
			mother had left the matrimonial home on 12.09.2016 and thereafter
			<lb />
			did not bother about her daughter.
			<lb />
			3.
			<lb />
			We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and carefully
			<lb />
			examined the order dated 07.06.2018 passed by the Family Court and
			<lb />
			the order dated 23.07.2018 passed in the review petition.
			<lb />
			4.
			<lb />
			In this case, the marriage between the parties was solemnized on
			<lb />
			12.12.2013. A girl child was born from this wedlock on 16.09.2014.
			<lb />
			As per the submissions made, the parties separated on 12.09.2016
			<lb />
			when the child was with the father. Allegations and counter
			<lb />
			allegations have been made. According to the appellant, the mother is
			<lb />
			not a fit person to look after the minor as she suffers from a
			<lb />
			psychological problem and she is under treatment. Copy of the
			<lb />
			prescription has been annexed with the appeal. It is also contended
			<lb />
			MAT APP (FC) 217/2018
			<lb />
			Page 3 of 9
			<lb />
			that the wife behaves in a violent manner and thus is unfit to look after
			<lb />
			the child. The order shows that the wife has alleged that the husband
			<lb />
			is a habitual drunkard and uses abusive language. She has also alleged
			<lb />
			that she was often beaten by her husband and she was forced to call
			<lb />
			the police on 25.05.2015 when she was thrown out of the matrimonial
			<lb />
			home. Reading of the impugned order would show that the Family
			<lb />
			Court has carefully analyzed the submissions made. The Family
			<lb />
			Court has taken into account that the respondent/wife is a B.Com. and
			<lb />
			has a qualification in Computer Applications. She is working as a
			<lb />
			senior manager with a private firm, has a monthly income of
			<lb />
			Rs.25,000/-per month. Family Court has also assessed the income of
			<lb />
			the husband which is almost the same. The Family Court has
			<lb />
			correctly taken note of Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and
			<lb />
			Guardianship Act (HMG), 1956, which we reproduce below wherein
			<lb />
			it has been provided that custody of a minor who has not completed
			<lb />
			the age of five year shall ordinarily be with the mother.
			<lb />
			Section 6 reads as follows:-
			<lb />
			6. Natural guardians of a Hindu minor.-The natural
			<lb />
			guardian of a Hindu minor, in respect of the minor&apos;s
			<lb />
			person as well as in respect of the minor&apos;s property
			<lb />
			(excluding his or her undivided interest in joint family
			<lb />
			property), are-

			(a) in the case of a boy or an unmarried girl-the father,
			<lb />
			and after him, the mother: provided that the custody of a

			minor who has not completed the age of five years shall
			<lb />
			ordinarily be with the mother;

			that no person shall be entitled to act as the natural

			guardian of a minor under the provisions of this section-
			<lb />
			(a) if he has ceased to be a Hindu, or
			<lb />
			(b) if he has completely and finally renounced the
			<lb />
			world by becoming a hermit (vanaprastha) or an

			&quot;mother&quot; do not include a step-father and a step-mother.

			<lb />
			The Hon&apos;ble Supreme Court in Gaytri Bajaj vs. Jiten Bhalla, (2012)
			<lb />
			12 SCC 471, categorically held that while dealing with an application
			<lb />
			for custody of a minor child, the interest and welfare of the minor
			<lb />
			should be of paramount importance. The conducive and appropriate
			<lb />
			environment along with the desirability of the child are some of the
			<lb />
			relevant factors that have to be kept in mind while deciding the
			<lb />
			custody of the child. The Court while explaining the importance of the
			<lb />
			abovementioned factor held in paragraph 12-14 as under:-
			<lb />
			&quot;12. The law relating to custody of minors has received an
			<lb />
			exhaustive consideration of this Court in a series of
			<lb />
			pronouncements. In Gaurav Nagpal v. Sumedha Nagpal

			2009 (1) SCC 142, the principles of English and American
			<lb />
			law in this regard were considered by this Court to hold
			<lb />
			that the legal position in India is not in any way different.
			<lb />
			Noticing the judgment of the Bombay High Court in
			<lb />
			Saraswati Bai Shripad Ved v. Shripad Vasanji Ved AIR
			<lb />
			1941 (Bom.) 103; Rosy Jacob v. Jacob A Chakramakkal
			<lb />
			(1973) 1 SCC 840 and Thirty Hoshie Dolikuka v. Hoshiam
			<lb />
			Shavdaksha Dolikuka (1982) 2 SCC 544 this Court
			<lb />
			eventually concluded in paragraph 50 and 51 that:
			<lb />
			(Gaurav Nagpal case, SCC p.57)
			<lb />
			&quot;50. [T]hat when the Court is confronted with conflicting
			<lb />
			demands made by the parents, each time it has to justify
			<lb />
			the demands. The Court has not only to look at the issue
			<lb />
			on legalistic basis, in such matters human angles are
			<lb />
			relevant for deciding those issues. The Court then does not
			<lb />
			give emphasis on what the parties say, it has to exercise a
			<lb />
			jurisdiction which is aimed at the welfare of the minor. As
			<lb />
			observed recently in Mousmi Moitra Ganguli&apos;s case the
			<lb />
			court has to give due weightage to the child&apos;s ordinary
			<lb />
			contentment, health, education, intellectual development
			<lb />
			and favourable surroundings but over and above physical
			<lb />
			comforts, the moral and ethical values have also to be
			<lb />
			noted. They are equal if not more important than the
			<lb />
			others.
			<lb />
			51. The word &quot;welfare&quot; used in Section 13 of the Act has
			<lb />
			to be construed literally and must be taken in its widest
			<lb />
			sense. The moral and ethical welfare of the child must also
			<lb />
			weigh with the Court as well as its physical well being.
			<lb />
			Though the provisions of the special statutes which
			<lb />
			governs the rights of the parents and guardians may be
			<lb />
			taken into consideration, there is nothing which can stand
			<lb />
			in the way of the Court exercising its parens patriae
			<lb />
			jurisdiction arising in such cases.&quot;
			<lb />
			13. The views expressed in Para 19 and 20 of the report in
			<lb />
			Mousmi Moitra Ganguli v. Jayant Ganguli, (2008) 7 SCC
			<lb />
			673, would require special notice. In the said case it has
			<lb />
			been held that it is the welfare and interest of the child and
			<lb />

		<body>
			not the rights of the parents which is the determining
			<lb />
			factor for deciding the question of custody. It was the
			<lb />
			further view of this Court that the question of welfare of
			<lb />
			the child has to be considered in the context of the facts of
			<lb />
			each case and decided cases on the issue may not be
			<lb />
			appropriate to be considered as binding precedents.
			<lb />
			Similar observations of this Court contained in para 30 of
			<lb />
			the Report in Sheila B. Das v. P.R. Sugasree, (2006) 3
			<lb />
			SCC 62 would also require a special mention.,
			<lb />
			14. From the above it follows that an order of custody of
			<lb />
			minor children either under the provisions of The
			<lb />
			Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 or Hindu Minority and
			<lb />
			Guardianship Act, 1956 is required to be made by the
			<lb />
			Court treating the interest and welfare of the minor to be
			<lb />
			of paramount importance. It is not the better right of the
			<lb />
			either parent that would require adjudication while
			<lb />
			deciding their entitlement to custody. The desire of the
			<lb />
			child coupled with the availability of a conducive and
			<lb />
			appropriate environment for proper upbringing together
			<lb />
			with the ability and means of the concerned parent to take
			<lb />
			care of the child are some of the relevant factors that have
			<lb />
			to be taken into account by the Court while deciding the
			<lb />
			issue of custody of a minor. What must be emphasized is
			<lb />
			that while all other factors are undoubtedly relevant, it is
			<lb />
			the desire, interest and welfare of the minor which is the
			<lb />
			crucial and ultimate consideration that must guide the
			<lb />
			determination required to be made by the Court.&quot;
			<lb />
			6.
			<lb />
			In Roxann Sharma Vs. Arun Sharma , (2015) 8 SCC 318 ,the Supreme
			<lb />
			Court held as under:-
			<lb />
			&quot;5. We shall consider the import and amplitude of the
			<lb />
			legal concept of Guardianship on first principles. Black
			<lb />
			Law Dictionary 5th Edition contains a definition of
			<lb />
			Guardianship which commends itself to us. It states that-
			<lb />
			&quot;A person lawfully invested with the power, and charged
			<lb />
			with the duty, of taking care of the person and managing

		<body>
			the property and rights of another person, who, for defect
			<lb />
			of age, understanding, or self control, is considered
			<lb />
			incapable of administering his own affairs. One who
			<lb />
			legally has the care and management of the person, or the
			<lb />
			estate or both, of a child during its minority&quot;. Thereafter
			<lb />
			there are as many twelve classifications of a guardian but
			<lb />
			we shall reproduce only one of them, which reads-&quot;a
			<lb />
			general guardian is one who has the general care and
			<lb />
			control of the person and estate of his ward; while a
			<lb />
			special guardian is one who has special or limited powers
			<lb />
			and duties with respect to his ward, e.g., a guardian who
			<lb />
			has the custody of the estate but not of the person, or vice
			<lb />
			versa, or a guardian ad litem&quot;. Black&apos;s Law Dictionary
			<lb />
			also defines &apos;Custody&apos; as the care and control of a thing or
			<lb />
			person. The keeping, guarding, care, watch, inspection,
			<lb />
			preservation or security of a thing, carrying with it the
			<lb />
			idea of the thing being within the immediate personal care
			<lb />
			and control of the person to whose custody it is subjected.
			<lb />
			Immediate charge and control, and not the final, absolute
			<lb />
			control of ownership, implying responsibility for the
			<lb />
			protection and preservation of the thing in custody.
			<lb />
			….
			<lb />
			12. The HMG Act postulates that the custody of an infant
			<lb />
			or a tender aged child should be given to his/her mother
			<lb />
			unless the father discloses cogent reasons that are
			<lb />
			indicative of and presage the livelihood of the welfare and
			<lb />
			interest of the child being undermined or jeopardised if the
			<lb />
			custody retained by the mother. Section 6(a) of HMG Act,
			<lb />
			therefore, preserves the right of the father to be the
			<lb />
			guardian of the property of the minor child but not the
			<lb />
			guardian of his person whilst the child is less than five
			<lb />
			years old. It carves out the exception of interim custody, in
			<lb />
			contradistinction of guardianship, and then specifies that
			<lb />
			custody should be given to the mother so long as the child
			<lb />
			is below five years in age. We must immediately clarify
			<lb />
			that this Section or for that matter any other provision
			<lb />
			including those contained in the G&amp;W Act, does not

			disqualify the mother to custody of the child even after the
			<lb />
			latter&apos;s crossing the age of five years.
			<lb />
			7.
			<lb />
			The Family Court has rightly placed reliance upon the recent judgment
			<lb />
			of the this court in W.P. (CRL) 357/2018 titled as Kiran Lohia vs. The
			<lb />
			State Govt. of Nct of Delhi &amp; Ors., observed as follows:-
			<lb />
			&quot;44.A perusal of Section 6(a) of the HMG Act shows that
			<lb />
			the legislature has considered it appropriate, that in
			<lb />
			respect of a minor child, who has not completed the age of
			<lb />
			five years, the custody should normally be with the mother.
			<lb />
			The reason for the same is not difficult to fathom. The
			<lb />
			reason, simply put, is that normally, a mother is
			<lb />
			biologically and psychologically attuned to look after and
			<lb />
			protect the child. It comes naturally to the mother to be
			<lb />
			sensitive to the needs of the minor child -be it food,
			<lb />
			hygiene, clothing, comfort and protection. This is not to
			<lb />
			say that the father of a minor child cannot have the same
			<lb />
			level of concern or sensitivity.&quot;
			<lb />
			8.
			<lb />
			The law is clear that in case of the custody, the willingness and the
			<lb />
			interest of the child is of the utmost importance. The child in this case
			<lb />
			is a four years old. It has been established fact that the child is
			<lb />
			comfortable around the respondent and recognized the respondent as
			<lb />
			her mother.
			<lb />
			9.
			<lb />
			Furthermore, a bare reading of Section 6 (a) of the HMG explicitly
			<lb />
			states that the custody in case of the minor child, below the age of five
			<lb />
			years vests with the mother and this case is no exception. The question
			<lb />

		<body>
			of custody can be reconsidered in case, where the father is able to
			<lb />
			disclose any cogent reasons that are indicative of and presage the
			<lb />
			livelihood of the welfare and interest of the child being undermined or
			<lb />
			jeopardised, if the custody is retained by the mother. Moreover, the
			<lb />
			appellant has failed to convince this court that the mother is not fit to
			<lb />
			retain custody of the child.
			<lb />
			10. Additionally, the reasoning so adduced by the Family Court is that in
			<lb />
			case of a girl, a mother is in a better position to look after her as she
			<lb />
			would require special attention and guidance during her childhood and
			<lb />
			also be able to look after her psychological and biological needs.
			<lb />
			11. We do not find any infirmity in the reasoning or orders passed by the
			<lb />
			Family Court.
			<lb />
			12. Resultantly, we find no ground to interfere with the orders passed by
			<lb />
			the Family Court. The appeal is dismissed.
