			JUSTICE PRATHIBA M. SINGH
			<lb />
			Prathiba M. Singh, J. (Oral)
			<lb />

		<p>
			1.Shri Mohan Lal had purchased the property bearing no.16/493-H,
			<lb />
			Street No.15, Hardhyan Singh Road, Bapa Nagar, New Delhi in the year
			<lb />
			1966. He left for his heavenly abode on 10 th September, 1988. He died
			<lb />
			intestate. He had six legal heirs namely Smt. Vidya Devi, Shri Desh Raj,
			<lb />
			Smt. Kamla Devi, Smt. Bimla Devi, Smt. Nirmla Devi and Smt. Phool Wati.
			<lb />
			His other legal heirs including his widow and two sons, namely Shri Daya
			<lb />
			Kishan and Shri Bhaskar had passed away by the time of the filing of the
			<lb />
			suit.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			2. A suit came to be filed being CS No.614375/2016 (old No.331/2015)
			<lb />
			was filed by one of the daughters namely Smt. Vidya Devi seeking her share
			<lb />
			in the suit property. This was the second suit in respect of the same property.
			<lb />
			An earlier suit bearing Suit No.285/2003 was filed by the
			<lb />
			Appellant/Defendant No.1 (hereinafter, &apos;Defendant&apos;) against two of his
			<lb />
			sisters, namely Smt. Nirmala and Smt. Kamla, seeking possession, damages,
			<lb />
			declaration and injunction, on the ground that as per an oral settlement
			<lb />
			between the family members he was the exclusive owner of the entire 50 sq.
			<lb />
			yds. of the suit property. This suit was dismissed on 1 st July, 2005 wherein it
			<lb />
			was held that all the five sisters of the Defendant have 1/6 th share in the suit
			<lb />
			property.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			3. The allegations in the present suit were that out of the 50 sq. yds
			<lb />
			property, 25 sq. yds came to be sold away by the Defendant, in connivance
			<lb />
			with two sisters. The Defendant relied upon the General Power of Attorney
			<lb />
			and Special Power of Attorney in his favour executed on 9 th November,
			<lb />
			1998 which, however, was not accepted by the Trial court.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			4. The learned Trial court relied on the order dated 1 st July, 2005 passed
			<lb />
			in the earlier suit and held that since it was already decided that each of the
			<lb />
			parties had 1/6 th share, the Plaintiff Smt. Vidya Devi is entitled to
			<lb />
			preliminary decree for her 1/6 th share. The issues that were framed in the suit
			<lb />
			were as under:
			<lb />
			&quot;1. Whether the plaint is liable to be rejected for
			<lb />
			want of cause of action? OPD
			<lb />
			2. Whether the suit is barred in view of Section 115
			<lb />
			of Evidence Act? OPD
			<lb />
			3. Whether the suit is barred by limitation? OPD
			<lb />
			4. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for preliminary
			<lb />
			decree for partition in respect of the suit property?
			<lb />
			OPP
			<lb />
			5. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for decree for
			<lb />
			rendition of accounts? OPP
			<lb />
			6. Relief. &quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			5. On issue Nos.1 &amp; 4, the Trial court held that the Plaintiff is entitled to
			<lb />
			a preliminary decree of 1/6 th share. On issue No. 2, the Trial Court held that
			<lb />
			the suit is not barred by Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. On
			<lb />
			issue No. 3, the Trial Court held that the suit is not bared by limitation. On
			<lb />
			issue no. 5, the Trial Court passed an order for rendition of accounts of all
			<lb />
			the profits earned by the Defendant i.e., the Appellant herein, in respect of
			<lb />
			the suit property. One of the fundamental grounds of challenge is that the
			<lb />
			decree has been passed by the Trial court without considering the evidence
			<lb />
			adduced in the suit.
			<lb />
			Appellant/Defendant&apos;s case
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			6. It is the case of the Defendant that subsequent to the judgment passed
			<lb />
			in the earlier suit, the Defendant had settled the entire dispute with his sisters
			<lb />
			and had paid them monetary sums in order to buy peace in the family. This
			<lb />
			was sought to be proved by way of two affidavits filed by one sister Smt.
			<lb />
			Phool Wati (DW3) who stated in her cross-examination that she does not
			<lb />
			claim any share in the property and that the shares of her sisters were paid
			<lb />
			off by the Defendant during the Diwali festival in 2005 i.e. subsequent to 1 st
			<lb />
			July, 2005, when the decree in the earlier suit was passed. The cross-
			<lb />
			examination of Smt. Phool Wati is extracted below:
			<lb />
			&quot;I have only stated that I do not want any share in
			<lb />
			the property. It is wrong to suggest that the
			<lb />
			plaintiff have share in the suit property. Vol. She
			<lb />
			was given her share in my presence. I do not
			<lb />
			remember the date or month but it near Diwali in
			<lb />
			the year 2005. No writing had obtained from
			<lb />
			plaintiff. The plaintiff was alone when she was
			<lb />
			given her share. I do not remember whether the
			<lb />
			plaintiff was informed in advance that she will be
			<lb />
			paid her share on a particular date.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			7. The second evidence led by the Defendant is of Smt. Pushpa, who is a
			<lb />
			cousin sister of the Plaintiff and the Defendant. She submitted in her
			<lb />
			affidavit that in the last part of 2005, two floors constructed above the shops
			<lb />
			in half portion of the property, namely, 25 sq. yd. were sold away in order to
			<lb />
			settle the shares of all the sisters of the Appellant/Defendant. The averments
			<lb />
			in Smt. Pushpa&apos;s affidavit are as under:
			<lb />
			&quot;That I say that after that in last quarter months of
			<lb />
			2005, on demand of plaintiff and one other LRs
			<lb />
			namely Kamla two floors of half portion was
			<lb />
			disposed off and shares of the plaintiff and Smt.
			<lb />
			Kamla was given to them that was Rs.2 lacs after
			<lb />
			deduction of litigation charges. The plaintiff has
			<lb />
			received Rs.2 lacs from the defendant no.1 against
			<lb />
			her share in the property left by her father, in
			<lb />
			presence of the deponent. The plaintiff had not
			<lb />
			acknowledged the said amount with pretext that
			<lb />
			she had already executed document in favour of
			<lb />
			the defendant no.1. &quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			8. In her cross-examination, Smt. Pushpa states as under:
			<lb />
			&quot;I am aware that all the three sisters have been
			<lb />
			given share as the same told to me by my parents.
			<lb />
			The defendant no.1 was giving money to the
			<lb />
			plaintiff when I reached the house of the defendant
			<lb />
			no.1. It was near Diwali. No writing was done in
			<lb />
			my presence. My mother and my Bhabhi was the
			<lb />
			only person present at that time when the money
			<lb />
			was given. (Again said) Phoowati was also present
			<lb />
			there. Phoolwati had refused to take any money.
			<lb />
			When money was given to Vidya Devi that time
			<lb />
			Kamala was not present but Phoolwati was
			<lb />
			present.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			9. It is the Defendant&apos;s submission that the learned Trial court has solely
			<lb />
			relied on the earlier decree dated 1 st July, 2005 and has completely ignored
			<lb />
			the evidence of events which transpired post the said judgment. The counsel
			<lb />
			for the Plaintiff submits that the Plaintiff did not have good relations with
			<lb />
			Smt. Phool Wati, which is evident from her affidavit where she categorically
			<lb />
			accepts that she had not even attended the wedding. Relevant part of the
			<lb />
			cross-examination of Smt. Phool Wati is set out below:
			<lb />
			&quot;I am no speaking terms with the plaintiff for the last
			<lb />
			many years. It is correct that I attended the marriage
			<lb />
			of only one daughter of the plaintiff namely Anita and I
			<lb />
			did not attend the marriage of any of the children of
			<lb />
			the plaintiff. I had attended the cremation of the
			<lb />
			husband of the plaintiff but I do not remember when
			<lb />
			the husband of the plaintiff has died.&quot;
			<lb />
			Respondents/Plaintiffs&apos; case
			<lb />
			10. Mr. Khanna, Counsel for the Plaintiff, submits that the earlier order
			<lb />
			operated as res judicata between the parties and it was not open to the
			<lb />
			Defendant to argue contrary to the said judgment/decree. On behalf of the
			<lb />
			other sisters/Respondent Nos. 2, 3 &amp; 5, it is submitted that they have already
			<lb />
			received their shares and they do not claim any share in the suit property.
			<lb />
			The relevant part of the reply is set out below:
			<lb />
			&quot;11. In reply to para 4(X), it is submitted that the
			<lb />
			mother of the parties and all the sisters i.e.,
			<lb />
			Respondent No. 1 to 5 had executed a NOC/Affidavit in
			<lb />
			favor of the appellant and Daya Kishan (deceased) in
			<lb />
			relation to the suit property. It is further submitted that
			<lb />
			Respondent no. 1 (Vidya Devi), Respondent No. 3
			<lb />
			(Bimla Devi) and Respondent No. 5 (Phoolwati) had
			<lb />
			executed GPA and SPA thereby transferring their
			<lb />
			entire rights, title and interests in the suit property in
			<lb />
			favour of the appellant.
			<lb />
			………………
			<lb />
			24. That the contents of Para 5(A) to 5(DD) of grounds
			<lb />
			are not denied. However, it is submitted that the
			<lb />
			Respondent No.1 had already received her share in the
			<lb />
			suit property. It is further submitted that the mother of
			<lb />
			the parties and all the sisters i.e. Respondent No.l to 5
			<lb />
			had executed a NOC/Affidavit in favor of the appellant
			<lb />
			and Daya Kishan (Deceased) in relation to the suit
			<lb />
			property with a clear mutual understanding that in
			<lb />
			future they would not claim any share in the suit
			<lb />
			property and that they had relinquished their right in
			<lb />
			the suit property in favor of the appellant. It is further
			<lb />
			submitted that Respondent no. 1 (Vidya Devi),
			<lb />
			Respondent No.3 (Simla Devi) and Respondent No.5
			<lb />
			(Phoolwati) also had executed GPA and SPA thereby
			<lb />
			transferring their entire rights, title and interests in the
			<lb />
			suit property in favor of the appellant.&quot;
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			11. The said reply is duly signed by the three sisters namely Smt. Kamla
			<lb />
			Devi, Smt. Bimla Devi and Smt. Phoolwati and is also supported by the
			<lb />
			affidavits of all three sisters.
			<lb />
			Appeal Proceedings
			<lb />
			12. Insofar as the Respondent No.4 is concerned, none appears on her
			<lb />
			behalf and it is the submission of all counsels that she does not stake any
			<lb />
			claim against the Defendant, her brother and she has chosen not to appear in
			<lb />
			the matter.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			13. The factual position, thus, appears to be that insofar as Smt.
			<lb />
			Nirmla/Respondent No.4 is concerned, in the present suit, she has never
			<lb />
			appeared. All the other sisters, namely, Respondent Nos. 2, 3 &amp; 5 have
			<lb />
			supported the stand of the Defendant and do not stake any claim in the
			<lb />
			property. The only sister, who claims a share in the suit property is the
			<lb />
			Plaintiff i.e., Smt. Vidya Devi. The Trial court has simply gone by the order
			<lb />
			dated 1 st July, 2005 and has failed to take into consideration the
			<lb />
			developments subsequent to the said order. Thus, the preliminary decree is
			<lb />
			unsustainable. The evidence which has come on record subsequently ought
			<lb />
			to have been considered and could not have been ignored by the Trial court.
			<lb />
			</p>
			<p>
			14. Both the Defendant and Plaintiff are present in court. Submissions
			<lb />
			have been heard on behalf of the parties. By the conclusion of the hearing,
			<lb />
			settlement options were put forth and parties have arrived at a settlement on
			<lb />
			the following terms and conditions.
			<lb />
			(i)
			<lb />
			The Respondent no.1/Plaintiff is ready and willing to accept a
			<lb />
			sum of Rs. 3,00,000/-(Rupees Three Lakhs) towards her share in the
			<lb />
			suit property.
			<lb />
			(ii) The Appellant/Defendant No. 1 shall pay a sum of
			<lb />
			Rs.3,00,000/-in the following manner:
			<lb />
			 By 25 th January, 2018 -Rs. 1,00,000/-(Rupees One Lakh);
			<lb />
			and
			<lb />
			 Remaining sum of Rs.2,00,000/-(Rupees Two Lakhs) on or
			<lb />
			before 28 th February, 2018.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			15. The suit is decreed as per the settlement. Statements of the parties
			<lb />
			have been recorded to the above effect. The Plaintiff shall have no further
			<lb />
			claims in respect of the suit property upon receipt of full payment from the
			<lb />
			Defendant.
			<lb />
		</p>

		<p>
			16. The appeal is disposed of as settled. Suit is decreed in terms of the
			<lb />
			settlement. The Executing Court shall dispose of the execution petition.
			<lb />
		</p>
		<p>
