Mansoor Ahmad Mir, C.J. 

Batch of Letters Patent Appeals and Writ Petitions 

emanates from a policy, dated 18 th January, 1990, framed by 

the State Government, for providing employment assistance 

on compassionate grounds to the dependant of a 

government servant, who dies in harness, leaving behind his 

family in immediate need of assistance, (hereinafter referred 

to as the Policy). Thus, all the appeals and the writ petitions 

were clubbed together and are being disposed of by this 

common judgment. 

2. 
Before we deal with the Policy and the 

applicability thereof viz. a viz. to the facts of the each case, 

we deem it proper to find the origin and rationale behind 

granting compassionate appointment. 

3. 
It is well settled principle of service jurisprudence 

that every appointment against a public post must be made 

strictly in consonance with the mandatory provisions of 

Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and as per the 

Rules occupying the field. Any selection/appointment made 

de hors the Rules, is illegal. However, an exception has been

carved out for providing employment on compassionate 

ground. The aim and object of granting appointment on 

compassionate ground is to provide help to the 

family/dependants of an employee, who dies in harness, in 

tiding over the crisis which they suddenly met on the death of 

the bread-earner of the family. 
The other object of 

promulgating such a scheme is to save the dependants of 

the deceased-employee from social evils and to come to 

their rescue in the hour of need, particularly, to those families 

who, on the death of their breadwinner, fall on the earth and 

lose everything. 

4. 
The Central Government and the State 

Governments, 
have 
made 
Rules/Regulations/Policies/ 

Schemes for making appointment on compassionate ground. 

The Corporations and the Semi Government Departments, 

including Banks etc., have either adopted those Schemes or 

have framed their own Schemes. 

5. 
The State of Himachal Pradesh, being a model 

employer, is no exception and has framed a Policy for 

providing employment assistance on compassionate ground

for the sons/daughters/near relations of those government 

employees, who died in harness and left their families in 

immediate need of assistance, which was notified on 18 th 

January, 1990. It may be placed on record that the said 

Policy was amended by the respondents-State from time to 

time. 

6. 
Before the said Policy is scrutinized and examined 

meticulously, we deem it proper to refer to the decisions of 

the Apex Court in regard to the aim and object of providing 

employment assistance on compassionate grounds. 

7. 
The Apex Court in Balbir Kaur and another vs. Steel 

Authority of India Ltd. and others, reported in (2000) 6 

Supreme Court Cases 493, has discussed the aim and object 

of granting employment on compassionate ground, while 

referring to the law expounded on the subject till the year 

2000. In the said decision, the Apex Court observed that the 

socialistic pattern of society, as envisaged in the Constitution, 

has to be attributed its full meaning and the law courts 

cannot gaze as a mute spectator where relief is denied to the 

family, who is suffering due to the death of bread-earner. It is

apt to reproduce paragraphs 8 and 9 of the said decision, 

hereunder: 

"8 The employer being Steel Authority of India, 
admittedly an authority within the meaning of Article 12 
has thus an obligation to act in terms of the avowed 
objective of social and economic justice as enshrined in 
the Constitution but has the authority in the facts of the 
matters under consideration acted like a model and an 
ideal employer -It is in this factual backdrop, the issue 
needs an answer as to whether we have been able to 
obtain the benefit of constitutional philosophy of social 
and economic justice or not. Have the lofty ideals which 
the founding fathers placed before us any effect in our 
daily life -the answer cannot however but be in the 
negative -what happens to the constitutional 
philosophy as is available in the Constitution itself, which 
we ourselves have so fondly conferred on to ourselves. 
The socialistic pattern of society as envisaged in the 
Constitution has to be attributed its full meaning. A 
person dies while taking the wife to a hospital and the 
cry of the lady for bare subsistence would go unheeded 
on certain technicality. The bread earner is no longer 
available and prayer for compassionate appointment 
would be denied, as "it is likely to open a Pandora's Box" 
-This is the resultant effect of our entry into the new 
millennium. Can the law courts be a mute spectator in 
the matter of denial of such a relief to the horrendous 
sufferings of an employee's family by reason of the 
death of the bread-earner. It is in this context this Court's 
observations in Dharwad Distt. PWD Literate Daily Wage 
Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka (1990) 2 SCC 396 
: (AIR 1990 SC 883 : 1990 Lab IC 625) seem to be rather 
apposite. This Court upon consideration of Randhir Singh 
v. Union of India (Daily Rated Casual Labour Employed 
under P and T Dept. through Bhartiya Dak Tar Mazdoor 
Manch v. Union of India) (1988) 1 SCC 122 : (AIR 1987 SC

551) and D. S. Nakara v. Union of India (1983) 1 SCC 305 
: (AIR 1983 SC 130 : 1983 Lab IC 1) observed in 
paragraphs 14 and 15 as below : 
"14. We would like to point out that the philosophy 
of this Court as evolved in the cases we have 
referred to above is not that of the court but is 
ingrained in the Constitution as one of the basic 
aspects and if there was any doubt on this there is 
no room for that after the Preamble has been 
amended and the Forty-second Amendment has 
declared the Republic to be a socialistic one. The 
judgments, therefore, do nothing more than 
highlight one aspect of the constitutional 
philosophy and make an attempt to give the 
philosophy a reality of flesh and blood. 
15. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of this 
Republic while dreaming of elevating the lot of 
the common man of this country once stated : 
"Our final aim can only be a classless society 
with 
equal 
economic 
justice 
and 
opportunity to all, a society organized on a 
planned basis for the raising of mankind to 
higher 
material 
and 
cultural 
levels. 
Everything that comes in the way will have 
to be removed gently, if possible; forcibly if 
necessary, and there seems to be little 
doubt that coercion will often be necessary." 
These were his prophetic words about three 
decades back. More than a quarter of century 
has run out since he left us but there has yet been 
no percolation in adequate dose of the benefits 
the constitutional philosophy stands for to the 
lower strata of society. Tolstoy wrote : 
"The abolition of slavery has gone on for a 
long time. Rome abolished slavery. America 
abolished it and we did but only the words 
were abolished, not the thing." 
Perhaps what Tolstoy wrote about abolition of 
slavery in a large sense applies to what we have 
done to the constitutional ethos. It has still

remained on paper and is contained in the book. 
The benefits have not yet reached the common 
man. What Swami Vivekananda wrote in a 
different context may perhaps help a quicker 
implementation of the goal to bring about the 
overdue changes for transforming India in a 
positive way and in fulfilling the dreams of the 
Constitution fathers. These were the words of the 
Swami : 
'It is imperative that all this various yogas 
should be carried out in practice. Mere 
theories about them will not do any good. 
First we have to hear about them; then we 
have to think about them. We have to 
reason the thoughts out, impress them on 
our minds and meditate on them; realise 
them, until at last they become our whole 
life. No longer will religion remain a bundle of 
ideas or theories or an intellectual assent; it 
will enter into our very self. By means of an 
intellectual assent, we may today subscribe 
to many foolish things, and change our 
minds altogether tomorrow. But true religion 
never changes. Religion is realisation; not 
talk, nor doctrine, nor theories, however 
beautiful they may be. It is being and 
becoming, not hearing or acknowledging. It 
is the whole soul's becoming changed into 
what it believes. That is religion.'" 
9. As a matter of fact the constitutional philosophy 
should be allowed to become a part of every man's life 
in this country and then only the Constitution can reach 
everyone and the ideals of the Constitution framers 
would be achieved since the people would be nearer 
the goal set by the Constitution -an ideal situation but a 
far cry presently."

AIR SCW 1169, while dilating upon the aim and object of 

granting appointment on compassionate ground, has held 

that no appointment can be made on compassionate 

ground in the absence of Scheme and the Scheme must be 

corresponding to the scheme of equality, as enshrined in the 

Constitution. It was further held that all appointments against 

public posts must be made while keeping in view the 

mandate of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It is 

apt to reproduce paragraphs 14 to 16 of the said decision 

hereunder: 

"14. Appointment on compassionate ground would be 
illegal in absence of any scheme providing therefor. 
Such scheme must be commensurate with the 
constitutional scheme of equality. 
15. This Court in Punjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board 
v. Ranjodh Singh & Ors. 2006 (13) Scale 426, has 
observed: 
"The statutory bodies are bound to apply the rules 
of recruitment laid down under statutory rules. 
They being 'States' within the meaning of Article 12 
of the Constitution Of India, 1950 are bound to 
implement the constitutional scheme of equality. 
Neither the statutory bodies can refuse to fulfil 
such constitutional duty, nor the State can issue 
any direction contrary to or inconsistent with the 
constitutional principles adumbrated under 
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution Of India, 
1950" 
16. All public appointments must be in consonance with 
Article 16 of the Constitution Of India, 1950. Exceptions

carved out therefore are the cases where 
appointments are to be given to the widow or the 
dependent children of the employee who died in 
harness. Such an exception is carved out with a view to 
see that the family of the deceased employee who has 
died in harness does not become a destitute. No 
appointment, therefore, on compassionate ground can 
be granted to a person other than those for whose 
benefit the exception has been carved out. Other 
family members of the deceased employee would not 
derive any benefit thereunder." 

9. 
The Apex Court in another decision in Union of 

India & Anr. vs. B. Kishore, 2011 AIR SCW 2293, while dealing 

with the case of appointment on compassionate ground, has 

observed that the aim and object of providing 

compassionate appointment to the dependants of a 

deceased-employee is to provide immediate succour to the 

family, who, on the sudden death of the employee, may find 

itself in a state of destitution and if that object is taken out of 

the scheme, in that case, it would turn out to be a reservation 

in favour of the dependants of an employee who died in 

harness, which would not be in consonance with the 

mandate of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It is 

apt to reproduce paragraphs 5 and 6 of the said decision 

hereunder:

"5. On going through the judgment passed by the High 

Court, it is evident that it is based on a complete 

misconception about the scheme of compassionate 

appointments. Contrary to the High Court's observation, 

indigence of the dependents of the deceased 

employee is the first pre-condition to bring the case 

under the scheme of "compassionate appointment". 

The very purpose and object of the scheme is to 

provide immediate succour to the family of an 

employee that, on his death, may suddenly find itself in 

a state of destitution. If the element of indigence and 

the need to provide immediate assistance for relief from 

financial deprivation is taken out from the scheme of 

compassionate appointments, it would turn out to be a 

reservation in favour of the dependents of an employee 

who died while in service which would be directly in 

conflict with the ideal of equality guaranteed under 

Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. 

6. In State Bank of India v. Raj Kumar, 2010 11 SCC 661, 

elucidating the nature of the scheme of compassionate 

appointments this Court observed: 

"It is now well settled that appointment on 
compassionate grounds is not a source of 
recruitment. On the other hand it is an exception 
to the general rule that recruitment to public 
services should be on the basis of merit, by an 
open invitation providing equal opportunity to all 
eligible persons to participate in the selection 
process. The dependants of employees, who die

in harness, do not have any special claim or right 
to employment, except by way of the concession 
that may be extended by the employer under the 
rules or by a separate scheme, to enable the 
family of the deceased to get over the sudden 
financial crisis. The claim for compassionate 
appointment is therefore traceable only to the 
scheme framed by the employer for such 
employment and there is no right whatsoever 
outside such scheme. An appointment under the 
scheme can be made only if the scheme is in 
force and not after it is abolished/withdrawn. It 
follows therefore that when a scheme is abolished, 
any pending application seeking appointment 
under the scheme will also cease to exist, unless 
saved. The mere fact that an application was 
made when the scheme was in force, will not by 
itself create a right in favour of the applicant." 

10. 
After going through the pronouncements of the 

Apex Court, one comes to inescapable conclusion as to what 

is 
the 
purpose 
behind 
making 
appointment 
on 

compassionate ground and what factors are to be kept in 

mind by the concerned Authorities while making such 

appointments, of course, in consonance with the 

Scheme/Policy/Rules/ Regulations occupying the field. 

11. 
The genesis of the controversy, in hand, is the 

Policy, dated 18 th January, 1990, framed by the Government 

of Himachal Pradesh for making appointments on 

compassionate ground, which is reproduced hereinbelow:

"Subject;-Appointment of sons/daughters/near relations of 
a government servant who died in harness, 
leaving his family in immediate need of 
assistance. 

The undersigned is directed to say that the question of 
revising the policy for providing employment assistance to 
dependents of Govt. servants, who died while in Govt. 
service, leaving their families in indigent circumstances was 
under consideration of the Govt. for some time past. After 
thorough consideration and in supersession of all previous 
orders in this respect, it has now been decided to adopt the 
following new policy for grant of employment on 
compassionate grounds to the dependents of deceased 
Govt. servants in future:-
1) 
Policy:-
The employment on compassionate 
grounds to the dependents of Govt. servants who die while 
in service is not to be provided as a matter of right. It should 
be given only in deserving cases where the family of 
deceased Govt. servant is left in indigent circumstances 
requiring immediate means of subsistence. The concerned 
Administrative Departments would satisfy themselves about 
the indigent circumstances of the family before 
appointment on compassionate grounds is made. 
2) 
To whom the policy is applicable:-The employment 
assistance on compassionate grounds will be allowed in 
order of priority only to widow or a son or an unmarried 
daughter (in case of unmarried Govt. servant to father, 
mother brighter and unmarried sister) of:-
(a) 
a Govt. servant who dies while in service 
(including by suicide) leaving his family in immediate 
need of assistance. 
(b) a Daily wage employee who dies while in 
service after having rendered at least 5 years service 
with not less than 240 days on daily wage basis in a 
year( to be computed as an average of the number 
of days served in the preceding years) leaving his 
family in immediate need of assistance. In such cases 
compassionate employment would be on daily wages 
only, 
(c) a Govt. servant who has been missing for more 
than two years and the family needs the immediate 
assistance.

(d) a Govt. servant (Class-III and IV only) who retires 
on medical grounds under rule 38 of the C.C.S. 
(Pension) Rules, 1972. 
Provided the employee so retiring has not crossed the 
age of 53 years and 55 years in case of Class-III and IV 
respectively. 
(e) 
a Govt. servant who dies during the period of 
extension in service but not re-employment, leaving his 
family in immediate need of assistance. 
3) 
Authority competent to make appointment on 
Compassionate Grounds. 
(a) 
The compassionate appointment is to be provided 
basically in the department to which the deceased Govt. 
servant belonged, subject to fulfillment of minimum 
educational and technical qualifications prescribed for the 
post. In exceptional cases where the post does not at all 
exist in the Deptt. concerned, the said Department may 
recommend appointment in another department. 
(b) 
Head of the Department to which the late employee 
belonged shall be competent to make compassionate 
appointment subject to fulfillment of all essential conditions 
and his satisfaction as to the indigent circumstances of the 
family of the deceased/retired Govt. servant. 
4) 
Post to which such appointment can be made:-The 
appointment on compassionate grounds can be made only 
to the lowest rung of class-IV and Class-III posts carrying the 
pay scale of Rs.300-430 (now revised to Rs.750-1350) and 400-
600 or 400-660 ( now revised to Rs.950-1800 respectively). 
Class-III jobs would include all equivalent jobs including 
technical posts and teachers (class-III) in the scale of Rs.950-
1800 only. 
5. 
Eligibility:-
(a) 
appointment on compassionate grounds can 
be made only against direct recruitment quota posts 
and candidate should possess the minimum 
educational and technical qualifications prescribed 
for the post as prescribed in recruitment Rules. 
(b) 
if any training requirement is a pre-requisite for 
the post the incumbent seeking compassionate 
appointment against the post should possess such 
training and also possess physical standard wherever 
required for particular posts. Selection of incumbents

o u r t o f H 

. P . 

32 

on such compassionate basis for training is not 
permissible. 
(c) 
In all cases where one or more members of the 
family are already in Government service or in 
employment 
of 
Autonomous 
bodies/Boards/ 
Corporations etc., of the State/Central Government, 
employment assistance should not under any 
circumstances be provided to the second or third 
member of the family. In cases however, where the 
widow of the deceased Government servant 
represents or claims that her employed sons/daughters 
are not supporting her, the request of employment 
assistance should be considered only in respect of the 
widow. 
Even 
for 
allowing 
compassionate 
appointment to the widow in such cases the opinion 
of the Department of Personnel and Finance 
Department should specifically be sought and the 
matter finally decided by the Council of Ministers. 
(d) 
In the case of deceased Government servant 
who 
had 
taken 
loans/advances 
from 
the 
Government, the employment assistance to his widow 
or son of unmarried daughter will be provided only 
after obtaining an undertaking from him/her on non-
judicial paper of the value of Rs.3/-to refund the entire 
amount of loan together with interest which the 
deceased Government servant had taken in the 
prescribed application form. 
6) 
whether advance increment(s) can be given:-
No 
advance increment will be given to the 
dependents of the deceased Government servants on their 
compassionate appointment under any circumstances. 
7) 
Extent of relaxation and power to make relaxation:-
While providing employment on compassionate grounds the 
following relaxation can be made by the Administrative 
Department_ 
(a) 
Recruitment procedure, i.e. without the agency 
of Public service Commission or Employment 
Exchange. 
(b) 
If there is ban on filling up the posts, the ban 
shall be deemed to have been relaxed for the 
purpose of making compassionate appointments. 
(c) 
The educational qualification for class-IV posts 
will be relaxable in genuine cases with the prior

approval of the Cabinet. However, in case of a 
widow of Govt. servant to the appointed as Class-IV 
employee, the educational qualification can be 
relaxed by the concerned Administrative Department. 
(d) Age relaxation shall not be given by any 
authority. Genuine cases will be placed before the 
Cabinet for allowing age relaxation by the Deptt. 
concerned. 
8) 
Belated requests for compassionate appointments: 
Requests for grant of employment assistance should 
be received in the Deptt. concerned within three years of 
the death of the Government servant. In case where none 
of the sons/daughters of the deceased Government servant

the Government servant, the time limit for receipt of request 
for employment assistance in department concerned will be 
attained of age of 21 years by the eldest son/un-married 
daughter. No relaxation will be allowed in entertaining 
requests beyond the above age except in the case of

will be allowed to continue in service even after re-marriage. 

10) 
Selective approach:-

Except as provided in para 7(c) above, the 
appointments on compassionate grounds should be 
made in such a way that persons appointed to the posts 
do have the essential educational and technical 
qualifications and experience requirements maintenance 
of efficiency of administration. 
(b) 
It is not essential that a son or a daughter or a 
widow of a deceased Class-IV employee should be 
considered for employment against Class-IV post only but 
can be appointed against the lowest rung of Class-III post 
as indicated in para 4 above for which he is 
educationally qualified, proved a vacancy in Class-III is 
available.

made significant difference in the financial position of the 
families of the Govt. servants dying in harness. The benefit

employment assistance on compassionate grounds. 
Such measures, in brief, which are at present available to 
the families of the deceased employees are as under:-
(i) 
Ad-hoc ex-gratia grant @ 10 times the

condition under the Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme. 
11) 
Request for change in posts:-When a person has 
accepted a compassionate appointment to a particular 
post the set circumstances which led to his/her initial 
appointment should be deemed to have ceased to exist 
and 
thereafter 
the 
person 
who 
has 
accepted 
compassionate appointment in a particular post should strive 
in his carrier like his colleagues for future advancement. The 
request for change in posts should not be allowed. However, 
the incumbents would be allowed to apply for jobs under 
Govt./Corporation/Govt. of India, if they have better 
prospects there like other Govt. servants. 
12) 
General:-The proforma as in Annexure (Part I and II) 
may be used by the candidate and the Department 
respectively for processing the cases of compassionate 
appointments." 

Emphasis applied. 

12. 
Clause-1 of the said Policy provides that 

compassionate appointment should be given only in 

deserving cases where the family of the deceased-employee 

is left in indigent circumstances. Clause-2 of the Policy lays 

down the scope of the Policy and provides that -i) 

employment assistance would be provided to the 

dependants in those cases where a government servant dies 

in harness, ii) where a daily wage employee who dies while in 

service after having rendered at least 5 years service with not

less than 240 days on daily wage basis in a year, iii) where an 

employee is missing for more than two years, and iv) where 

an employee (class-III and class-IV only), who retires on 

medical grounds under Rule 38 of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 

1972, provided that such an employee has not crossed the 

age of 53 years and 55 years in the case of Class-III and Class-

IV, respectively. Clause-3 of the Policy provides as to who 

would be the competent Authority to make appointment on 

compassionate ground. 

13. 
Clause-4 
of 
the 
Policy 
provides 
that 

compassionate appointment would be made only to the 

lowest rung of Class-IV and Class-III posts. It was also provided 

under this Clause that Class-III jobs would include all 

equivalent jobs including technical posts and teachers (Class-

III). Clause-5 of the Policy deals with the eligibility. 

14. 
Clause-7 deals with the power of relaxation and 

provides that relaxation can be granted in regard to 

recruitment procedure, in case there is ban on filling up the 

posts the ban shall be deemed to have been relaxed, 

relaxation in educational qualification would be provided

only in respect of Class-IV posts and, that too, in genuine 

cases, with the prior approval of the Cabinet. However, in the 

cases of widows who are seeking appointment against Class-

IV post, relaxation in educational qualification can be 

granted by the concerned Administrative Department. In 

respect of relaxation in age, such cases are required to be 

placed before the Cabinet. 

15. 
Clause-8 of the Policy postulates that requests for 

grant of employment assistance must be received in the 

Department concerned within three years of the death of the 

Government servant. However, in case, at the time of death 

of the government servant, the sons/daughters of such an 

employee have not attained the age of majority, the time 

limit for receiving the request for employment assistance has 

been prescribed as attainment of 21 years by the eldest 

son/un-married daughter. 

16. 
Clause 10 of the Policy postulates that the benefits 

received by the family of the deceased-employee on 

account of family pension, death gratuity and ex-gratia grant 

have to be kept in mind while considering the cases under

the Policy. Clause 11 states that once a person accepts 

compassionate appointment to a particular post, he/she 

cannot seek change of post and such requests would not be 

allowed. 

17. 
The Policy, for the first time, was amended vide 

Office Memorandum, dated 26 th February, 1990, which 

provided that incumbents, who were offered appointment on 

compassionate grounds, either on the death of their 

parents/brothers/sisters or on the retirement of their parents 

on medical grounds, as the case may be, would be entitled 

to senior scale on qualifying the type test. It is apt to 

reproduce the relevant portion of the Office Memorandum, 

dated 26 th February, 1990, as under: 

"………it has been decided by the Government that the 
incumbents appointed as clerks on compassionate grounds 
either due to death of their parents/brothers/sisters etc. in 
service or due to retirement of their parents on medical 
grounds will not be allowed the senior scale till they qualify 
the type test. The decision may be brought to the notice of 
all concerned." 

18. 
Thereafter, an amendment was brought into the 

Policy vide Office Memorandum, dated 28 th June, 1991, 

whereby it was provided that where the employee who

sought retirement on medical grounds, at the age of 53 years 

in the case of a Class-III employee and 55 years in the case of 

a Class-IV employee, the case of wife or husband, as the 

case may be, would be considered, at the first instance, for 

grant of compassionate appointment. 

19. 
On 3 rd October, 1992, again the said Policy was 

amended, whereby it was provided that the incumbents, 

who were appointed on compassionate grounds, were to 

qualify the tying test within one year of their appointment and 

the incumbents not qualifying the typing test within one year, 

would not be entitled for annual increment and the annual 

increment would be granted in such cases from the date the 

incumbents qualify the typing test. 

20. 
On 1 st June, 1992, the Policy was again amended 

only in regard to compassionate appointment on medical 

grounds, which is not necessary for present discussion. 

21. 
Thereafter, on 18 th May, 1995, Clause 2(b) of the 

said Policy was amended, whereby it was provided that the 

employment assistance on compassionate ground would be 

provided to the dependant of a deceased daily waged

worker on daily wage basis only, irrespective of the fact 

whether the deceased daily waged worker had put in five 

years service with 240 days, on daily wage basis, in a 

calendar year or not. It is apt to reproduce relevant portion 

of the said Office Memorandum, dated 18 th May, 1995, 

hereunder: 

……. It has now been decided by the Government that the 

employment assistance to the dependent of a deceased 

daily waged worker shall be provided irrespective of the fact 

whether the deceased daily waged worker had put in 5 

years service with 240 days on daily wages basis in a year. 

Accordingly, para 2(b) of this Department O.M. of 

even number dated 18.1.1990 may be deemed to have 

been amended as under:-

"2(b). 
A daily waged employee who dies while 

in service leaving his family in immediate need of 

assistance may be given compassionate employment 

on daily wages only." 

22. 
Vide Office Memorandum, dated 12 th December, 

1997, another amendment was carried out and clause-5(c) of 

the policy was amended to the following effect: 

"…………. After due consideration of the matter it has now 
been decided by the Government that the employment 
assistance to the dependent of the deceased Government 
servant shall also be provided irrespective of the fact

whether one or more members of the deceased family is/are 
in Defence Services. 
Accordingly para 5(c) of this Department office 
Memorandum of even number dated 18.1.1990 may deem 
to have been amended to the above extent." 

23. 
Thereafter, the Policy was again amended vide 

Office Memorandum, dated 8 th May, 2001, to the following 

effect: 

"….. After careful consideration it has been decided that a 
person appointed on compassionate grounds should give 
an undertaking in writing that he/she will maintain properly 
the other family members who were dependent on the 
deceased Government servant and in case it is proved 
subsequently (at any time) that the family members are 
being neglected or are not being looked after properly by 
him/her, his/her services may be terminated forthwith. It 
should be incorporated as one of the additional conditions 
in the offer of appointment applicable only in the case of 
compassionate appointee. 
Further, it has been decided that such compassionate 
appointments can be terminated on the grounds stated in 
the offer of appointment after providing an opportunity to 
the person appointed on compassionate grounds by way of 
issuing a show cause notice asking him/her to explain why 
his/her services should not be terminated for non-
compliance of the condition(s) in the offer of appointment 
and it will not be necessary to follow the procedure 
prescribed in the Disciplinary Rules/Temporary Service Rules 
for this purpose. 
In order to check its misuse, it has also been decided 
that his power of termination of services for non-compliance 
of the condition(s) in the offer of compassionate 
appointment should vests only with the concerned 
Administrative Secretary of the Department not only in 
respect of persons working in the department but also in 
respect of Attached/subordinate Offices under that 
Department."

24. 
The Policy was also amended on 20 th May, 2000 to 

the following effect: 

"…. That as per provision of para-3 of the instructions ibid, 
the Head of Deptt. are competent to make appointment on 
compassionate grounds where the person seeking 
employment fulfils the criteria of educational as well as age 
and also his case covers under the instructions issued by the 
Govt. on the above subject. However, where relaxation on 
accounts of age/education qualification is necessitated, 
keeping in view the genuineness of the cases, such cases 
should be sent to the Admn. Deptt. alongwith specific 
recommendations and record of the case. As such, it is 
requested that in future such cases be decided finally at 
your level (except where relaxation on account of 
age/education qualification is needed) so that un-necessary 
delay to finalize these cases could be avoided." 

25. 
Again, pursuant to the Office Memorandum 

dated 25 th May, 2001, the Policy was amended and it was 

provided that all cases pertaining to compassionate 

appointment be sent by the concerned Heads of 

Department to the Finance Department of the Government 

for examination. 

26. 
Vide Office Memorandum dated 21 st June, 2002, 

once more, the Policy was amended and it was provided 

that the Administrative Departments would be the 

competent Authority to take a decision on the requests for 

compassionate appointments, subject to fulfillment of

essential conditions, including satisfaction in regard to 

indigent circumstances of the family of the deceased/retired 

employee. 
The relevant portion of the said Office 

Memorandum is reproduced below: 

"….it has been decided by the Government that henceforth 

the Administrative Departments shall be the competent 

authority to take a decision on the requests for 

compassionate appointments subject to fulfillment of all 

essential conditions of the policy and their satisfaction as to 

the indigent circumstances of the family of the 

deceased/retired Government servant." 

27. 
On 24 th August, 2002 and 2 nd September, 2002, 

clarifications in regard to 'indigent circumstances' were 

issued defining the word "indigent", as referred to in the 

Policy. Relevant portion of the letter dated 24 th August, 2002 

is reproduced below: 

"……in this connection, references have been received from 

certain departments enquiring as to what constitutes 

"Indigent circumstances" and also requesting that some 

uniform guidelines on the subject may be issued. 

The matter has been considered carefully and it is 

noticed that specific guidelines with respect to what would 

amount to "indigent circumstances" will not be possible or 

practicable "indigent circumstances" of a family are to be

seen with specific reference to the assets i.e. immoveable 

and moveable property left behind by the deceased 

income from various sources i.e. assets, house(s), pension, 

savings resulting to income employment status and number 

of employees within the extended family etc. as also 

liabilities i.e. number of dependents specially unmarried 

daughters aged parents etc. left behind by the deceased, 

some consideration towards the particular standard of life 

that the family of the deceased might be used to during the 

life time of the government employee etc. These are vital 

parameters that have to be kept in mind before any 

decision is arrived at regarding admissibility of employment 

to the ward/dependent of the deceased employee. As the 

above 
would 
show 
the 
question 
of 
"indigent 

circumstances", therefore has to be decided in each 

individual case after obtaining detailed information about all 

the relevant aspects mentioned, so that employment on 

compassionate grounds is not given as matter of routine. 

While every effort should be made to provide suitable 

employment in all deserving cases. It should always be kept 

in mind that employment on compassionate ground can not 

be claimed as a matter of right. Also the competent 

authority should take full precautions to exclude the element 

of "pick and choose" while considering such cases." 

It may be placed on record that it appears that these 

clarificatory letters, dated 24 th August 2002 and 2 nd

September, 2002, were issued without amending the Policy 

and without any approval from the competent Authority. 

28 
Vide Office Memorandum, dated 23 rd November, 

2004, yet again the Policy was amended and it was provided 

that the Administrative Departments would send the requests 

for compassionate appointments to the Finance Department 

of the Government, who, in turn, would submit the same to 

the Hon'ble Chief Minister through Chief Secretary. It is apt to 

reproduce the relevant portion of the said Office 

Memorandum, hereunder: 

"…… After due consideration it has now been decided by 

the Government that henceforth all the Administrative 

Departments will send case-files in this regard to the Finance 

department which will submit the same to the Hon'ble Chief 

Minister through Chief Secretary for approval." 

29. 
Again, amendment in the said Policy was made 

on 16 th August, 2005, whereby Clause 2(b) of the said Policy 

was amended and it was laid down that in case a work 

charge Beldar, working on daily wage basis with 7 years 

continuous service, dies in harness, one of his dependants be 

appointed on compassionate ground, on daily wage basis

and the Deputy Commissioners, Superintending Engineers of 

Public Works Department, Irrigation & Public Health 

Department, HPSEB, Conservators of Forest, Chief Medical 

Officers, 
Deputy 
Director 
of 
Horticulture/Agriculture 

Department and other equivalent Regional/District Level 

Officers, as the case may be, would be competent to make 

such an appointment. 

"…..With a view to further liberalize the policy, it has been 

decided by the Government that if a Work Charged Beldar 

on daily wages with 7 years continuous service dies in 

harness one of his dependents be appointed on daily 

wages. In such cases appointments will be done by Deputy 

Commissioner, Superintending Engineers of Public Works 

Department, Irrigation & Public Health Department, 

H.P.S.E.B., Conservators of Forest, Chief Medical Officers,

30. 
The 
policy 
was 
amended 
vide 
Office 

Memorandum, dated 4 th April, 2008, and it was provided that 

only indigent circumstances of the family were required to be 

looked into and no indigent certificate of any kind was 

required. It is apt to reproduce the relevant portion of the 

said Office Memorandum hereunder: 

"…..It has been brought to the notice of the 

Government that some departments are not implementing 

these provisions and therefore, the Government has 

decided to reiterate the following points: 

1. 
That employment should be given on merit i.e. 

after examining the indigent status of the family 

properly. 

2. 
The applications received for such employment 

may have some deficiencies/objections. All such 

deficiencies/ objections should be raised only once

and the practice of returning the applications several 

times is not correct. 
This causes unnecessary 

harassment to the families and therefore it should be 

avoided; and 

3. 
No indigent certificate of any kind is required as 

per instructions. Only indigent circumstances of the 

family are required to be looked into. This purpose 

can be achieved by examining the income of the 

family. There is no such certificate prescribed by the 

Government nor should indigent certificate be 

demanded from the affected families." 

31. 
Subsequently, Office Memorandum was issued on 

10 th November, 2008, whereby 5% vacancies, falling under 

the direct recruitment quota in Class-III and Class-IV posts, 

were reserved for appointments to be made on 

compassionate grounds. It is apt to reproduce the relevant 

portion of the said amendment hereunder: 

"………….The matter for providing employment on 

compassionate grounds expeditiously in deserving cases was 

under consideration of the Government for some time past. 

After due consideration it has been deiced by the 

?Government that in order to provide compassionate 

employment to the deserving and eligible persons 5% of 

vacancies falling under direct recruitment quota in Class-III & 

IV post should be reserved for this category. The Appointing 

Authority may therefore, hold up to 5% of vacancies in the

aforesaid categories to be filled by direct recruitment, so as 

to fill such vacancies by appointment on compassionate 

grounds." 

32. 
Vide Office Memorandum, dated 21 st January, 

2009, issued by the Secretary (Personnel) to the Government 

Himachal Pradesh, it was provided that the cases for 

appointment on compassionate ground on daily wage basis 

be also sent to the Finance Department for obtaining 

approval. It is apt to reproduce relevant portion of the said 

Office Memorandum hereunder: 

"…..After due consideration and in continuation of the

the Government that henceforth the compassionate cases 

of employment of daily-wagers shall also be sent by the 

Departments to the Administrative Departments who will 

send the same to the Finance Department for obtaining the 

approval of the competent authority so as to expedite the 

matter and maintain uniformity in approach." 

33. 
A letter, dated 15 th July, 2010, was issued by the 

Principal Secretary (Finance) to the Government of Himachal 

Pradesh, to all the Administrative Secretaries whereby it was 

conveyed that for the present, only those cases be sent to

ground in which the applicant is a widow or where both

of the said letter is reproduced hereunder: 

"….as per present policy of the Government this Department 

is considering those cases where the applicant is a widow or 

cases of those applications whose both parents are not 

alive." 

34. 
In the sequel, vide letter dated 25 th September, 

2010, again an amendment was brought into the said Policy 

wherein it was provided that apart from widows, the cases of 

the applicants whose parents were not alive, would be 

considered on priority basis for appointment on 

compassionate grounds. The relevant portion of the said 

letter is extracted hereinbelow: 

"….Now, it has been decided by the Government that apart 

from the widow applicants the cases of applicants whose 

both parents are not alive shall be given priority for 

considering the matter of providing employment on

relevant criteria prescribed by the Govt. from time to time.

Thereupon, Clause 2(f) was added in the Policy

whereby it was provided that the dependant of a 

contractual employee, who died in harness, would be 

entitled for appointment on compassionate ground on daily 

wage basis. It is apt to reproduce relevant portion of the said 

notification hereunder: 

"………It has further been decided by the State Govt. that

dated 18.01.1990:-

leaving his family in immediate need of assistance 

may be given compassionate employment on daily 

waged basis." 

36. 
Letter dated 21 st December, 2012, issued by the 

Finance Department of the Government to the Administrative 

Secretaries, mandates that all cases wherein appointment on

Thereafter, in terms of the Office Memorandum, 

dated 10 th September, 2013, following amendment was 

effected in Clause 2(d) and Clause 10 (b), which are

Authority. A specific query was put to the learned Advocate 

General to show from the records whether the decision for 

fixing the maximum income ceiling, by taking into account 

the income received from family pension and other terminal 

benefits, was taken by amending the Policy and whether 

such amendment has been approved by the Cabinet. 

41. 
To this, the learned Advocate General submitted 

that Clause 10(c) of the Policy itself provides that amounts 

received by the family of the deceased employee on 

account of ex-gratia, improved family pension and death 

gratuity, are to be taken into consideration, while granting 

appointment on compassionate ground. In order to show 

that the decision for fixing the maximum income ceiling was 

taken by amending the policy, he has placed reliance upon 

a letter dated 1 st November, 2008, which was written by the 

Secretary (PW) to the Engineer-in-Chief, HP PWD, in which it 

was mentioned that the income ceiling fixed by the Finance 

Department, for a family of four members, was Rs.1.00 lac. It 

is apt to reproduce the said letter hereunder:

The Secretary(PW) to the 
Govt. of Himachal Pradesh

Shimla-2. 

Dated Shimla-2, the 1.11.2008 

Subject: 
Regarding 
Employment 
assistance 
on 
compassionate grounds. 
Sir, 

On the above cited subject, I am directed to 

say 
that 
Finance 
Deptt. 
has 
issued 
some 

instructions/conditions 
regarding 
compassionate 

employment which already stands conveyed to your office 

vide this deptt letter No.PBW-A-B(2)-34/2006 dated 29 th 

September 2008. One of the conditions is that before offer 

of appointment, department is to ensure that Income based 

indigency criteria is met with. However, the Income based 

criteria fixed by the Finance Department is reproduced as 

under:-

"The Income Criteria fixed by the Finance 

Department takes into consideration maximum family 

income ceiling fixed by the finance Deptt. for a family for 4 

members as Rs.1.00 lac and for smaller families, the internal 

criteria is Rs.25,000/-per person, per annum. Thus, if there is 

only one dependent, the overall income limit to be 

considered is Rs.25,000/-per annum. In case, there are two 

dependents of the deceased, the income of the applicant 

should not exceed Rs.50,000/-per annum. In case of three

dependents, the overall income should not exceed 

Rs.75,000/-per annum. The overall income limit is Rs.1.00 lac 

per annum, even if family size is more than four. Gratuity, 

leave encashment, commutation amount are excluded for 

purpose of calculating family income but monthly 

pension/family pension, Dearness Relief, Interim Relief is 

included for calculation of yearly family income." 

You are therefore, requested that while sending 

the cases of employment assistance on compassionate 

grounds to this department, these may be examined on the 

basis of above criteria fixed by the Finance Department and 

such cases which do not fulfill the above criteria, need not 

be sent to the Govt. and be decided at your own level. 

Yours Faithfully 

Sd/-

Under Secretary (PW) to the 
Govt. of Himachal Pradesh" 

It is mentioned in the said letter that the maximum family 

income ceiling fixed by the finance Deptt. for a family of 4 

members was Rs.1.00 lac. Thereafter, as has come on the 

record, the maximum income ceiling was increased to Rs.1.50 

lacs. 

42. 
However, it is not clear from a perusal of the 

above letter -whether the maximum income ceiling, by 

taking into account the amount received by the family

towards family pension and other terminal benefits, was fixed 

on the basis of the amendment effected by the competent 

Authority i.e. the State Cabinet. If the answer to this question 

is in the affirmative, then it is again a mystery that why the 

follow-up orders were not issued by the concerned 

Department of the Government bringing the said 

amendment into broad day light. The learned Advocate 

General was also not in a position to place on record any 

material which would be suggestive of the fact that the said 

ceiling was fixed by amending the Policy. 

43. 
It is also pertinent to note that the Finance 

Department of the Government of Himachal Pradesh issued a 

letter, dated 18 th July, 2014, to all the Administrative 

Secretaries that an appeal be filed in cases where the Courts 

have passed direction for giving compassionate appointment 

to a claimant without counting family pension as income. 

44. 
Thus, from the above discussion of the Policy, as 

amended from time to time, and from the facts of the cases, 

which would be enumerated subsequently, the following

questions emerge for determination, in order to narrow down 

and settle the controversy: 

(i) Whether the amount of family pension and other 

retiral benefits, received by the family of the 

deceased-employee, can be included in the family 

income 
for 
denying 
the 
compassionate 

appointment? 

(ii) Which date would be relevant viz. a viz. applicability 

of the Policy -whether the date of death of the 

employee or the date when the application was 

presented, for the first time, for seeking employment 

on compassionate ground or the date on which the 

application came up for consideration before the 

Authorities, and whether a claim for compassionate 

appointment can be decided on the basis of 

subsequent amendment, when the application was 

presented prior to such amendment? 

(iii) If an applicant was in lis and his case was directed to 

be reconsidered, whether the claim of such 

applicant is to be determined as per the policy 

which was existing at the time of passing the order or 

as per the policy which was in place at the time of 

staking claim for the first time or as per the policy 

existing at the time of consideration?

(iv) Whether the applicant can claim appointment on 

compassionate ground against a higher cadre, once 

he had been appointed in the lower cadre? 

(v) In case a person is appointed on contract basis, 

whether he is within his rights to seek appointment on 

regular basis? 

(vi) In a given set of cases, in one case the appointment 

on compassionate ground has been offered against 

a Class-III post and in other case, the appointment 

has been offered to a Class-IV post, whether it 

amounts to discrimination? 

(vii) Whether a person can claim compassionate 

appointment after a considerable delay? 

(viii) Whether requisite qualification or age can be 

relaxed? 

(ix) In case one or more dependants of a deceased-

employee is/are in service, though living separately, 

whether that can be made a ground to deny 

compassionate 
appointment 
to 
the 
other 

dependant of the deceased-employee? 

45. 
After going through the Policy, dated 18 th 

January, 1990, as amended from time to time, and the facts, 

as are emerging, our point-wise findings, on the above points, 

are as under.

Point No.(i) : Whether the amount of family pension and 
other retiral benefits, received by the family of the 
deceased-employee, can be included in the family 
income for denying the compassionate appointment? 

46. 
Clause 10(c) of the Policy mandates that while 

making appointment on compassionate ground, the 

competent Authority has to keep in mind the benefits 

received by the family on account of ad hoc ex-gratia grant, 

improved family pension and death gratuity. Therefore, we 

may place on record at the outset that no maximum income 

ceiling has been prescribed in the Policy. Only what has 

been prescribed is that the competent Authority has to keep 

in mind the benefits received by the family after the death of 

the employee, as detailed above. 

47. 
The aim and object of granting compassionate 

appointment is to enable the family of the deceased 

employee to tide over the sudden financial crisis which the 

family has met on the death of its breadwinner. Though, 

appointment on compassionate ground is inimical to the right 

of equality guaranteed under the Constitution, however, at 

the same time, we cannot be oblivious to the fact that the 

concept of granting appointment on compassionate ground

H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

61 

is an exception to the general rule, which concept has been 

evolved in the interest of justice, by way of Policy framed in 

this regard by the employer. 
The object sought to be 

achieved by making such an exception is to provide 

immediate assistance to the destitute family, which comes to 

the level of zero after the death of its bread-earner. Thus, we 

are of the considered view that the amount of family pension 

and other retiral benefits cannot be equated with the 

employment assistance on compassionate ground. 

48. 
While reaching at this conclusion, we are 

supported by the decision of the Apex Court in Govind 

Prakash Verma vs. Life Insurance Corporation of India and 

others, (2005) 10 Supreme Court Cases 289, wherein it was 

held that scheme for providing employment assistance on 

compassionate ground was over and above the service 

benefits received by the family of an employee after his 

death. 
It is apt to reproduce the relevant portion of 

paragraph 6 of the said decision hereunder: 

"6. In our view, it was wholly irrelevant for the 

departmental authorities and the learned Single Judge 

to take into consideration the amount which was being

paid as family pension to the widow of the deceased 

(which amount, according to the appellant, has now 

been reduced to half) and other amounts paid on 

account of terminal benefits under the Rules. The 

scheme of compassionate appointment is over and 

above whatever is admissible to the legal 

representatives of the deceased employee as benefits 

of service which one gets on the death of the 

employee. Therefore, compassionate appointment 

cannot be refused on the ground that any member of 

the family received the amounts admissible under the 

Rules……………………………..". 

49. 
The Apex Court in A.P.S.R.T.C., Musheerabad & 

Ors. vs. Sarvarunnisa Begum, 2008 AIR SCW 1946, while 

discussing the aim and object of granting compassionate 

appointment, has held that the widow, who was paid 

additional monetary benefits for not claiming appointment, 

was not entitled to compassionate appointment. It is apt to 

reproduce paragraphs 3 and 4 of the said decision 

hereunder: 

"3. This Court time and again has held that the 

compassionate appointment would be given to the 

dependent of the deceased who died in harness to get

over the difficulties on the death of the bread-earner. 

In Umesh Kumar Nagpal vs. State of Haryana and 

Others, (1994) 4 SCC 138, this Court has held as under: 

"The whole object of granting compassionate 

employment is to enable the family to tide over 

the sudden crisis. The object is not to give a 

member of such family a post much less a post for 

post held by the deceased. What is further, mere 

death of an employee in harness does not entitle 

his family to such source of livelihood. The 

Government or the public authority concerned 

has to examine the financial condition of the 

family of the deceased, and it is only if it is 

satisfied, that but for the provision of employment, 

the family will not be able to meet the crisis that a 

job is to be offered to the eligible member of the 

family. The posts in Classes III and IV are the lowest 

post in non-manual and manual categories and 

hence they alone can be offered on 

compassionate grounds, the object being to 

relieve the family, of the financial destitution and 

to help it get over the emergency. 

Offering compassionate employment as a matter 

of course irrespective of the financial condition of the 

family of the deceased and making compassionate 

appointments in posts above Classes III and IV, is legally 

impermissible."

4. In the present case, the additional monetary benefit 

has been given to the widow apart from the benefits 

available to the widow after the death of her husband 

to get over the financial constraints on account of 

sudden death of her husband and, thus, as a matter of 

right, she was not entitled to claim the compassionate 

appointment and that too when it had not been 

brought to the notice of the Court that any vacancy 

was available where the respondent could have been 

accommodated by giving her a compassionate 

appointment. That apart, the Division Bench of the High 

Court has committed an error in modifying the direction 

of the Single Judge by directing the Corporation to 

appoint the respondent when no appeal was preferred 

by the respondent challenging order of the Single 

Judge." 

50. 
Coming to the Policy in hand, there is nothing on 

the record to show that the writ respondents have ever made 

a provision for additional monetary benefit, as a substitute to 

the employment assistance on compassionate ground, 

except the terminal benefits to which the family of the 

deceased-employee is otherwise entitled to. 

51. 
The Apex Court in its latest decision in Canara 

Bank & Anr. vs. M. Mahesh Kumar, 2015 AIR SCW 3212, while

o u r t o f H

relying upon its earlier decision in Balbir Kaur and another vs. 

Steel Authority of India Ltd. and others, (supra), has restated 

the similar position, and held that grant of family pension or 

payment of terminal benefits, cannot be treated as substitute 

for providing employment assistance on compassionate 

ground. It is apt to reproduce paragraphs 15 and 16 of the 

said decision hereunder: 

"15. Insofar as the contention of the appellant-bank 

that since the respondent's family is getting family 

pension and also obtained the terminal benefits, in our 

view, is of no consequence in considering the 

application for compassionate appointment. Clause 3.2 

of 1993 Scheme says that in case the dependant of 

deceased employee to be offered appointment is a 

minor, the bank may keep the offer of appointment 

open till the minor attains the age of majority. This would 

indicate that granting of terminal benefits is of no 

consequence because even if terminal benefit is given, 

if the applicant is a minor, the bank would keep the 

appointment open till the minor attains the majority. 

16. In Balbir Kaur & Anr. vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd. & 

Ors., 2000 6 SCC 493, while dealing with the application 

made by the widow for employment on compassionate 

ground applicable to the Steel Authority of India, 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

66 

contention raised was that since she is entitled to get 

the benefit under Family Benefit Scheme assuring 

monthly payment to the family of the deceased 

employee, the request for compassionate appointment 

cannot be acceded to. Rejecting that contention in 

paragraph (13), this Court held as under:-

"13. .But in our view this Family Benefit Scheme 
cannot in any way be equated with the benefit of 
compassionate appointments. The sudden jerk in 
the family by reason of the death of the 
breadearner can only be absorbed by some 
lump-sum amount being made available to the 
family this is rather unfortunate but this is a reality. 
The feeling of security drops to zero on the death 
of the breadearner and insecurity thereafter 
reigns and it is at that juncture if some lump-sum 
amount is made available with a compassionate 
appointment, the grief-stricken family may find 
some solace to the mental agony and manage its 
affairs in the normal course of events. It is not that 
monetary benefit would be the replacement of 
the breadearner, but that would undoubtedly 
bring some solace to the situation." 

Referring to Steel Authority of India Ltd.'s case, High 

Court has rightly held that the grant of family pension or 

payment of terminal benefits cannot be treated as a 

substitute for providing employment assistance. The 

High Court also observed that it is not the case of the 

bank that the respondents' family is having any other 

income to negate their claim for appointment on 

compassionate ground." 

Emphasis applied.

52. 
The Clauses contained in the Policy in hand are 

similar to the Scheme, which was the subject matter before 

the Apex Court in Canara Bank's case (supra). Therefore, the 

mandate of the said judgment of the Apex Court is squarely 

applicable to the cases in hand. 

53. 
From the facts of the cases in hand, another moot 

question, which arises for consideration, is -Whether 

instructions contained in letters/communications, made by 

one Department of the Government to another, can be said 

to be amendment in the Policy? The answer is in the 

negative for the following reasons. 

54. 
In order to show that the maximum income ceiling 

was prescribed by the competent Authority, the respondents 

have relied upon the letter, dated 1 st November, 2008, written 

by the Secretary (PW) to the Government of H.P., to the 

Engineer-in-Chief, HP PWD, referred to above, wherein it was 

mentioned that the income ceiling fixed by the Finance 

Department, for a family of four members, was Rs.1.00 lac. A 

perusal of this letter shows that it has been mentioned therein 

that "the Income Criteria fixed by the Finance Department 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

68 

takes into consideration maximum family income ceiling fixed 

by the finance Deptt. for a family of 4 members as Rs.1.00 

lac." It is nowhere mentioned in the said letter that the 

income ceiling was fixed by the competent Authority by 

making amendment in the Policy. 
Moreover, the said 

amendment, if any, has not been placed on record and has 

not seen the light of the day. 
Therefore, the 

letters/communications issued by a Department to another 

Department cannot be said to be amendment in the Policy 

unless the said amendment has got the approval of the 

competent Authority i.e. the Cabinet. 

55. 
Having regard to the above discussion, we are of 

the considered view that the action of the respondents of 

denying employment assistance to the dependant of a 

deceased employee by taking into account the family 

pension and other terminal benefits is not tenable in the eyes 

of law. Point No.(i) is answered accordingly. 

Point No.(ii) -Which date would be relevant viz. a viz. 

applicability of the Policy -whether the date of death of 

the employee or the date when the application was 

presented, for the first time, for seeking employment on 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

69 

compassionate ground or the date on which the 

application came up for consideration before the 

Authorities, and whether a claim for compassionate 

appointment can be decided on the basis of subsequent 

amendment, when the application was presented prior 

to such amendment? 

Point No.(iii) -If an applicant was in lis and his case was 

directed to be reconsidered, whether the claim of such 

applicant is to be determined as per the policy which 

was existing at the time of passing the order or as per the 

policy which was in place at the time of staking claim for 

the first time or as per the policy existing at the time of 

consideration? 

56. 
These points, being overlapping, are taken up 

together and are being determined as follows. 

57. 
To answer these points, we may refer to Clause-8 

of the Policy, which provides that at the time of death of the 

employee, in case, the dependant of the employee is minor, 

the writ respondents would keep the offer of appointment 

under eclipse i.e. open till the eldest son/un-married daughter 

attains the age of 21 years. Thus, from a perusal of the above 

Clause and the Policy in its entirety, we are of the considered 

view that in order to achieve the avowed purpose of the 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

70 

Policy, the cause of action can be said to have arisen on the 

date when the claim is presented by the applicant by filing 

the application claiming appointment on compassionate 

ground, and that, the claim for appointment on 

compassionate ground, presented under a particular 

scheme, cannot be considered under a scheme which was 

amended after the date of making the claim. 

58. 
While reaching at the above conclusion, we are 

supported by the decision of the Apex Court in State Bank of 

India and others vs. Jaspal Kaur, 2007 AIR SCW 1044, wherein 

the Apex Court has held that appointment on compassionate 

ground has to be made strictly in accordance with the 

Policy/Scheme which was applicable at the time of making 

the application. It is apt to reproduce paragraph 30 of the 

said decision hereunder: 

30. Finally, in the fact situation of this case, Sri. Sukhbir Inder 

Singh (late), Record Assistant (Cash & Accounts) on 

01.08.1999, in the Dhab Wasti Ram, Amritsar branch, passed 

away. The respondent, widow of Sri Sukhbir Inder Singh 

applied for compassionate appointment in the appellant 

Bank on 05.02.2000 under the scheme which was formulated 

in 2005. The High Court also erred in deciding the matter in

o u r t o f H 

. P . 

71 

favour of the respondent applying the scheme formulated 

on 04.08.2005, when her application was made in 2000. A 

dispute arising in 2000 cannot be decided on the basis of a 

scheme that came into place much after the dispute arose, 

in the present matter in 2005. Therefore, the claim of the 

respondent that the income of the family of deceased is 

Rs.5855/-only, which is less than 40% of the salary last drawn 

by Late Shri. Sukhbir Inder Singh, in contradiction to the 2005 

scheme does not hold water." 

59. 
The Apex Court in Maharani Devi & Anr. vs. Union 

of India & Ors., 2009 AIR SCW 5775, while considering the 

question as to what would be the relevant date -whether 

date of death of the employee or the date when the 

application was presented or the date of consideration, 

remanded the matter to the High Court to decide the said 

issue. It is apt to reproduce paragraphs 12, 13, 14 and 15 of 

the said decision hereunder: 

"12. The learned Counsel for the appellants relied on the 

judgment of this Court reported in Chairman Railway Board 

and Ors. v. C.R. Rangadhamaiah and Ors. which is a 

Constitution Bench decision. This was a case wherein the 

validity of the same Notification issued by the Railways under 

Article 309 amending Rule 2544 of Indian Railway 

Establishment Board with retrospective effect was under

72 

consideration. By that amendment the pension conditions of 

the employees who had already retired on the date of 

Notification was adversely affected. The Court held that in 

the circumstances, the rules could not have been amended 

retrospectively affecting the rights of the employees. The 

Court, however, held that on the date when the said 

retrospective amendments were introduced, Article 19(1)(f) 

and Article 31(1) were available in the Constitution of India. 

The Court held that, therefore, the right of property of the 

petitioner was breached by the impugned retrospective 

circulars. Further in cutting down the pension by bringing in 

the amendments to the provisions retrospectively would be 

invalid, breaching Articles 14 and 16. Relying heavily on this 

judgment the learned Counsel suggests that at least in the 

aforementioned case, the amendments were retrospective 

while in the present case they were not retrospective and, 

therefore, the amended Circular dated 13.12.1995 would not 

be applicable. The further argument is that under any 

circumstance the right for being considered for 

compassionate appointment had accrued on the date of 

death of the employee that being the only relevant date. 

According to the learned Counsel the date on which the 

representation was made was irrelevant. 

13. As against this the learned senior counsel Shri Harish 

Chandra urged that the most relevant date would only be 

when the representation was made because the Railway 

Board had to consider as to whether the appellants were 

indigent on the date when the application was made.

14. On this crucial question, however, the High Court has not 

expressed any opinion. It has merely approved of the 

judgment of the Tribunal. Learned senior counsel in support 

of his argument relied on the judgment in State Bank of India 

and Ors. v. Jaspal Kaur, reported in 2007 (9) SCC 571. 

However, we do not find any similarity in the situation 

appearing in this case and the one decided by this Court. 

The reported decision only considered the question as to 

which scheme pertaining to compassionate appointment 

should be preferred -whether it should be the scheme 

prevailing at the time when the application for 

compassionate appointment was filed or the one which was 

available on the date of decision of the Court. 

15. Such question is not for our consideration in the present 

matter. That decision is, therefore, of no use for learned 

Counsel for the respondents. However, in our view the 

question posed by us as to what would be the relevant date 

for consideration, whether it would be the date of death of 

employee or whether it would be the date of making the 

representation? That has not been considered by the High 

Court. We, therefore, remand this matter to the High Court 

with a request to the High Court to decide the same. We 

request the High Court to dispose of the matter within six 

months of the writ reaching the High Court as the matter 

pertains to the rights of a poor widow. The appeal is allowed 

in the terms stated by us with no orders as to the costs."

the case of compassionate appointment, has held that a 

scheme or policy promulgated by the employer is binding on 

the employer and the employee. It is apt to reproduce 

paragraph 15 of the said decision hereunder: 

"15. Now, it is well settled that compassionate employment is 

given solely on humanitarian grounds with the sole object to 

provide immediate relief to the employee's family to tide 

over the sudden financial crisis and cannot be claimed as a 

matter of right. Appointment based solely on descent is 

inimical to our Constitutional scheme, and ordinarily public 

employment must be strictly on the basis of open invitation 

of applications and comparative merit, in consonance with 

Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. No other mode 

of appointment is permissible. Nevertheless, the concept of 

compassionate appointment has been recognized as an 

exception to the general rule, carved out in the interest of 

justice, in certain exigencies, by way of a policy of an 

employer, which partakes the character of the service rules. 

That being so, it needs little emphasis that the scheme or the 

policy, as the case may be, is binding both on the employer 

and the employee. Being an exception, the scheme has to 

be strictly construed and confined only to the purpose it 

seeks to achieve. We do not propose to burden this 

judgment with reference to a long line of decisions of this 

Court on the point. However, in order to recapitulate the 

factors to be taken into consideration while examining the

claim for appointment on compassionate ground, we may 

refer to a few decisions." 

61. 
The Apex Court in MGB Gramin Bank vs. 

Chakrawarti Singh, 2013 AIR SCW 4801, held that in case a 

scheme does not create any legal right, a candidate cannot 

claim that his case be considered as per the Scheme existing 

on the date the cause of action had arisen i.e. death of the 

incumbent on the post. It is apt to reproduce paragraphs 12 

and 13 of the said decision hereunder: 

"12. A scheme containing an in pari materia clause, as is 

involved in this case was considered by this Court in State 

Bank of India & Anr. vs. Raj Kumar, (2010) 11 SCC 661. Clause 

14 of the said Scheme is verbatim to clause 14 of the 

scheme involved herein, which reads as under: 

"14. Date of effect of the scheme and disposal of 

pending applications: The Scheme will come into 

force with effect from the date it is approved by the 

Board of Directors. Applications pending under the 

Compassionate Appointment Scheme as on the date 

on which this new Scheme is approved by the Board 

will be dealt with in accordance with Scheme for 

payment of ex-gratia lump sum amount provided they 

fulfill all the terms and conditions of this scheme." 

13. The Court considered various aspects of service 

jurisprudence and came to the conclusion that as the

H 
i g h

appointment on compassionate ground may not be 

claimed as a matter of right nor an applicant becomes 

entitled automatically for appointment, rather it depends on 

various other circumstances i.e. eligibility and financial 

conditions of the family, etc., the application has to be 

considered in accordance with the scheme. In case the 

Scheme does not create any legal right, a candidate 

cannot claim that his case is to be considered as per the 

Scheme existing on the date the cause of action had arisen 

i.e. death of the incumbent on the post. In State Bank of 

India & Anr. , this Court held that in such a situation, the case 

under the new Scheme has to be considered." 

62. 
The Apex Court in its latest decision in Canara 

Bank & Anr. vs. M. Mahesh Kumar, 2015 AIR SCW 3212, 

(supra), held that when the dependant of the deceased-

employee applied in time, under a particular Scheme, his 

case cannot be considered under the Scheme, which was 

introduced subsequently. 
It was also held that the 

subsequently introduced Scheme, being administrative or 

executive order, cannot have a retrospective effect. It is apt 

to reproduce paragraphs 9, 11, 13, 14 and 17 of the said 

decision hereunder: 

"9. Before adverting to the arguments of the learned counsel 

for the parties, it is necessary to examine the scope of the

Scheme dated 8.05.1993 vide Circular No.154/1993 for 

"compassionate appointment". The object of the Scheme is 

to help dependants of employees of Canara Bank who die 

or become totally and permanently disabled while in 

harness and to overcome the immediate financial difficulties 

on account of sudden stoppage of the main source of 

income. The employment under the scheme will be 

considered only if there are indigent circumstances 

necessitating employment to one of the dependants and 

the deceased employee's service record is unblemished. 

Mere eligibility will not vest a right for claiming employment. 

As per para 3.1, application for employment should be 

sought within 21/2 years from the date of death of the 

employees. In para 3.2, it is stated that in case of the 

dependant of the deceased employee to be offered 

appointment is a minor, the bank may keep the offer of 

appointment open till the minor attains the age of majority 

provided a request is made to the bank by the family of the 

deceased employee and the same may be considered 

subject to rules prevailing at the time of consideration. 

……………….

11. The main question falling for consideration is whether the 

Scheme passed in 2005 providing for ex-gratia payment or 

the Scheme then in vogue in 1993 providing for 

compassionate appointment is applicable to the 

respondent. Appellant-bank has placed reliance upon the 

judgment of this Court in Jaspal Kaur's case to contend that 

the respondent's case cannot be considered on the basis of 

'Dying in Harness Scheme 1993' when the new Scheme of

H 
i g h

o u r t o f H

78 

2005 providing for ex-gratia payment had been put in place. 

In Jaspal Kaur's case , Sukhbir Inder Singh employee of State 

Bank of India, Record Assistant (Cash & Accounts) passed 

away on 1.08.1999. Widow of the employee applied for 

compassionate appointment in State Bank of India on 

5.02.2000. On 7.01.2002, the competent authority of the bank 

rejected the application of Jaspal Kaur in view of the 

Scheme vis-a-vis the financial position of the family. Against 

that decision of the competent authority, the respondent 

filed writ petition before the Punjab and Haryana High Court 

which has directed to consider the case of Jaspal Kaur by 

applying the Scheme formulated on 4.08.2005 when her 

application was made in the year 2000. In that factual 

matrix, this Court has directed that dispute arising in the year 

2000 cannot be decided on the basis of a Scheme that was 

put in place much after the dispute. By perusal of the 

judgment in Jaspal Kaur's case, it is apparent that the 

judgment specifically states that claim of compassionate 

appointment under a scheme of a particular year cannot 

be decided in the light of the subsequent scheme that 

came into force much after the claim. 

………………… 
………………… 
………………. 

13. Applying these principles to the case in hand, as 

discussed earlier, respondent's father died on 10.10.1998 

while he was serving as a clerk in the appellant-bank and 

the respondent applied timely for compassionate 

appointment as per the scheme 'Dying in Harness Scheme' 

dated 8.05.1993 which was in force at that time. The 

appellant-bank rejected the respondent's claim on 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

79 

30.06.1999 recording that there are no indigent 

circumstances for providing employment to the respondent. 

Again on 7.11.2001, the appellant-bank sought for particulars 

in connection with the issue of respondent's employment. In 

the light of the principles laid down in the above decisions, 

the cause of action to be considered for compassionate 

appointment arose when the Circular No.154/1993 dated 

8.05.1993 was in force. Thus, as per the judgment referred in 

Jaspal Kaur's case, the claim cannot be decided as per 2005 

Scheme providing for ex-gratia payment. The Circular dated 

14.2.2005 being an administrative or executive order cannot 

have retrospective effect so as to take away the right 

accrued to the respondent as per circular of 1993. 

14. It is also pertinent to note that 2005 Scheme providing 

only for ex-gratia payment in lieu of compassionate 

appointment stands superseded by the Scheme of 2014 

which has revived the scheme providing for compassionate 

appointment. As on date, now the scheme in force is to 

provide 
compassionate 
appointment. 
Under 
these 

circumstances, the appellant-bank is not justified in 

contending that the application for compassionate 

appointment of the respondent cannot be considered in 

view of passage of time. 

……………. 
……………….. 
…………………… 

17. Considering the scope of the Scheme 'Dying in Harness 

Scheme 1993' then in force and the facts and circumstances 

of the case, the High Court rightly directed the appellant-

bank to reconsider the claim of the respondent for 

compassionate appointment in accordance with law and

i g h

as per the Scheme (1993) then in existence. We do not find 

any reason warranting interference." 

63. 
Applying the ratio to the cases in hand and 

keeping in view the provisions of the Policy in question, we 

hold that the date of death of the employee is not to be 

taken into consideration while seeing the applicability of the 

Policy. Similarly, the date on which the application comes up 

for consideration before the competent Authority is also of no 

importance, since, because of the lackadaisical approach of 

the Departments, such cases may have been kept pending 

for a pretty long time and during that period, the policy may 

have been amended. 
Thus, the applicants, in such 

circumstances, cannot be made to suffer for the inaction on 

the part of the Authorities. 

64. 
Accordingly, we hold that the case of the 

applicant would be governed by the provisions of the Policy 

which was in place at the time when the application, for the 

first time, was made by the applicant to the Department, and 

in the case of a minor, the right to apply would commence 

from the date he/she attained majority, as given in the

Scheme and his/her application would be considered as per 

the Policy/Scheme which was in vogue at the time of 

presenting the application. In the matters where the Court or 

the Tribunal has directed the Authorities to consider the case 

of the applicant afresh, the claim of the applicant has to be 

determined as per the policy applicable at the time of 

presenting the application for the first time before the 

Department concerned. Points No.(ii) and (iii) are answered 

accordingly. 

Points No.(iv): Whether the applicant can claim 

appointment on compassionate ground against a higher 

cadre, once he had been appointed in the lower cadre? 

Point No.(v): In case a person is appointed on contract 

basis, whether he is within his rights to seek appointment 

on regular basis? 

Point No.(vi): In a given set of cases, in one case the 

appointment on compassionate ground has been 

offered against a Class-III post and in other case, the 

appointment has been offered to a Class-IV post, 

whether it amounts to discrimination? 

65. 
These points are interconnected and, therefore, 

the same are being settled together.

66. 
As has been discussed above, the idea behind 

providing employment assistance on compassionate ground 

is to tide over the immediate hardship which is faced by a 

family on account of the death of the bread earner. 

However, endless compassion cannot be shown to such a 

family. 
We may also place on record that right to claim 

appointment on compassionate ground cannot be used as a 

method to seek employment. It is just an exception and 

discretion of the competent Authority. The applicant cannot 

claim that he is entitled to appointment on compassionate 

ground as a matter of right. 

67. 
The Apex Court in I.G. (Karmik) & Ors. vs. Prahlad 

Mani Tripathi, 2007 AIR SCW 3305, has laid down the same 

principles. It is apt to reproduce paragraph 13 of the said 

decision hereunder: 

"13. Furthermore, Appellant accepted the said post without 

any demur whatsoever. He, therefore, upon obtaining 

appointment in a lower post could not have been permitted 

to turn round and contend that he was entitled for a higher 

post although not eligible therefor. A person cannot be 

appointed unless he fulfils the eligibility criteria. Physical 

fitness

Superintendent of Police could not have made any 

recommendation in violation of the rules. Nothing has been 

shown before us that even the petitioner came within the 

purview of any provisions containing grant of relaxation of 

such qualification. Whenever, a person invokes such a 

provision, it would be for him to show that the authority is 

vested with such a power." 

68. 
The Apex Court in State Bank of India & Anr. vs. 

Somvir Singh, 2007 AIR SCW 1571, has held that dependants 

of employees who died in harness do not have any special or 

additional claim to public services other than one conferred, 

if any, by the employer. It was also held that the claim for 

compassionate appointment has to be considered only in 

accordance with the scheme framed by the employer in this 

regard. It is apt to reproduce paragraphs 7 and 10 of the said 

decision hereunder: 

"7. Article 16(1) of the Constitution of India, 1950 

guarantees to all its citizens equality of opportunity in 

matters relating to employment or appointment to any 

office under the State. Article 16(2) protects citizens 

against discrimination in respect of any employment or 

office under the State on grounds only of religion, race, 

caste, sex, descent. It is so well settled and needs no 

restatement at our ends that appointment on

compassionate grounds is an exception carved out to 

the general rule that recruitment to public services is to 

be made in a transparent and accountable manner 

providing opportunity to all eligible persons to compete 

and participate in the selection process. Such 

appointments are required to be made on the basis of 

open invitation of applications and merit. Dependants 

of employees died in harness do not have any special 

or additional claim to public services other than the one 

conferred, if any, by the employer. 

………….. 
……………. 
………………… 

10. There is no dispute whatsoever that the appellant-

Bank is required to consider the request for 

compassionate appointment only in accordance with 

the scheme framed by it and no discretion as such left 

with any of the authorities to make compassionate 

appointment de hors the scheme. In our considered 

opinion the claim for compassionate appointment and 

the right, if any, is traceable only to the scheme, 

executive instructions, rules etc. framed by the 

employer in the matter of providing employment on 

compassionate grounds. There is no right of whatsoever 

nature to claim compassionate appointment on any 

ground other than the one, if any, conferred by the 

employer by way of scheme or instructions as the case 

may be."

The Apex Court in Umesh Kumar Nagpal vs. State 

of Haryana and others, (1994) 4 Supreme Court Cases 138, 

has held that if the dependant of the deceased employee 

finds it below his dignity to accept the post offered, he is free 

not to do so. It is further held that the post offered is not to 

cater to the status of such dependant, but to enable the 

family to tide over the financial calamity being faced by the 

family on the death of bread earner. It was also held that 

compassionate appointment, in posts above Class-III and 

Class-IV, is legally impermissible. 
It is apt to reproduce 

paragraphs 3 and 5 of the said decision hereunder: 

"3. Unmindful of this legal position, some governments 

and 
public 
authorities 
have 
been 
offering 

compassionate employment sometimes as a matter of 

course irrespective of the financial condition of the 

family of the deceased and sometimes even in posts 

above Classes III and IV. That is legally impermissible. 

…….. 
………… 
………… 
………. 
5. It is obvious from the above observations that the 

High court endorses the policy of the State government 

to make compassionate appointment in posts 

equivalent to the posts held by the deceased 

employees and above Classes III and IV. It is

unnecessary to reiterate that these observations are 

contrary to law. If the dependant of the deceased 

employee finds it below his dignity to accept the post 

offered, he is free not to do so. The post is not offered to 

cater to his status but to see the family through the 

economic calamity." 

70. 
The Apex Court in a case of compassionate 

appointment in Union of India and others vs. K.P. Tiwari, (2003) 

9 Supreme Court Cases 129, has held in paragraph 4 as 

under: 

"4. It is unnecessary in this case to examine either 
question of law or fact arising in the matter. Suffice 
to say that the respondent has been appointed 
now and has been in service for more than five 
years. We do not think, it would be appropriate to 
disturb that state of affairs by making any other 
order resulting in uprooting the respondent from 
his livelihood. " 

71. 
The Apex Court in Steel Authority of India vs. 

Madhusudan Das & Ors., 2009 AIR SCW 390, has held that 

provision for compassionate appointment has been carved 

out to provide minimum relief to the grief stricken family and 

that such appointment cannot be claimed as a matter of 

right. It is apt to reproduce paragraph 14 of the said decision 

hereunder:

"14. Appellant being a State within the meaning of 

Article 12 of the Constitution of India, while making 

recruitments, it is bound to follow the rules framed by it. 

Appointment of a dependant of a deceased employee 

on compassionate ground is a matter involving policy 

decision. It may be a part of the service rules. In this 

case it would be a part of the settlement having the 

force of law. A Memorandum of Settlement entered 

into by and between the Management and the 

employees having regard to the provisions contained in 

Section 12(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act is binding 

both on the employer and the employee. In the event, 

any party thereto commits a breach of any of the 

provisions thereof, ordinarily, an industrial dispute is to be 

raised. We would, however, assume that a writ petition 

therefor was maintainable. It is in that sense of the term, 

the learned Single Judge opined that the question as to 

whether there has been a breach of the Memorandum 

of Settlement on the part of the employer or not 

involves a disputed question of fact. The Division Bench 

of the High Court, however, proceeded on the premise 

that the employer was bound to provide appointment 

on compassionate appointment in all cases involving 

death of an employee. The Division Bench, in our 

opinion, was not correct in its view. This Court in a large 

number of decisions has held that the appointment on 

compassionate ground cannot be claimed as a matter

of right. It must be provided for in the rules. The criteria 

laid down therefor, viz., that the death of the sole bread 

earner of the family, must be established. It is meant to 

provide for a minimum relief. When such contentions 

are raised, the constitutional philosophy of equality 

behind making such a scheme be taken into 

consideration. Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of 

India mandate that all eligible candidates should be 

considered for appointment in the posts which have 

fallen vacant. Appointment on compassionate ground 

offered to a dependant of a deceased employee is an 

exception to the said rule. It is a concession, not a right. 

(See General Manager, State Bank of India & Ors. vs. 

Anju Jain, 2008 8 SCC 475)" 

72. 
The Apex Court in Director General of Posts and 

others vs. K. Chandrashekar Rao, (2013) 3 Supreme Court 

Cases 310, has laid down the same principle. It is apt to 

reproduce paragraphs 22 and 26 of the said decision 

hereunder: 

"22. From the above Scheme and Office Memorandum, 
it is clear that where on the one hand, the State had 
formulated a welfare scheme for compassionate 
appointments, there on the other, because of limitations 
of its financial resources it decided to take economic 
measures by reducing the extent of appointment by 
direct recruitment from the financial year 2001-2002. 
Both these matters falling in the domain of the

Government and being matters of policy, the Court is 
hardly called upon to comment upon either of them. 
These are the acts which fall in the domain of the State 
and do not call for any judicial interference. All that we 
propose to hold is that State has to abide by the 
Scheme it has floated for compassionate appointment. 
23. The 1998 Scheme floated by the Government 
should receive a liberal construction and application as 
it is stated to be a social welfare scheme and largely 
tilted in favour of the members of the family of the 
deceased employee. The purpose appears to be to 
provide them with recruitment on a regular basis rather 
than circumvent the same by adopting any other 
measure. That is the reason why the Government 
specifically states in its Scheme that efforts should be 
made to appoint the members of a distressed family to 
the post provided he/she satisfies the other parameters 
stated in the Scheme. 
…………. ………………. 
……………… 
………….. 
26. Despite the fact that the judgment of the Central 
Administrative Tribunal (for short "the Tribunal") has been 
upheld by the High Court, we are unable to contribute 
and sustain the view taken by the Tribunal that the 
Memorandum dated 16th May, 2001 frustrated the very 
object of the Scheme for Compassionate Appointment 
and on that ground alone, it was liable to be declared 
invalid. As already noticed, both the matters are policy 
matters of the State and for valid and proper reasons, 
without infringing the spirit of Article 14 and 16 of the 
Constitution. The State can frame its policy, where it is 
for economic reasons, least such decision would be 
open to judicial review to that extent. In the present 
case, there is some ambiguity created by issuance of 
office memorandums dated 16th May, 2001 and 14th 
June, 2006 and the enforcement of the former vide 
office memorandum dated 4th July, 2002 in relation to 
the implementation of Compassionate Appointment 
Scheme of 1998. Thus, it is not only desirable but 
necessary that the competent authority should issue 
comprehensive guidelines squarely covering the issue,

but they cannot tamper with the existing rights of the 
appointees." 

73. 
Clause-11 of the Policy, reproduced supra, 

mandates that when a person has accepted the offer of 

appointment on compassionate ground to a particular post, 

the request for change in post shall not be allowed. Similarly, 

Clause 2(b) also provides that if a daily wage employee or a 

work charge Beldar, on daily wages with 7 years continuous 

service, dies while in service, one of the dependants of such 

employee will be "appointed on daily wages only". Further 

Clause 2(f) was added later on vide Office Memorandum 

dated 4 th September, 2012 (reproduced above), which 

entitled the dependant of a contractual employee dying in 

harness to claim compassionate employment on "daily 

waged basis". 

74. 
The policy also postulates in Clause-4 that 

appointment on compassionate ground would only be made 

to "the lowest rung of Class-IV and Class-III posts". It was also 

provided that Class-III jobs would include all equivalent jobs 

including technical posts and teachers (class-III).

75. 
In view of the decisions referred to above, what 

flows is that the compassionate employment cannot be 

claimed as a matter of right, rather this provision has been 

carved out, against the general rule of equality, in order to 

ameliorate the hardship of a family. Moreover, the Policy 

itself explicitly provides that once a person accepted 

appointment on a particular post, he would not be allowed 

to seek change in post. 

76. 
The discretion to offer appointment on 

compassionate 
ground 
is 
vested 
with 
the 

respondents/Authorities and it is for the said Authorities to see 

whether a person is to be appointed against a Class-IV or 

Class-III post or on daily wage basis and that discretion 

cannot be questioned on the ground of discrimination, and 

that too, when a person has accepted the offer of 

appointment and joined without any demur and enjoyed the 

benefits. 
However, there is also no quarrel about the 

proposition that the Authority, who is vested with the 

discretion of making appointment on compassionate ground, 

is expected to exercise the discretion vested in it judiciously

and without being influenced, strictly in accordance with the 

provisions envisaged in the Policy, so that the avowed object 

sought to be achieved by the State, by framing such a policy, 

is achieved. 

77. 
The sum and substance of the above discussion is 

that the incumbents, who have been appointed on a 

particular post and have joined to the said post without 

expressing any reluctance or protest, such incumbents are 

precluded from claiming that they should either be 

appointed to a higher post or should have been given 

appointment on regular basis, instead of employment on 

contract basis, or have been discriminated viz. a viz. similarly 

paced persons. 

78. 
It was also brought to our notice that the 

Government of Himachal Pradesh had taken a decision in 

the year 2003 making provision for appointment on contract 

basis. This fact has been sought to be substantiated by a 

copy of letter, dated 12 th December, 2003, issued by the 

Chief Secretary, to the Government of Himachal Pradesh, to 

all the Secretaries, the Heads of Department, all the Divisional

Subject:-
Prescribing of Provision for appointment on 
contract basis. 

Sir, 

I am directed to say that it has been decided by the 
Government that the mode of recruitment by way of 
"contract recruitment" may also be prescribed in addition to 
other mode of recruitment in all the Recruitment and 
Promotion Rules. 
It is, therefore, requested that all existing Recruitment 
& Promotion Rules where the mode of direct recruitment of 
the post has been prescribed the same may be amended. 
As such provision of Col.No.10 of the Recruitment and 
Promotion Rules be prescribed in the following manner:-
"Col.No.10: By direct recruitment or on Contract 
basis."

Since the matter has already been approved by 
the Council of Ministers it is therefore, requested to amend 
the Recruitment & Promotion Rules accordingly without 
referring the matter to the Cabinet. 

Yours faithfully 

Sd/-
Under Secretary (Pers.) to the 
Govt. of Himachal Pradesh." 

79. 
Thus, it is clear from the perusal of the above letter 

that the Government has taken a policy decision to make 

appointments on contract basis to different cadres, including 

Class-III 
and 
Class-IV 
cadres 
against 
which 
the 

compassionate employment is provided. 
As discussed 

hereinabove, the compassionate employment is an 

exception and the person is given appointment without 

undergoing any selection process. 
The persons, who are 

directly appointed have to undergo the selection process as 

prescribed in the Recruitment Rules and only thereafter, are 

appointed, and that too, on contract basis. Thus, it would be 

inappropriate to entitle a person for appointment on regular 

basis who is given employment out of compassion and 

without undergoing the rigors of the selection process, and 

the another person, who has put himself to the test and got

selected, is offered appointment on contract basis. If that is 

permitted, then the persons appointed on compassionate 

ground would steal a march over and above the persons 

who are appointed through a selection process, which would 

be against the concept of service jurisprudence and also not 

in consonance with the mandate of Articles 14 and 16 of the 

Constitution of India. 

80. 
Thus also, the appointments on compassionate 

ground made on contract basis are legally correct and need 

no interference. 

81. 
Points No.(iv), (v) and (vi) are answered 

accordingly. 

Point No.(vii): Whether a person can claim 

compassionate appointment after a considerable 

delay? 

82. 
To answer the above point, we may first refer to 

the decisions of the Apex Court on the issue. The Apex Court, 

in case titled as Local Administration Department & Anr. vs. M. 

Selvanayagam @ Kumaravelu, 2011 AIR SCW 2198, in which 

case, the wife of the deceased-employee had not made

application immediately after the death of the employee 

and the son of the employee had applied after 7-1/2 years of 

the death of his father for appointment on compassionate 

ground, in such circumstances, held that once the family had 

been able to tide over the blow of the death of the bread 

winner for such a considerable long period, therefore, 

granting of belated appointment cannot be said to subserve 

the basic object and purpose of the scheme. The Apex Court 

has also observed that, no doubt, it is not possible to lay down 

a rigid time limit within which appointment on compassionate 

ground must be made, but emphasis must be that such an 

appointment must have some bearing on the object of the 

scheme. It is apt to reproduce paragraphs 7 to 9 of the said 

decision hereunder: 

"7. We think that the explanation given for the wife of 

the deceased not asking for employment is an after-

thought and completely unacceptable. A person 

suffering from anemia and low blood pressure will 

always greatly prefer the security and certainty of a 

regular job in the municipality which would be far more 

lucrative and far less taxing than doing menial work 

from house to house in an unorganized way. But, apart

i g h

o u r t o f H 

. P . 

97 

from this, there is a far more basic flaw in the view taken 

by the Division Bench in that it is completely divorced 

from the object and purpose of the scheme of 

compassionate appointments. It has been said a 

number of times earlier but it needs to be recalled here 

that under the scheme of compassionate appointment, 

in case of an employee dying in harness one of his 

eligible dependents is given a job with the sole 

objective to provide immediate succour to the family 

which may suddenly find itself in dire straits as a result of 

the death of the bread winner. An appointment made 

many years after the death of the employee or without 

due consideration of the financial resources available 

to his/her dependents and the financial deprivation 

caused to the dependents as a result of his death, 

simply because the claimant happened to be one of 

the dependents of the deceased employee would be 

directly in conflict with Articles 14 & 16 of the 

Constitution and hence, quite bad and illegal. In 

dealing with cases of compassionate appointment, it is 

imperative to keep this vital aspect in mind. 

8. Ideally, the appointment on compassionate basis 

should be made without any loss of time but having 

regard to the delays in the administrative process and 

several other relevant factors such as the number of 

already pending claims under the scheme and 

availability of vacancies etc. normally the appointment 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

98 

may come after several months or even after two to 

three years. It is not our intent, nor it is possible to lay 

down a rigid time limit within which appointment on 

compassionate grounds must be made but what needs 

to be emphasised is that such an appointment must 

have some bearing on the object of the scheme. 

9. In this case the respondent was only 11 years old at 

the time of the death of his father. The first application 

for his appointment was made on July 2, 1993, even 

while he was a minor. Another application was made 

on his behalf on attaining majority after 7 years and 6 

months of his father's death. In such a case, the 

appointment cannot be said to sub-serve the basic 

object and purpose of the scheme. It would rather 

appear that on attaining majority he staked his claim on 

the basis that his father was an employee of the 

Municipality and he had died while in service. In the 

facts of the case, the municipal authorities were clearly 

right in holding that with whatever difficulty, the family 

of Meenakshisundaram had been able to tide over the 

first impact of his death. That being the position, the 

case of the respondent did not come under the 

scheme of compassionate appointments. 

83. 
The Apex Court in Umesh Kumar Nagpal's case 

(supra) has held that keeping in view the aim and object of 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

99 

compassionate employment, the same cannot be granted 

after a lapse of a reasonable period, which must be specified 

in the rules. 
It was also held that employment on 

compassionate ground is not a vested right which can be 

exercised at any time. It is apt to reproduce paragraph 6 of 

the said decision as under: 

"6. For these very reasons, the compassionate 

employment cannot be granted after a lapse of a 

reasonable period which must be specified in the rules. 

The consideration for such employment is not a vested 

right which can be exercised at any time in future. The 

object being to enable the family to get over the 

financial crisis which it faces at the time of the death of 

the sole breadwinner, the compassionate employment 

cannot be claimed and offered whatever the lapse of 

time and after the crisis is over." 

84. 
Now, let us have a glace of the relevant provision 

of the Policy pertaining to the period within which application 

has to be made by the dependant after the death of an 

employee. Clause-8 of the Policy prescribes that application 

for grant of employment on compassionate ground be made 

to the Department concerned within three years of the death

H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

100 

of the government servant. Clause-8 of the Policy further 

postulates that in case the dependant of an employee is 

minor at the time of death of the employee, then, in that 

eventuality, the time limit for receiving application in the 

department concerned would be the attaining of age of 21 

years by the eldest son/un-married daughter. 

85. 
While reading Clause 8 of the Policy, two factors 

arise -a) where the employment on compassionate ground 

has been sought by the widow or the son/un-married 

daughter, who were major, at the time of death of the 

employee-concerned; and b) where the dependants were 

minor and widow of the deceased employee was not 

inclined to take employment on compassionate ground. 

86. 
In the first factor, the policy itself is amply clear 

that the claim for employment assistance must be made 

within three years of the death of the government employee. 

In the given circumstances, the appointment is to be sought 

within three years of the death of the government-employee 

and not thereafter. 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

101 

87. 
As far as the other factor is concerned, the above 

judgments are distinguishable since as per the mandate of 

the Policy, if a dependant is minor at the time of the death of 

the employee, he can apply for compassionate appointment 

till the attainment of 21 years by the eldest son/unmarried 

daughter. Thus, the case of such applicant cannot be 

dismissed on the ground that the dependant has applied 

after a considerable lapse of time. However, it is mandatory 

for the Authorities to consider such cases as per the provisions 

of the Scheme/Policy occupying the field at the relevant 

point of time when the application was made for claiming 

such employment. 

88. 
We can also not be oblivious to yet another 

situation where the claim for compassionate employment has 

been preferred within the time stipulated in the Policy, but the 

matter remained pending with the respondent-Authorities for 

a considerable long period, in such a situation, we are clear 

in our mind that once the delay is not attributable to the 

claimant, his application cannot be rejected on the ground 

of delay.

H

o u r t o f H 

. P . 

102 

89. 
Then, another question would arise as to which 

Policy would govern the appointment of such an applicant -

whether the policy which was in place at the time of the 

death of the employee or the policy when such an applicant 

preferred his claim. 

90. 
In that case, we have already held above that 

the Policy which was prevailing and was in force at the time 

when the application was presented by the applicant after 

attaining the age of majority would be relevant and 

applicable to such an applicant and the policy which was 

governing the field at the time of the death of the employee 

would be of no consequence. To dilate further, the said 

applicants would become eligible, as per the Policy and the 

Rules occupying the field, at the time of attaining the age of 

majority. 
Clause-8 of the Policy, in hand, provides 

mechanism, which is pari materia to Clause 3.2 of the 

Scheme discussed by the Apex Court in the case of Canara 

Bank v. M. Mahesh Kumar (supra) and the discussion made 

by the Apex Court in paragraph 15 of the said decision,

H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

103 

reproduced above, is the complete answer to the question in 

hand. 

91. 
The point stands answered accordingly. 

Point No.(viii): Whether requisite qualification or age 

can be relaxed? 

92. 
For making appointment against public posts, 

possessing minimum educational qualification is one of the 

essential conditions and that condition cannot be relaxed. 

However, Clause 7 of the Policy, dated 18 th January, 1990, 

deals with the "Extent of relaxation and power to make 

relaxation". Sub Clause (c) of Clause 7 deals with granting 

relaxation in educational qualification to those aspirants who 

are seeking appointment against a Class-IV post. 
It is 

provided in the said Sub Clause that in genuine cases, the 

condition of possessing minimum educational qualification 

can be relaxed with the prior approval of the Cabinet. A 

distinction has also been carved out in the cases where the 

widows of the deceased employee are seeking appointment 

against Class-IV posts and in those cases, the relaxation in 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

104 

educational qualification can be provided by the concerned 

Administrative Department. 

93. 
Similarly, Sub Clause (d) of Clause 7 provides that 

age relaxation would not be allowed. However, the genuine 

cases would be placed before the Cabinet for allowing age 

relaxation. 

94. 
Thus, it is amply clear from the reading of Clause 

7(c) and (d) of the Policy that relaxation in educational 

qualification or age can be granted, subject to approval by 

the Authority, as prescribed therein, only when the 

appointment is to be made against Class-IV post. 

95. 
The said Clause 7 of the Policy was amended vide 

office order, dated 25 th April, 1991, and it was provided that in 

those cases where appointment on compassionate ground 

was claimed against a Class-IV post, by seeking relaxation in 

respect of educational qualification or age, the concerned 

Administrative Department would have the power to grant 

such relaxation. In the matters, other than those, the power 

of relaxation was vested with the Chief Minister.

96. 
Fixing the eligibility criteria for a particular post falls 

under the domain of the legislature/executive and power to 

relax the same also lies with the said Authority. Our this view is 

fortified by the decision of the Apex Court in State of Gujarat 

& Ors. vs. Arvindkumar T. Tiwari and Anr., 2012 AIR SCW 5131. 

It is apt to reproduce paragraphs 8 and 9 of the said decision 

hereunder: 

"8. The courts and tribunal do not have the power to 

issue direction to make appointment by way of granting 

relaxation of eligibility or in contravention thereof. In 

State of M.P. & Anr. v. Dharam Bir, 1998 6 SCC 165, this 

Court while dealing with a similar issue rejected the plea 

of humanitarian grounds and held as under: 

"The courts as also the tribunal have no power to 
override the mandatory provisions of the Rules on 
sympathetic consideration that a person, though 
not 
possessing 
the 
essential 
educational 
qualifications, should be allowed to continue on 
the post merely on the basis of his experience. 
Such an order would amount to altering or 
amending the statutory provisions made by the 
Government under Article 309 of the Constitution." 

9. Fixing eligibility for a particular post or even for 

admission to a course falls within the exclusive domain 

of the legislature/executive and cannot be the subject 

matter of judicial review, unless found to be arbitrary, 

unreasonable or has been fixed without keeping in mind

106 

the nature of service, for which appointments are to be 

made, or has no rational nexus with the object(s) sought 

to be achieved by the statute. Such eligibility can be 

changed even for the purpose of promotion, unilaterally 

and the person seeking such promotion cannot raise 

the grievance that he should be governed only by the 

rules existing, when he joined service. In the matter of 

appointments, the authority concerned has unfettered 

powers so far as the procedural aspects are concerned, 

but it must meet the requirement of eligibility etc. The 

court should therefore, refrain from interfering, unless the 

appointments so made, or the rejection of a 

candidature is found to have been done at the cost of 

'fair play', 'good conscious' and 'equity'. (Vide: State of J 

& K v. Shiv Ram Sharma & Ors., 1999 AIR(SC) 2012 and 

Praveen Singh v. State of Punjab & Ors.,2000 8 SCC 

436)" 

97. 
A reference may also be made to the latest 

decision of the Apex Court in State of Gujarat and another vs. 

Chitraben, 2015 AIR SCW 4305, wherein also the applicant 

was seeking appointment on compassionate grounds but 

was not fulfilling the minimum educational qualification, as 

prescribed under the Rules governing the field. It was held by 

the Apex Court that the case of the applicant was rightly 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

107 

rejected for compassionate appointment since the applicant 

was not fulfilling the minimum requisite educational 

qualification as stipulated in the Rules governing the field. It is 

apt to reproduce paragraphs 8 and 9 of the said decision 

hereunder: 

"8. It is not a matter of dispute, that the Government of 

Gujarat, in its General Administration Department, 

issued a notification dated 16-3-2005 laying down 

eligibility conditions for appointment in different Class-IV 

posts. Insofar as the eligibility for direct recruitment is 

concerned, the same is stipulated in Rule 3 of the afore-

stated rules, which is being extracted hereunder: 

"3. To be eligible for appointment by direct selection 
to the post mentioned in Rule 2, a candidate shall:-

(i) not be less than 18 years and not more than 25 
years of age; 
(ii) have passed Secondary School Certificate 
Examination. 
(iii) Possesses skills relevant to the job as may be 
prescribed by Government from time to time." 
(Emphasis is ours) 

A perusal of Rule 3(ii) indicates, that to be eligible 

for appointment by direct recruitment against a Class-IV 

posts, the concerned candidate should possess the 

"secondary school certificate". It is therefore apparent, 

that eligibility for appointment on compassionate 

grounds, under resolution dated 10-3-2000, after 16-3-

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

108 

2005 (when the aforesaid notification in respect of 

recruitment to class IV posts was issued), requires to 

possess the qualification stipulated therein, i.e., 

"secondary school certificate" qualification. 

9. It is not a matter of dispute, that the respondent has 

possessed only the qualification of IV standard, and 

does not possess the qualification of "secondary school 

certificate" examination, as has been postulated in Rule 

3(ii) of the notification dated 16-3-2005. It is therefore 

imperative for us to conclude, that the respondent was 

not qualified for appointment against a class-IV posts, 

when her husband died in harness on 13-6-2006. When 

the respondent applied for appointment on 

compassionate grounds on 17-7-2006, it was necessary 

for her, to fulfil the qualification stipulated in the 

notification dated 16-3-2005. Since, admittedly the 

respondent did not fulfil the aforesaid qualification, she 

was 
not 
eligible 
to claim 
appointment 
on 

compassionate grounds, under the resolution dated 10-

3-2000." 

98. 
Thus, it is clear from the perusal of the above 

decision that no relaxation can be granted in educational 

qualification. However, the said decision is distinguishable 

since the legislature, while making the Policy in hand, in its 

wisdom, has provided that relaxation in educational 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

109 

qualification and age can be granted in respect of cases 

where appointment is sought against a Class-IV post, as has 

been discussed supra. Thus, it cannot be a ground to refuse 

compassionate appointment against a Class-IV post and the 

point stands answered accordingly. 

Point No.(ix): In case one or more dependants of a 
deceased-employee is/are in service, though living 
separately, whether that can be made a ground to 
deny compassionate appointment to the other 
dependant of the deceased-employee? 

99. 
In order to answer this point, we may have a 

glance of the Policy, Clause 5(c) whereof provides that in all 

cases where one or more members of the family of the 

deceased-employee were already in Government service or 

employment of Autonomous bodies/Boards/Corporations 

etc., of the State/Central Government, employment 

assistance would not "under any circumstances" be provided 

to the second or third member of the family. However, in 

case where the widow of the deceased Government servant 

made a representation that her employed sons/daughters 

were not supporting her, in that case request of the widow

H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

110 

could be considered and the final decision was to be taken 

by the Council of Ministers. 

101. 
Viewed thus, it is manifestly clear that in case any 

member of the deceased-employee is in gainful employment 

i.e. either in the government service or serving in autonomous 

bodies/Boards/ Corporations etc., of the State/Central 

Government, no employment assistance on compassionate 

ground, under any circumstance, shall be provided to 

second or third member of that family. However, only the 

claim for such employment assistance can be considered 

qua the widow of the deceased-employee, as discussed 

hereinabove. 

101. 
In regard to gainful employment, we may 

refer to the decision of the Apex Court in Govind Prakash 

Verma's case (supra), wherein, the elder brother of the 

applicant was engaged in agricultural work and was also 

doing the work of a casual painter. The Apex Court held that 

in such circumstances, the elder brother of the applicant 

cannot be said to be in gainful employment. It is apt to 

::: Downloaded on -20/03/2022 12:51:02 :::CIS 


H 
i g h 

C 
o u r t o f H 

. P . 

111 

reproduce the relevant portion of paragraph 6, of the said 

decision hereunder: 

"………………..So far as the question of gainful 

employment of the elder brother is concerned, we find 

that it had been given out that he has been engaged 

in cultivation. We hardly find that it could be considered 

as gainful employment if the family owns a piece of 

land and one of the members of the family cultivates 

the field. This statement is said to have been 

contradicted when it is said that the elder brother had 

stated that he works as a painter. This would not 

necessarily be a contradiction much less leading to the 

inference drawn that he was gainfully employed 

somewhere as a painter. He might be working in his field 

and might casually be getting work as painter also. 

Nothing has been indicated in the enquiry report as to 

where he was employed as a regular painter. The other 

aspects, on which the officer was required to make 

enquiries, have been conveniently omitted and not a 

whisper is found in the report submitted by the officer. In 

the above circumstances, in our view, the orders passed 

by the High Court are not sustainable. The respondents 

have wrongly refused compassionate appointment to 

the appellant. The inference of gainful employment of 

the elder brother could not be acted upon. The terminal

benefits received by the widow and the family pension 

could not be taken into account." 

102. 
Adverting to the Policy in hand, there is no 

provision in the policy according to which any other 

dependant, except widow, can make a claim for 

compassionate appointment, in case one of the dependants 

of the deceased-employee is in Government or Semi 

Government service, as discussed above. However, there 

may be probability that at the time of death of the employee 

concerned, the widow may have crossed the maximum age 

limit fixed by the Government for seeking employment or the 

widow is not possessing the minimum qualification or for any 

other reason, the widow is not intending to seek employment 

and makes a representation, carving out sufficient reasons, 

for grant of employment to the other member of the family, 

the Authority concerned, in order to achieve the mandate of 

the Policy being a social legislation, may consider such cases 

sympathetically, after proper inquiry, and, of course, after 

adverting to the provisions as contained in the Policy and also 

keeping in view the dictum of the Apex Court, supra.

103. 
Having said so, the point is answered accordingly. 

104. 
We also deem it proper to place on record here 

that the Central Government as well as the State 

Governments have made their Rules/Regulations/Schemes 

for providing employment assistance on compassionate 

ground 
and 
even 
the 
Semi 
Government 

Departments/Boards/Corporations etc. have also adopted 

those Schemes or have made their own Schemes. Each case 

has to be considered as per the Policy of an Organization, 

applicable at the relevant point of time. 

105. 
Cases in hand are to be dealt with as per the 

Scheme which is holding the field as on today and any 

judgment, which is outcome of a Policy not pari materia with 

the above Policy of the State, cannot be made a ground for 

granting or declining the relief. Thus, the judgments based on 

the Schemes, which are not applicable to the State, are 

distinguishable. 

106. 
It is apt to record herein that the Apex Court in 

Canara Bank vs. M. Mahesh Kumar (supra) has discussed all 

the judgments, read with the Policy/Scheme governing the

field, while arriving at the conclusions. In the instant case, the 

Policy contains Clauses stipulating the terms and conditions 

for making appointment on compassionate ground. 

Therefore, the cases, in hand, are to be tested as per the 

mandate of the judgment in Canara Bank vs. M. Mahesh 

Kumar (supra), read with the Policy/Scheme, referred to 

above. 

107. 
Now, let us examine the instant cases on the basis 

of the principles, as discussed hereinabove. 

CWPs No.1638 of 2011, 4475 of 2011, 8325, 9300, 10111 of 2012, 695,

3763, 3774 and 3822 of 2015. 

108. 
In all these writ petitions, the petitioners have laid a 

challenge to the action of the respondents, whereby the claims of 

the writ petitioners for appointment on compassionate ground has 

been rejected on the ground that the family(ies) of the deceased-

employee(s) do not fall within the indegency criteria laid down by 

the Finance Department of the Government and that the income 

of the family exceeds more than the limit prescribed in the Policy. 

109. 
Facts of CWP No.1638 of 2011 are being enumerated 

taking the same as lead case in this group. Father of the

petitioner, who was working as Chief Pharmacist with the 

respondent-Department, died on 9.5.2008, while in service. The 

petitioner being 10+2 and having one year computer diploma 

applied for the post of Clerk, and the respondents duly 

recommended his case. However, vide letter dated 21.7.2010 

(Annexure P-2), the petitioner was informed that his case was 

considered and rejected as the income of the family of the 

petitioner exceeds more than Rs.1,00,000. Thus, the writ petition for 

quashing Annexure P-2. The respondents filed the reply to the writ 

petition stating therein that the respondents have rightly rejected 

the claim of the petitioner, as the income of the family of 

petitioner, as per the certificate issued in this regard, was more 

than the cap fixed by the Government. Therefore, it was pleaded 

that the case of the petitioner did not fall within the scope of the 

policy. 

110. 
During the course of hearing, the learned counsel for 

the petitioners argued that the respondents have wrongly taken 

into account the amount of family pension and other retiral 

benefits received by the family of the deceased-employee or the 

employee who sought retirement on medical grounds. The said 

action of the respondents is against the law laid down by the Apex 

Court on the issue and therefore, prayed that the impugned

orders, whereby the applications of the petitioners have been 

rejected, be quashed. 

111. 
On the other hand, the learned Advocate General 

submitted that the appointment on compassionate ground 

cannot be claimed as a matter of right and the Policy empowers 

the respondents to examine the indigent circumstances of the 

family of the deceased-employee, by taking into account the 

amount received as family pension and other retiral benefits, as 

prescribed in the Policy. 
It was further submitted that the 

respondents have amended the Policy, dated 18 th January, 1990, 

and have laid down a definite criteria, including maximum income 

ceiling, for assessing the eligibility of a family for providing 

employment assistance on compassionate ground. Thus, it was 

submitted that the respondents were well within their right to reject 

the claims projected by the petitioners on the ground that the 

family of the deceased-employee exceeded the limit prescribed in 

the Policy. 

112. 
In view of our findings on point No.(i) recorded 

hereinabove, the arguments advanced by the learned Advocate 

General are devoid of any force and the same are repelled 

accordingly. The impugned orders, in these cases, are quashed 

and the respondents are directed to do the needful and pass

of the petitioner was rejected on the ground of family income and 

that the father of the petitioner had crossed the age of 55 years at 

the time of retirement. 

116. 
In view of our findings on point No.(i), coupled with 

findings on other points, as discussed hereinabove, the impugned

constraining the petitioner to file writ petition, which was disposed 

of on 27.11.2013. However, vide order dated 4.2.2014 (P-4), the 

respondents rejected the case of the petitioner on income criteria 

and on delay also.

reconsider the case of the petitioner in terms of our findings 

recorded on point Nos.(i) to (ix) and also after referring to the 

Policy.

of 2012, 1204, 1240 and 6505 of 2013: 

119. 
These cases are clubbed together for the reason that 

the facts and circumstances of the cases are similar and the policy 

applicable is also the same. 

120. 
CWP No.9094 of 2013 is taken as lead case in this 

group of cases and the facts of the said case are thus. Father 
of 

the petitioner, who was serving as Patwari right from the year 1973 

with the respondent-Department, died in harness on 26 th June, 

2003. The petitioner applied for appointment on compassionate 

ground in the month of December, 2003 and documents were 

required by the respondents from the petitioner, which were 

submitted by him in September, 2004. In the years 2005 and 2008, 

the respondents again raised queries and demanded more 

documents from the petitioner, which, as per the petitioner, were 

supplied by him to the respondents. In May 2009, the petitioner 

again received a letter from the respondents wherein also the 

petitioner was required to complete certain formalities, which were 

completed by the petitioner.

121. 
In May 2011, the petitioner received a letter, dated 3 rd 

May, 2011, (Annexure P-8), whereby it was conveyed that the 

respondents were considering the cases of only those employees 

in which either the widow of the deceased employee was seeking 

employment or the applicant was an orphan. Thus, the petitioner 

has filed the writ petition for quashing Annexure P-8. 

122. 
Respondents have filed the reply, in which it has been 

pleaded that the Policy, dated 18 th January, 1990, was amended 

by the Government, vide amendment dated 25 th September, 

2010, to the following effect: 

"……………Now, it has been decided by the Government 

that apart from the widow applicants the cases of 

applicants whose both parents are not alive shall be given 

priority for considering the matter of providing employment 

on compassionate grounds subject to fulfillment of other 

relevant criteria prescribed by the Govt. from time to time. 

You are requested to please bring these instructions to the 

notice of all concerned for strict adherence." 

Thus, it was pleaded that the case of the petitioner, being the son 

of the deceased employee, did not fall within scope of the Policy 

and was rightly rejected by the respondents. 

123. 
The writ petitions are allowed and the orders 

impugned are set aside in view of our findings recorded on points

No.(ii) and (iii), supra. The respondents are directed to consider the 

cases of the petitioners afresh in view of our findings on points 

No.(i) to (ix) and also after adverting to the Policy. 

CWP Nos.8342 of 2012, 9115 of 2013, 3568, 3893, 7397, 8895, 9378 of 
2014, 2397, 3044, 3546, 3585 and 3652 of 2015: 

124. 
In these writ petitions, the petitioners have applied to 

the respondents for their appointment on compassionate ground, 

but, as pleaded, the respondents have not taken any decision so 

far. 

125. 
Facts of CWP No.8342 of 2012, titled Damodar Ram vs. 

State of H.P. and others, are being referred to in this group of 

cases. Father of the petitioner, who was serving as Beldar, with the 

respondents, died in harness on 18 th March, 2008, whereafter, the 

petitioner approached the respondents for providing appointment 

on compassionate grounds and as admitted by the respondents in 

the reply, the case of the petitioner is still pending consideration 

with the respondents. 

126. 
Thus, in all these cases, the respondents are directed 

to consider the cases of the petitioners as per our findings on points 

No.(i) to (ix) and the Policy in question, expeditiously.

1512 of 2014: 

127. 
In this group of cases, the petitioners, after the death 

of their bread winner, applied for appointment on compassionate 

ground and the petitioners were appointed on contract basis 

against different posts, i.e. Clerk, Beldar, Chowkidar etc. Now, by 

the medium of these petitions, the petitioners are seeking direction 

to the respondents-Authorities to give appointment to the 

petitioners on regular basis against the post they have already 

joined. 

128. 
Taking CWP No.1106 of 2012 as lead case in this group, 

the facts of this case are being referred to. 
Father of the 

petitioner, who was working as a teacher with the respondents, 

died in harness on 31 st May, 1995. On attaining the age of majority 

in the year 2005, the petitioner applied for being appointed on 

compassionate ground and came to be appointed as Clerk on 

10 th October, 2007, on contract basis. Thus, the petitioner has filed 

the writ petition praying for a direction to the respondents to give 

him appointment on regular basis, instead of contract basis, from 

the date he joined as such on contract basis, with all 

consequential benefits incidental thereof.

129. 
Respondents have filed the reply and contested the 

writ petition on the ground that the petitioner was appointed as 

Clerk on contract basis and all terms and conditions, as postulated 

in the appointment letter, were accepted by the petitioner without 

any protest and acted upon the offer of appointment and joined 

his duties as Clerk on contract basis. Therefore, the petitioner is 

precluded from seeking regular appointment. 

130. 
These writ petitions are dismissed in view the findings 

recorded on points No.(iv), (v) and (vi) supra. 

CWP Nos.5115, 8650, 8652, 9954, 10336, 10511, 10512, 10524, 10756 
of 2012, 11, 8968 of 2013, 797, 803, 3117 and 3143 of 2014: 

131. 
In this group of cases, the petitioners applied for 

appointment on compassionate ground and they were offered 

appointment on contract basis against Class-IV posts on daily 

wage basis. Now, by the medium of these petitions, the petitioners 

are seeking direction to the respondents-Authorities to give 

appointment to the petitioners either against Class-III posts or to a 

different post than the one offered to them and they joined. 

132. 
CWP No.5115 of 2012 is taken up as lead case and the 

facts of the said case are thus. Father of the petitioner, who was 

serving as Plumber, in the respondent-Department, died in harness 

on 1 st September, 2007. Thereafter, the petitioner applied for being

appointed on compassionate ground as per the Policy of the State 

Government, which culminated into offer of appointment to the 

petitioner as daily wage Beldar and he joined as such. Thus, the 

petitioner has filed the instant writ petition for direction to the 

respondents to appoint him as Plumber instead of daily-wage 

Beldar. It is the case of the petitioner that the respondents has 

appointed the similarly situated persons against Class-III posts, but 

the petitioner has been discriminated. 

133. 
The respondents have filed the reply wherein it has 

been pleaded that the petitioner, at the first instance, after the 

death of his father, applied for appointment on compassionate 

ground for the post of Beldar and was accordingly appointed as 

such on 21 st March, 2008. The petitioner joined as such without any 

protest. It was also pleaded that the instances pointed out by the 

petitioner viz. a viz. discrimination were entirely different since the 

claimants in such cases were eligible for the post against which 

they were appointed. It was also pleaded that since the petitioner 

initially applied for the post of Beldar and did not possess minimum 

educational qualification for being appointed as Plumber, his case 

was rightly rejected for being appointed as Plumber. 

134. 
These writ petitions are dismissed in view the findings 

recorded by us on points No.(iv), (v) and (vi) supra.

135. 
The Claim of the petitioners, in this group of cases, has 

been rejected or has been sought to be resisted by filing replies by 

the respondents, on the ground that the petitioners are not entitled 

for compassionate appointment since one of the member of the 

family of the deceased employee was in government/semi 

government service. 

136. 
Facts, as pleaded in CWP No.6547 of 2010, taken as 

lead case for this group, are that the father of the petitioner, who 

was working as Peon with the respondent department, had 

expired on 4 th January, 1997, while in service. The petitioner, on 

attaining the age of majority, applied for being appointed on 

compassionate ground, but the case of the petitioner was 

rejected by the respondents on 25 th April, 2008, on the ground that 

the elder brother of the petitioner was in service. 

137. 
The petitioner has pleaded that his elder brother was 

living separately, which fact has been sought to be substantiated 

by the petitioner from the copy of the Ration Card (Annexure P-8) 

and a copy of the certificate, dated 25.9.2006 (Annexure P-9) 

issued by the Pradhan of the Gram Panchayat concerned. 

138. 
The respondents filed the reply in which it has been 

pleaded that the case of the petitioner was rightly rejected since

the Policy occupying the field provided that in case one or more 

members of the family of the deceased employee was in 

Government service or in employment of Autonomous bodies 

Boards/Corporations etc., of the State or Central Government, 

employment assistance, under any circumstances, would not be 

provided to the second or third member of the family.

In these cases, the petitioners sought appointment on 

compassionate ground against Class-IV posts on the death of their 

beard-earner, who died while in service. It is pleaded by the 

respondents that the case of the petitioner could not be

educational qualification for being appointed against a Class IV 

post.

CWP Nos.3821 of 2014 and 75 of 2015: 

142. 
In CWP No.3821 of 2014, it is averred that the mother of 

the petitioner, who was working as daily wage Beldar, had died in 

harness on 18 th June, 2007, after putting in 11 years of service, 

whereafter the petitioner applied for compassionate appointment 

on 26 th April, 2010. It was also pleaded that the respondents have 

returned the case of the petitioner to respondent No.4, vide letter 

dated 7 th February, 2014, (Annexure P-1), on the ground that as per 

the employment policy, case be submitted to the department 

within three years from the date of death and since the petitioner's 

case was received after the lapse of the said period, therefore, the 

claim of the petitioner was returned back for re-examination. Thus, 

feeling aggrieved, the petitioner has filed the writ petition. 

143. 
The respondents have filed the reply in which it has 

been admitted that the case of the petitioner was sent to 

respondent No.4 for reexamination, as pleaded by the petitioner, 

and after re-examination, it was found that the case of the 

petitioner was not time barred and, therefore, was sent to the 

Government for approval. As and when the approval of the

144. 
Thus, in view of the reply filed by the respondents, 

nothing survives in the writ petition, except to observe that a final 

decision be taken in the matter expeditiously, preferably within 

three months from today.

As averred, the father of the petitioner, who was 

working as Peon, died in harness on 18 th March, 2009. The

However, the respondents rejected the 

application of the petitioner in the month of September, 2014 vide 

Annexure P-5 on the ground that the case of the petitioner did not 

fall under para 8 of the Policy as the request of the petitioner was 

received for the first time in the office on 14 th December, 2012 after 

attaining the age of 21 years by the petitioner. 

146.

CWP No.2236 of 2015: 

149. 
In this writ petition, father of the petitioner, who was 

working as Part Time Water Carrier since 7 th August, 1997, died in 

April 2007. The petitioner has filed the instant petition for direction 

to the respondents to grant him appointment on compassionate 

ground. It is pleaded that at the time of the death of his father, 

the petitioner was minor. 

150. 
It appears that the petitioner has not applied on the 

prescribed proforma to the respondents for grant of 

compassionate appointment and has directly approached this 

Court for grant of appointment on compassionate grounds. 

CWP No.3112 of 2014:

The petitioner has filed this writ petition with the prayer 

that the respondents be directed to appoint the petitioner in

respondents to release pension and ex-gratia benefits to the 

petitioner. 

152. 
Respondent No.1 in its reply pleaded that as per the 

policy of the State Government, the petitioner has not applied to 

the concerned department for seeking employment on 

compassionate ground. So far as release of payment of ex-gratia, 

gratuity and pension is concerned, the same stand already 

released in favour of the petitioner vide Annexure R-1, Annexure R-

II and Annexure R-III, respectively. 

153. 
In the facts of these cases, (CWP No.2236 of 2015 and 

3112 of 2014), the petitioners in these cases are at liberty to apply 

to the respondents for appointment on compassionate grounds 

and the respondents are directed to consider the said request of

Facts: 

155. 
On 21.11.2009, when late Shri Duni Chand was going 

to his residence after performing his duties, he was found 

murdered. The said Duni Chand was initially engaged on daily 

wage basis in the year 1994 and was regularized w.e.f. 19.1.2007. 

His son and daughters were minor at the time of death of the 

employee and widow is stated to be not in a fit state of mind, 

which fact is supported by the medical certificate Annexure P-4. 

Therefore, the present petition has been filed through their 

guardian, petitioner No.6, younger brother of deceased 

employee. 

156. 
In such circumstances the petitioners submitted a 

representation to respondent No.1 for providing employment to 

their guardian i.e. petitioner No.6 on compassionate ground. They 

have also prayed in the representation that case of the petitioners 

be kept pending till such time the son of the deceased attains 

majority. 
Thus, the petitioners prayed directions to the 

respondents to grant employment to petitioner No.6 or in the 

alternative keep pending the claim of the petitioners till the son of 

the deceased attains majority. 

157. 
In the reply filed by the respondents, it has been stated 

that, as per the Policy, appointment on compassionate ground

cannot be granted to petitioner No.6, who is the brother of the 

deceased-employee. It has also been pleaded that petitioner 

No.1 submitted an application on 19 th January, 2010 in the office of 

Assistant Engineer, HPPWD, Sub Division, Suni in which she stated 

that she was not willing to get employment and requested that 

employment assistance be provided to her son, who was minor at 

that time. 

158. 
In such circumstances, the respondents are directed 

to examine the case of the petitioner in accordance with the 

Policy and the observations made by this Court, supra, and pass 

appropriate orders within six weeks from today. 

CWP No.7074 of 2014

Father of the petitioner, who was CID Inspector, died 

in the year 1993, while in service. The petitioner, being Matriculate, 

applied for appointment as Clerk in Police Department and the 

Department informed the petitioner vide letters dated 23.5.1994 

and 19.8.1994 that he could not be accommodated as other 

persons were in the waiting list. 

160. 
As pleaded, in January, 1997, the petitioner was 

arrested in a criminal case, however, stood acquitted by the 

Sessions Court as also by the High Court on 29 th July, 2010. During 

the pendency of such proceedings, the petitioner represented for

compassionate appointment, but his requests were rejected on 

the ground that a criminal case was pending against him. 

161. 
After the dismissal of the criminal appeal by the High 

Court in the year 2010, in January, 2011, the petitioner again 

approached the respondent Department, but his case was 

rejected by the respondent-Department on 17 th February, 2012 

being time barred. When the petitioner again requested for re-

examination of his case, similar view was conveyed to the 

petitioner vide letter dated 2 nd July, 2012. 

162. 
Thus, the petitioner has prayed for quashing of 

Annexure P-5 and P-6, whereby case of the petitioner was rejected 

being time barred. 

163. 
In the facts of the case, the impugned orders are 

quashed and the respondents are directed to consider the case of 

the petitioner afresh, after adverting to findings recorded on point 

Nos.(i) to (ix) and also to the provisions of the Policy.

same is allowed and the writ petition is ordered to be restored to 

its original number. The application is disposed of.

CWP No.1138 of 2014 

165. 
As pleaded, grandfather of the petitioner died in 

harness on 6.8.2008. It is further pleaded that the petitioner being 

the adopted son of deceased employee, applied for 

compassionate appointment, was rejected by the respondents on 

the ground that there is no provision for employment to a grandson 

of the deceased employee. Hence, the writ petition. 

166. 
The respondents have filed the reply, in which they 

have stated that since the petitioner is the grandson of the 

deceased-employee, therefore, his case is not covered under the 

Policy, for grant of employment on compassionate ground. 

167. 
In view of our findings on points No.(i) to (ix), there is no 

merit in the writ petition and the same is dismissed. 

CWP No.8212 of 2014 

168. 
Father of the petitioner, who was working as work 

charge Beldar, died in the year 1999. In 2001, the petitioner 

applied for employment as Clerk being unmarried daughter of the 

deceased-employee. On 6.1.2006, the petitioner was offered 

appointment as daily waged Beldar, when she was maid, which 

offer was declined by the petitioner, as has come up in the reply of 

the respondent, on the ground that since she was eligible for 

appointment as Clerk, therefore, her case be considered for

appointment against the post of Clerk. This is suggestive of the fact 

that the petitioner was not in indigent circumstances or was not 

facing any difficulty or was not in distress. In the interregnum, she 

got married. As per the Policy of the respondents, compassionate 

employment can be granted to an unmarried daughter of the 

deceased. 
Therefore, her case was rightly rejected by the 

respondents. 

169. 
Having said so, there is no merit in the writ petition and 

the same is dismissed. 

CWP No.142 of 2013 

170. 
As averred, the facts of the case are that the father of 

the petitioner, who was working as Field Assistant, died in harness 

on 16.6.2004. In the year 2003, the father of the petitioner had 

applied for retirement on medical grounds, which request 

remained pending with the department till his death. After the 

death of the employee, the petitioner filed application for 

compassionate appointment, which was rejected by the 

department on the ground that since the deceased-employee 

had crossed the age as prescribed under Rule 38 of the CCS 

(Pension) Rules, 1972, therefore, the petitioner cannot claim 

appointment on compassionate ground.

171. 
Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner had approached this 

Court by way of writ petition and in the reply to the said writ 

petition, the respondents admitted that the father of the petitioner 

was in service till his death. Therefore, the writ petition was 

disposed of with a direction to the respondents to reconsider the 

matter of the petitioner. However, the respondents again rejected 

the claim of the petitioner on the same ground. 

172. 
Thus, the petitioner, by way of the instant petition, has 

sought writ of certiorari for quashing Annexure P-8, whereby the 

claim of the petitioner came to be rejected. The petitioner has 

also sought writ of mandamus commanding the respondents to 

appoint him on compassionate ground. 

173. 
Respondents have resisted the writ petition by filing the 

reply. 

174. 
Precisely, the ground pressed into service by the 

respondents while rejecting the claim of the petitioner is that the 

deceased had crossed the requisite age as per the Policy 

occupying the field. 

175. 
Clause 2(d) of the policy stipulates that employment 

assistance shall be provided to those government servants (Class-III 

and Class-IV only), who retire on medical grounds, provided the

employees so retiring have not crossed the age of 53 years in the 

case of Class-III and 55 years in the case of Class-IV. 

176. 
As 
per 
the 
discussion 
made 
hereinabove, 

appointment can be made only as per the Rules/Scheme/Policy 

occupying the field and no appointment can be made de hors 

the Scheme/Policy. 
It is clear from the reply filed by the 

respondents that the age of the father of the petitioner was "53 

years 10 months and 14 days on the date of his pre-mature 

retirement on 8.4.2003", which is not in dispute. 

177. 
Viewed thus, the respondents have rightly passed the 

rejection order. Accordingly, there is no merit in the writ petition 

and the same is dismissed. 

CWP No.10024 of 2012

Father of the petitioner was working as Shastri teacher 

and died in harness on 9.9.1987. The petitioner who was having 

degree of Ayurvedaacharya applied for being appointed against 

the post of Auruvedic Chikitsa Adhikari on compassionate ground. 

However, the petitioner was offered appointment against the post 

of Clerk and he joined against the said post on 19.11.1990. 

Thereafter, on 23.8.1997 the petitioner was appointed as Ayurvedic 

Chikitsa Adhikari. The petitioner represented to the respondents for 

giving him employment as Chikitsa Adhikari from the date of his

passing the degree or from 9.9.1987 when his father died or from 

19.11.1990 when he joined as Clerk, which representation of the 

petitioner was rejected by the respondents vide Annexure P-18. 

Therefore, by way of the present writ petition the petitioner has 

prayed that he be held entitled to be appointed as Ayurveda 

Chikitsa Adhikari from 9/1987 when his father died and that the 

pay of the petitioner be fixed as Ayurvedic Chikitsa Adhikari from 

9/1987 to 30.8.1997 when he actually joined as such. 

179. 
The petition, on the face of it, is not maintainable. The 

petitioner was offered appointment on compassionate ground 

against the post of Clerk in the year 1990 and he joined against the 

said post without any protest. Now, he cannot claim appointment 

as Ayurvedic Chikitsa Adhikari. Moreover, allowing the claim of 

the petitioner would affect the seniority of the persons who had 

already joined as 
Ayurvedic Chikitsa Adhikari prior to his 

appointment in the said cadre. 
The writ petition is also not 

maintainable in view of the findings recorded by us on points 

No.(iv), (v) and (vi), supra. 

180. 
Accordingly, it is held that there is no merit in the writ 

petition and the same is dismissed.

Father of the petitioner, who was serving as Head 

Constable, died on 25.6.2005, while in service. The petitioner 

applied for the post of Clerk on compassionate ground. It is further 

pleaded that respondent No.2 issued an advertisement for 

recruitment of Constables for which the petitioner applied. The 

petitioner appeared in the efficiency test, written examination and 

personality test and qualified the same and figured at Serial No.5 

of the waiting list. Respondents did not consider his name for 

appointment as Constable against 5% quota prescribed in the 

Policy for compassionate employment. Accordingly, the petitioner 

filed a writ petition, which was disposed of by providing that in 

case the petitioner files fresh representation expressing willingness 

to serve anywhere in the State and vacancy being available 

against 5% quota, the name of the petitioner shall be considered 

for such appointment. 
Thereafter, the petitioner filed 

representation on 24.7.2011 (P-11), which was rejected on 

20.3.2012 (P-12) on the ground that the department was 

considering the cases of widows, secondly on the ground of 

income criteria and thirdly the name of the petitioner figures at 

Serial No.46 of the priority list maintained for offering appointment 

on compassionate ground against the post of Clerk and he cannot 

be considered in preference to the persons above him.

and interview held, in accordance with the policy of the State 

Government which provides that 5% posts, in direct recruitment, 

shall be reserved for those applicants who are seeking 

employment on compassionate ground. 

183. 
In the reply filed by the respondents, they have 

pleaded that there was no post reserved for the wards of the 

deceased police personnel under 5% quota in the 6 th Indian 

Reserve Battalion or the other battalion. It is further pleaded in the 

reply that the family of the deceased-employee was not found to 

be in indigent circumstances which required immediate 

employment assistance on compassionate ground. It was also 

pleaded that the petitioner had initially applied for being 

appointed on compassionate ground against the post of Clerk, 

therefore, he cannot claim that his case be also considered for 

appointment against the post of Constable. 

184. 
In view of the reply filed by the respondents, it is clear 

that there was no post reserved under 5% quota for the 

dependant of the deceased-employee, who died in harness, 

against which the petitioner is seeking appointment. Therefore, the

The 
petitioner, 
being 
widow, 
applied 
for 

compassionate appointment on the death of her husband, who 

was in service with the respondent Corporation as driver, when he 

died on 22.1.2006 in an accident, while performing duty. Vide 

letter dated 9.9.2009, it was intimated to the petitioner that her 

case cannot be considered in view of the decision of Board of 

Directors taken on 26.6.2008. It is averred that copy of the FIR 

(Annexure P-3) shows that there was no eye witness of the 

accident and the police had also not made any investigation with 

respect to the cause of the accident. Thus, cause of accident 

cannot be attributed to the husband of the petitioner and the 

action of the respondents in declining employment to the 

petitioner on this ground is wrong. Hence, the writ petition. 

186. 
In the reply filed by the respondents it has been 

pleaded that since the accident in question had taken place due 

to the negligence on the part of the deceased-employee, 

therefore, as per the decision of the Board of Directors of the 

respondent-Corporation, the claim of the petitioner was rightly

rejected. The writ petition has also been resisted on other grounds, 

such as, the appointment on compassionate ground cannot be 

claimed as a matter of right and the appointment is to be given 

only in those cases where the family of the deceased was living in 

indigent circumstances. 

187. 
There is nothing on the record, from a perusal of which 

it could be inferred that the respondents have ever inquired into 

the cause of accident and on the basis of such inquiry, have 

concluded that the accident, in question, had taken place due to 

the negligence on the part of the husband of the petitioner. 

188. 
Thus, the writ petition is allowed, the impugned order is 

set aside and the respondents are directed to reconsider the case 

of the petitioner afresh in light of the Policy and the findings

averred that the husband of the petitioner was entitled for daily 

wage status after completion of 10 years service and thereafter, 

for work charge status. Therefore, it has been prayed that: 

a) 
The petitioner be granted appointment on 

compassionate ground; 

b) 
Respondents be directed to grant gratuity, pension 

and other retiral benefits. 

191. 
Reply of the respondents is to the effect that as per 

the policy of the State Government dated 16.8.2005, 

compassionate appointment can be granted in case an 

employee had put in 7 years continuous service on daily wage 

basis and in the case of the husband of the petitioner, he has only 

put in 5 years as daily wage worker. 

192. 
The Policy in question was amended vide Office 

Memorandum, dated 18 th May, 1995, whereby Clause 2(b) of the 

said policy was amended entitling the family of a daily waged 

employee, who dies while in service, to seek employment on 

compassionate ground, irrespective of number of years of service 

rendered by a daily wage worker. 

193. 
In the instant case, the husband of the petitioner was 

granted daily wage status in the year, 2004, thus, as per the Policy

Having said so, the impugned order is set aside and 

the respondents are directed to reconsider the case of the 

petitioner afresh, of course, in accordance with the policy and the 

findings recorded hereinabove on points No.(i) to (ix). As far as 

the relief of granting other service benefits is concerned, the 

petitioner is at liberty to pursue that claim independently, if 

advised.

The father of the petitioner, while on duty and

his son i.e. the petitioner be provided job, which request of retiring 

the father of the petitioner was accepted by the Corporation on 

13 th May, 2014. However, the request for providing employment to 

the petitioner was rejected vide letter dated 3 rd May, 2014,

dated 3 rd May, 2014, (Annexure P-4), whereby he has been denied 

employment on compassionate ground, be quashed.

No reply has been filed. 

200. 
From the facts of the case, it is apparent that the 

father of the petitioner suffered 100% disability while discharging his 

duties. Therefore, it was incumbent upon the respondents not to 

reject the request of the petitioner for grant of appointment on 

compassionate ground in a cursory manner. Rather, the fact that 

the father of the petitioner suffered the injury while performing his 

duties ought to have been kept in mind by the respondents.

respondents to consider the case of the petitioner afresh in 

accordance with the policy prevalent in the year 2007, when the 

writ petitioner applied for being appointed on compassionate 

grounds. 

205. 
Facts of the case, in brief, are that father of the 

petitioner died in harness on 26.12.2003 while working as Drawing 

Master on regular basis. The writ petitioner filed application for 

granting compassionate appointment, which was not adhered to 

on the ground that the family of the petitioner was not in indigent 

circumstances as the mother of the petitioner was drawing family 

pension to the tune Rs.16,918/-per month. Another ground of 

rejection was that the existing policy provided for employment 

either to the widow of the deceased employee or to an orphan. 

The learned Single Judge, after dilating on the judgments passed 

by the Apex Court, held that the stand of the writ respondents was

not inconsonance with the policy prevalent in the year 2007, when

In view of our findings returned on points No.(ii) and (iii) 

above, the impugned judgment needs to be upheld to the extent 

that the case of the writ petitioner was to be considered by the 

writ respondents as per the Policy in vogue at the time of 

presenting the claim by the writ petitioner, for the first time.

Having said so, the Letters Patent Appeal is disposed

Judgment rendered in CWP No.1575 of 2012 dated

CWP No.1343 of 2012, dated 2.11.2012. 
The 
writ 
petitioner 

(respondent herein) was offered appointment on compassionate 

ground as daily wage Beldar vide letter dated 7 th February, 2006, 

to which he joined without any protest. Thereafter, the writ 

petitioner filed the petition with the prayer that the writ

respondents (appellants herein) be directed to consider the case 

of the petitioner for being appointed against a Class-III post. 

209. 
It is worthwhile to mention here that In CWP No.1343 of 

2012, the petitioner was appointed as Beldar on daily wage basis, 

on compassionate ground. The petitioner, by the medium of the 

writ petition, sought direction to the respondents to give him 

appointment against the post of Clerk. The learned Single Judge 

allowed the said writ petition and directed the respondents to 

appoint the petitioner as Clerk on daily wage basis from the date 

of his initial appointment. 

210. 
In view of our findings on the above points, the appeal 

is allowed and the judgment, impugned in the instant appeal, is set 

aside. Consequently, the writ petition is dismissed. 

211. 
Before parting with, we may place on record that the 

aim and object of providing employment assistance on 

compassionate ground is to immediately enable the dependants 

of an employee to tide over the sudden financial constraints on 

the death of their bread-earner. 
Thus, the source of such 

employment is purely based on humanitarian grounds taking into 

consideration the fact that unless some source of livelihood is 

provided, the family would not be able to make both ends meet.

Therefore, it is desirable that efforts are made by the 

respondents-State for providing employment assistance on 

compassionate ground promptly and without any loss of time, after 

the death of the employee, so that the family is provided 

immediate help and the purpose of carving out such an exception 

is achieved. 
To achieve the avowed purpose of framing the 

policy for grant of employment on compassionate ground, it is 

also desirable that the Authority, who is vested with the 

discretion of making appointment on compassionate ground, 

exercises the said discretion discreetly, without discrimination 

and without being influenced, strictly in accordance with the 

provisions envisaged in the Policy. 

213. 
The writ petitions and the appeals are disposed of as 

indicated above, alongwith all pending CMPs, if any.
