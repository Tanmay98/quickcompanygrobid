			<body>apt to reproduce paragraphs 8 and 9 of the said decision, <lb/>hereunder: <lb/>&quot;8 The employer being Steel Authority of India, <lb/>admittedly an authority within the meaning of Article 12 <lb/>has thus an obligation to act in terms of the avowed <lb/>objective of social and economic justice as enshrined in <lb/>the Constitution but has the authority in the facts of the <lb/>matters under consideration acted like a model and an <lb/>ideal employer -It is in this factual backdrop, the issue <lb/>needs an answer as to whether we have been able to <lb/>obtain the benefit of constitutional philosophy of social <lb/>and economic justice or not. Have the lofty ideals which <lb/>the founding fathers placed before us any effect in our <lb/>daily life -the answer cannot however but be in the <lb/>negative -what happens to the constitutional <lb/>philosophy as is available in the Constitution itself, which <lb/>we ourselves have so fondly conferred on to ourselves. <lb/>The socialistic pattern of society as envisaged in the <lb/>Constitution has to be attributed its full meaning. A <lb/>person dies while taking the wife to a hospital and the <lb/>cry of the lady for bare subsistence would go unheeded <lb/>on certain technicality. The bread earner is no longer <lb/>available and prayer for compassionate appointment <lb/>would be denied, as &quot;it is likely to open a Pandora&apos;s Box&quot; <lb/>-This is the resultant effect of our entry into the new <lb/>millennium. Can the law courts be a mute spectator in <lb/>the matter of denial of such a relief to the horrendous <lb/>sufferings of an employee&apos;s family by reason of the <lb/>death of the bread-earner.

We would like to point out that the philosophy <lb/>of this Court as evolved in the cases we have <lb/>referred to above is not that of the court but is <lb/>ingrained in the Constitution as one of the basic <lb/>aspects and if there was any doubt on this there is <lb/>no room for that after the Preamble has been <lb/>amended and the Forty-second Amendment has <lb/>declared the Republic to be a socialistic one. The <lb/>judgments, therefore, do nothing more than <lb/>highlight one aspect of the constitutional <lb/>philosophy and make an attempt to give the <lb/>philosophy a reality of flesh and blood. <lb/>15. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of this <lb/>Republic while dreaming of elevating the lot of <lb/>the common man of this country once stated : <lb/>&quot;Our final aim can only be a classless society <lb/>with <lb/>equal <lb/>economic <lb/>justice <lb/>and <lb/>opportunity to all, a society organized on a <lb/>planned basis for the raising of mankind to <lb/>higher <lb/>material <lb/>and <lb/>cultural <lb/>levels. <lb/>Everything that comes in the way will have <lb/>to be removed gently, if possible; forcibly if <lb/>necessary, and there seems to be little <lb/>doubt that coercion will often be necessary.&quot; <lb/>These were his prophetic words about three <lb/>decades back.

Tolstoy wrote : <lb/>&quot;The abolition of slavery has gone on for a <lb/>long time. Rome abolished slavery. America <lb/>abolished it and we did but only the words <lb/>were abolished, not the thing.&quot; <lb/>Perhaps what Tolstoy wrote about abolition of <lb/>slavery in a large sense applies to what we have <lb/>done to the constitutional ethos.

What Swami Vivekananda wrote in a <lb/>different context may perhaps help a quicker <lb/>implementation of the goal to bring about the <lb/>overdue changes for transforming India in a <lb/>positive way and in fulfilling the dreams of the <lb/>Constitution fathers. These were the words of the <lb/>Swami : <lb/>&apos;It is imperative that all this various yogas <lb/>should be carried out in practice. Mere <lb/>theories about them will not do any good. <lb/>First we have to hear about them; then we <lb/>have to think about them. We have to <lb/>reason the thoughts out, impress them on <lb/>our minds and meditate on them; realise <lb/>them, until at last they become our whole <lb/>life. No longer will religion remain a bundle of <lb/>ideas or theories or an intellectual assent; it <lb/>will enter into our very self. By means of an <lb/>intellectual assent, we may today subscribe <lb/>to many foolish things, and change our <lb/>minds altogether tomorrow. But true religion <lb/>never changes. Religion is realisation; not <lb/>talk, nor doctrine, nor theories, however <lb/>beautiful they may be. It is being and <lb/>becoming, not hearing or acknowledging. It <lb/>is the whole soul&apos;s becoming changed into <lb/>what it believes. That is religion.&apos;&quot; <lb/>9. As a matter of fact the constitutional philosophy <lb/>should be allowed to become a part of every man&apos;s life <lb/>in this country and then only the Constitution can reach <lb/>everyone and the ideals of the Constitution framers <lb/>would be achieved since the people would be nearer <lb/>the goal set by the Constitution -an ideal situation but a <lb/>far cry presently.&quot; <lb/>8. <lb/>The Apex Court in case titled as National Institute <lb/>of Technology &amp; Ors. vs. Niraj Kumar Singh, reported in 2007 <lb/></body>

			<body>AIR SCW 1169, while dilating upon the aim and object of <lb/>granting appointment on compassionate ground, has held <lb/>that no appointment can be made on compassionate <lb/>ground in the absence of Scheme and the Scheme must be <lb/>corresponding to the scheme of equality, as enshrined in the <lb/>Constitution.

			<body>carved out therefore are the cases where <lb/>appointments are to be given to the widow or the <lb/>dependent children of the employee who died in <lb/>harness. Such an exception is carved out with a view to <lb/>see that the family of the deceased employee who has <lb/>died in harness does not become a destitute. No <lb/>appointment, therefore, on compassionate ground can <lb/>be granted to a person other than those for whose <lb/>benefit the exception has been carved out. Other <lb/>family members of the deceased employee would not <lb/>derive any benefit thereunder.&quot; <lb/>9. <lb/>The Apex Court in another decision in Union of <lb/>India &amp; Anr. vs. B. Kishore, 2011 AIR SCW 2293, while dealing <lb/>with the case of appointment on compassionate ground, has <lb/>observed that the aim and object of providing <lb/>compassionate appointment to the dependants of a <lb/>deceased-employee is to provide immediate succour to the <lb/>family, who, on the sudden death of the employee, may find <lb/>itself in a state of destitution and if that object is taken out of <lb/>the scheme, in that case, it would turn out to be a reservation <lb/>in favour of the dependants of an employee who died in <lb/>harness, which would not be in consonance with the <lb/>mandate of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.

			<body>&quot;5. On going through the judgment passed by the High <lb/>Court, it is evident that it is based on a complete <lb/>misconception about the scheme of compassionate <lb/>appointments. Contrary to the High Court&apos;s observation, <lb/>indigence of the dependents of the deceased <lb/>employee is the first pre-condition to bring the case <lb/>under the scheme of &quot;compassionate appointment&quot;. <lb/>The very purpose and object of the scheme is to <lb/>provide immediate succour to the family of an <lb/>employee that, on his death, may suddenly find itself in <lb/>a state of destitution. If the element of indigence and <lb/>the need to provide immediate assistance for relief from <lb/>financial deprivation is taken out from the scheme of <lb/>compassionate appointments, it would turn out to be a <lb/>reservation in favour of the dependents of an employee <lb/>who died while in service which would be directly in <lb/>conflict with the ideal of equality guaranteed under <lb/>Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. <lb/>6. In State Bank of India v. Raj Kumar, 2010 11 SCC 661, <lb/>elucidating the nature of the scheme of compassionate <lb/>appointments this Court observed: <lb/>&quot;It is now well settled that appointment on <lb/>compassionate grounds is not a source of <lb/>recruitment. On the other hand it is an exception <lb/>to the general rule that recruitment to public <lb/>services should be on the basis of merit, by an <lb/>open invitation providing equal opportunity to all <lb/>eligible persons to participate in the selection <lb/>process.

The claim for compassionate <lb/>appointment is therefore traceable only to the <lb/>scheme framed by the employer for such <lb/>employment and there is no right whatsoever <lb/>outside such scheme. An appointment under the <lb/>scheme can be made only if the scheme is in <lb/>force and not after it is abolished/withdrawn. It <lb/>follows therefore that when a scheme is abolished, <lb/>any pending application seeking appointment <lb/>under the scheme will also cease to exist, unless <lb/>saved. The mere fact that an application was <lb/>made when the scheme was in force, will not by <lb/>itself create a right in favour of the applicant.&quot; <lb/>10. <lb/>After going through the pronouncements of the <lb/>Apex Court, one comes to inescapable conclusion as to what <lb/>is <lb/>the <lb/>purpose <lb/>behind <lb/>making <lb/>appointment <lb/>on <lb/>compassionate ground and what factors are to be kept in <lb/>mind by the concerned Authorities while making such <lb/>appointments, of course, in consonance with the <lb/>Scheme/Policy/Rules/ Regulations occupying the field. <lb/>11. <lb/>The genesis of the controversy, in hand, is the <lb/>Policy, dated 18 th January, 1990, framed by the Government <lb/>of Himachal Pradesh for making appointments on <lb/>compassionate ground, which is reproduced hereinbelow: <lb/></body>

After <lb/>thorough consideration and in supersession of all previous <lb/>orders in this respect, it has now been decided to adopt the <lb/>following new policy for grant of employment on <lb/>compassionate grounds to the dependents of deceased <lb/>Govt. servants in future:-<lb/>1) <lb/>Policy:-<lb/>The employment on compassionate <lb/>grounds to the dependents of Govt. servants who die while <lb/>in service is not to be provided as a matter of right. It should <lb/>be given only in deserving cases where the family of <lb/>deceased Govt. servant is left in indigent circumstances <lb/>requiring immediate means of subsistence. The concerned <lb/>Administrative Departments would satisfy themselves about <lb/>the indigent circumstances of the family before <lb/>appointment on compassionate grounds is made. <lb/>2) <lb/>To whom the policy is applicable:-The employment <lb/>assistance on compassionate grounds will be allowed in <lb/>order of priority only to widow or a son or an unmarried <lb/>daughter (in case of unmarried Govt. servant to father, <lb/>mother brighter and unmarried sister) of:-<lb/>(a) <lb/>a Govt. servant who dies while in service <lb/>(including by suicide) leaving his family in immediate <lb/>need of assistance. <lb/>(b) a Daily wage employee who dies while in <lb/>service after having rendered at least 5 years service <lb/>with not less than 240 days on daily wage basis in a <lb/>year( to be computed as an average of the number <lb/>of days served in the preceding years) leaving his <lb/>family in immediate need of assistance. In such cases <lb/>compassionate employment would be on daily wages <lb/>only, <lb/>(c) a Govt. servant who has been missing for more <lb/>than two years and the family needs the immediate <lb/>assistance. <lb/></body>

			<body>Point No.(i) : Whether the amount of family pension and <lb/>other retiral benefits, received by the family of the <lb/>deceased-employee, can be included in the family <lb/>income for denying the compassionate appointment? <lb/>46. <lb/>Clause 10(c) of the Policy mandates that while <lb/>making appointment on compassionate ground, the <lb/>competent Authority has to keep in mind the benefits <lb/>received by the family on account of ad hoc ex-gratia grant, <lb/>improved family pension and death gratuity. Therefore, we <lb/>may place on record at the outset that no maximum income <lb/>ceiling has been prescribed in the Policy. Only what has <lb/>been prescribed is that the competent Authority has to keep <lb/>in mind the benefits received by the family after the death of <lb/>the employee, as detailed above. <lb/>47. <lb/>The aim and object of granting compassionate <lb/>appointment is to enable the family of the deceased <lb/>employee to tide over the sudden financial crisis which the <lb/>family has met on the death of its breadwinner.

Thus, we <lb/>are of the considered view that the amount of family pension <lb/>and other retiral benefits cannot be equated with the <lb/>employment assistance on compassionate ground. <lb/>48. <lb/>While reaching at this conclusion, we are <lb/>supported by the decision of the Apex Court in Govind <lb/>Prakash Verma vs. Life Insurance Corporation of India and <lb/>others, (2005) 10 Supreme Court Cases 289, wherein it was <lb/>held that scheme for providing employment assistance on <lb/>compassionate ground was over and above the service <lb/>benefits received by the family of an employee after his <lb/>death. <lb/>It is apt to reproduce the relevant portion of <lb/>paragraph 6 of the said decision hereunder: <lb/>&quot;6.

The object is not to give a <lb/>member of such family a post much less a post for <lb/>post held by the deceased. What is further, mere <lb/>death of an employee in harness does not entitle <lb/>his family to such source of livelihood. The <lb/>Government or the public authority concerned <lb/>has to examine the financial condition of the <lb/>family of the deceased, and it is only if it is <lb/>satisfied, that but for the provision of employment, <lb/>the family will not be able to meet the crisis that a <lb/>job is to be offered to the eligible member of the <lb/>family. The posts in Classes III and IV are the lowest <lb/>post in non-manual and manual categories and <lb/>hence they alone can be offered on <lb/>compassionate grounds, the object being to <lb/>relieve the family, of the financial destitution and <lb/>to help it get over the emergency. <lb/>Offering compassionate employment as a matter <lb/>of course irrespective of the financial condition of the <lb/>family of the deceased and making compassionate <lb/>appointments in posts above Classes III and IV, is legally <lb/>impermissible.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>contention raised was that since she is entitled to get <lb/>the benefit under Family Benefit Scheme assuring <lb/>monthly payment to the family of the deceased <lb/>employee, the request for compassionate appointment <lb/>cannot be acceded to. Rejecting that contention in <lb/>paragraph (13), this Court held as under:-<lb/>&quot;13. .But in our view this Family Benefit Scheme <lb/>cannot in any way be equated with the benefit of <lb/>compassionate appointments. The sudden jerk in <lb/>the family by reason of the death of the <lb/>breadearner can only be absorbed by some <lb/>lump-sum amount being made available to the <lb/>family this is rather unfortunate but this is a reality. <lb/>The feeling of security drops to zero on the death <lb/>of the breadearner and insecurity thereafter <lb/>reigns and it is at that juncture if some lump-sum <lb/>amount is made available with a compassionate <lb/>appointment, the grief-stricken family may find <lb/>some solace to the mental agony and manage its <lb/>affairs in the normal course of events. It is not that <lb/>monetary benefit would be the replacement of <lb/>the breadearner, but that would undoubtedly <lb/>bring some solace to the situation.&quot; <lb/>Referring to Steel Authority of India Ltd.&apos;s case, High <lb/>Court has rightly held that the grant of family pension or <lb/>payment of terminal benefits cannot be treated as a <lb/>substitute for providing employment assistance. The <lb/>High Court also observed that it is not the case of the <lb/>bank that the respondents&apos; family is having any other <lb/>income to negate their claim for appointment on <lb/>compassionate ground.&quot; <lb/>Emphasis applied. <lb/></body>

Therefore, the <lb/>mandate of the said judgment of the Apex Court is squarely <lb/>applicable to the cases in hand. <lb/>53. <lb/>From the facts of the cases in hand, another moot <lb/>question, which arises for consideration, is -Whether <lb/>instructions contained in letters/communications, made by <lb/>one Department of the Government to another, can be said <lb/>to be amendment in the Policy? The answer is in the <lb/>negative for the following reasons. <lb/>54. <lb/>In order to show that the maximum income ceiling <lb/>was prescribed by the competent Authority, the respondents <lb/>have relied upon the letter, dated 1 st November, 2008, written <lb/>by the Secretary (PW) to the Government of H.P., to the <lb/>Engineer-in-Chief, HP PWD, referred to above, wherein it was <lb/>mentioned that the income ceiling fixed by the Finance <lb/>Department, for a family of four members, was Rs.1.00 lac.

Point No.(i) is answered accordingly. <lb/>Point No.(ii) -Which date would be relevant viz. a viz. <lb/>applicability of the Policy -whether the date of death of <lb/>the employee or the date when the application was <lb/>presented, for the first time, for seeking employment on <lb/></body>

			<body>Policy, the cause of action can be said to have arisen on the <lb/>date when the claim is presented by the applicant by filing <lb/>the application claiming appointment on compassionate <lb/>ground, and that, the claim for appointment on <lb/>compassionate ground, presented under a particular <lb/>scheme, cannot be considered under a scheme which was <lb/>amended after the date of making the claim. <lb/>58. <lb/>While reaching at the above conclusion, we are <lb/>supported by the decision of the Apex Court in State Bank of <lb/>India and others vs. Jaspal Kaur, 2007 AIR SCW 1044, wherein <lb/>the Apex Court has held that appointment on compassionate <lb/>ground has to be made strictly in accordance with the <lb/>Policy/Scheme which was applicable at the time of making <lb/>the application.

It is apt to reproduce paragraphs 12, 13, 14 and 15 of <lb/>the said decision hereunder: <lb/>&quot;12.

The Court held that in <lb/>the circumstances, the rules could not have been amended <lb/>retrospectively affecting the rights of the employees. The <lb/>Court, however, held that on the date when the said <lb/>retrospective amendments were introduced, Article 19(1)(f) <lb/>and Article 31(1) were available in the Constitution of India. <lb/>The Court held that, therefore, the right of property of the <lb/>petitioner was breached by the impugned retrospective <lb/>circulars. Further in cutting down the pension by bringing in <lb/>the amendments to the provisions retrospectively would be <lb/>invalid, breaching Articles 14 and 16. Relying heavily on this <lb/>judgment the learned Counsel suggests that at least in the <lb/>aforementioned case, the amendments were retrospective <lb/>while in the present case they were not retrospective and, <lb/>therefore, the amended Circular dated 13.12.1995 would not <lb/>be applicable. The further argument is that under any <lb/>circumstance the right for being considered for <lb/>compassionate appointment had accrued on the date of <lb/>death of the employee that being the only relevant date. <lb/>According to the learned Counsel the date on which the <lb/>representation was made was irrelevant. <lb/>13. As against this the learned senior counsel Shri Harish <lb/>Chandra urged that the most relevant date would only be <lb/>when the representation was made because the Railway <lb/>Board had to consider as to whether the appellants were <lb/>indigent on the date when the application was made. <lb/></body>

Learned senior counsel in support <lb/>of his argument relied on the judgment in State Bank of India <lb/>and Ors. v. Jaspal Kaur, reported in 2007 (9) SCC 571. <lb/>However, we do not find any similarity in the situation <lb/>appearing in this case and the one decided by this Court. <lb/>The reported decision only considered the question as to <lb/>which scheme pertaining to compassionate appointment <lb/>should be preferred -whether it should be the scheme <lb/>prevailing at the time when the application for <lb/>compassionate appointment was filed or the one which was <lb/>available on the date of decision of the Court. <lb/>15. Such question is not for our consideration in the present <lb/>matter. That decision is, therefore, of no use for learned <lb/>Counsel for the respondents. However, in our view the <lb/>question posed by us as to what would be the relevant date <lb/>for consideration, whether it would be the date of death of <lb/>employee or whether it would be the date of making the <lb/>representation? That has not been considered by the High <lb/>Court. We, therefore, remand this matter to the High Court <lb/>with a request to the High Court to decide the same. We <lb/>request the High Court to dispose of the matter within six <lb/>months of the writ reaching the High Court as the matter <lb/>pertains to the rights of a poor widow.

			<body>the case of compassionate appointment, has held that a <lb/>scheme or policy promulgated by the employer is binding on <lb/>the employer and the employee. It is apt to reproduce <lb/>paragraph 15 of the said decision hereunder: <lb/>&quot;15. Now, it is well settled that compassionate employment is <lb/>given solely on humanitarian grounds with the sole object to <lb/>provide immediate relief to the employee&apos;s family to tide <lb/>over the sudden financial crisis and cannot be claimed as a <lb/>matter of right. Appointment based solely on descent is <lb/>inimical to our Constitutional scheme, and ordinarily public <lb/>employment must be strictly on the basis of open invitation <lb/>of applications and comparative merit, in consonance with <lb/>Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. No other mode <lb/>of appointment is permissible. Nevertheless, the concept of <lb/>compassionate appointment has been recognized as an <lb/>exception to the general rule, carved out in the interest of <lb/>justice, in certain exigencies, by way of a policy of an <lb/>employer, which partakes the character of the service rules. <lb/>That being so, it needs little emphasis that the scheme or the <lb/>policy, as the case may be, is binding both on the employer <lb/>and the employee. Being an exception, the scheme has to <lb/>be strictly construed and confined only to the purpose it <lb/>seeks to achieve.

It is apt to reproduce paragraphs 12 <lb/>and 13 of the said decision hereunder: <lb/>&quot;12. A scheme containing an in pari materia clause, as is <lb/>involved in this case was considered by this Court in State <lb/>Bank of India &amp; Anr. vs. Raj Kumar, (2010) 11 SCC 661. Clause <lb/>14 of the said Scheme is verbatim to clause 14 of the <lb/>scheme involved herein, which reads as under: <lb/>&quot;14. Date of effect of the scheme and disposal of <lb/>pending applications: The Scheme will come into <lb/>force with effect from the date it is approved by the <lb/>Board of Directors. Applications pending under the <lb/>Compassionate Appointment Scheme as on the date <lb/>on which this new Scheme is approved by the Board <lb/>will be dealt with in accordance with Scheme for <lb/>payment of ex-gratia lump sum amount provided they <lb/>fulfill all the terms and conditions of this scheme.&quot; <lb/>13.

In case the <lb/>Scheme does not create any legal right, a candidate <lb/>cannot claim that his case is to be considered as per the <lb/>Scheme existing on the date the cause of action had arisen <lb/>i.e. death of the incumbent on the post. In State Bank of <lb/>India &amp; Anr. , this Court held that in such a situation, the case <lb/>under the new Scheme has to be considered.&quot; <lb/>62. <lb/>The Apex Court in its latest decision in Canara <lb/>Bank &amp; Anr. vs. M. Mahesh Kumar, 2015 AIR SCW 3212, <lb/>(supra), held that when the dependant of the deceased-<lb/>employee applied in time, under a particular Scheme, his <lb/>case cannot be considered under the Scheme, which was <lb/>introduced subsequently. <lb/>It was also held that the <lb/>subsequently introduced Scheme, being administrative or <lb/>executive order, cannot have a retrospective effect.

The object of the Scheme is <lb/>to help dependants of employees of Canara Bank who die <lb/>or become totally and permanently disabled while in <lb/>harness and to overcome the immediate financial difficulties <lb/>on account of sudden stoppage of the main source of <lb/>income. The employment under the scheme will be <lb/>considered only if there are indigent circumstances <lb/>necessitating employment to one of the dependants and <lb/>the deceased employee&apos;s service record is unblemished. <lb/>Mere eligibility will not vest a right for claiming employment. <lb/>As per para 3.1, application for employment should be <lb/>sought within 21/2 years from the date of death of the <lb/>employees. In para 3.2, it is stated that in case of the <lb/>dependant of the deceased employee to be offered <lb/>appointment is a minor, the bank may keep the offer of <lb/>appointment open till the minor attains the age of majority <lb/>provided a request is made to the bank by the family of the <lb/>deceased employee and the same may be considered <lb/>subject to rules prevailing at the time of consideration. <lb/>………………. <lb/>……………. <lb/>…………… <lb/>11. The main question falling for consideration is whether the <lb/>Scheme passed in 2005 providing for ex-gratia payment or <lb/>the Scheme then in vogue in 1993 providing for <lb/>compassionate appointment is applicable to the <lb/>respondent. Appellant-bank has placed reliance upon the <lb/>judgment of this Court in Jaspal Kaur&apos;s case to contend that <lb/>the respondent&apos;s case cannot be considered on the basis of <lb/>&apos;Dying in Harness Scheme 1993&apos; when the new Scheme of <lb/></body>

			<body>2005 providing for ex-gratia payment had been put in place. <lb/>In Jaspal Kaur&apos;s case , Sukhbir Inder Singh employee of State <lb/>Bank of India, Record Assistant (Cash &amp; Accounts) passed <lb/>away on 1.08.1999. Widow of the employee applied for <lb/>compassionate appointment in State Bank of India on <lb/>5.02.2000. On 7.01.2002, the competent authority of the bank <lb/>rejected the application of Jaspal Kaur in view of the <lb/>Scheme vis-a-vis the financial position of the family. Against <lb/>that decision of the competent authority, the respondent <lb/>filed writ petition before the Punjab and Haryana High Court <lb/>which has directed to consider the case of Jaspal Kaur by <lb/>applying the Scheme formulated on 4.08.2005 when her <lb/>application was made in the year 2000. In that factual <lb/>matrix, this Court has directed that dispute arising in the year <lb/>2000 cannot be decided on the basis of a Scheme that was <lb/>put in place much after the dispute. By perusal of the <lb/>judgment in Jaspal Kaur&apos;s case, it is apparent that the <lb/>judgment specifically states that claim of compassionate <lb/>appointment under a scheme of a particular year cannot <lb/>be decided in the light of the subsequent scheme that <lb/>came into force much after the claim. <lb/>………………… <lb/>………………… <lb/>………………. <lb/>13. Applying these principles to the case in hand, as <lb/>discussed earlier, respondent&apos;s father died on 10.10.1998 <lb/>while he was serving as a clerk in the appellant-bank and <lb/>the respondent applied timely for compassionate <lb/>appointment as per the scheme &apos;Dying in Harness Scheme&apos; <lb/>dated 8.05.1993 which was in force at that time. The <lb/>appellant-bank rejected the respondent&apos;s claim on <lb/></body>

In <lb/>the light of the principles laid down in the above decisions, <lb/>the cause of action to be considered for compassionate <lb/>appointment arose when the Circular No.154/1993 dated <lb/>8.05.1993 was in force. Thus, as per the judgment referred in <lb/>Jaspal Kaur&apos;s case, the claim cannot be decided as per 2005 <lb/>Scheme providing for ex-gratia payment. The Circular dated <lb/>14.2.2005 being an administrative or executive order cannot <lb/>have retrospective effect so as to take away the right <lb/>accrued to the respondent as per circular of 1993. <lb/>14. It is also pertinent to note that 2005 Scheme providing <lb/>only for ex-gratia payment in lieu of compassionate <lb/>appointment stands superseded by the Scheme of 2014 <lb/>which has revived the scheme providing for compassionate <lb/>appointment. As on date, now the scheme in force is to <lb/>provide <lb/>compassionate <lb/>appointment. <lb/>Under <lb/>these <lb/>circumstances, the appellant-bank is not justified in <lb/>contending that the application for compassionate <lb/>appointment of the respondent cannot be considered in <lb/>view of passage of time. <lb/>……………. <lb/>……………….. <lb/>…………………… <lb/>17. Considering the scope of the Scheme &apos;Dying in Harness <lb/>Scheme 1993&apos; then in force and the facts and circumstances <lb/>of the case, the High Court rightly directed the appellant-<lb/>bank to reconsider the claim of the respondent for <lb/>compassionate appointment in accordance with law and <lb/></body>

We do not find <lb/>any reason warranting interference.&quot; <lb/>63. <lb/>Applying the ratio to the cases in hand and <lb/>keeping in view the provisions of the Policy in question, we <lb/>hold that the date of death of the employee is not to be <lb/>taken into consideration while seeing the applicability of the <lb/>Policy. Similarly, the date on which the application comes up <lb/>for consideration before the competent Authority is also of no <lb/>importance, since, because of the lackadaisical approach of <lb/>the Departments, such cases may have been kept pending <lb/>for a pretty long time and during that period, the policy may <lb/>have been amended. <lb/>Thus, the applicants, in such <lb/>circumstances, cannot be made to suffer for the inaction on <lb/>the part of the Authorities. <lb/>64. <lb/>Accordingly, we hold that the case of the <lb/>applicant would be governed by the provisions of the Policy <lb/>which was in place at the time when the application, for the <lb/>first time, was made by the applicant to the Department, and <lb/>in the case of a minor, the right to apply would commence <lb/>from the date he/she attained majority, as given in the <lb/></body>

			<body>66. <lb/>As has been discussed above, the idea behind <lb/>providing employment assistance on compassionate ground <lb/>is to tide over the immediate hardship which is faced by a <lb/>family on account of the death of the bread earner. <lb/>However, endless compassion cannot be shown to such a <lb/>family. <lb/>We may also place on record that right to claim <lb/>appointment on compassionate ground cannot be used as a <lb/>method to seek employment. It is just an exception and <lb/>discretion of the competent Authority. The applicant cannot <lb/>claim that he is entitled to appointment on compassionate <lb/>ground as a matter of right. <lb/>67. <lb/>The Apex Court in I.G.

It is further held that the post offered is not to <lb/>cater to the status of such dependant, but to enable the <lb/>family to tide over the financial calamity being faced by the <lb/>family on the death of bread earner. It was also held that <lb/>compassionate appointment, in posts above Class-III and <lb/>Class-IV, is legally impermissible. <lb/>It is apt to reproduce <lb/>paragraphs 3 and 5 of the said decision hereunder: <lb/>&quot;3. Unmindful of this legal position, some governments <lb/>and <lb/>public <lb/>authorities <lb/>have <lb/>been <lb/>offering <lb/>compassionate employment sometimes as a matter of <lb/>course irrespective of the financial condition of the <lb/>family of the deceased and sometimes even in posts <lb/>above Classes III and IV.

Appellant being a State within the meaning of <lb/>Article 12 of the Constitution of India, while making <lb/>recruitments, it is bound to follow the rules framed by it. <lb/>Appointment of a dependant of a deceased employee <lb/>on compassionate ground is a matter involving policy <lb/>decision. It may be a part of the service rules. In this <lb/>case it would be a part of the settlement having the <lb/>force of law. A Memorandum of Settlement entered <lb/>into by and between the Management and the <lb/>employees having regard to the provisions contained in <lb/>Section 12(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act is binding <lb/>both on the employer and the employee. In the event, <lb/>any party thereto commits a breach of any of the <lb/>provisions thereof, ordinarily, an industrial dispute is to be <lb/>raised. We would, however, assume that a writ petition <lb/>therefor was maintainable. It is in that sense of the term, <lb/>the learned Single Judge opined that the question as to <lb/>whether there has been a breach of the Memorandum <lb/>of Settlement on the part of the employer or not <lb/>involves a disputed question of fact. The Division Bench <lb/>of the High Court, however, proceeded on the premise <lb/>that the employer was bound to provide appointment <lb/>on compassionate appointment in all cases involving <lb/>death of an employee. The Division Bench, in our <lb/>opinion, was not correct in its view.

It is meant to <lb/>provide for a minimum relief. When such contentions <lb/>are raised, the constitutional philosophy of equality <lb/>behind making such a scheme be taken into <lb/>consideration. Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of <lb/>India mandate that all eligible candidates should be <lb/>considered for appointment in the posts which have <lb/>fallen vacant. Appointment on compassionate ground <lb/>offered to a dependant of a deceased employee is an <lb/>exception to the said rule. It is a concession, not a right. <lb/>(See General Manager, State Bank of India &amp; Ors. vs. <lb/>Anju Jain, 2008 8 SCC 475)&quot; <lb/>72. <lb/>The Apex Court in Director General of Posts and <lb/>others vs. K.

From the above Scheme and Office Memorandum, <lb/>it is clear that where on the one hand, the State had <lb/>formulated a welfare scheme for compassionate <lb/>appointments, there on the other, because of limitations <lb/>of its financial resources it decided to take economic <lb/>measures by reducing the extent of appointment by <lb/>direct recruitment from the financial year 2001-2002. <lb/>Both these matters falling in the domain of the <lb/></body>

All that we <lb/>propose to hold is that State has to abide by the <lb/>Scheme it has floated for compassionate appointment. <lb/>23. The 1998 Scheme floated by the Government <lb/>should receive a liberal construction and application as <lb/>it is stated to be a social welfare scheme and largely <lb/>tilted in favour of the members of the family of the <lb/>deceased employee. The purpose appears to be to <lb/>provide them with recruitment on a regular basis rather <lb/>than circumvent the same by adopting any other <lb/>measure. That is the reason why the Government <lb/>specifically states in its Scheme that efforts should be <lb/>made to appoint the members of a distressed family to <lb/>the post provided he/she satisfies the other parameters <lb/>stated in the Scheme. <lb/>…………. ………………. <lb/>……………… <lb/>………….. <lb/>26. Despite the fact that the judgment of the Central <lb/>Administrative Tribunal (for short &quot;the Tribunal&quot;) has been <lb/>upheld by the High Court, we are unable to contribute <lb/>and sustain the view taken by the Tribunal that the <lb/>Memorandum dated 16th May, 2001 frustrated the very <lb/>object of the Scheme for Compassionate Appointment <lb/>and on that ground alone, it was liable to be declared <lb/>invalid. As already noticed, both the matters are policy <lb/>matters of the State and for valid and proper reasons, <lb/>without infringing the spirit of Article 14 and 16 of the <lb/>Constitution. The State can frame its policy, where it is <lb/>for economic reasons, least such decision would be <lb/>open to judicial review to that extent. In the present <lb/>case, there is some ambiguity created by issuance of <lb/>office memorandums dated 16th May, 2001 and 14th <lb/>June, 2006 and the enforcement of the former vide <lb/>office memorandum dated 4th July, 2002 in relation to <lb/>the implementation of Compassionate Appointment <lb/>Scheme of 1998. Thus, it is not only desirable but <lb/>necessary that the competent authority should issue <lb/>comprehensive guidelines squarely covering the issue, <lb/></body>

Similarly, <lb/>Clause 2(b) also provides that if a daily wage employee or a <lb/>work charge Beldar, on daily wages with 7 years continuous <lb/>service, dies while in service, one of the dependants of such <lb/>employee will be &quot;appointed on daily wages only&quot;. Further <lb/>Clause 2(f) was added later on vide Office Memorandum <lb/>dated 4 th September, 2012 (reproduced above), which <lb/>entitled the dependant of a contractual employee dying in <lb/>harness to claim compassionate employment on &quot;daily <lb/>waged basis&quot;. <lb/>74. <lb/>The policy also postulates in Clause-4 that <lb/>appointment on compassionate ground would only be made <lb/>to &quot;the lowest rung of Class-IV and Class-III posts&quot;. It was also <lb/>provided that Class-III jobs would include all equivalent jobs <lb/>including technical posts and teachers (class-III). <lb/></body>

			<body>75. <lb/>In view of the decisions referred to above, what <lb/>flows is that the compassionate employment cannot be <lb/>claimed as a matter of right, rather this provision has been <lb/>carved out, against the general rule of equality, in order to <lb/>ameliorate the hardship of a family. Moreover, the Policy <lb/>itself explicitly provides that once a person accepted <lb/>appointment on a particular post, he would not be allowed <lb/>to seek change in post. <lb/>76. <lb/>The discretion to offer appointment on <lb/>compassionate <lb/>ground <lb/>is <lb/>vested <lb/>with <lb/>the <lb/>respondents/Authorities and it is for the said Authorities to see <lb/>whether a person is to be appointed against a Class-IV or <lb/>Class-III post or on daily wage basis and that discretion <lb/>cannot be questioned on the ground of discrimination, and <lb/>that too, when a person has accepted the offer of <lb/>appointment and joined without any demur and enjoyed the <lb/>benefits. <lb/>However, there is also no quarrel about the <lb/>proposition that the Authority, who is vested with the <lb/>discretion of making appointment on compassionate ground, <lb/>is expected to exercise the discretion vested in it judiciously <lb/></body>

The Apex Court <lb/>has also observed that, no doubt, it is not possible to lay down <lb/>a rigid time limit within which appointment on compassionate <lb/>ground must be made, but emphasis must be that such an <lb/>appointment must have some bearing on the object of the <lb/>scheme. It is apt to reproduce paragraphs 7 to 9 of the said <lb/>decision hereunder: <lb/>&quot;7. We think that the explanation given for the wife of <lb/>the deceased not asking for employment is an after-<lb/>thought and completely unacceptable. A person <lb/>suffering from anemia and low blood pressure will <lb/>always greatly prefer the security and certainty of a <lb/>regular job in the municipality which would be far more <lb/>lucrative and far less taxing than doing menial work <lb/>from house to house in an unorganized way.

			<body>from this, there is a far more basic flaw in the view taken <lb/>by the Division Bench in that it is completely divorced <lb/>from the object and purpose of the scheme of <lb/>compassionate appointments. It has been said a <lb/>number of times earlier but it needs to be recalled here <lb/>that under the scheme of compassionate appointment, <lb/>in case of an employee dying in harness one of his <lb/>eligible dependents is given a job with the sole <lb/>objective to provide immediate succour to the family <lb/>which may suddenly find itself in dire straits as a result of <lb/>the death of the bread winner. An appointment made <lb/>many years after the death of the employee or without <lb/>due consideration of the financial resources available <lb/>to his/her dependents and the financial deprivation <lb/>caused to the dependents as a result of his death, <lb/>simply because the claimant happened to be one of <lb/>the dependents of the deceased employee would be <lb/>directly in conflict with Articles 14 &amp; 16 of the <lb/>Constitution and hence, quite bad and illegal. In <lb/>dealing with cases of compassionate appointment, it is <lb/>imperative to keep this vital aspect in mind. <lb/>8. Ideally, the appointment on compassionate basis <lb/>should be made without any loss of time but having <lb/>regard to the delays in the administrative process and <lb/>several other relevant factors such as the number of <lb/>already pending claims under the scheme and <lb/>availability of vacancies etc. normally the appointment <lb/></body>

			<body>may come after several months or even after two to <lb/>three years. It is not our intent, nor it is possible to lay <lb/>down a rigid time limit within which appointment on <lb/>compassionate grounds must be made but what needs <lb/>to be emphasised is that such an appointment must <lb/>have some bearing on the object of the scheme. <lb/>9. In this case the respondent was only 11 years old at <lb/>the time of the death of his father. The first application <lb/>for his appointment was made on July 2, 1993, even <lb/>while he was a minor. Another application was made <lb/>on his behalf on attaining majority after 7 years and 6 <lb/>months of his father&apos;s death. In such a case, the <lb/>appointment cannot be said to sub-serve the basic <lb/>object and purpose of the scheme. It would rather <lb/>appear that on attaining majority he staked his claim on <lb/>the basis that his father was an employee of the <lb/>Municipality and he had died while in service. In the <lb/>facts of the case, the municipal authorities were clearly <lb/>right in holding that with whatever difficulty, the family <lb/>of Meenakshisundaram had been able to tide over the <lb/>first impact of his death. That being the position, the <lb/>case of the respondent did not come under the <lb/>scheme of compassionate appointments. <lb/>83. <lb/>The Apex Court in Umesh Kumar Nagpal&apos;s case <lb/>(supra) has held that keeping in view the aim and object of <lb/></body>

It is apt to reproduce paragraph 6 of <lb/>the said decision as under: <lb/>&quot;6. For these very reasons, the compassionate <lb/>employment cannot be granted after a lapse of a <lb/>reasonable period which must be specified in the rules. <lb/>The consideration for such employment is not a vested <lb/>right which can be exercised at any time in future. The <lb/>object being to enable the family to get over the <lb/>financial crisis which it faces at the time of the death of <lb/>the sole breadwinner, the compassionate employment <lb/>cannot be claimed and offered whatever the lapse of <lb/>time and after the crisis is over.&quot; <lb/>84. <lb/>Now, let us have a glace of the relevant provision <lb/>of the Policy pertaining to the period within which application <lb/>has to be made by the dependant after the death of an <lb/>employee. Clause-8 of the Policy prescribes that application <lb/>for grant of employment on compassionate ground be made <lb/>to the Department concerned within three years of the death <lb/></body>

Clause-8 of the Policy further <lb/>postulates that in case the dependant of an employee is <lb/>minor at the time of death of the employee, then, in that <lb/>eventuality, the time limit for receiving application in the <lb/>department concerned would be the attaining of age of 21 <lb/>years by the eldest son/un-married daughter. <lb/>85. <lb/>While reading Clause 8 of the Policy, two factors <lb/>arise -a) where the employment on compassionate ground <lb/>has been sought by the widow or the son/un-married <lb/>daughter, who were major, at the time of death of the <lb/>employee-concerned; and b) where the dependants were <lb/>minor and widow of the deceased employee was not <lb/>inclined to take employment on compassionate ground. <lb/>86. <lb/>In the first factor, the policy itself is amply clear <lb/>that the claim for employment assistance must be made <lb/>within three years of the death of the government employee. <lb/>In the given circumstances, the appointment is to be sought <lb/>within three years of the death of the government-employee <lb/>and not thereafter. <lb/></body>

			<body>87. <lb/>As far as the other factor is concerned, the above <lb/>judgments are distinguishable since as per the mandate of <lb/>the Policy, if a dependant is minor at the time of the death of <lb/>the employee, he can apply for compassionate appointment <lb/>till the attainment of 21 years by the eldest son/unmarried <lb/>daughter. Thus, the case of such applicant cannot be <lb/>dismissed on the ground that the dependant has applied <lb/>after a considerable lapse of time. However, it is mandatory <lb/>for the Authorities to consider such cases as per the provisions <lb/>of the Scheme/Policy occupying the field at the relevant <lb/>point of time when the application was made for claiming <lb/>such employment. <lb/>88. <lb/>We can also not be oblivious to yet another <lb/>situation where the claim for compassionate employment has <lb/>been preferred within the time stipulated in the Policy, but the <lb/>matter remained pending with the respondent-Authorities for <lb/>a considerable long period, in such a situation, we are clear <lb/>in our mind that once the delay is not attributable to the <lb/>claimant, his application cannot be rejected on the ground <lb/>of delay. <lb/></body>

			<body>89. <lb/>Then, another question would arise as to which <lb/>Policy would govern the appointment of such an applicant -<lb/>whether the policy which was in place at the time of the <lb/>death of the employee or the policy when such an applicant <lb/>preferred his claim. <lb/>90. <lb/>In that case, we have already held above that <lb/>the Policy which was prevailing and was in force at the time <lb/>when the application was presented by the applicant after <lb/>attaining the age of majority would be relevant and <lb/>applicable to such an applicant and the policy which was <lb/>governing the field at the time of the death of the employee <lb/>would be of no consequence. To dilate further, the said <lb/>applicants would become eligible, as per the Policy and the <lb/>Rules occupying the field, at the time of attaining the age of <lb/>majority. <lb/>Clause-8 of the Policy, in hand, provides <lb/>mechanism, which is pari materia to Clause 3.2 of the <lb/>Scheme discussed by the Apex Court in the case of Canara <lb/>Bank v.

			<body>reproduced above, is the complete answer to the question in <lb/>hand. <lb/>91. <lb/>The point stands answered accordingly. <lb/>Point No.(viii): Whether requisite qualification or age <lb/>can be relaxed? <lb/>92. <lb/>For making appointment against public posts, <lb/>possessing minimum educational qualification is one of the <lb/>essential conditions and that condition cannot be relaxed. <lb/>However, Clause 7 of the Policy, dated 18 th January, 1990, <lb/>deals with the &quot;Extent of relaxation and power to make <lb/>relaxation&quot;. Sub Clause (c) of Clause 7 deals with granting <lb/>relaxation in educational qualification to those aspirants who <lb/>are seeking appointment against a Class-IV post. <lb/>It is <lb/>provided in the said Sub Clause that in genuine cases, the <lb/>condition of possessing minimum educational qualification <lb/>can be relaxed with the prior approval of the Cabinet. A <lb/>distinction has also been carved out in the cases where the <lb/>widows of the deceased employee are seeking appointment <lb/>against Class-IV posts and in those cases, the relaxation in <lb/></body>

			<body>educational qualification can be provided by the concerned <lb/>Administrative Department. <lb/>93. <lb/>Similarly, Sub Clause (d) of Clause 7 provides that <lb/>age relaxation would not be allowed. However, the genuine <lb/>cases would be placed before the Cabinet for allowing age <lb/>relaxation. <lb/>94. <lb/>Thus, it is amply clear from the reading of Clause <lb/>7(c) and (d) of the Policy that relaxation in educational <lb/>qualification or age can be granted, subject to approval by <lb/>the Authority, as prescribed therein, only when the <lb/>appointment is to be made against Class-IV post. <lb/>95. <lb/>The said Clause 7 of the Policy was amended vide <lb/>office order, dated 25 th April, 1991, and it was provided that in <lb/>those cases where appointment on compassionate ground <lb/>was claimed against a Class-IV post, by seeking relaxation in <lb/>respect of educational qualification or age, the concerned <lb/>Administrative Department would have the power to grant <lb/>such relaxation. In the matters, other than those, the power <lb/>of relaxation was vested with the Chief Minister. <lb/></body>

			<body>96. <lb/>Fixing the eligibility criteria for a particular post falls <lb/>under the domain of the legislature/executive and power to <lb/>relax the same also lies with the said Authority. Our this view is <lb/>fortified by the decision of the Apex Court in State of Gujarat <lb/>&amp; Ors. vs. Arvindkumar T. Tiwari and Anr., 2012 AIR SCW 5131. <lb/>It is apt to reproduce paragraphs 8 and 9 of the said decision <lb/>hereunder: <lb/>&quot;8. The courts and tribunal do not have the power to <lb/>issue direction to make appointment by way of granting <lb/>relaxation of eligibility or in contravention thereof. In <lb/>State of M.P. &amp; Anr. v. Dharam Bir, 1998 6 SCC 165, this <lb/>Court while dealing with a similar issue rejected the plea <lb/>of humanitarian grounds and held as under: <lb/>&quot;The courts as also the tribunal have no power to <lb/>override the mandatory provisions of the Rules on <lb/>sympathetic consideration that a person, though <lb/>not <lb/>possessing <lb/>the <lb/>essential <lb/>educational <lb/>qualifications, should be allowed to continue on <lb/>the post merely on the basis of his experience. <lb/>Such an order would amount to altering or <lb/>amending the statutory provisions made by the <lb/>Government under Article 309 of the Constitution.&quot; <lb/>9. Fixing eligibility for a particular post or even for <lb/>admission to a course falls within the exclusive domain <lb/>of the legislature/executive and cannot be the subject <lb/>matter of judicial review, unless found to be arbitrary, <lb/>unreasonable or has been fixed without keeping in mind <lb/></body>

It is <lb/>apt to reproduce paragraphs 8 and 9 of the said decision <lb/>hereunder: <lb/>&quot;8. It is not a matter of dispute, that the Government of <lb/>Gujarat, in its General Administration Department, <lb/>issued a notification dated 16-3-2005 laying down <lb/>eligibility conditions for appointment in different Class-IV <lb/>posts. Insofar as the eligibility for direct recruitment is <lb/>concerned, the same is stipulated in Rule 3 of the afore-<lb/>stated rules, which is being extracted hereunder: <lb/>&quot;3. To be eligible for appointment by direct selection <lb/>to the post mentioned in Rule 2, a candidate shall:-<lb/>(i) not be less than 18 years and not more than 25 <lb/>years of age; <lb/>(ii) have passed Secondary School Certificate <lb/>Examination. <lb/>(iii) Possesses skills relevant to the job as may be <lb/>prescribed by Government from time to time.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis is ours) <lb/>A perusal of Rule 3(ii) indicates, that to be eligible <lb/>for appointment by direct recruitment against a Class-IV <lb/>posts, the concerned candidate should possess the <lb/>&quot;secondary school certificate&quot;. It is therefore apparent, <lb/>that eligibility for appointment on compassionate <lb/>grounds, under resolution dated 10-3-2000, after 16-3-<lb/></body>

			<body>2005 (when the aforesaid notification in respect of <lb/>recruitment to class IV posts was issued), requires to <lb/>possess the qualification stipulated therein, i.e., <lb/>&quot;secondary school certificate&quot; qualification. <lb/>9. It is not a matter of dispute, that the respondent has <lb/>possessed only the qualification of IV standard, and <lb/>does not possess the qualification of &quot;secondary school <lb/>certificate&quot; examination, as has been postulated in Rule <lb/>3(ii) of the notification dated 16-3-2005. It is therefore <lb/>imperative for us to conclude, that the respondent was <lb/>not qualified for appointment against a class-IV posts, <lb/>when her husband died in harness on 13-6-2006. When <lb/>the respondent applied for appointment on <lb/>compassionate grounds on 17-7-2006, it was necessary <lb/>for her, to fulfil the qualification stipulated in the <lb/>notification dated 16-3-2005. Since, admittedly the <lb/>respondent did not fulfil the aforesaid qualification, she <lb/>was <lb/>not <lb/>eligible <lb/>to claim <lb/>appointment <lb/>on <lb/>compassionate grounds, under the resolution dated 10-<lb/>3-2000.&quot; <lb/>98. <lb/>Thus, it is clear from the perusal of the above <lb/>decision that no relaxation can be granted in educational <lb/>qualification.

			<body>reproduce the relevant portion of paragraph 6, of the said <lb/>decision hereunder: <lb/>&quot;………………..So far as the question of gainful <lb/>employment of the elder brother is concerned, we find <lb/>that it had been given out that he has been engaged <lb/>in cultivation. We hardly find that it could be considered <lb/>as gainful employment if the family owns a piece of <lb/>land and one of the members of the family cultivates <lb/>the field. This statement is said to have been <lb/>contradicted when it is said that the elder brother had <lb/>stated that he works as a painter. This would not <lb/>necessarily be a contradiction much less leading to the <lb/>inference drawn that he was gainfully employed <lb/>somewhere as a painter. He might be working in his field <lb/>and might casually be getting work as painter also. <lb/>Nothing has been indicated in the enquiry report as to <lb/>where he was employed as a regular painter. The other <lb/>aspects, on which the officer was required to make <lb/>enquiries, have been conveniently omitted and not a <lb/>whisper is found in the report submitted by the officer. In <lb/>the above circumstances, in our view, the orders passed <lb/>by the High Court are not sustainable. The respondents <lb/>have wrongly refused compassionate appointment to <lb/>the appellant. The inference of gainful employment of <lb/>the elder brother could not be acted upon. The terminal <lb/></body>

In the interregnum, she <lb/>got married. As per the Policy of the respondents, compassionate <lb/>employment can be granted to an unmarried daughter of the <lb/>deceased. <lb/>Therefore, her case was rightly rejected by the <lb/>respondents. <lb/>169. <lb/>Having said so, there is no merit in the writ petition and <lb/>the same is dismissed. <lb/>CWP No.142 of 2013 <lb/>170. <lb/>As averred, the facts of the case are that the father of <lb/>the petitioner, who was working as Field Assistant, died in harness <lb/>on 16.6.2004. In the year 2003, the father of the petitioner had <lb/>applied for retirement on medical grounds, which request <lb/>remained pending with the department till his death. After the <lb/>death of the employee, the petitioner filed application for <lb/>compassionate appointment, which was rejected by the <lb/>department on the ground that since the deceased-employee <lb/>had crossed the age as prescribed under Rule 38 of the CCS <lb/>(Pension) Rules, 1972, therefore, the petitioner cannot claim <lb/>appointment on compassionate ground. <lb/></body>

			<body>171. <lb/>Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner had approached this <lb/>Court by way of writ petition and in the reply to the said writ <lb/>petition, the respondents admitted that the father of the petitioner <lb/>was in service till his death. Therefore, the writ petition was <lb/>disposed of with a direction to the respondents to reconsider the <lb/>matter of the petitioner. However, the respondents again rejected <lb/>the claim of the petitioner on the same ground. <lb/>172. <lb/>Thus, the petitioner, by way of the instant petition, has <lb/>sought writ of certiorari for quashing Annexure P-8, whereby the <lb/>claim of the petitioner came to be rejected. The petitioner has <lb/>also sought writ of mandamus commanding the respondents to <lb/>appoint him on compassionate ground. <lb/>173. <lb/>Respondents have resisted the writ petition by filing the <lb/>reply. <lb/>174. <lb/>Precisely, the ground pressed into service by the <lb/>respondents while rejecting the claim of the petitioner is that the <lb/>deceased had crossed the requisite age as per the Policy <lb/>occupying the field. <lb/>175. <lb/>Clause 2(d) of the policy stipulates that employment <lb/>assistance shall be provided to those government servants (Class-III <lb/>and Class-IV only), who retire on medical grounds, provided the <lb/></body>

Accordingly, there is no merit in the writ petition <lb/>and the same is dismissed. <lb/>CWP No.10024 of 2012 <lb/>178. <lb/>Father of the petitioner was working as Shastri teacher <lb/>and died in harness on 9.9.1987.

The <lb/>petitioner was offered appointment on compassionate ground <lb/>against the post of Clerk in the year 1990 and he joined against the <lb/>said post without any protest. Now, he cannot claim appointment <lb/>as Ayurvedic Chikitsa Adhikari. Moreover, allowing the claim of <lb/>the petitioner would affect the seniority of the persons who had <lb/>already joined as <lb/>Ayurvedic Chikitsa Adhikari prior to his <lb/>appointment in the said cadre. <lb/>The writ petition is also not <lb/>maintainable in view of the findings recorded by us on points <lb/>No.(iv), (v) and (vi), supra. <lb/>180. <lb/>Accordingly, it is held that there is no merit in the writ <lb/>petition and the same is dismissed. <lb/>CWP No.5753 of 2012 <lb/></body>

			<body>181. <lb/>Father of the petitioner, who was serving as Head <lb/>Constable, died on 25.6.2005, while in service. The petitioner <lb/>applied for the post of Clerk on compassionate ground. It is further <lb/>pleaded that respondent No.2 issued an advertisement for <lb/>recruitment of Constables for which the petitioner applied. The <lb/>petitioner appeared in the efficiency test, written examination and <lb/>personality test and qualified the same and figured at Serial No.5 <lb/>of the waiting list. Respondents did not consider his name for <lb/>appointment as Constable against 5% quota prescribed in the <lb/>Policy for compassionate employment. Accordingly, the petitioner <lb/>filed a writ petition, which was disposed of by providing that in <lb/>case the petitioner files fresh representation expressing willingness <lb/>to serve anywhere in the State and vacancy being available <lb/>against 5% quota, the name of the petitioner shall be considered <lb/>for such appointment. <lb/>Thereafter, the petitioner filed <lb/>representation on 24.7.2011 (P-11), which was rejected on <lb/>20.3.2012 (P-12) on the ground that the department was <lb/>considering the cases of widows, secondly on the ground of <lb/>income criteria and thirdly the name of the petitioner figures at <lb/>Serial No.46 of the priority list maintained for offering appointment <lb/>on compassionate ground against the post of Clerk and he cannot <lb/>be considered in preference to the persons above him. <lb/></body>

It is further pleaded in the <lb/>reply that the family of the deceased-employee was not found to <lb/>be in indigent circumstances which required immediate <lb/>employment assistance on compassionate ground. It was also <lb/>pleaded that the petitioner had initially applied for being <lb/>appointed on compassionate ground against the post of Clerk, <lb/>therefore, he cannot claim that his case be also considered for <lb/>appointment against the post of Constable. <lb/>184. <lb/>In view of the reply filed by the respondents, it is clear <lb/>that there was no post reserved under 5% quota for the <lb/>dependant of the deceased-employee, who died in harness, <lb/>against which the petitioner is seeking appointment.

Vide <lb/>letter dated 9.9.2009, it was intimated to the petitioner that her <lb/>case cannot be considered in view of the decision of Board of <lb/>Directors taken on 26.6.2008. It is averred that copy of the FIR <lb/>(Annexure P-3) shows that there was no eye witness of the <lb/>accident and the police had also not made any investigation with <lb/>respect to the cause of the accident. Thus, cause of accident <lb/>cannot be attributed to the husband of the petitioner and the <lb/>action of the respondents in declining employment to the <lb/>petitioner on this ground is wrong. Hence, the writ petition. <lb/>186. <lb/>In the reply filed by the respondents it has been <lb/>pleaded that since the accident in question had taken place due <lb/>to the negligence on the part of the deceased-employee, <lb/>therefore, as per the decision of the Board of Directors of the <lb/>respondent-Corporation, the claim of the petitioner was rightly <lb/></body>

The writ petition has also been resisted on other grounds, <lb/>such as, the appointment on compassionate ground cannot be <lb/>claimed as a matter of right and the appointment is to be given <lb/>only in those cases where the family of the deceased was living in <lb/>indigent circumstances. <lb/>187. <lb/>There is nothing on the record, from a perusal of which <lb/>it could be inferred that the respondents have ever inquired into <lb/>the cause of accident and on the basis of such inquiry, have <lb/>concluded that the accident, in question, had taken place due to <lb/>the negligence on the part of the husband of the petitioner. <lb/>188. <lb/>Thus, the writ petition is allowed, the impugned order is <lb/>set aside and the respondents are directed to reconsider the case <lb/>of the petitioner afresh in light of the Policy and the findings <lb/>recorded on points No.(i) to (ix) hereinabove. <lb/>CWP No.3486 of 2012 <lb/>189. <lb/>Husband of the petitioner died on 7.7.2009 while <lb/>working as water carrier-cum-cook with the respondent <lb/>department on daily wage basis.

As far as <lb/>the relief of granting other service benefits is concerned, the <lb/>petitioner is at liberty to pursue that claim independently, if <lb/>advised. <lb/>CWP No.9140 of 2014 <lb/>195. <lb/>Petitioner, being son of deceased employee, who was <lb/>serving in the respondent Department as Forest Worker, applied for <lb/>compassionate appointment as Chowkidar vide representation <lb/>Annexure P-2, which representation is stated to be pending with <lb/>the respondents. Thus, the petitioner prayed for directions to the <lb/>respondents to offer him appointment against the post of <lb/>Chowkidar. <lb/>196. <lb/>The respondents in the reply have stated that vide <lb/>letter No.FFE-A(E)2-85/2014, dated 26 th February, 2015, sanction has <lb/>been accorded for extending employment assistance on <lb/>compassionate ground in favour of the petitioner against a Class-<lb/>IV post on daily wage basis. <lb/></body>

			<body>197. <lb/>Therefore, in view of the reply filed by the respondents, <lb/>nothing survives in the writ petition and the same is disposed of as <lb/>such. <lb/>CWP No.7805 of 2014: <lb/>198. <lb/>The father of the petitioner, while on duty and <lb/>repairing HRTC bus, got seriously injured and suffered 100% disability <lb/>and thus sought retirement on medical grounds and prayed that <lb/>his son i.e. the petitioner be provided job, which request of retiring <lb/>the father of the petitioner was accepted by the Corporation on <lb/>13 th May, 2014. However, the request for providing employment to <lb/>the petitioner was rejected vide letter dated 3 rd May, 2014, <lb/>(Annexure P-4). Thus, the petitioner has prayed that the letter, <lb/>dated 3 rd May, 2014, (Annexure P-4), whereby he has been denied <lb/>employment on compassionate ground, be quashed. <lb/>199. <lb/>No reply has been filed. <lb/>200. <lb/>From the facts of the case, it is apparent that the <lb/>father of the petitioner suffered 100% disability while discharging his <lb/>duties. Therefore, it was incumbent upon the respondents not to <lb/>reject the request of the petitioner for grant of appointment on <lb/>compassionate ground in a cursory manner. Rather, the fact that <lb/>the father of the petitioner suffered the injury while performing his <lb/>duties ought to have been kept in mind by the respondents. <lb/></body>

The appellants <lb/>have challenged the impugned judgments mainly on the ground <lb/>that the learned Single Judge has erred in directing the appellants <lb/>to offer appointment to the writ petitioners on regular basis from <lb/>due date with all consequential benefits since the writ petitioners <lb/>were offered appointment on daily wage basis as per the Policy in <lb/>vogue and the petitioners also joined against the said posts <lb/>without any protest. <lb/></body>

The writ petitioner filed application for <lb/>granting compassionate appointment, which was not adhered to <lb/>on the ground that the family of the petitioner was not in indigent <lb/>circumstances as the mother of the petitioner was drawing family <lb/>pension to the tune Rs.16,918/-per month. Another ground of <lb/>rejection was that the existing policy provided for employment <lb/>either to the widow of the deceased employee or to an orphan. <lb/>The learned Single Judge, after dilating on the judgments passed <lb/>by the Apex Court, held that the stand of the writ respondents was <lb/></body>

			<body>respondents (appellants herein) be directed to consider the case <lb/>of the petitioner for being appointed against a Class-III post. <lb/>209. <lb/>It is worthwhile to mention here that In CWP No.1343 of <lb/>2012, the petitioner was appointed as Beldar on daily wage basis, <lb/>on compassionate ground. The petitioner, by the medium of the <lb/>writ petition, sought direction to the respondents to give him <lb/>appointment against the post of Clerk.

Consequently, the writ petition is dismissed. <lb/>211. <lb/>Before parting with, we may place on record that the <lb/>aim and object of providing employment assistance on <lb/>compassionate ground is to immediately enable the dependants <lb/>of an employee to tide over the sudden financial constraints on <lb/>the death of their bread-earner. <lb/>Thus, the source of such <lb/>employment is purely based on humanitarian grounds taking into <lb/>consideration the fact that unless some source of livelihood is <lb/>provided, the family would not be able to make both ends meet. <lb/></body>
