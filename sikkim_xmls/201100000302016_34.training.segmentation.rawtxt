1. 
The discontentment of the Petitioners arises on account 

of their appointment and retention on Officiating basis from 

08.05.2008 in the posts of Accounts Officers despite alleged 

existing Substantive vacancies, confirming them in the posts only 

on 16.03.2013, thus, depriving them of regular Promotion and 

Service Seniority, as against the Respondents No.7 to 17 directly 

recruited as Accounts Officers in January/February, 2009, who 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

2 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

have been ranked higher than the Petitioners in the inter se 

Seniority. 

1.(a) 
They are further aggrieved that the Respondents No.4, 

5 and 6, who had appeared in the same Departmental Examination 

as them in the year 1997, were promoted on 24.12.1997 as Senior 

Accountants from the Panel prepared for such Promotion. On 

05.02.2005, the same Respondents were further promoted as 

Accounts Officers on Officiating capacity while the Petitioners No.1, 

2 and 8 despite possessing similar requisite qualifying years of 

Service, were excluded citing lack of vacancy. The said 

Respondents were promoted on Substantive capacity as Accounts 

Officers on 21.01.2009 and as Senior Accounts Officers on 

Officiating basis on 11.02.2011. The Petitioners No.1 and 2 were 

promoted as Senior Accountants in 1998, the Petitioner No.8 in 

1999 and the remaining Petitioners only on 27.06.2000. 

1.(b) 
It is the Petitioners' case that they were, in fact, 

eligible for Promotion as Accounts Officers in 2004-2006 itself, 

having then put in the requisite years of Service required by the 

Rules as Senior Accountants. When the Cadre strength of Accounts 

Officers was 77 (seventy-seven), there were adequate vacancies to 

accommodate them in Substantive capacity, which would have 

made them seniors to the 11 (eleven) Direct Recruits who were 

appointed in January/February, 2009, allegedly from the same 

Cadre strength of 77 (seventy-seven) and promoted as Officiating 

Senior Accounts Officers on 11.01.2013 after only four years of 

Service, as against the required number of six years, mandated by 

the Rules. In December, 2008, the Cadre strength was increased 

from 77 (seventy-seven) to 103 (one hundred and three), resulting 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

3 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

in 26 (twenty-six) new vacancies but it was only on 16.03.2013, 

that the Petitioners were confirmed in the Substantive posts of 

Accounts Officers. The Petitioners No.1, 2 and 8 along with one 

M.R. Chettri, were promoted as Senior Accounts Officers on 

Officiating capacity on 22.05.2014, leaving out the remaining 

Petitioners who possessed the requisite qualification and merit. 

1.(c) 
The Petitioners speculate that had they been promoted 

as Accounts Officers in 2004-2006, by 2013, they could well have 

been promoted as Senior Accounts Officers in the 12 (twelve) 

vacancies in the said posts, but vide a Notification dated 

21.06.2013, these 12 (twelve) posts were downgraded to that of 

Accounts Officers, allegedly for the purpose of appointing Direct 

Recruits as Accounts Officers. Ultimately, no Direct Recruit came to 

be appointed to the downgraded posts but were then filled by way 

of Promotion. Thus, the policy of Promotions adopted by the State-

Respondents No.1, 2 and 3 has been prejudicial to the Petitioners. 

On approaching the Respondent No.3, their prayers were declined, 

while steps taken by the Respondent No.1 to mitigate their 

grievances on their request led to their confirmation in March, 

2013, by which time, the Respondents No.7 to 17 had already 

stolen a march against them in terms of Seniority. That, although 

Petitioners No.2 and 3 have retired during the pendency of the 

instant Writ Petition, they seek enforcement of their legal rights. 

1.(d) 
Hence, the prayers in the Petition, as extracted 

hereinbelow; 

"(i) 
A Rule upon the Government respondents to show-
cause as to why the petitioners" seniority in the rank 
of A.O. and Sr.A.O. shall not be protected and they 
be declared as seniors to the directly recruited 
respondent nos.7 to 17 with all service benefits in 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

the rank of A.O. and Sr.A.O. and upon hearing the 
parties to make the Rule absolute; 

(ii) 
A writ or order or direction or declaration that the 
petitioners are seniors to the respondent nos.7 to 
17 i.e. directly recruited A.O. and in the seniority list 
the petitioners" name be incorporated above those 
of respondent nos.7 to 17 in the said rank of A.O.; 

(iii) 
A writ or order or direction or declaration that the 
three petitioners namely petitioner nos.1, 2 and 8 
be deemed to be promoted as Sr.A.O. on the same 
date when respondent nos.7 to 17 were promoted 
as Sr.A.O. on officiating capacity with all service 
benefits; 

(iv) 
A writ or order or direction or declaration that the 
petitioners who were promoted as A.O. in 
substantive capacity on 16/3/13 be deemed to have 
promoted as such on 08/5/2008 when they were 
promoted as A.O. in officiating capacity without 
service benefits; 

(v) 
A writ or order or direction or declaration that the 
12 numbers of posts of Sr.A.O. which were 
downgraded vide Office Order dated 21/6/13 
(Annexure-P9) shall be set aside, quashed and 
cancelled. 

(vi) 
A writ or order or direction or declaration that the 
petitioners shall be given all benefits of service in 
the respective rank of A.O. and Sr. A.O. and they be 
placed senior over the respondent nos.7 to 17 in the 
seniority list in the said rank of A.O. and Sr.A.O. 

(vii) 
A writ or order or direction or declaration that the 
petitioners shall be given all benefits of service in 
the respective rank of A.O. and Sr.A.O. and they be 
placed in the seniority list above those of the 
respondent nos.7 to 17 in both the ranks. 

(viii) A writ or order or direction or declaration that the 
remaining seven petitioners namely petitioner nos.3 
to 7, 9 and 10 be also promoted in the rank of 
Sr.A.O. in substantive capacity before those of 
respondent nos.7 to 17; 

(ix) 
A writ or order or direction or declaration to follow 
the process of appointment/promotion between the 
petitioners and the respondent nos.7 to 17 on 50:50 
ratio i.e. 50% for inservice candidates i.e. 
petitioners and 50% for direct recruits i.e. the 
respondent nos.7 to 17. 

(ix)(a) 
A writ or order or direction or declaration 
declaring that the petitioner nos.2 and 3 
even after retirement in the service shall be 
entitled to get their legal rights pertaining to 
their incidental reliefs/service benefits which 
they would have got prior to their retirement 
in the event the petitioners succeed in the 
instant writ petition. 

(x)…………… 

(xi)……………" 

2.(i) 
While denying and disputing the averments of the 

Petitioners, the State-Respondents No.1, 2 and 3, in their joint 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

5 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

Counter-Affidavit, sought to explain that on 03.06.2003, the Cadre 

strength of the Accounts Officers were increased from 75 (seventy-

five) to 77 (seventy-seven). On the date of Cadre revision in 

December, 2008, 31 (thirty-one) persons were occupying the posts 

of Accounts Officers while 46 (forty-six) posts were vacant. 23 

(twenty-three) posts were to be filled by Direct Recruitment 

through Open Competitive Examination and 23 (twenty-three) by 

way of Promotion. Therefore, against the 23 (twenty-three) posts 

for Promotees, in fact, 55 (fifty-five) Officers were promoted and 

all were senior in rank to the Petitioners. No Direct Recruitment to 

the post of Accounts Officers in the 23 (twenty-three) vacant posts 

meant for Direct Recruits, took place during the said period, the 

last Direct Recruitment having been made in May, 2003. It was 

only on 16.07.2007 that the Respondent No.3 forwarded a 

requisition to the Sikkim Public Service Commission (for short 

"SPSC"), for filling up 11 (eleven) posts of Accounts Officers under 

the Sikkim Finance and Accounts Service Rules, 1978 (for brevity 

"Rules of 1978") by Direct Recruitment. Pending this proposal, 17 

(seventeen) Senior Accountants were promoted as Accounts 

Officers in Officiating capacity on 08.05.2008, subject to the 

conditions that the Officiating Promotion shall not confer any right 

for regular Promotion and shall not be counted towards Seniority 

and their regular Promotion shall be made on the recommendation 

of the SPSC, which were accepted by the Petitioners without 

demur. The amendment of the Rules of 1978 on 15.12.2008, 

increased the Cadre strength of Accounts Officers from 77 

(seventy-seven) to 103 (one hundred and three). On 08.04.2008, 

prior to the above amendment, the SPSC invited applications for 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

6 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

filling up of 11 (eleven) posts of Accounts Officers, consequently 11 

(eleven) Direct Recruits came to be appointed vide Orders dated 

31.01.2009, 02.02.2009 and 04.02.2009. Thus, the appointment of 

Respondents No.7 to 17 was against the Direct Recruitment Quota 

of 50 per cent of the Rules of 1978 and having been appointed in 

Substantive capacity, were made senior to the Petitioners who 

were promoted on Officiating capacity, as 20 (twenty) Officers 

senior to them were already working in Officiating capacity. That, 

Rule 24 Sub Clause 5 of the Sikkim Finance Accounts Service 

(Amendment) Rules, 1986 (hereinafter "Rules of 1986") provides 

for Rota Quota but the Government had considered the Promotion 

of Senior Accountants to the post of Accounts Officers from 

December, 2003 to June, 2007, duly utilizing Direct Recruitment 

Quota either on Officiating basis and then in Substantive capacity, 

or against Substantive capacity as and when vacancy existed, or 

against anticipated vacancies. 

(ii) 
Countering the allegation of the Petitioners being made 

junior to Respondents No.4, 5 and 6, it was explained that they 

were placed at Serial Nos.1, 2 and 3 amongst 19 (nineteen) 

candidates in the Departmental Examination held for Promotion 

which was subject to availability of vacancies, which occurred on 

24.12.1997. The validity of the Panel was extended up to 

31.12.1999 and the Petitioners No.1, 2 and 3 were promoted as 

Senior Accountants on 31.12.1998. Similarly, one D.R. Pradhan 

and the Petitioner No.8, were promoted on 22.05.1999. On 

14.06.1999, the Petitioners No.3, 4, 6, 7 and 9 submitted a 

Petition to the Government seeking extension of the Panel till 

finalization of anticipated vacancies of Senior Accountants. On due 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

7 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

consideration by the Government, these persons also came to be 

promoted as Senior Accountants on 27.06.2000. That, the Petition 

deserves a dismissal on grounds of delay and laches, as the Orders 

of the Petitioners pertaining to Officiating capacity was issued in 

2008 while the Writ Petition was filed only in 2016. 

3. 
The Respondents No.4, 5 and 6 filed their respective 

Counter-Affidavits which, in sum and substance, were similar to 

each other and substantially reiterated the facts as set out in the 

Counter-Affidavit of the Respondents No.1, 2 and 3. 

4. 
Respondents No.7 to 17, while denying and disputing 

the allegations made in the Writ Petition, reiterated the position of 

Quota and Rota as spelt out by the State-Respondents No.1, 2 and 

3 and averred that the prayers in the Petition are misconceived and 

liable to be rejected by this Court as also the Writ Petition. 

5. 
In Rejoinder, the Petitioners elucidated that by the time 

the Cadre was revised in the month of December 2008, around 14 

(fourteen) people had retired/expired which has not been 

addressed by the State-Respondents as they were aware that the 

Petitioners could well have been accommodated in the said 14 

(fourteen) vacancies. The names of the 14 (fourteen) persons who 

had retired/expired between 2003 to December 2008, were also 

detailed in the Rejoinder. 

6.(i) 
Advancing his arguments for the Petitioners, Learned 

Senior Counsel Mr. A. Moulik, while reiterating the averments made 

in the Writ Petition and the Rejoinder, contended that the State-

Respondents have attempted to prove that the Promotion of the 

Petitioners as Accounts Officers in Officiating capacity was merely a 

stop gap arrangement and a fortuitous appointment as such, their 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

8 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

past Services could not be counted for the purposes of rendering 

them senior to the private Respondents. Relying on the decision in 

D.R. Nim vs. Union of India 1 , it was canvassed that the Petitioners 

have worked in the post of Accounts Officers for several years and 

have never been reverted, hence they are entitled to Seniority 

from 08.05.2008, the date of their Officiating Orders in the posts of 

Accounts Officers. It was further contended that the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court has held in Rudra Kumar Sain and Others vs. Union of 

India and Others 2 that if an appointment is made to meet a 

particular contingency and for a specific period, then such an 

appointment is ad hoc or stop gap. On the other hand, if the post is 

created to meet a sudden and temporary situation then the 

appointment is fortuitous but these criterion are not attracted in 

the Order of the Petitioners, dated 08.05.2008. Drawing support 

from the decision in O.P. Singla and Another vs. Union of India and 

Others 3 , Learned Senior Counsel next contended that as per the 

said ratio, if a temporary employee works for five to twelve years 

continuously and the Appointment Order reads as "Until further 

orders" then such appointment cannot be termed as ad hoc or 

fortuitous or stop gap, so also is the case of the Petitioners. That, 

the two conditions laid out in the Officiating Promotion Order dated 

08.05.2008 were mere requirements. The Petitioners had indeed 

completed 6 (six) years of Service as Senior Accountants as 

required by the relevant Rules, making them eligible for Promotion 

as Accounts Officers in 2004/2006 itself. However, the Petitioners 

continued as Officiating Accounts Officers for years together due to

3 (1984) 4 SCC 450 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

9 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

inaction and negligence of the State-Respondents, thus the 

Petitioners have the right to claim Seniority over the private 

Respondents. On this count, reliance was placed on Baleshwar Dass 

and Others vs. State of U.P. and Others 4 . 

(ii) 
Canvassing the contention that there were sufficient 

vacancies in the Substantive posts in which the Petitioners could 

have been promoted on 08.05.2008 itself, Learned Senior Counsel 

pointed out that there were 10 (ten) vacancies in the rank of 

Accounts Officer when the Petitioners were promoted on Officiating 

basis on 08.05.2008, as the State-Respondents have claimed at 

Paragraph "5(d)" of their Counter-Affidavit that there were 46 

(forty-six) vacancies as on 01.07.2003 in the rank of Accounts 

Officer to be filled up, out of which 9 (nine) posts were filled up on 

19.12.2003, another 19 (nineteen) posts were filled up on 

20.02.2004 and 8 (eight) vacancies were filled up on 08.06.2006. 

Thus, up to 08.05.2008, only 36 (thirty-six) vacancies out of 46 

(forty-six) were filled up in the Substantive capacity and 10 (ten) 

vacancies were yet to be filled. Hence, it was erroneous to state 

that when the 10 (ten) Petitioners were promoted as Accounts 

Officers (Officiating), there was no vacancy. 

(iii) 
It was further contended that as on 03.06.2003, the 

Cadre Strength of Accounts Officers was 77 (seventy-seven) for 

which reliance was placed on Annexure R-2. As on 01.07.2003, the 

vacancies to be filled up out of 77 (seventy-seven) posts was 46 

(forty-six) for which, attention of this Court was invited to 

Annexure R-3. That, vide Annexure R-11 dated 15.12.2008, the 

Cadre Strength of Accounts Officers was increased from 77 

4 (1980) 4 SCC 226 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

10 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

(seventy-seven) to 103 (one hundred and three) thereby creating 

26 (twenty-six) new posts. Hence, as on the said date, total 

vacancies amounted to 72 (seventy-two) by adding the 46 (forty-

six) existing vacancies and 26 (twenty-six) newly created posts. 

That, 9 (nine) Senior Accountants were promoted as Accounts 

Officers on Substantive basis of which, 4 (four) retired/died before 

the Petitioners were promoted on 08.05.2008. Thereafter on 

20.02.2004, 19 (nineteen) Senior Accountants were promoted as 

Accounts Officers in Substantive capacity out of which, 8 (eight) 

persons retired. Vide Order dated 23.02.2004, 22 (twenty-two) 

persons were promoted as Accounts Officers who were later 

absorbed in Substantive posts vide different Orders through the 

years 2006, 2008 and 2009. Thus, out of the 72 (seventy-two) 

vacancies existing till 15.12.2008, 56 (fifty-six) vacancies were 

filled by 21.01.2009 and 16 (sixteen) vacancies were yet to be 

filled. That, the recruitment of Respondents No.7 to 17 was against 

non-existent vacancies. That, the 20 (twenty) senior most 

Accounts Officers had to be promoted out of the 26 (twenty-six) 

new vacancies of which, 6 (six) vacancies then remained in hand, 

in which Respondents No.7 to 17 could not be accommodated 

besides, the State-Respondents have not addressed the death or 

retirement of 14 (fourteen) Accounts Officers up to the end of 

2008, thereby creating vacancies by 2008 in addition to the stated 

72 (seventy-two) vacancies. 

(iv) 
That, the delay in approaching the Court is on account 

of the absence of any Seniority List and that there is still no 

Confirmation List as on date. On the point of delay, reliance was 

placed on Ram Nath Sao alias Ram Nath Sahu and Others vs. 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

11 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

Gobardhan Sao and Others 5 . Relying on proposition "(B)" of 

Paragraph "47" of the ratio in Direct Recruit Class II Engineering 

Officers' Association vs. State of Maharashtra and Others 6 , Learned 

Senior Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that in terms thereof, 

in the instant matter, even assuming that the initial appointment 

was not made by following the procedure prescribed, the 

Petitioners continued in Service uninterruptedly till regularization in 

accordance with the Rules, therefore the period of Officiating 

Service ought to be counted towards Seniority vis-à-vis the 

Respondents No.7 to 17. The Petitioners could have been 

confirmed in 2006 and 2008 in the existing vacancies. The 

Petitioners have been deprived of Promotion in their right time and 

have been kept on Officiating basis when they are entitled to 

Seniority over the Respondents No.7 to 17. Garnering strength 

from the ratio of Narender Chadha vs. Union of India 7 , it was stated 

that the Petitioners' case is comparable to the said ratio as the 

Petitioners were qualified to fill the posts. To further reinforce his 

submissions, reliance was placed on the decisions in S.B. 

Patwardhan and Another vs. State of Maharashtra and Others 8 , Pran 

Krishna Goswami and Others vs. State of West Bengal and Others 9 , G.K. 

Dudani and Others vs. S.D. Sharma and Others 10 , G.C. Gupta and Others 

vs. N.K. Pandey and Others 11 , M.V. Krishna Rao and Others vs. Union of

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

7. 
Learned Additional Advocate General, Dr. (Mrs.) Doma 

T. Bhutia, for the State-Respondents No.1 to 3, per contra, 

contended that once the Petitioners have accepted the Officiating 

Promotion along with the conditions therein without demur, it 

tantamounts to their acceptance of the conditions and hence, they 

have waived their rights pertaining to Seniority as they failed to 

raise any issue on this point, at the relevant time. Towards this 

point, reliance was placed on P.S. Gopinathan vs. State of Kerala and 

Others 14 . Drawing strength from the ratio in Rajen Kumar Chettri vs. 

State of Sikkim and Others 15 , it was contended that the Petition has 

been filed belatedly and for this reason, cannot be sustained. That, 

there were no vacancies in the Quota for Promotees when the 

Petitioners were promoted on Officiating basis and their claim for 

Seniority is unsubstantiated and stale. On this count, reliance was 

placed on B.S. Sheshagiri Setty and Others vs. State of Karnataka and 

Others 16 . That, Seniority can be reckoned only from the date that 

the Petitioners entered the Service in Substantive posts and not 

retrospectively. Contending that the Promotees cannot be 

accommodated in the Quota meant for the Direct Recruits, thus 

resulting in the Officiating Promotion of the Petitioners, reliance 

was placed on Nani Sha and Others vs. State of Arunachal Pradesh and 

Others 17 . That, the Petition is hit by laches and delay, this aspect of 

the argument was buttressed by Union of India and Others vs. M.K. 

Sarkar 18 . Relying on the facts and circumstances as detailed in the

WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

13 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

Counter-Affidavit, it was contended that the Petition deserves a 

dismissal. 

8. 
Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Karma Thinlay, for 

Respondents No.4, 5 and 6 reiterated and relied on the averments 

made in their Return and submitted that they were promoted as 

Accounts Officers on Officiating capacity in the year 2005 and were 

confirmed in the year 2009. That, should the Petitioners be granted 

reliefs in terms of Seniority from 2008, the cascading effect 

thereon would be to the benefit of the Respondents No.4, 5 and 6, 

who would also then be eligible for Seniority from the year 2005. 

That, 46 (forty-six) vacant posts of Accounts Officers existed in 

2003 and the Officiating Order of the Respondents No.4, 5 and 6 

was issued when the 46 (forty-six) posts were vacant. In fact, out 

of the 77 (seventy-seven) posts of Accounts Officers at the 

relevant time, 31 (thirty-one) were filled and against the 46 (forty-

six) vacancies, Respondents No.4, 5 and 6 had been appointed on 

Officiating basis on 05.02.2005 and confirmed on 21.01.2009. 

Respondents No.4, 5 and 6 are therefore senior to the Petitioners. 

That, the Petition being devoid of merit ought to be dismissed. 

9.(i) 
Learned Senior Advocate Mr. J.B. Pradhan, on behalf of 

Respondents No.7 to 17, building his arguments on the edifice of 

Rule 24 (5) of the Rules of 1986, pointed out that the said Rule 

provides that the relative Seniority inter se of persons recruited to 

the Service through Competitive Examination and by Promotion, 

shall be determined according to the rotation of vacancies between 

Direct Recruits and Promotees which shall be based on the Quotas 

of vacancies reserved for Direct Recruitment and Promotion 

respectively. That, the said Rule also provides in the "Explanation" 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

14 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

that "a Roster shall be maintained based on the reservation for Direct 

Recruitment and Promotion in the Rules, which shall be as follows; (1) 

Promotion (2) Direct Recruitment (3) Promotion (4) Direct Recruitment 

and so on. Appointment shall be made in accordance with this Roster and 

Seniority determined accordingly." Therefore, the Petitioners cannot 

be promoted in the Quota of the Direct Recruits, in excess to their 

own Quota. That, this position is fortified by Schedule II to the 

same Rules, which provides for 50 per cent by Direct Recruitment 

through Open Competitive Examination and 50 per cent by 

Promotion 
through 
Limited 
Departmental 
Competitive 

Examination/Deputation/Re-employment. 
Attention 
was 
also 

invited to Rules 6 and 16 of the Rules supra. That, as per the Office 

Note Sheet dated 30.06.2003, out of 77 (seventy-seven) numbers 

of Posts of Accounts Officers in the Junior Grade in the year 2003, 

46 (forty-six) Posts were vacant. In terms of Schedule II of the 

Rules of 1986, 46 (forty-six) Posts were to be equally divided 

between Promotees and Direct Recruits, however, between the 

years 2003 up to 2008, no appointments by way of Direct 

Recruitment were made, whereas the 23 (twenty-three) posts for 

Promotees was duly filled up and exceeded as well. Learned Senior 

Counsel contended that when the Petitioners were promoted on 

Officiating basis on 08.05.2008, there was no Substantive posts 

neither were the Rules relaxed then by any executive Order. It was 

only on 19.05.2012 that a Notification pertaining to relaxation of 

Rules was published. The State-Respondent No.3 sent the Letter of 

recommendation for appointment of the Petitioners only on 

13.09.2012 to the SPSC, upon which the Departmental Promotion 

Committee of the SPSC convened on 24.01.2013 and accepted the 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

15 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

recommendations. The Petitioners were then promoted to the 

Substantive posts of Accounts Officers only after 24.01.2013, 

whereas the Respondents No.7 to 17 were appointed in 

Substantive posts between 31.01.2009 to 04.02.2009 thereby 

rendering them senior to the Petitioners in terms of Rule 24 supra. 

Inviting the attention of this Court to the ratio in State of W.B. and 

Others vs. Aghore Nath Dey and Others (supra) wherein the dispute 

arose as a result of Promotions being made in excess of the 

Promotees Quota in the case of the surplus Promotees, it was 

contended that even if it is to be presumed that the Rules were 

relaxed, the relaxation can only be effective from the date of 

issuance of Notification by the Government in this context, i.e. in 

the case of the Petitioners from 19.05.2012, if not from 

16.03.2013 which is the correct approach and would still render 

them subordinate to Respondents No.7 to 17. 

(ii) 
That, the amendments to the Rules of 1978, notified on 

25.02.1987, are relevant which provides at Rule 6 that competitive 

examination was to be held by the Commission and the number of 

vacancies to be filled up by Promotion, Deputation or Re-

employment in one year, would not exceed 50 per cent of the total 

number of vacancies to be filled in that year. Pointing to the 

alleged incongruities in the grounds raised by the Petitioners, more 

especially in Grounds No.1, 2, 5, 8 and 11, Learned Senior Counsel 

contended that the Petitioners have approached the Court 

belatedly as they seek to challenge the appointment of 

Respondents No.7 to 17 after a period of 8 (eight) years of their 

appointment as Accounts Officers and that of Respondents No.4 to 

6 after a period of 19 (nineteen) years from the date they were 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

16 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

appointed as Senior Accountants. That apart, it was a rather 

strange proposition that the Petitioners were claiming Service 

Seniority from the date of their Officiating Service despite the clear 

conditions specified in their Orders. These Orders were unassailed 

before the concerned authorities thereby barring the Petition by the 

principles of Waiver, Estoppel and Acquiescence, to buttress this 

submission reliance was placed on P.S. Gopinathan (supra) and M.P. 

Palanisamy and Others vs. A. Krishnan and Others 19 . Besides, the 

Petitioners cannot pick and choose parts of the Order favourable to 

them and reject the others, as held in M.P. Palanisamy (supra). 

That, the Rota Quota Rule was not broken but procedure 

prescribed therein was not followed, thus to utilize the Rota Quota 

Rule, the Notification pertaining to relaxation of Rules was issued 

on 19.05.2012 to enable regularization of the appointment of the 

Petitioners. That, in fact, the Rota Quota Rule breaks down only 

when efforts are made by the Government through advertisement 

inviting candidates for Direct Recruitment but fails to get 

candidates making such appointments an impossibility. It is then 

that the Government has to derive a method to deviate and see 

how the posts can be filled up. The Government is thus under an 

obligation to establish by documentary evidence that there were no 

suitable candidates for appointment by Direct Recruitment. 

Paragraph "5 (e)" of the State-Respondents' Counter-Affidavit 

indicates that no such effort was made. On this count, succour was 

drawn from the ratio in Suraj Parkash Gupta and Others vs. State of 

J&K and Others 20 and N.K. Chauhan and Others vs. State of Gujarat and 

19 (2009) 6 SCC 428 
20 (2000) 7 SCC 561 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

17 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

Others 21 . Further, support was garnered from the ratio in Union of 

India vs. Dharam Pal and Others 22 wherein it was observed that 

where the initial appointment is only ad hoc and not according to 

Rules and made as a stop gap arrangement, the period of 

Officiation in such post cannot be taken into account for 

considering the Seniority. That, even assuming that there were 

vacancies for the purposes of Promotion, the Petitioners were to 

have adhered to the procedure of appearing for Departmental 

Examinations and thereafter obtaining the recommendation of the 

SPSC, this was not done. Inviting the attention of this Court to 

Keshav Chandra Joshi and Others vs. Union of India and Others 23 and 

Samdup Tshering Bhutia vs. State of Sikkim and Others 24 , it was 

canvassed that the Officiating Promotion of the Petitioners was 

fortuitous appointments and the Direct Recruit Quota on which 

they were promoted, has to invariably revert back to the Direct 

Recruits for the next appointments. That, the Petitioners have 

themselves accepted by averments made in their Rejoinder that 

other Accounts Officers similarly circumstanced as them, were 

promoted in Substantive Capacity in the vacancies meant for both 

Promotees and Direct Recruits. Relying on the ratio of Direct Recruit 

Class II Engineering Officers' Association (supra), Learned Senior 

Counsel advanced the contention that the case of the Petitioners 

falls under the corollary of Proposition "(A)" in Paragraph "47" 

therein and not under proposition "(B)", as advanced by Learned 

Senior Counsel for the Petitioners. That, in view of the grounds 

21 (1977) 1 SCC 308 
22 (2009) 4 SCC 170 
23 (1992) Supp 1 SCC 272 
24 2017 SCC OnLine Sikk 153 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

18 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

canvassed, the Petition being devoid of merit deserves to be 

dismissed. 

10. 
In rebuttal, Learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioners, 

while agreeing with Learned Senior Counsel for Respondents No.7 

to 17 that the Rota Quota Rule had not broken down, submitted 

that initially due to filling up of the posts of Direct Recruits by the 

Promotees, there was a breakdown of the Rota Quota Rule but 

these appointments were subsequently regularized restoring the 

Rota Quota. That, no condition in the Officiating Order debarred 

the Petitioners from claiming Seniority from the date of Promotion 

in their Officiating capacity once they were regularized in the 

Substantive posts. That, the settled position of law is as laid down 

in Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers' Association (supra) by 

the Constitution Bench and this is applicable to the Petitioners' 

case. That, the ratio in Samdup Tshering Bhutia (supra) relied on by 

the Respondents No.7 to 17, is not relevant in the instant matter 

as the Court was not informed of the correct factual position and 

its conclusion for arriving at the finding that the appointment was 

fortuitous, was sans reasons. The question of the Petitioners 

accepting the Officiating Promotion without demur does not arise, 

they being mere employees and the State-Respondents were 

required to look after their welfare. That, the case of M.P. 

Palanisamy (supra) relied on by the Respondents No.7 to 17, is 

distinguishable from the instant facts and not applicable to the 

Petitioners' case as also the ratio in P.S. Gopinathan (supra) and 

hence the Petitioners are deserving of the reliefs prayed for. 

11. 
The rival submissions of Learned Counsel for the 

parties were heard in extenso by me and given due consideration. 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

19 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

The decisions relied on by Learned Counsel for the parties have 

also been perused as also the pleadings and all documents on 

record. 

12. 
The only question that falls for consideration before 

this Court is; 

Whether the fitment of Seniority determined by the 

Department vis-à-vis the Petitioners and the 

Respondents No.7 to 17, was in accordance with the 

Rules? 

13.(i) 
To assess with clarity the grievances of the Petitioners, 

it is essential to briefly refer to the Rules which govern them. The 

Sikkim Subordinate Accounts Service Rules, 1984 was notified on 

28.01.1985 and governs the posts of Accounts Clerk, Junior 

Accountant, Accountant and Senior Accountant. The Petitioners 

were initially appointed in Service under these Rules. The Rules of 

1978, notified on 30.04.1979, governs the appointment of 

Accounts Officers and Senior Accounts Officers consisting of three 

Grades i.e. Junior, Senior and Selection Grades. The said Rules 

comprised of thirteen Clauses including Rule 13 which is the 

interpretation Clause. Rule 3 provided inter alia for "Constitution of 

Service", Rule 4 was for "Appointments and Postings," Rule 5 detailed 

"Initial Constitution of the Service," Rule 6 laid down the "Method of 

Recruitment to the Service," Rule 7 was concerned with "Qualification 

for Appointment," Rule 8 dealt with "Constitution of Selection 

Committees." The Committee was to comprise of the Chairman, 

Sikkim Public Service Commission or his nominee, the Chief 

Secretary to the Government, the Finance Secretary and the 

Establishment Secretary to the Government and was entrusted 

with the task of grading persons mentioned in Rule 5, for 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

20 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

absorption in the various Grades of the Service and under Sub Rule 

(4) of Rule 6. The Committee was also to make recommendations 

for Direct Recruitments under Clause (i) of Rule 6 or Sub Rule (4) 

of Rule 6. Promotion of persons mentioned in Rule 6 (1) (iv) was 

also vested on the Committee. The recommendations of the 

Committee, as finally approved by the Commission, was to be 

forwarded to the Government along with all other papers sent to 

the Selection Committee. Rule 9 elucidated the "Training, Probation 

and Confirmation" of persons appointed, while Rule 10 laid the 

details of how "Seniority" was to be computed and provided that the 

persons deemed to have been appointed to the Service under Rule 

5 was to rank as senior to all those who may be appointed under 

Rule 6 and that, "The inter-se seniority of direct recruits and promotees 

shall be in the order in which their names appear in the merit/select list. 

As for seniority between promotees and direct recruits, persons promoted 

in one year shall rank senior to persons recruited direct in that year." 

Schedule I to the Rules detailed the strength and composition and 

designation of posts. It indicated 29 (twenty-nine) posts then in 

the Junior Grade i.e. that of Accounts Officers. 

(ii) 
The Rules came to be amended several times in the 

interregnum and twice in 1986, one vide Notification No.15/Fin. 

dated 11.03.1986 and vide Notification No.20/Fin. dated 

25.02.1987. Vide the amendment on 25.02.1987, the sanctioned 

strength of Accounts Officers was shown to be 43 (forty-three) in 

Schedule I. Rules 6 and 16 of the amended Rules are extracted 

hereinbelow; 

"Amendment of rules 

6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 

In the said rules, for rules 6, 
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, 
following 
rules 
shall 
be 
substituted, namely:-


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

21 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

"6. Method of Recruitment to the Service -(1) 

Subject to the provision of rules 5, recruitment to 
the Service shall, after the appointed day, be 
made by the following methods, namely:-

(i) 
Competitive Examination to be held by the 
Commission. 

(ii) 
Obtaining the services of any employee of the 
Central Government or other State Governments. 

(iii) Promotion 

from 
among 
persons 
holding 
substantive appointment in Grade I mentioned in 
Schedule II to the Sikkim Sub-ordinate 
Accounts 
Service Rules, 1984. 

(iv) Re-employment, after retirement of any person, 
who in the opinion of the Government is suitable for 
such re-employment. 

2. (i) Government shall ordinarily decide in each 

year the number of vacancies in the Service to be 
filled in that year by direct recruitment and 
also the number to be filled by promotion or by 
any other method mentioned in sub-rule (1). 

(ii) The number of vacancies to be filled up by 
promotion, deputation or re-employment in any 
one year shall not exceed 50 per cent of the 
total number of vacancies to be filled in that 
year." 
…………………………………………………………………………………… 

16. RECRUITMENT BY PROMOTION 

(1) 
…………………………………………………………………………………… 

(2) 

The Government shall, every year for the purpose of 
promotion to the Service under Clause (iii) of sub-
rule (1) of rule 6, prepare a list of names of persons 
in order of seniority who have, on the first day of 
that year, completed not less than six years of 
continuous service under the Government in a 
post included in Grade I mentioned in the Schedule 
II appended to the Sikkim Subordinate Accounts 
Service Rules, 1984. 

(3) 

The 
Government 
shall 
forward 
to 
the 
Commission the list of persons referred to in 
sub-rule (2) of this rule together with their 
character rolls and service records for the preceding 
five years indicating the anticipated number of 
vacancies to be filled by promotion in course of 
the period of 12 months commencing from the 
date of preparation of the list. 

(4) 

The 
Commission 
after 
satisfying 
themselves 
that the records and information complete in all 
respects have been received, shall convene a 
meeting 
of 
the 
Promotion 
Committee. 
The 
Committee shall prepare a final list of persons 
who are found to be suitable for promotion to 
the Service on an overall relative assessment of 
their service records and interview. 

(5) 
The number of persons to be included in the list 
shall not exceed twice the number of vacancies to 
be filled by promotion. 

(6) 

The Commission shall forward the final list 
prepared under sub-rule (4) of this rule to the 
Government along with all the character rolls 
and 
service 
records 
received 
from 
the 
Government. 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

22

(7) 

The list shall ordinarily be in force for a period of 
twelve 
months 
from 
the 
date 
of 
the 
recommendation of the Commission. 

(8) 

Appointment of persons included in the list to 
the service shall be made by the Government in the 
order in which the names of persons appear in the 
list. 

(9) 
It shall not be ordinarily necessary to consult 
the Commission before each appointment is 
made unless during the period of 12 months 
from the date of recommendation of the 
Commission there occurs 
deterioration in the 
work of the person which in the opinion of the 
Government, 
is 
such 
as 
to 
render 
him 
unsuitable for appointment to the service." 

(emphasis supplied) 

(iii) 
Schedule II referred to in Rule 16 (2) supra details the 

"Designation of Posts," "Method of Recruitment" and "Eligibility 

Conditions" of Selection Grade I, Selection Grade II, Senior Grade 

and Junior Grade. So far as the Junior Grade is concerned, it 

includes Accounts Officer/Accounts-cum-Administrative Officer/ 

Audit Officer and the "Method of Recruitment" is shown to be 50 per 

cent by Direct Recruitment through Open Competitive Examination 

and 50 per cent by Promotion through a Limited Departmental 

Competitive 
Examination/Deputation/Re-employment. 
The 

"Eligibility Conditions" for Promotion is reflected as follows, 

"SCHEDULE -II 
………………………………………………………………………………………. 

By Promotion: Persons holding posts in Grade-I of 
the Sikkim Subordinate Accounts Service with at least 6 
years of service in the grade. The promotion shall be made 
on the basis of seniority-cum-merit." 

(emphasis supplied) 

14. 
From a reading of the above Rules, it emerges that the 

posts of Accounts Officers were to be filled by way of Promotion 

and Direct Recruitment in the ratio of 50:50 each. The Petitioners 

were qualified as per the Rules in 2004-2006 as well as on 

08.05.2008, to be considered for Promotion as Accounts Officers. 

The Rules extracted supra required the State-Respondents to 

decide in each year, the number of vacancies in the Service to be 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

23 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

filled in that year by Direct Recruitment and Promotion and to take 

steps after assessing the vacancy, viz., including recommending 

the names of the Service holders for Promotion to Substantive 

Posts. The State-Respondents failed to comply with this 

requirement of the Rules nor were Examinations for either criteria 

held, as mandated. From the records available before this Court, it 

is clear that the procedure prescribed for recruitment was not 

adhered to by the State-Respondents which has, in fact, led to the 

heartburning amongst the Petitioners and the Direct Recruits 

concerning their inter se Seniority. Besides failing to take steps as 

enunciated hereinabove, the Government has not prepared a List 

of names of persons in order of Seniority (as per Rules) who have, 

on the first day of that year, completed not less than 6 (six) years 

of continuous Service as Senior Accountants nor was the List of 

such persons forwarded to the Commission along with the relevant 

documents. The anticipated number of vacancies to be filled by 

Promotion in the course of the period of 12 (twelve) months, 

commencing from the date of preparation of the List was not 

indicated as well. In the absence of necessary steps by the 

Government, it is evident that the Commission was not in a 

position to take consequential steps and convene a meeting of the 

Promotion Committee who had been vested with the responsibility 

of preparing a final List of persons found to be suitable for 

Promotion to the higher Service on an overall relative assessment 

of their Service Records and interview. 

15.(i) 
The State-Respondents have failed to enlighten this 

Court on the number of posts filled vide the two channels till 2009. 

Clearly, the Rules have been ignored and sidelined by the 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

24 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

Government and appointments to the posts of Accounts Officers 

made by Promotion only. By their own admission, Direct 

Recruitment had been kept in abeyance from December, 2003 to 

2007 and the post of Accounts Officer in the Junior Grade was filled 

only by Promotion. While considering the conduct of the State-

Respondents, it is apposite to refer to the observations made by 

the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Keshav Chandra Joshi (supra), 

wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court while faced with, once again 

the proposition of reckoning inter se Seniority, was alive to the 

lackadaisical attitude of the Government and inter alia held as 

follows; 

"22. In a democracy governed by rule of law, it is 

necessary for the appropriate governance of the country 
that the political executive should have the support of an 
efficient bureaucracy. Our Constitution enjoins upon the 
executive and charges the legislature to lay down the policy 
of administration in the light of the directive principles. The 
executive should implement them to establish the 
contemplated egalitarian social order envisaged in the 
preamble of the Constitution. 

…………………………………………………………………………………… 

24. It is notorious that confirmation of an employee 
in a substantive post would take place long years after the 
retirement. An employee is entitled to be considered for 
promotion on regular basis to a higher post if he/she is an 
approved probationer in the substantive lower post. An 
officer appointed by promotion in accordance with Rules 
and within quota and on declaration of probation is entitled 
to reckon his seniority from the date of promotion and the 
entire length of service, though initially temporary, shall be 
counted for seniority. Ad hoc or fortuitous appointments on 
a temporary or stop gap basis cannot be taken into account 
for the purpose of seniority, even if the appointee was 
subsequently qualified to hold the post on a regular basis. 
To give benefit of such service would be contrary to 
equality enshrined in Article 14 read with Article 16(1) of 
the Constitution as unequals would be treated as equals. 

………" 

A similar attitude of the concerned Departments as indicated 

above, are reflected even in the facts and circumstances of the 

instant case by the nonchalant circumvention of the Rules by the 

State-Respondents. Besides, sloth takes away a man's welfare. 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

25 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

(ii) 

Rule 24 of the amended Rules of 1986 provides for 

"Seniority" and reads inter alia as follows; 

"24. SENIORITY: 

(1) The persons deemed to have been appointed to the 
Service under rule 5 shall rank as senior to all those who 
may be appointed under rule 6: 
Provided that……………………………………………………………… 
(2) 
………………… 
(3) The seniority inter-se of the persons recruited to the 
Service through competitive examination shall be in the 
same order in which their names appear in the merit list 
forwarded by the Commission under sub-rule (4) of rule 7. 

(4) The seniority inter-se of the persons appointed to the 
Service by promotion shall be in the same order in which 
their names appear in the list prepared under sub-rule (4) 
of rule 16 and forwarded by the Commission to the 
Government. 

(5) The relative seniority inter-se of persons recruited to 
the 
Service 
through 
competitive 
examination 
and 
appointed to the Service by promotion shall be determined 
according to the rotation of vacancies between direct 
recruits and promotees which shall be based on the quotas 
of vacancies reserved for direct recruitment and promotion 
respectively in these rules. 

Explanation:-A roster shall be maintained based on the 
reservation for direct recruitment and promotion in these 
rules. The roster shall run as follows:-

(1) 
Promotion, (2) Direct Recruitment, (3) Promotion, 
(4) Direct Recruitment and so on. 

Appointment shall be made in accordance with this 
roster and seniority determined accordingly. 

(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in rules 5 and 6, 
the seniority of persons mentioned in the third proviso to 
rule 5 and in clause (ii) of sub-rule (1) of rule 6, who are 
absorbed in the Service shall be such as may be 
determined by Government in each case." 

(emphasis supplied) 

(iii) 
These Rules, for the first time provided for a Roster 

System, for recruitment. Schedule II to the Rules elucidates that 

the Junior Grade comprising of Accounts Officers, is to be filled 50 

per cent by Direct Recruitment through Open Competitive 

Examination and 50 per cent by Promotion through Limited 

Departmental 
Competitive 
Examination/Deputation/Re-

employment. At this juncture, it is worth noticing that the State-

Respondents have not explained as to how the rotation of the 

Quota is fixed, is it to be construed as the Promotees getting the 

first, third and fifth of the vacancies that occur or was it by way of 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

26 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

entitlement of half the vacancies? The facts placed before this 

Court by the State-Respondents in this context, are opaque and do 

not reflect the method adopted by them. There is an absence of 

data to indicate the Quota Rota adopted up to May, 2003, when 

the last Direct Recruitment to the post of Accounts Officer allegedly 

took place. 

(iv) 
In 1988, the Rules were further amended and notified 

on 11.08.1988. Serial number "2" reads as follows; 

"2. Rules 6 Method of recruitment to the Service: 

In clause (iii) of sub-rule (i) of this rule add the following 

words at the end of the sentence:-"to be held by the 

Commission." 

(emphasis supplied) 

"Schedule I" of the existing Schedule was substituted by a new 

Schedule. As already pointed out, the Commission's hands were 

evidently tied in the absence of necessary and timely steps by the 

Government in terms of Rules 6 and 16 supra. By a Notification 

dated 29.06.1996, amending the Rules further, the post of 

Accounts Officer was indicated to be 73 (seventy-three). On 

26.08.1998, another amendment took place which stated inter alia 

as follows; 

"Amendment 

of Schedule II. 

2. In the Sikkim Finance and Accounts 
Service Rules, 1978, in Schedule-II, 
for the post of Accounts Officer/ 
Assistant 
Director/Accounts-cum-
Administrative Officer/Audit Officer, 
under 
the 
heading 
method 
of 
recruitment, for the figures and words 
"66% by direct recruitment and 34% by 
promotion", the figures and words 
"50% by direct recruitment and "50% 
by promotion" shall be substituted 
respectively." 

(v) 
Indeed, this amendment is superfluous, as the 

amended Rules of 1986, notified on 25.02.1985, at Schedule II, 

already indicated 50 per cent by Promotion and 50 percent by 

Direct Recruitment, besides, a careful scrutiny of the Rules placed 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

27 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

before this Court, nowhere indicates "66 per cent by Direct 

Recruitment and 34 per cent by Promotion." On 05.09.2001, vide a 

Notification of the same date, further amendment was made to the 

Rules which provided that "……in Schedule II, in serial No.4, under the 

column eligibility conditions for the figure "8; the figure "6" shall be 

substituted" which meant that Senior Accountants, would be eligible 

for Promotion to the post of Accounts Officers on putting in 6 (six) 

years of qualifying service instead of 8 (eight) years, as previously 

required. The Petitioners thus were in the zone of consideration for 

Promotion having indubitably completed 6 (six) years of Service as 

Senior Accountants by 2004/2006. On 03.06.2003, another 

amendment came to be made in the Rules vide which the post of 

Accounts Officer was increased to 77 (seventy-seven). However, as 

already pointed out, the State-Respondents were loath to take 

timely steps although the Rules made adequate provisions. 

16.(i) 
Notably, vide Notification dated 09.12.2003, the Rules 

of 1978 were further amended whereby "Rule 28," a provision for 

relaxation of the Rules, was inserted. The said Rule reads as 

follows; 

"28. Power to relax:-Where the Government is of 

the opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do, it 
may, by order, for reasons to be recorded in writing, relax 
any of the provisions of these rules with respect to any 
class or category or persons or post." 

(ii) 
The Rules of 1978 (unamended) contained no powers 

of relaxation save to the extent that in Rule 9, the Governor was 

given the prerogative of extending the period of probation of the 

Direct Recruits and the Promotees at his discretion, for any 

particular case or cases and was also empowered to exempt for 

reasons to be recorded from passing the Examination. On the point 

of relaxation and inter se Seniority, we may relevantly refer to the 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

28 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

decision in G.S. Lamba and Others vs. Union of India and Others 25 

decided by a two Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

wherein the relevant Rules provided for recruitment to the Indian 

Foreign Service from three different Services viz., (i) Direct 

Recruitment by Competitive Examination, (ii) Substantive 

appointment of persons included in the select list promoted on the 

basis of a Limited Competitive Examination and (iii) Promotion on 

the basis of Seniority. One of the Rules provided that a recruitment 

should be made from the above sources on the following basis: (i) 

One-sixth of the Substantive vacancies to be filled in by Direct 

Recruitment, (ii) 33 1/3 per cent of the remaining five-sixth of the 

vacancies to be filled on the basis of results of Limited Competitive 

Examinations, and (iii) the remaining vacancies to be filled in by 

Promotion on the basis of Seniority. The Hon'ble Court found that 

the Direct Recruitment had not been made for years, Limited 

Competitive Examination had also not been held for years and 

Promotions from the select list had been made in excess of the 

Quota. Thus, there was enormous departure from the Rules of 

recruitment in making appointments over several years. The 

Hon'ble Court was of the view that the situation was similar to the 

situation in two other earlier cases viz., A. Janardhana vs. Union of 

India and Others 26 and O.P. Singla (supra). It was opined that in the 

circumstances, it should be presumed that the excess appointment 

by Promotion had been made in relaxation of the Rules since there 

was power to relax the Rules. The Hon'ble Court held inter alia as 

follows; 

25 (1985) 2 SCC 604 
26 (1983) 3 SCC 601 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

29 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

"27. ……………………Therefore assuming there 

was failure to consult the Union Public Service 
Commission before exercising the power to relax the 
mandatory quota rule and further assuming that the 
posts in integrated Grade II and III were within the 
purview of the Union Public Service Commission and 
accepting for the time being that the Commission 
was not consulted before the power to relax the rule 
was exercised yet the action taken would not be 
vitiated nor would it furnish any help to Union of 
India which itself cannot take any advantage of its 
failure to consult the Commission. Therefore it can 
be safely stated that the enormous departure from 
the quota rule year to year permits an inference 
that the departure was in exercise of the power of 
relaxing the quota rule conferred on the controlling 
authority. Once there is power to relax the 
mandatory quota rule, the appointments made in 
excess of the quota from any given source would 
not be illegal or invalid but would be valid and legal 
as held by this Court in N.K. Chauhan v. State of 
Gujarat [(1977) 1 SCC 308 : (1977) 1 SCR 1037 : 
1977 SCC (L&S) 127] . Therefore the promotion of 
the promotees was regular and legal both on 
account of the fact that it was made to meet the 
exigencies of service in relaxation of the mandatory 
quota rule and the substantive vacancies in 
service." 

(iii) 
Similarly, in Narender Chadha (supra) decided by a two 

Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the question therein 

was of inter se Seniority between Direct Recruits and Promotees. 

Evidently, ad hoc or ex gratia Promotions were made in large 

numbers from feeder posts to continuously fill several vacancies 

allocated for Direct Recruits while only few Direct Recruitments 

were made in deliberate derogation of the Quota Rule. The 

Promotees, however, had continued in their ad hoc posts for fifteen 

to twenty years without being reverted to their original posts and 

without their right to hold the Promotion posts being questioned. 

The Departmental Promotion Committee, which was required to 

meet annually, in accordance with Rules and instructions, met only 

thrice in nineteen years and selected for Promotion only those 

Promotees who had four years of regular Service in their feeder 

posts, as on a specified date of several years back. The Hon'ble 

Supreme Court held that Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

30 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

were violated and all Promotees were entitled to regular Promotion. 

The Seniority of the Promotees including those selected by the 

Departmental Promotion Committee, was to be reckoned with 

effect from the dates of their continuous officiation in the 

Promotion posts. It was observed inter alia as follows; 

"15. At one stage it was argued before us on behalf 

of some of the respondents that the petitioners who have 
not been appointed in accordance with Rule 8(1)(a)(ii) 
could not be treated as members of the Indian Economic 
Service or of the Indian Statistical Service at all and hence 
there was no question of determining the question of 
seniority as between the petitioners and the direct recruits. 
This argument has got to be rejected. It is true that the 

petitioners were not promoted by following the actual 
procedure prescribed under Rule 8(1)(a)(ii) but the fact 
remains that they have been working in posts included in 
Grade IV from the date on which they were appointed to 
these posts. The appointments are made in the name of the 
President by the competent authority. They have been 
continuously holding these posts. They are being paid all 
along the salary and allowances payable to incumbents of 
such posts. They have not been asked to go back to the 
posts from which they were promoted at any time since the 

dates of their appointment. The order of promotion issued 
in some cases show that they are promoted in the direct 
line of their promotion. It is expressly admitted that the 
petitioners have been allowed to hold posts included in 
Grade IV of the aforesaid services, though on an ad hoc 
basis. ……………………………………………. But in a case of the kind 
before us where persons have been allowed to function in 
higher posts for 15 to 20 years with due deliberation it 
would be certainly unjust to hold that they have no sort of 
claim to such posts and could be reverted unceremoniously 
or treated as persons not belonging to the Service at all, 

particularly where the Government is endowed with the 

power to relax the rules to avoid unjust results. In the 
instant case the Government has also not expressed its 
unwillingness to continue them in the said posts. The other 
contesting respondents have also not urged that the 
petitioners should be sent out of the said posts. The only 
question agitated before us relates to the seniority as 
between the petitioners and the direct recruits and such a 
question can arise only where there is no dispute regarding 
the entry of the officers concerned into the same grade. In 
the instant case there is no impediment even under the 
Rules to treat these petitioners and others who are 
similarly situated as persons duly appointed to the posts in 
Grade IV because of the enabling provision contained in 
Rule 16 thereof. ………………………………………………………………..…. 
…………………………………………………………….…………………………………. 
17. ……………….Therefore it can be safely stated that 
the enormous departure from the quota rule year to year 
permits an inference that the departure was in exercise of 
the power of relaxing the quota rule conferred on the 
controlling authority. Once there is power to relax the 
mandatory quota rule, the appointments made in excess of 
the quota from any given source would not be illegal or 
invalid but would be valid and legal as held by this Court 
in N.K. Chauhan v. State of Gujarat………….."

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

(iv) 

On the bedrock of the principle expounded above, while 

considering the admitted departure from the Quota Rule and 

prescribed procedure of recruitment in the instant matter, it is a 

safe assumption that the appointments of the Petitioners if made in 

excess of the Service Quota were valid and legal in view of the 

existence of the Relaxation Clause at Rule 28 of the amended Rules 

of 1986. A presumption thus arises that Rule 28 was invoked 

legalizing and validating the Promotion of the Petitioners. I cannot 

bring myself to agree with the submissions of Learned Senior 

Counsel for Respondents No.7 to 17 that the relaxation would only 

come into effect from the date of Notification i.e. 19.05.2012, if not 

from 16.03.2013, the date of confirmation, for the reason that the 

Notification firstly does not specify the date of such relaxation, 

besides, Rule 28 was inserted vide the amendment dated 

09.12.2003 and therefore in existence when the Officiating Orders 

were issued on 08.05.2008. Thus, the inevitable conclusion is that 

the Relaxation Clause was invoked and effective from the date the 

Officiating appointment of the Petitioners were made to the posts 

of Accounts Officers i.e. from 08.05.2008. Conditions "1" and "2" 

inserted in the Officiating Order of the Petitioners are sans reasons, 

no Rules make provisions for insertion of such conditions. 

17.(i) 
Relevantly, the impact and purpose of the word 

"Officiating" in the case at hand, is to be considered. The 

Officiating Order, dated 08.05.2008, states that the Petitioners are 

promoted as Accounts Officers in Officiating capacity and the 

Officiating Promotion shall be subject to the following conditions: 

"1. 

The officiating promotion shall not confer any right 
for regular promotion and shall not be counted 
towards seniority. 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

32 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

2. 
Their regular promotion shall be made on the 
recommendation of the Sikkim Public Service 
Commission." 

Since the Rules of 1978 do not define "Officiating," we may refer to 

the Sikkim Government Service Rules, 1974 which, in Chapter II, 

Rule 13 provides as follows:-

"(13) 'Officiating appointment'.-A Government 

Servant is said to be holding an officiating appointment 
when he performs the duties of a vacant or newly created 
temporary post on which no Government Servant holds a 
lien without completing the minimum number of qualifying 
years of service as may have been or as may be prescribed 
by the Government from time to time." 

(ii) 
Rule 39 of the Sikkim Government Service Rules, 1974 

reads inter alia thus; 

"39. Officiating appointment.-

(1) A Government Servant may be appointed to 
officiate in a post carrying a higher time scale of pay if the 
vacancy is for a period exceeding one year 
(2) ………… 

(3) Officiating appointment shall continue till the 
Government Servant completes the minimum qualifying 
number of years as may have been or may be prescribed 
by the Government from time to time." 

(iii) 
Therefore, it is understood that a person appointed on 

Officiating basis is essentially a Government servant who has not 

completed the minimum number of qualifying years of Service 

prescribed by the Government from time to time and in a post 

which carries a higher time scale of pay, if the vacancy is for a 

period exceeding one year. The qualification necessary for the 

Petitioners to be considered for Promotion from Senior Accountant 

to Accounts Officer is 6 (six) years of continuous Service in the 

rank of Senior Accountant. It is not the case of the State-

Respondents that the Petitioners had not completed the qualifying 

years of Service or were lacking in any other field, which would 

render them eligible only for Officiating Promotion. That, having 

been said, while considering condition number "1." of the 

Officiating Order, dated 08.05.2008, it is in the first instance, 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

33 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

unfathomable since it states that the Officiating Promotion shall not 

confer any right for regular Promotion, in such a circumstance, is it 

to be construed that despite the person having put in the required 

years of Service, all other qualifications being met and Substantive 

vacant posts existing, he would still be deprived of his regular 

Promotion and would be sentenced to suffer the whims of the 

State-Respondents? The second condition provides that regular 

Promotion can be made on the recommendation of the SPSC, this 

condition obviously would be contingent upon the action of the 

State-Respondents in terms of Rule 16 (extracted supra) of the 

amended Rules of 1986, notified on 11.03.1986. The Petitioners 

cannot be answerable for the procrastination or indolence of the 

State-Respondents, thereby depriving them of timely Promotions, 

of course subject to fulfillment of all other requisite conditions. The 

uncertainty of confirmation is surely not a reflection of the 

inefficiency of the Petitioners. 

18. 
Related to this would be the question of vacancy in the 

posts of Accounts Officer. On this aspect, the averments in the 

Counter-Affidavit are at best nebulous and fail to address the real 

issues pertaining to vacancy as emanates from the discussions 

which follow. No reasonable explanation was offered as to why the 

Petitioners were promoted only on Officiating capacity, besides 

which, a confirmed Seniority List as on date, is not exhibited. 

Although the State-Respondents would argue that the 11 (eleven) 

Direct Recruits had been appointed in the year 2009 against the 23 

(twenty-three) vacancies that existed for Direct Recruits at the 

relevant time, however, Annexure R-15 (collectively) provides that 

there was a proposal on 30.06.2003 for filling up of 23 (twenty-


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

34 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

three) posts by Departmental Competitive Examination via 

Promotion. Thereafter, again in 2003, a proposal was placed for 

filling up of 18 (eighteen) Posts of Accounts Officers by Direct 

Recruitment, however, vide Letter dated 22.11.2003, Annexure R-

15/5 (collectively), it was stated that the Department had already 

forwarded the proposal for filling up of 18 (eighteen) Posts of 

Accounts Officers by Promotion and a request was made to the 

Rule Section to allot the Roster Points. Therefore, the Office Notes 

reveal that for the post of 23 (twenty-three) alleged vacancies of 

Direct Recruits, 18 (eighteen) posts were also proposed to be filled 

by Promotion. The Office Notes further reveal that on 12.10.2004, 

the Chief Minister convened a meeting in which he directed that 10 

(ten) new posts of Accounts Officers be created. On 19.05.2007, 

another Office Note reveals that there were 12 (twelve) posts of 

Accounts Officers which were proposed to be filled through Direct 

Recruitment against anticipated vacancy. In the light of what has 

ensued in the concerned Department, as also the Order of the 

Chief Minister, it is evident that the contention of the State-

Respondents that the Direct Recruits in 2009 were being filled from 

the 23 (twenty-three) vacant posts of the 46 (forty-six) posts, are 

erroneous and not buttressed by documentary evidence. The 

vacancies that arose out of the death and retirements and the 

allocation of such vacancies to the Quota and Rota, have not been 

responded to at all by the State-Respondents. 

19.(i) 
Turning my attention now to the Quota Rota Rule, in 

N.K. Chauhan (supra), the question that fell for consideration was 

whether the 50:50 ratio as between Direct Recruits and Promoted 

hands was subject to the saving clause "as far as practicable." It 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

35 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

was observed that the Government must give proof that it was not 

practicable for the State to recruit from the open market qualified 

persons through the specialized agency of the Public Service 

Commission. If it does not succeed despite honest and serious 

efforts, it qualifies for departure from the Rule. It was inter alia 

held as follows; 

"27. ………………………The 

straightforward 
answer 
seems to us to be that the State, in tune with the mandate 
of the rule, must make serious effort to secure hands to fill 
half the number of vacancies from the open market. If it 
does not succeed, despite honest and serious effort, it 
qualifies for departure from the rule. ……………………………The 
short test, therefore, is to find out whether the 
government, in the present case, has made effective 
efforts, doing all that it reasonably can, to recruit from the 

open market necessary numbers of qualified hands. ………" 

(ii) 
In Suraj Parkash Gupta (supra), it was held inter alia as 

follows; 

"38. That in such situations there can be no 

breakdown of the quota rule is clear from the decided 
cases. In N.K. Chauhan v. State of Gujarat [(1977) 1 SCC 
308 : 1977 SCC (L&S) 127] the rule said that "as far as 
practicable", the quota must be followed. Krishna Iyer, J. 
said that there must be evidence to show that effort was 
made to fill up the direct recruitment quota. It must be 
positively proved that it was not feasible, nor practicable to 
get direct recruits. The reason should not be 
"procrastinatory". 
In Syed 
Khalid 
Rizvi v. Union 
of 
India [1993 Supp (3) SCC 575 : 1994 SCC (L&S) 84 : 
(1994) 26 ATC 192] it was held that mere non-preparation 
of select list does not amount to collapse of the quota rule. 
In M.S.L. Patil v. State of Maharashtra [(1996) 11 SCC 
361] it was held that mere omission to prepare lists did not 
amount to breakdown of quota rule." 

(iii) 
Therefore, both the ratio of N.K. Chauhan and Suraj 

Parkash Gupta (supra), lay down that the Quota Rule is not broken 

down until serious efforts are made by the Government to recruit 

from the open market. In the instant case, right from the inception 

of the Rules and several amendments thereof, the State-

Respondents have not been able to establish before this Court that 

the Quota Rule was ever adhered to, however, the Rules do exist 

providing for methods of recruitment for Direct Recruits and 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

36 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

Promotees but no effort has been shown to have been made by the 

Government to recruit from the open market. On the touchstone of 

the principles enunciated in N.K. Chauhan and Suraj Parkash Gupta 

(supra), the Quota Rule thus cannot be said to have broken down. 

In Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers' Association (supra), the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court was also of the opinion that although the 

Rules fixed the Quota of the appointees from two sources and were 

meant to be followed but that if it becomes impractical to act upon 

it, it is no use insisting that the authorities must continue to give 

effect to it. That, on the Quota Rule not being followed, brings 

about its natural demise and there is no meaning in pretending 

that it is still vibrant with life. In such a situation, if appointments 

from one source are made in excess of a Quota, but in a regular 

manner and after following the prescribed procedure, there is no 

reason to push down the appointees below the recruits from the 

other source who are inducted in the Service subsequently. That, 

where the Rules permit the authorities to relax the provision 

relating to the Quota, ordinarily a presumption should be raised 

that there was such Relaxation when there is a deviation from the 

Quota Rules. Despite the Quota Rule not having broken down in 

the instant case, the safety net of Rule 28 inserted in the Rules on 

09.12.2003, has come into play, as already elaborately discussed, 

making the appointments of the Petitioners as Accounts Officers 

valid and legal. 

20.(i) 
In the light of the above position, it is imperative to 

discuss here as to how the inter se Seniority between the 

Petitioners and the Respondents No.7 to 17 was to be settled. 

Relevant reference may be made to the observation in D.R. Nim 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

37 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

(supra), wherein it was held that when an Officer had worked 

continuously for a long period (as in that case for nearly fifteen to 

twenty years) in a post and had never been reverted, it cannot be 

held that the Officer's continuous Officiation was a mere temporary 

or local or stop gap arrangement even though the Order of 

appointment may state so. In such circumstances, the entire 

period of Officiation was to be counted for Seniority, any other 

view would be arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 16 (1) of 

the Constitution because the temporary Service in the post in 

question is not for a short period intended to meet some emergent 

or unforeseen circumstance. The ratio in S.B. Patwardhan (supra), 

may also be referred to. The pivotal question for consideration 

before a three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court was 

whether Departmental Promotees and Direct Recruits appointed as 

Deputy Engineers in the Engineering Services of the Governments 

of Maharashtra and Gujarat, belonged to the same Class so that 

they may be treated with an even hand or whether they belonged 

to different Classes or categories and can justifiably be treated 

unequally. The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that concededly, 

they were being treated unequally in the matter of Seniority 

because whereas, Promotees rank for Seniority from the date of 

their confirmation, the Seniority of Direct Recruits is reckoned from 

the date of their initial appointment. That, a Promotee ranks below 

the Direct Recruit even if he has officiated continuously as a 

Deputy Engineer for years before the appointment of the Direct 

Recruit is made and even if he, the Promotee, could have been 

confirmed in an available Substantive vacancy before the 

appointment of the Direct Recruit. After due consideration of the 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

38 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

relevant Rules, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to opine 

inter alia as follows; 

"39. If officiating Deputy Engineers belong to 

Class II cadre as much as direct recruits do and if 
the quota system cannot operate upon their 
respective confirmation in that cadre, is there any 
valid basis for applying different standards to the 
members of the two groups for determining their 
seniority? Though drawn from two different sources, 
the direct recruits and promotees constitute in the 
instant case a single integrated cadre. They 
discharge 
identical 
functions, 
bear 
similar 
responsibilities and acquire an equal amount of 
experience in their respective assignments. And yet 
clause (iii) of Rule 8 provides that probationers 
recruited during any year shall in a bunch be treated 
as senior to promotees confirmed in that year. The 
plain arithmetic of this formula is that a direct 
recruit appointed on probation, say in 1966, is to be 
regarded as senior to a promotee who was 
appointed as an officiating Deputy Engineer, say in 
1956, but was confirmed in 1966 after continuous 
officiation till then. This formula gives to the direct 
recruit even the benefit of his one year's period of 
training and another year's period of probation for 
the purposes of seniority and denies to promotees 
the benefit of their long and valuable experience. If 
there was some intelligible ground for this 
differentiation bearing nexus with efficiency in public 
services, it might perhaps have been possible to 
sustain such a classification. ……………… It is on the 
record of these writ petitions that officiating Deputy 
Engineers were not confirmed even though 
substantive vacancies were available in which they 
could have been confirmed. It shows that 
confirmation does not have to conform to any set 
rules and whether an employee should be confirmed 
or not depends on the sweet will and pleasure of the 
government. 
………………………………………………………………………………… 
43. Rule 8(ii) in the instant case adopts the 
seniority-cum-merit test for preparing the statewise 
Select List of seniority. And yet clause (iii) rejects 
the test of merit altogether. The vice of that clause 
is that it leaves the valuable right of seniority to 
depend upon the mere accident of confirmation. 
That, under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, is 
impermissible and therefore we must strike down 
Rule 8 (iii) as being unconstitutional. 
…………………………………….…………………………………………… 
48. Rules 33, insofar as it makes seniority 
dependent upon the fortuitous circumstance of 
confirmation, is open to the same objection as Rule 
8(iii) of the 1960 Rules and must be struck down for 
identical reasons. 
…………………………………………………….…………………………… 
51. We 
are 
not 
unmindful 
of 
the 
administrative difficulties in evolving a code of 
seniority which will satisfy all conflicting claims. But 
care ought to be taken to avoid a clear 
transgression of the equality clauses of the 
Constitution. ……………………… We however hope that 

the Government will bear in mind the basic principle 
that if a cadre consists of both permanent and 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

39 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

temporary employees, the accident of confirmation 
cannot be an intelligible criterion for determining 
seniority as between direct recruits and promotees. 

All other factors being equal, continuous officiation 
in a non-fortuitous vacancy ought to receive due 
recognition in determining rules of seniority as 
between persons recruited from different sources, 
so long as they belong to the same cadre, discharge 
similar functions and bear similar responsibilities. 

……………………" 

(emphasis supplied) 

(ii) 
In Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers' Association 

(supra), a Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court was in 

agreement with the Patwardhan case (supra), and held inter alia 

therein as follows; 

"13. When the cases were taken up for 

hearing before us, it was faintly suggested that the 
principle laid down in Patwardhan case [(1977) 3 
SCC 399: 1977 SCC (L&S) 391: (1977) 3 SCR 775] 
was unsound and fit to be overruled, but no attempt 
was made to substantiate the plea. We were taken 
through the judgment by the learned counsel for the 
parties more than once and we are in complete 

agreement with the ratio decidendi, that the period 
of continuous officiation by a government servant, 
after his appointment by following the rules 
applicable for substantive appointments, has to be 
taken into account for determining his seniority; 
and seniority cannot be determined on the sole test 
of 
confirmation, 
for, 
as 
was 
pointed out, 
confirmation is one of the inglorious uncertainties 
of government service depending neither on 
efficiency of the incumbent nor on the availability of 

substantive vacancies. The principle for deciding 
inter se seniority has to conform to the principles of 
equality spelt out by Articles 14 and 16. If an 
appointment is made by way of stop-gap 
arrangement, without considering the claims of all 
the eligible available persons and without following 
the rules of appointment, the experience on such 
appointment cannot be equated with the experience 
of a regular appointee, because of the qualitative 
difference in the appointment. To equate the two 
would be to treat two unequals as equal which 
would violate the equality clause. But if the 

appointment is made after considering the claims of 
all eligible candidates and the appointee continues 
in the post uninterruptedly till the regularisation of 
his service in accordance with the rules made for 
regular substantive appointments, there is no 
reason to exclude the officiating service for the 
purpose of seniority. Same will be the position if the 
initial appointment itself is made in accordance with 
the rules applicable to substantive appointments as 
in the present case. To hold otherwise will be 
discriminatory 
and 
arbitrary. 

……………………………………………………………………….…… 

16. …….……We are not in a position to agree 

with the learned counsel that the rules indicate that 
the officiating posts were not included in the cadre 
of the Deputy Engineers. It is true that the use of 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

40 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

word "promotions" in Rule 8(i) of the 1960 Rules is 
not quite appropriate, but that by itself cannot lead 
to the conclusion that the officiating Deputy 
Engineers formed a class inferior to that of the 

permanent Engineers. ………………………………….….. 

17. This 
question 
was 
considered 
in Patwardhan case [(1977) 3 SCC 399: 1977 SCC 
(L&S) 391: (1977) 3 SCR 775] at considerable 
length, and a categorical finding against the direct 
recruits was arrived at, which has been followed for 
the last more than a decade, in many cases arising 
between members of Maharashtra and Gujarat 
Engineering Services. The question is of vital 
importance affecting a very large number of officers 
in the departments concerned and many disputes 
have been settled by following the judgment 
in Patwardhan case [(1977) 3 SCC 399: 1977 SCC 
(L&S) 391: (1977) 3 SCR 775]. In such a situation it 
is not expedient to depart from the decision lightly. 
It is highly desirable that a decision, which concerns 
a large number of government servants in a 
particular Service and which has been given after 
careful consideration of the rival contentions, is 
respected rather than scrutinised for finding out any 
possible error. It is not in the interest of the Service 

to unsettle a settled position every now and then. 

………………." 

(emphasis supplied) 

In sum and substance, the Hon'ble Supreme Court summarized the 

points as follows; 

"47. To sum up, we hold that: 

(A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a 
post according to rule, his seniority has to be 
counted from the date of his appointment and not 
according to the date of his confirmation. 
The corollary of the above rule is that where 
the initial appointment is only ad hoc and not 
according to rules and made as a stop-gap 
arrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be 
taken into account for considering the seniority. 

(B) If the initial appointment is not made by 
following the procedure laid down by the rules but 
the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly 
till the regularisation of his service in accordance 
with the rules, the period of officiating service will 
be counted. 

(C) When appointments are made from more 
than one source, it is permissible to fix the ratio for 
recruitment from the different sources, and if rules 
are framed in this regard they must ordinarily be 
followed strictly. 

(D) If it becomes impossible to adhere to the 
existing quota rule, it should be substituted by an 
appropriate rule to meet the needs of the situation. 
In case, however, the quota rule is not followed 
continuously for a number of years because it was 
impossible to do so the inference is irresistible that 
the quota rule had broken down.

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

(E) Where the quota rule has broken down 
and the appointments are made from one source in 
excess of the quota, but are made after following 
the procedure prescribed by the rules for the 
appointment, the appointees should not be pushed 
down below the appointees from the other source 
inducted in the service at a later date. 

(F) Where the rules permit the authorities to 
relax the provisions relating to the quota, ordinarily 
a presumption should be raised that there was such 
relaxation when there is a deviation from the quota 
rule. 

(G) The quota for recruitment from the 
different sources may be prescribed by executive 
instructions, if the rules are silent on the subject. 

(H) If the quota rule is prescribed by an 
executive 
instruction, 
and 
is 
not 
followed 
continuously for a number of years, the inference is 
that the executive instruction has ceased to remain 
operative. 

(I) The posts held by the permanent Deputy 
Engineers as well as the officiating Deputy 
Engineers under the State of Maharashtra belonged 
to the single cadre of Deputy Engineers. 

(J) The decision dealing with important 
questions concerning a particular service given after 
careful consideration should be respected rather 
than scrutinised for finding out any possible error. It 
is not in the interest of Service to unsettle a settled 
position. 

With respect to Writ Petition No. 1327 of 
1982, we further hold: 

(K) That a dispute raised by an application 
under Article 32 of the Constitution must be held to 
be barred by principles of res judicata including the 
rule of constructive res judicata if the same has 
been earlier decided by a competent court by a 
judgment which became final." 

(emphasis supplied) 

21.(i) 
Admittedly, the Promotion of the Petitioners was not 

made by following the procedure prescribed but they did fulfill the 

criteria mandated by the Rules. Being thus eligible under the said 

Rules, they could well have been considered for Promotion on 

completion of required period in the posts of Senior Accountants 

but for the passivity of the State-Respondents. Now, would the 

term "ad hoc" as emanates in the corollary of proposition "A" of 

the ratio in Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers' Association 

(supra), be applicable to the case of the Petitioners. In Rudra Kumar 

Sain (supra), a Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

42 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

was considering the question of inter se Seniority between Direct 

Recruits and Promotees in the Delhi Higher Judicial Service and 

while examining the term "ad hoc" held inter alia as follows; 

"16. ………………In Black's Law Dictionary, the 

expression "fortuitous" means "occurring by 
chance", "a fortuitous event may be highly 
unfortunate". It thus, indicates that it occurs only by 
chance or accident, which could not have been 
reasonably foreseen. The expression "ad hoc" 
in Black's Law Dictionary, means "something which 
is formed for a particular purpose". The expression 
"stopgap" as per Oxford Dictionary, means "a 
temporary way of dealing with a problem or 
satisfying a need". 
17. In Oxford Dictionary, the word "ad hoc" 
means for a particular purpose; specially. In the 
same dictionary, the word "fortuitous" means 
happening by accident or chance rather than design. 
18. In P. 
Ramanatha 
Aiyar's 
Law 
Lexicon (2nd Edn.) the word "ad hoc" is described 
as: "For particular purpose. Made, established, 
acting or concerned with a particular (sic) and or 
purpose." The meaning of word "fortuitous event" is 
given as "an event which happens by a cause which 
we cannot resist; one which is unforeseen and 
caused by superior force, which it is impossible to 
resist; a term synonymous with Act of God". 

19. ……………………If the appointment order 

itself indicates that the post is created to meet a 
particular temporary contingency and for a period 
specified in the order, then the appointment to such 
a post can be aptly described as "ad hoc" or 
"stopgap". If a post is created to meet a situation 
which has suddenly arisen on account of happening 
of some event of a temporary nature then the 
appointment of such a post can aptly be described 

as "fortuitous" in nature. ………………………" 

(ii) 
The Officiating Orders of the Petitioners do not indicate 

that the posts were created to meet a particular temporary 

contingency and for a period specified nor is it the case of the 

State-Respondents that the post was created to meet a situation 

which had suddenly arisen on account of the happening of some 

event of a temporary nature to describe the appointment of the 

Petitioners as fortuitous. The Petitioners were in the posts of 

Accounts Officers from 08.05.2008 till their confirmation on 

16.03.2013 and therefore cannot be said to be for a short period 

intended to meet emergent or unforeseen circumstances. In fact, 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

43 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

only two whimsical conditions have been inserted in the Officiating 

Order, which also do not lay down that they would be reverted to 

their posts of Senior Accountants nor are the conditions fortified by 

any Rules. No conditions were attached to their Officiating 

Promotion regarding obtainment of qualification at a later date or 

reversion to the earlier posts, except the two conditions as already 

extracted hereinabove sans explanation as to whether there were 

Substantive vacancies or not. The appointment does not specify 

that it was made in the exigencies of service or on ad hoc or stop 

gap to meet a sudden temporary situation requiring en masse 

Promotions to define it as fortuitous. It is settled law that where 

the initial appointment is only ad hoc and not according to Rules 

and made as a stop gap arrangement, the period of Officiation to 

the said post cannot be taken into account for considering 

Seniority. In the instant case, however, the well-settled principle of 

law as propounded by the ratio in Direct Recruit Class II Engineering 

Officers' Association (supra) is applicable viz., that an employee 

appointed to a post according to Rules would be entitled to get his 

Seniority reckoned from the date of his appointment and not from 

the date of its confirmation. It is but trite to remark that without 

State action in terms of the prescribed procedure, the Petitioners 

could not have volunteered to take the Limited Departmental 

Competitive Examination. 

(iii) 
In Vireshwar Singh and Others vs. Municipal Corporation of 

Delhi and Others 27 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed inter alia as 

follows; 

27 (2014) 10 SCC 360 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

44 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

"15. It is the view expressed in Narender 

Chadha [Narender Chadha v. Union of India, (1986) 2 SCC 
157 : 1986 SCC (L&S) 226] which would require a close 
look as Keshav Chandra Joshi [1992 Supp (1) SCC 272 : 
1993 SCC (L&S) 694 : (1993) 24 ATC 545] is a mere 
reiteration of the said view. In Narender Chadha [Narender 
Chadha v. Union of India, (1986) 2 SCC 157 : 1986 SCC 
(L&S) 226] the lis between the parties was the one relating 
to counting of ad hoc service rendered by the promotees 
for the purpose of computation of seniority qua the direct 
recruits. The basis of the decision to count long years of ad 
hoc service for the purpose of seniority is to be found more 
in the peculiar facts of the case as noted in para 20 of the 
Report than on any principle of law of general application. 
However, in paras 15-19 of the Report a deemed relaxation 
of the rules of appointment and the wide sweep of the 
power to relax the provisions of the rules, as it existed at 
the relevant point of time, appears to be the basis for 
counting of the ad hoc service for the purpose of seniority. 
16. The 
principle 
laid 
down 
in Narender 
Chadha [Narender Chadha v. Union of India, (1986) 2 SCC 
157 : 1986 SCC (L&S) 226] was approved by the 
Constitution Bench in Direct Recruit Class II [Direct Recruit 
Class II Engg. Officers' Assn. v. State of Maharashtra, 
(1990) 2 SCC 715 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 339 : (1990) 13 ATC 
348] as the promotion of the officers on ad hoc basis was 
found to be "without following the procedure laid down 
under the Rules". That apart, what was approved in Direct 
Recruit Class II [Direct Recruit Class II Engg. Officers' 
Assn. v. State of Maharashtra, (1990) 2 SCC 715 : 1990 
SCC (L&S) 339 : (1990) 13 ATC 348] is in the following 
terms: (SCC p. 726, para 13) 
"13. … We, therefore, confirm the 
principle of counting towards seniority the 
period of continuous officiation following 
an appointment made in accordance with 
the 
rules 
prescribed for 
regular 
substantive appointments in the service." 

……………" 

The law on the point of Seniority qua the appointments made in 

excess to the Quotas and the principle of computing the Seniority 

is thus clearly laid down, further, as expressed in the ratio of Direct 

Recruit Class II Engineering Officers' Association (supra), it is not in 

the interest of the Service to unsettle a settled position now and 

then. 

(iv) 
We may, therefore now look at the propositions put 

forth in Direct Recruits case supra. Learned Senior Counsel for 

Respondents No.7 to 17 relied on proposition "(A)" while Learned 

Senior Counsel for the Petitioners relied on proposition "(B)". From 

the discussions made hereinabove, it can be culled out that the 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

45 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

Petitioners continued in the posts until regularization of their 

Service in accordance with the Rules. Thus, the case of the 

Petitioners squarely falls under proposition "(B)" enunciated in 

Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers' Association supra. At the 

same time, it is worth noticing propositions "(D)" and "(F)" of the 

same ratio wherein at "(D)" it was held that if it becomes 

impossible to adhere to the existing Quota Rule, it should be 

substituted by an appropriate Rule to meet the needs of the 

situation. In case, however, the Quota Rule is not followed 

continuously for a number of years because it was impossible to 

do so, the inference is irresistible that the Quota Rule had broken 

down. It may be explained here that the word "impossible" has to 

be construed in this context in terms of the decision of the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court in N.K. Chauhan and Suraj Parkash Gupta (supra). No 

effort of the State-Respondents to recruit directly is established 

herein as already discussed. Proposition "F" of Direct Recruit Class II 

Engineering Officers' Association 1990 (2) SCC 715 supra provides that 

where the Rules permit the authorities to relax the provisions 

relating to the Quota, ordinarily a presumption should be raised 

that there was such relaxation when there is a deviation from the 

Quota Rule. The Relaxation Clause at Rule 28 of the Rules is 

assumed to have been invoked when deviation from the Quota 

Rule was made. 

22. 
In conclusion, it must be remarked that no case fits 

with mathematical or clockwork precision to a previously decided 

case. The facts of each case are peculiar in their own details. Thus, 

it is only reasonable that the Courts apply the principles laid down 

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, similar to those requiring 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

46 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

determination before them. It is worth remarking at this juncture 

that the Petitioners had also agitated the point that the Direct 

Recruits appointed in January, 2009 were promoted on Officiating 

basis as Senior Accounts Officers even before completion of the 

qualifying years of Service as Accounts Officers, and that 12 

(twelve) posts of Senior Accounts Officers to that of Accounts 

Officers were downgraded for the alleged purposes of Direct 

Recruitments which were subsequently then filled by Promotions. 

No light has been shed on these circumstances by the State-

Respondents. 

23. 
So far as the grievance of the Petitioners against the 

Respondents No.4, 5 and 6 are concerned, in the first instance, 

they had appeared in the Departmental Examination in the year 

1997 for Promotion from the posts of Accountants to Senior 

Accountants and were ranked in the first, second and third place 

amongst 19 (nineteen) candidates in the Panel prepared for such 

Promotion. In such circumstances, in my considered opinion, 

nothing irregular emanates on their selection and consequent 

Promotions. 

24. 
The foregoing detailed discussions thus soundly 

answers the question that fell for consideration before this Court. 

25. 
So far as the question of delay is concerned, the 

Petitioners are employees of the State-Respondents and bound by 

official discipline. In the absence of any Confirmation List 

pertaining to Seniority, it was not for the Petitioners to have run to 

the Court at the drop of a hat. In my considered opinion, there is 

no negligence or inaction on the part of the Petitioners or want of 

bona fides. The expectation of the Petitioners was that the State-


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

47 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

Respondents would treat them fairly and when such action was not 

forthcoming, the Petitioners were constrained to seek redressal 

from the Court. The Courts cannot always take a pedantic and 

hyper technical view on the point of delay, which ought not to be 

an obstacle in the exercise of the Courts' discretion to mete out 

even handed justice to all concerned. 

26. 
While on the issue of waiver and acquiescence, I am 

inclined to agree with the submissions of Learned Counsel for the 

Petitioners that the ratio of P.S. Gopinathan and M.P. Palanisamy 

(supra) relied on by Learned Counsel for Respondents No.7 to 17, 

are distinguishable from the instant case. In P.S. Gopinathan 

(supra), the relief was not granted to the Appellant as the position 

therein was that the Appellant was well aware of the 

"35..……..mistaken belief of the High Court in appointing and posting him 

as a temporary employee. …" to which he raised no objection and did 

so only subsequently. In M.P. Palanisamy (supra), the contention of 

the Appellants was that they had all the qualifications for holding 

the posts of Post Graduate Assistants when they were appointed 

under the relevant Rules and there was no break in Service to 

which they were ultimately regularized in 1988. They were placed 

below in Seniority to those who were selected in 1986. It was 

found inter alia as follows; 

"29. ……………however, it must be borne in 

mind that though the appellants herein had the necessary 

qualifications at the time of their initial appointment under 
Rule 10(a)(i)(1) and though they were subsequently 
regularised also, the regularisation was conditional 
regularisation, which was done way back in 1988. The 
condition regarding the seniority was explicit in the said 
regularisation, which is clear from a mere reading of GOMs 

No. 1813. …………..." 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

48 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

The Appellants therein raised the issue in 1994 and thereafter 

when the Seniority prayed for by them was refused, they bore it in 

silence and raised the matter again only in 2003. That apart, it is 

worth considering that in N.K. Chauhan (supra), the Hon'ble 

Supreme Court had also observed inter alia as follows; 

"36. …………….….But we should not forget that 

seniority is the manifestation of official experience, -the 
process of metabolism of service, over the years, of civil 
servants, by the administration -and, therefore, it is 
appropriate that as far as possible he who has actually 

served longer benefits better in the future. …………." 

27. 
The Rule of law cannot be anathema to the State-

Respondents, it demands obedience and exists to check arbitrary 

exercise of power which otherwise conceives chaos, as exhibited in 

the facts and circumstances herein. The fate of the Petitioners have 

been left to the vagaries of executive indecisions leading to 

violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. 

28. 
Considering the entirety of the facts and circumstances 

and for the reasons discussed supra and in terms of the well 

settled position of law in the ratiocinations relied upon, it is hereby 

ordered as follows: 

(i) 
The Petitioners shall be accorded Seniority with 

effect from the date of their Officiating Promotion 

i.e. 08.05.2008 as Accounts Officers with all benefits 

of Service; 

(ii) 
The consequent Seniority of the Petitioners in their 

subsequent senior posts shall be computed in terms 

of the directions supra; 

(iii) 
A Seniority List shall be prepared by the State-

Respondents on the above basis, to rule out 


WP(C) No.30 of 2016 

49 

Sushil Pradhan and Others vs. State of Sikkim and Others 

prejudice to the Petitioners and ensure equity to all, 

thereby, toeing the line of Articles 14 and 16 of the 

Constitution and thus satisfying the test of 

constitutionality; 

(iv) 
The Petitioners No.2 and 3 who have retired during 

the pendency of the instant Writ Petition are entitled 

to receive the same benefits as granted to the 

Petitioners herein, during their time in Service, for 

the purposes of their retirement benefits. 

(v) 
No Orders need be issued with regard to 

Respondents No.4, 5 and 6 in view of the foregoing 

discussions pertaining to their Promotions, they are 

at liberty to approach the State-Respondents for 

redressal of any grievances. 

29. 
The Writ Petition stands disposed of with the above 

directions. 

30. 
No order as to costs.
