1. 
The Appellants were the Plaintiffs before the learned 

trial Court, in Title Suit No.08 of 2011 (Nil Kumar Dahal and Another 

v. Indira Dahal and Others), a Suit for Declaration, Recovery of 

Possession, Injunction and other Consequential Reliefs, against the 

Respondents No.1 to 4 herein, who were the Defendants No.1 to 4 

in the said Title Suit. The learned trial Court on consideration of the 

evidence and all materials on record dismissed the Suit of the 

Appellants, by the impugned Judgment, dated 26.07.2017. 

Dissatisfied thereof this Appeal has arisen. 


RFA No.10 of 2017

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

2. 
Parties shall hereinafter be referred to in their order of 

appearance before the learned trial Court. 

3. 
The Plaintiffs are blood brothers being the sons of one 

Devi Prasad Dahal. The Defendant No.1 is their step mother and the 

Defendant No.4 is their niece, being the daughter of their deceased 

step brother, Bal Krishna Dahal, the son of Defendant No.1 and the 

Plaintiffs" father. Defendant No.4 is represented by her guardian 

Devi Kala Sharma. Defendants No.2 and 3 are Government officials 

inter alia concerned with registration of land. The Plaintiffs claim to 

be governed by the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law. The dispute 

between the parties pivots around the "jiwni" land described in the 

Schedule to the Plaint, kept aside by their late father from the 

ancestral properties, for his upkeep and sustenance during his 

lifetime at Raley Block, East Sikkim, after partitioning the ancestral 

properties amongst his sons. By the "Banda Patra" ("Partition 

Deed"), Exhibit "A," dated 17.05.1985, their father devised dual 

conditions for the "jiwni" land to be passed on to his sons i.e. 

"father"s "jiwni" share would go to the son who would look after and 

perform death rites." On his passing on 23.09.2001, the Plaintiffs 

and the father of the Defendant No.4, each laid claims to the said 

"jiwni" land on grounds that each of them fulfilled the conditions laid 

out in Exhibit "A." Defendant No.1, for her part, while denying 

governance by the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law, claims the 

property on grounds that she has been in unencumbered physical 

possession of the property since the execution of Exhibit "A" and 

exercising all rights over it as its owner, sans interference from any 

quarter. 


RFA No.10 of 2017

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

4.(i) 
Undisputedly, the property is ancestral having belonged 

to the Plaintiffs" great-grandfather, one Parmananda Bahun. He had 

three sons Bishnu Lall (grandfather of the Plaintiffs), Purananda and 

Lok Nath. Bishnu Lall and Lok Nath passed away before the 

properties could be partitioned, Lok Nath having died issueless, as a 

result, the properties came to be partitioned amongst the four 

remaining sons of Bishnu Lall (out of his five sons) and Purananda 

Bahun. One of the sons of Bishnu Lall was their father Devi Prasad. 

(ii) 
According to the Plaintiffs, on 26.03.2010, the 

Defendant No.1, who also allegedly maintains her Nepalese 

citizenship, filed an application before the District Collector 

(Defendant No.2), East Sikkim, seeking mutation of the "jiwni" land 

to her name from that of Devi Prasad. Despite objections raised by 

the Plaintiffs, by the impugned Order dated 03.11.2010, the 

Defendant No.2, allowed mutation of the "jiwni" land in the name of 

Defendant No.1 and ordered that Plots bearing No.450 and 452 

measuring an area of 0.3050 hectares at Raley Khesey Block, be 

mutated in the name of the Defendant No.1 although Plot No.452 

was already mutated in the name of the Plaintiff No.2, as his share, 

vide Exhibit "A." That, the Order lacked jurisdiction as the 

Defendant No.2 was not vested with powers to decide Title disputes 

and exhibited lack of application of mind for ordering mutation of 

Plot No.452 in the name of the Defendant No.1. That, as the 

Plaintiffs have fulfilled the dual conditions laid down in Exhibit "A," 

they are entitled to the "jiwni" land to the exclusion of Defendant 

No.1 and Defendant No.4, the latter allegedly having no locus to 

claim a share in the testamentary disposition as her father (Bal 

Krishna) was a Nepalese citizen and had passed away before the 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

4 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

issue of sharing of "jiwni" land came up for consideration. Besides, 

the Partition Deed nowhere mentions that a daughter or grand-

daughter is entitled to the "jiwni" land. That, when proceedings 

were taken up before the Defendant No.2, the Defendant No.1 had 

stated that her son Bal Krishna had two sons therefore it is unclear 

as to how Defendant No.4 has now emerged as the legal heir of Bal 

Krishna. The Plaintiffs also objected to the Guardianship Certificate 

issued to the guardian of Defendant No.4 alleging that she too is a 

Nepalese citizen. Hence, the prayers in the Plaint which are 

extracted hereinbelow; 

"In the circumstances the plaintiffs pray for a 
Decree: 

i. 
Declaring that the defendant no0(sic).2 has 
no 
right, 
title 
and 
authority to pass 
an Order(sic) dated 03/11/2010; 

(i)A 
Declaring that late Bal Krishna Dahal 
predeceased his father and having waived 
to perform certain obligations towards 
father, as such, his legal heirs has(sic) no 
right, title and interest over the "jiwni land"; 

(i)B 
Declaring that defendant no.4 not being son 
of late Devi Prasad Dahal has no right, title 
and interest over the "Jiwni land"; 

(i)C 
Declaring that a portion of the "jiwni land" 
cannot and shall not be mutated in the 
name of defendant no.4; 

(i)D 
Declaring that the Guardianship Certificate 
obtained by Smt. D.K. Sharma by 
misrepresentation of facts is liable to be set 
aside and cancelled. 
(i)E 
Praying for recovery of possession of Jiwni 
land from defendant no.1. 

(i)F 
Declaring that the defendnat(sic) no.1 
being a Nepal subject has no right to claim 
any share of the suit property. 

ii 
Declaring that the Order dated 03/11/2010, 
i.e. Annexure-15 to be null and void and 
the same is nonest; 

iii. 
Declaring that the Order dated 03/11/2010, 
i.e. Annexure 15 be set aside and quashed. 

iv. 
Declaring that the plaintiffs are only entitled 
for the jiwni land that is Plot no.450; 

v. 
Declaring that the schedule property cannot 
and shall not be mutated in the name of the 
defendant no.1; 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

5 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

vi. 
In the mean time if 
the 
Schedule 
property is mutated/transferred 
in 
the 
name of the defendant no.1 then to set 
aside, quash and cancel such mutation/ 
order of mutation; 

vii. 
Declaring that the plaintiffs have their right, 
title and interest on the Schedule Property 

viii. 
A permanent injunction 

(a) restraining the defendant no.3 from 
mutating/transferring the Schedule 
Property in the name of Defendant 
No.1; 

ix. 
A temporary injunction in terms of Prayer 
no.(X); 

x. 
Any other relief or reliefs as this Hon"ble 
Court may deem fit and proper." 

5. 
Contesting the claims of the Plaintiffs, the Defendant 

No.1 while denying that neither she nor her son were citizens of 

Nepal or that they were governed by the Mitakshara School of Hindu 

Law, averred that they were governed by the "Law of the land" 

which did not differentiate between male and female heirs. The 

Plaintiff No.1 had voluntarily left the "mul ghar" ("main house") in 

1983-84 as he did not get along with his father and the Plaintiff 

No.2 left after the execution of Exhibit "A." Consequent thereto, it 

fell upon her son Bal Krishna to take care of the family and Devi 

Prasad financially as he was ailing and bedridden for almost a 

decade, with no moral or financial support from the Plaintiffs. All 

medical expenses and expenses for death rites were arranged by 

the Defendant No.1 and her son by borrowing money from their well 

wishers. The Defendant No.1 asserts that she is entitled to fifty per 

cent of her husband"s property as per the "Law of the land" while 

the Plaintiffs have no such entitlement on their failure to fulfill the 

conditions in Exhibit "A" which, according to her, were "to look after 

their parents and perform death rites." She denies that the 

Defendant No.2 had no jurisdiction to issue the impugned Order or 

that only "sons" are entitled to the "jiwni" land. That, the entire Plot 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

6 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

No.452 does not belong to the Plaintiff No.2 as his Plot is numbered 

"452/1192" which measures 0.325 hectares, while Plot No.452 

measures 0.560 hectares. That, the cause of action arose after the 

completion of the forty-five days death ritual of the deceased and 

hence the Suit is barred by limitation, has no cause of action and is 

undervalued and on these grounds, liable to be dismissed. 

6. 
Defendant No.4, the minor daughter of late Bal Krishna 

Dahal, was abandoned by her mother after her father"s death and is 

thus represented by her paternal aunt and legal guardian Devi Kala 

Sharma, the sister of Bal Krishna, claiming to be a bona fide 

Sikkimese. She had obtained a Guardianship Certificate from the 

Family Court. In pith and substance, the Written Statement of the 

Defendant No.4 is similar to and reiterates the averments made by 

the Defendant No.1. According to her, the property kept as "jiwni" is 

the land on which the main house stands and has been in the 

unencumbered physical possession of the Defendant No.1 after the 

death of her grandfather, without objection or interference from any 

quarter including the Plaintiffs, hence, the Defendant No.1 is 

entitled to fifty per cent of her late husband"s property as per the 

Law of the Land. 

7. 
The Defendants No.2 and 3 had no Written Statements 

to file. 

8. 
It is essential for clarity to recapitulate here that earlier 

in the same matter i.e. Title Suit No.08 of 2011, the learned trial 

Court vide its Judgment dated 30.11.2013, concluded that the 

Plaintiffs are entitled to one-third share each from the "jiwni" land 

which was in the possession of the Defendant No.1. Calling in 

question the said decision, the Defendant No.1 was before this 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

7 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

Court in Appeal being Regular First Appeal No.04 of 2014 (Indira 

Dahal v. Nil Kumar Dahal and Another). The Appellant therein 

(Defendant No.1 herein) argued that the Suit ought to have failed 

on account of non-joinder of necessary parties as the son of Bal 

Krishna was not made a party to the Suit. This Court vide its 

Judgment, dated 22.04.2016, in the said RFA, remanded the matter 

back to the learned trial Court for impleadment of the legal heirs 

and successors of late Bal Krishna Dahal. The Plaintiffs filed their 

Amended Plaint, impleading the daughter of late Bal Krishna as 

Defendant No.4 in the instant Suit. The Defendants No.1 and 4 also 

filed their amended responses and the learned trial Court resettled 

the Issues for determination after the remand, as follows; 

"1. 
Whether the Suit is maintainable? 
Onus on Plaintiffs. 

2. 
Whether the Plaintiffs have right, title and 
interest in the suit property i.e., "jiwni 
land" being plot No.450? 
Onus on Plaintiffs. 
3. 
Whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to 
recover the suit land i.e. the "jiwni land" 
from the possession of the Defendant 
No.1? 
Onus on Plaintiffs. 
4. 
Whether the "jiwni land" can be mutated in 
the name of the Defendant Nos.1 and 4? 
Onus on Defendant Nos.1 and 4. (Issue

Onus on Defendant Nos.1 and 4. 
6. 
Whether the Defendant Nos.1 and 4 have 
already got their shares as per "banda

9. 
Whether Devi Kala Sharma has obtained 
the guardianship certificate fraudulently? 
Onus on Plaintiffs. (Issue framed vide

11. To what relief or reliefs, if any, are the 
Plaintiffs entitled? 
Onus on Plaintiffs." 

9.(i) 
The Plaintiffs, in order to establish their case, before the 

remand, had examined themselves as PW1 and PW2 and four other 

witnesses being Kunta Maya Dahal (she was variously numbered as 

"PW3" and "PW2" hence, hereinafter for convenience shall be 

referred to by name), PW3 Man Bahadur Kharka, PW6 Krishna 

Prasad Sapkota and PW7 Tanka Maya Adhikari. After remand, the 

Plaintiffs again examined themselves as PW1 and PW2 and one 

Laxuman Nepal, (son of Krishna Lall Nepal) as "PW1" and Ram 

Chandra Koirala as "PW2." Since Plaintiffs have also been numbered 

as "PW1" and "PW2," the witnesses above shall also be referred to 

by their names to avoid confusion. 

(ii) 
The Defendant No.1, before the remand, had examined 

herself as DW1, Tika Devi Sharma as DW2, Madhav Prasad Adhikari 

(he was variously numbered as "DW1" and "DW3" hence, 

hereinafter shall be referred to by name) and Dol Nath Gautam (he 

was variously numbered as "DW3" and "DW4" hence, hereinafter for 

convenience shall be referred to by name). After remand, she 

examined herself as DW1, Dhan Maya Adhikari as DW2, Dol Nath 

Gautam as DW3, Punya Prasad Adhikari (witness not numbered) 

and Ramesh Kumar Dahal as DW4. 


RFA No.10 of 2017

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

(iii) 
The Defendant No.4 examined one Laxuman Nepal, son 

of Jai Narayan Nepal as DW1 (to be distinguished from Laxuman 

Nepal, son of Krishna Lall Nepal, witness of the Plaintiffs), Madhav 

Prasad Adhikari as DW2, Tika Devi Sharma as DW3, Bishnu 

Khatiwada as DW4 and her legal guardian (Devi Kala Sharma) 

(witness not numbered). 

(iv) 
Defendants No.2 and 3 had no witnesses to examine. 

(v) 
It may be remarked here that the numbers allotted to 

the witnesses by the learned trial Court are slipshod and rather 

unhappily maintained, which should be discouraged. Due care ought 

to be taken by the concerned Court while numbering witnesses to 

avoid any conundrum in referring to them in the Judgment either by 

the learned trial Court itself or by the Appellate Court. The learned 

trial Court is expected to heed to this suggestion. 

10. 
The learned trial Court while taking up the Issues for 

consideration, took up Issue No.7 first and concluded that although 

the Plaintiffs did perform the death rites of their father, however, 

the evidence on record reflected that they had not taken care of him 

during his lifetime including the time of his ailment and therefore 

did not meet the dual conditions laid out in Exhibit "A." The Issue 

was decided against the Plaintiffs. Issue No.2 was next taken up for 

consideration and it was concluded that while the Plaintiffs had only 

performed the death rites of their father, late Bal Krishna had 

performed the death rites and also taken care of their father by 

incurring expenditure for their father"s treatment vide loans 

obtained from different persons and was, thus, entitled to the 

"jiwni" land to the exclusion of the Plaintiffs. This Issue also went 

against the Plaintiffs. Issues No.4, 5, 6 and 10 were taken up 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

10 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

together and relying on the provisions of the Sikkim Succession Act, 

2008, the learned trial Court held that the Defendant No.4 and the 

Defendant No.1 would be eligible to inherit the properties left 

behind by Bal Krishna, in equal portions and the said properties 

should be mutated in their names. While deciding Issues No.8 and 

9, it was concluded that there was nothing to suggest that the 

Guardianship Certificate was obtained by Devi Kala Sharma 

fraudulently and that the learned Family Court, East Sikkim had 

found Devi Kala Sharma competent to be the guardian of the minor 

Defendant No.4 therefore it could not be held that she had no such 

right. These Issues were also decided against the Plaintiffs. Issues 

No.1, 3 and 11 were taken up together and the Court concluded 

that the Plaintiffs are not entitled to the concerned "jiwni" land or its 

recovery. That, the Suit filed by them was clearly not maintainable 

and was thereby dismissed. 

11.(i) 
Advancing his arguments for the Plaintiffs, learned 

Senior Counsel walked this Court through the evidence of the 

parties and their witnesses as well as the findings of the learned 

trial Court and contended that a careful scrutiny of Exhibit "A" 

reveals that vide the document, Devi Prasad made no provision for 

the Defendant No.1 and he was concerned with bequeathing the 

"jiwni" property on his sons only. That, Defendant No.1 has falsely 

laid claim to it sans any intention of Devi Prasad. 

(ii) 
That, the Defendant No.2 not being a Civil Court, has 

passed the impugned Order, dated 03.11.2010, Exhibit 12, illegally 

ordering mutation of the "jiwni" land in favour of the Defendant 

No.1, in the teeth of the conditions laid down in the Partition Deed, 

Exhibit "A." 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

11 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

(iii) 
That, the Defendant No.1, besides being ineligible for 

the property, holds dual citizenship, being a Nepalese citizen also. 

Hence, the claim of the Defendant No.1 seeking mutation of the 

property and the Order of the Defendant No.2, dated 03.11.2010, 

have no legal validity. 

(iv) 
That, Issues No.4, 5 and 6 ought to have been decided 

in favour of the Plaintiffs and "jiwni" land granted to them, they 

having fulfilled both conditions mentioned in Exhibit "A." 

(v) 
That, the evidence reveals that the Plaintiffs were driven 

out from the main house by an intolerant Defendant No.1 with a 

"khukuri" (sharp edged weapon) and they thus had inimical 

relations, which their father was aware of. Despite the said 

circumstances, the Plaintiffs were expected to and did take care of 

their father although living away from the main house. After being 

driven out, the Plaintiff No.1 had to take shelter consecutively in the 

house of one Kunta Maya Dahal, Krishna Lall Nepal and Rinzing 

Tongden. Thereafter on passing his Class VIII, he secured 

Government employment. The Plaintiff No.2 similarly was 

constrained to leave the main house due to the ill-treatment of his 

father and step-mother and had taken shelter in the house of his 

sister, PW7 Tanka Maya Adhikari, who has substantiated this fact. 

Thus, the Plaintiffs were compelled to leave the main house which 

was not of their own volition. In spite of living separately from the 

main house, the Plaintiff No.1 replaced its thatched roof with GCI 

Sheets, this has been fortified by the evidence of PW6 Krishna 

Prasad Sapkota and PW7 Tanka Maya Adhikari and was not 

demolished in cross-examination. 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

12 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

(vi) 
While referring to the observation of the learned trial 

Court in Issue No.7, learned Senior Counsel contended that in fact 

late Devi Prasad used to visit both Plaintiffs in the absence of the 

Defendant No.1 and they extended financial help to him for the 

purposes of his medication and clothing. They also visited him when 

he was ill and this evidence has remained unimpeached. As their 

father was compelled to live with Defendant No.1 and her son Bal 

Krishna, the Plaintiffs could not take care of him directly but did so 

whenever the occasion arose. Devi Prasad left no documentary 

evidence to suggest that the Plaintiffs did not take care of him. 

That, the Defendant No.1 failed to examine any Doctor to establish 

that Devi Prasad was ailing for a decade while Defendant No.4, in 

cross-examination, could not stand by her evidence in this context. 

No Medical Certificates suggesting that Devi Prasad was ailing and 

bedridden were also furnished. DW Dol Nath Gautam, in fact, was 

only eleven years in 1985 when the Plaintiff No.1 was driven out but 

deposed that he was aware of the entire circumstance in which the 

Plaintiffs left the house therefore he cannot be said to be a truthful 

witness. The four Defence witnesses are also unreliable as their 

evidence were verbatim reproduction of each other"s statements. 

(vii) 
The learned trial Court while deciding Issues No.1, 2, 3, 

7 and 11 against the Plaintiffs failed to appreciate the 

uncontroverted evidence of their witnesses. 

(viii) 
PW Kunta Maya Dahal affirmed that the annual death 

rites were observed by the Plaintiffs besides stating that the 

Plaintiffs were present beside the body of their late father 

immediately after his death and her evidence remained 

uncontroverted as also the evidence of PW3 Man Bahadur Kharka 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

13 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

who deposed about Devi Prasad meeting the Plaintiffs. None of the 

DWs have disputed the evidence to the effect that the Plaintiffs 

performed the death rites of their father. 

(ix) 
The learned trial Court while concluding that the 

Plaintiffs had failed to prove that they maintained and looked after 

their late father did not discuss the yardstick required for such 

maintenance. That, the dual conditions were inserted into Exhibit 

"A" despite their father"s knowledge that the Plaintiffs lived 

separately from him which goes to establish that he had 

acknowledged that they had taken care of him during his lifetime. 

That, Bal Krishna had an advantageous position as he continued to 

live with his parents even after the partition and thereby could look 

after them directly. The learned trial Court observed that the 

Plaintiffs had failed to prove through documentary evidence that 

they had taken care of their father. In doing so, the Court failed to 

consider that children do not maintain books of accounts while 

rendering financial assistance to take care of their parents. Nor did 

the Court consider that the evidence of the witnesses pertaining to 

the Plaintiffs visiting their father, were not controverted in cross-

examination. 

(x) 
That, the observation of the learned trial Court 

regarding Hindu Law by Raghavachariar [N.R. Raghavachariar's Hindu 

Law] is totally misconceived and out of context. 

(xi) 
That, reliance on the Sikkim Succession Act of 2008 by 

the learned trial Court, is also erroneous as the Law was never 

enforced in the State of Sikkim. 

(xii) 
In view of all the facts and circumstances and the 

evidence on record, the prayers in the Plaint be granted and the 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

14 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

impugned Judgment and Decree of the learned trial Court be set 

aside as the Plaintiffs have proved that they complied with the 

terms of Exhibit "A" with regard to the "jiwni" land. 

12.(i) 
Learned Counsel for the Defendant No.1, repudiating 

the arguments of learned Senior Counsel for the Plaintiffs, 

contended that the Plaintiffs had filed the Suit only on their failure 

to obtain a favourable Order from the Defendant No.2, despite 

knowing fully well that the Plaintiff No.1 had failed to step into the 

main house from the year 1983-84. 

(ii) 
Learned Counsel also advanced the contention that the 

Plaintiffs had voluntarily left the house and separated from their 

father and the Defendant No.1. 

(iii) 
That, when their father was ailing for almost a decade, 

Bal Krishna along with the Defendant No.1 tended to him, providing 

for the house financially and also for his treatment, which has been 

extracted in the evidence of the Defendant No.1 duly supported by 

the evidence of her witnesses and of Defendant No.4. 

(iv) 
On his death, the Plaintiffs came reluctantly to the main 

house only on the request of the village elders and lit their father"s 

funeral pyre but offered no financial assistance. The evidence of the 

Defendant No.1 and her witnesses establishes as much. Contrarily, 

both Plaintiffs have no evidence to establish that they supported 

their father during his illness, took care of him in the Hospitals or 

contributed financially or morally during his illness. 

(v) 
It was contended that the Plaintiffs, by virtue of Exhibit 

"A," had already received sufficient landed property while the 

Defendant No.1, despite her contribution to the family, has not 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

15 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

inherited any property and she is entitled to fifty per cent of her 

husband"s property as per the Law of the land. 

13.(i) 
It was the next argument of the learned Counsel that 

the Plaintiffs had, only in the second Amended Plaint, at Paragraph 

22 "G," spun out a new story of having taken care of their father. 

To support this in evidence, sans pleadings, they deposed that the 

thatched roof of the main house was replaced by the Plaintiff No.1 

and that he was driven out by the Defendant No.1 and his father 

with a "khukuri." That, it is a well settled principle of Law that 

evidence adduced beyond the pleadings would not be admissible nor 

can any evidence be permitted to be adduced which is at variance 

with the pleadings. Such evidence is therefore to be disregarded. On 

this aspect, reliance was placed on Govind Singh v. Harchand Kaur 1 , M. 

Chinnasamy v. K.C. Palanisamy and Others 2 and Union of India v. 

Ibrahim Uddin and Another 3 . 

(ii) 
That, even if the roof had been replaced in 1978-79 as 

contended, it is evident that the Plaintiff No.1 was living in the main 

house at that time. The Plaintiff No.1 has admitted that he lived 

separately from his father and visited the house only on 23.09.2001 

on hearing of his father"s death. His further admission was that no 

custom in their family debars the females from shares in the family 

property and that none of his sisters were married when Exhibit "A" 

was executed. The Plaintiff No.2 also admitted to living separately

proves that it was not only the sons of Devi Prasad but all the 

children of the deceased, numbering fifteen, who performed his 

death rites. 

(iii) 
It was further canvassed by learned Counsel that the 

Plaintiffs have to prove their case "beyond a reasonable doubt" and 

the Plaintiffs must stand or fall on their own case. On this count, 

learned Counsel sought assistance from the ratio in Kiran Limboo v. 

Kussang Limboo 4 . 

(iv) 
Reliance was also placed on the provisions of Order VII 

Rules 1 and 3 and Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 

1908 ("CPC") and it was urged that the Suit must include the whole 

claim but the Plaintiffs have only sought for a declaration that they 

are entitled to the "jiwni" land. 

14.(i) 
DW Punya Prasad Adhikari, the witness for the 

Defendant No.1, has deposed that Defendant No.1 did not ill-treat 

the Plaintiffs. Placing reliance on the ratio of Karedla Parthasaradhi v. 

Gangula Ramanamma (Dead) Through Legal Representatives and Others 5 

and Sadhu Singh v. Gurdwara Sahib Narike & Ors. 6 , it was contended 

that the wife is the Class I heir of her husband and entitled to his 

properties on his death. That, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) 

Act, 2005 and Section 6 of the Act, in particular, removes 

discrimination by giving equal rights to daughters/widows in the 

Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary property for which strength was 

drawn from Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma 7 . That, accordingly the 

Defendant No.1 and the Defendant No.4 are entitled to fifty per cent 

each of the "jiwni" land despite the conditions laid down in Exhibit

(ii) 
Arguments were also advanced denying that Defendant 

No.1, late Bal Krishna Dahal and Devi Kala Sharma were citizens of 

Nepal. In this context, learned Counsel placed reliance on State of 

Andhra Pradesh v. Abdul Khader 9 . 

(iii) 
That apart, the Plaintiffs are well settled in life being 

Government employees and have received their respective shares of 

the property. 

(iv) 
That, this Court in its Judgment, dated 22.04.2016, in 

"RFA No.04 of 2014 (Smt. Indira Dahal v. Shri Nil Kumar Dahal and 

Another)" had held that "…Indisputably, Bal Krishna Dahal used to live 

with his parents, looked after them and had also performed the death rites 

of his father along with……" Hence, the observations of the learned 

trial Court in the impugned Judgment requires no interference. 

15. 
Learned Counsel Ms. Kunzang Choden Lepcha, 

appearing for the Defendant No.4 made no verbal submissions but 

filed her written synopsis of arguments reiterating the facts as 

averred in the pleadings and in sum and substance, also reiterating 

the arguments advanced by learned Counsel for the Defendant 

No.1. Learned Counsel led this Court through the evidence of the 

various witnesses and ultimately contended that the Defendant 

No.1, besides the Defendant No.4, is also entitled to fifty per cent of 

the "jiwni" land.

17. 
The submissions advanced by learned Counsel for the 

parties were heard at length and duly considered. The pleadings, all 

evidence, documents on record, the impugned Judgment and the 

citations placed at the Bar have also been perused. 

18.(i) 
Before embarking into a discussion on the merits of the 

matter, it is essential to point out here that the averments made by 

both Defendants No.1 and 4 in Paragraph "17" of their respective 

written statements inter alia reflects as follows; 

"17. ……..The said two pre conditions which are 
also acknowledged by the Honble High Court in its 
Judgment dated 22.04.2016 passed in RFA No.04 of 
2016 between Smt. Indira Dahal versus Shri Nil 
Kumar Dahal & another are "look after the parents 
and also perform death rites" which were not fulfilled 
by the Plaintiffs. It is only Defendant No.1 and her 
son, Bal Krishna Dahal who fulfill both this (sic 
"these") pre conditions and hence entitled to the 

JEWNI land as per the Hon'ble High Court…" 

(Emphasis supplied) 

(ii) 
Learned Counsel for the Defendant No.1 in his written 

arguments has inter alia contended as under; 

"………And finally when one comes to the case of 
respondent No. 4, it is not in doubt that Late Bal 

Krishna Dahal (the respondent No. 4 before this 

Hon'ble Court) had taken care of Late Devi Prasad 
Dahal during his lifetime and he had also performed 
his death rites thus fulfilling the twin conditions laid 
down in the Banda Patra. 
This was the observation of this Hon"ble Court 
way back on 22.04.2016 when Late Bal Krishna Dahal 
was not even impleaded as respondent No. 4 in the 
instant case in Judgment dated 22.04.2016 passed in 
R.F.A. No. 4 of 2014 at paragraph 15 concluded.-
"What stares one in the face is that the Appellant 
(Respondent No. 1/Defendant No. 1) bore one son Bal 
Krishna Dahal to Devi Prasad Dahal. It appears that 
the said Bal Krishna Dahal died in an accident in 
Nepal leaving behind his widow and a daughter. 

Indisputably, Bal Krishna Dahal used to live with his 
parents, looked after them and had also performed 

the death rites of his father along with his step 
brothers, the Respondent……….."." 

(iii) 
The Defendant No.4, in her written arguments stated 

that the Defendant No.1, at Paragraph "3" of her Additional 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

19 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

Evidence-on-Affidavit (Exhibit D1/G), has affirmed that, "The Hon"ble 

High Court in its Judgment dated 22.04.2016 passed in RFA No. 04 of 

2016 came to the conclusion that only my son, Bal Krishna Dahal fulfill the 

two conditions "look after the parents and also perform death rites", 

specifically laid down in the Banda Patra dated 17.05.1985 Exhibit D1/A 

is the Judgment dated 22.04.2016 passed in RFA No. 04 of 2016." 

19. 
It is imperative to clarify here that the interpretation 

given to the Judgment of this Court in RFA No.04 of 2014 (supra) as 

reflected in the averments of the Written Statements of the 

Defendant No.1 and Defendant No.4 and their written arguments, 

are misleading, erroneous and mischievous. It is necessary to refer 

herein to the Judgment and extract the relevant portion thereof; 

"15. What stares one in the face is that the 
Appellant bore one son Bal Krishna Dahal to Devi 
Prasad Dahal. It appears that the said Bal Krishna 
Dahal died in an accident in Nepal leaving behind his 
widow and a daughter. Indisputably, Bal Krishna 
Dahal, used to live with his parents, looked after them 
and had also performed the death rites of his father 
along with his step brothers, the Respondents. 
Although the Learned Trial Court in its Judgment has 
alluded to the fact that Bal Krishna Dahal looked after 
and maintained his late father as well as performed 
the death rites, however, in paragraph 56 of the 
impugned Judgment has recorded inter alia, that 
"…………..….It may be necessary to mention that though 
the younger son of late Devi Prasad Dahal, Bal Krishna 
(since deceased) also maintained/looked after and 
performed the death ritual of their father, however, 
neither his legal heir and successor were made parties in 
the present suit nor any of them came as interested 
party to claim the said Jiwni land, as such, it is not 
necessary to go into the details." 
……………………………………………………………………………………... 
23. It is hereby ordered that the legal heirs and 
successors of Bal Krishna Dahal be impleaded as 
Defendants in the Title Suit which shall be readmitted 
to its original number in the Register of Civil Suits of 
the Learned Court of the District Judge, Special 
Division-I, Sikkim at Gangtok. The Suit be determined 
as per Law within six months from today in view of 
the fact that the Title Suit is of the year 2010." 

(Emphasis supplied) 

From a reading of the above, it is clear that this Court had observed 

that Bal Krishna lived with his parents, looked after them and also 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

20 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

performed the death rites of his father "along" with his step 

brothers i.e. the Plaintiffs. The adverb "along" which obtains in the 

relevant sentence, has to be read in its correct perspective. It is 

clear that no decision with regard to the merits of the case has been 

made, as sought to be insinuated by the Defendant No.1 and 

Defendant No.4. The facts and circumstances at that juncture were 

duly considered and direction issued by this Court to implead the 

descendants of late Bal Krishna on account of his admitted role in 

his family. The Judgment, by no stretch of the imagination stated 

that only Bal Krishna fulfilled both the conditions. Such an 

erroneous interpretation cannot be given to the decision of this 

Court in the RFA supra and parties ought to refrain from such 

misrepresentation. 

20. 
That having been said, while perusing the averments of 

the parties in their pleadings, it is clear that the Plaintiffs claim to be 

governed by the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law while the 

Defendants No.1 and 4 deny it, asserting that they were governed 

by the Law of the land. The learned trial Court ought to have settled 

an issue for determination on this point in view of the provisions of 

Order XIV of the CPC, which inter alia provides that Issues arise 

when a material proposition of fact or Law is affirmed by the one 

party and denied by the other. Nonetheless, this matter shall be 

taken up for discussion herein. Accordingly, the questions that fall 

for consideration before this Court are; 

(i) 
Whether the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law was 

applicable to the Plaintiffs?; 

(ii) 
Who is entitled to succeed to the "jiwni" land of 

deceased Devi Prasad Dahal?; and 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

21 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

(iii) 
Whether the Defendant No.1 is entitled to fifty per 

cent of the "jiwni" land despite the conditions laid 

down in the testamentary disposition of the Partition 

Deed, Exhibit "A"? 

21. 
Taking up the first question framed hereinabove, in the 

first instance, we may relevantly examine whether there are Laws of 

Succession in the State protected by the provisions of Article 371-F 

of the Constitution of India ("Constitution"). Necessary reference is 

made to the provisions of Article 371-F(k), (l) and (n) of the 

Constitution which provides; 

"371-F. Special provisions with respect to the 

State of Sikkim.-Notwith-standing anything in this 
Constitution,-
……………………………………………………………………………… 
(k) all laws in force immediately before the 
appointed day in the territories comprised in the State 
of Sikkim or any part thereof shall continue to be in 
force therein until amended or repealed by a 
competent Legislature or other competent authority; 
……………………………………………………………………………… 
(l) for the purpose of facilitating the application 
of any such law as is referred to in clause (k) in 
relation to the administration of the State of Sikkim 
and for the purpose of bringing the provisions of any 
such law into accord with the provisions of this 
Constitution, the President may, within two years 
from the appointed day, by order, make such 
adaptations and modifications of the law, whether by 
way of repeal or amendment, as may be necessary or 
expedient, and thereupon, every such law shall have 
effect subject to the adaptations and modifications so 
made, and any such adaptation or modification shall 
not be questioned in any court of law; 
……………………………………………………………………………… 
(n) the President may, by public notification, 
extend with such restrictions or modifications as he 
thinks fit to the State of Sikkim any enactment which 
is in force in a State of India at the date of the 
notification; 
………………………………" 

These provisions are self-explanatory and have been extracted to 

elucidate the position of the old Laws in Sikkim as well as provisions 

existing for extension and enforcement of the Laws of the country to 

the State, consequent upon the 36 th Amendment Act to the 

Constitution, whereby Sikkim became a part of the Indian Union.

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

22. 
It was the vehement argument of learned Counsel for 

the Defendant No.1 that the parties are bound by the Law of the 

land which do not differentiate between men and women in terms of 

Succession thereby entitling Defendant No.1 to fifty per cent of her 

husband"s property. No specific Law was brought forth for the 

perusal of this Court by the Defendant No.1. It may be noticed that 

lex terrae or Law of the land refers to Laws within a country or 

region, but no effort was made by the Defendant No.1 to clarify 

either the "Law" or the "land" referred to in view of the afore-

extracted provisions of Article 371-F of the Constitution. Before the 

learned trial Court, reliance had been placed by the Defendant No.1 

on the Sikkim Succession Act, 2008, therefore it can be safely 

presumed that this was the Statute being referred to. The fate that 

this Law has met will be discussed later. 

23. 
The contention of the Defendant No.1 was that both 

Plaintiffs in their cross-examination, admitted that they belonged to 

the Brahmin community and follow their community traditions and 

customs and were unaware of the words "Mitakshara School" or 

what it stood for. 

24. 
In the light of the statement relating to customs and 

traditions extracted supra from the Plaintiffs in cross-examination, it 

would be relevant to examine what "Customs" are and the method 

of proof of such "Customs" for Courts to take it into consideration 

for the purposes of adjudication. In Halsbury's Laws of England, 

(Fourth Edition), Volume 12(1), the attributes of "Custom" was 

enumerated as follows; 

"606. Essential attributes. To be valid, a custom 
must have four essential attributes: (1) it must be 
immemorial; (2) it must be reasonable; (3) it must be 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

23 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

certain in its terms, and in respect both of the locality 
where it is alleged to obtain and of the persons whom 
it is alleged to affect; and (4) it must have continued 
as of right and without interruption since its 
immemorial origin. These characteristics serve a 
practical purpose as rules of evidence when the 
existence of a custom is to be established or refuted. 

[Page No.160] 

626. Nature of proof. All customs of which the 
courts do not take judicial notice must be clearly 
proved to exist, the onus of establishing them being 
upon the parties relying upon their existence. Proof 
must be made either by matter of record or by 
evidence of usage since time immemorial. Evidence to 
prove a custom must not only be consistent with the 
custom which is alleged, but must also prove a 
custom which is no wider than that alleged. If the 
evidence tends to prove a custom wider than that 
which is alleged, the party seeking to establish the 
custom is not at liberty to adopt part only of the 
evidence and to reject the rest. 

[Page No.177] 

627. Usual method of proof. In proving an 
immemorial custom, the usual course taken is to call 
persons of middle or old age to state that in their 
time, usually at least half a century, the custom has 
always prevailed. This is considered, in the absence of 
countervailing evidence, to show that the custom has 
existed from all time. There are two sorts of 
countervailing evidence. First, other old person may 
be called to show that there was an interruption 
during the period spoken of by the first set of 
witnesses; secondly, evidence may be given that, 
from the nature of the case, it was quite impossible 
that such a right should have existed from time 
immemorial, or that there is some legal difficulty or 
obstacle in the way which makes the alleged assertion 
of the right incompatible with the law of the country. 
Whether the evidence supports the custom as alleged 
or not is a question of fact for the court. A custom 
possible in law, being reasonable and otherwise 
fulfilling the requisites of a good custom, may be 
established by very slender evidence. 

[Page No.178] 

The extracts supra throw light on what comprises "Customs" and 

the usual method of proof required. 

25. 
In Ass Kaur (Smt.) (Deceased) by LRs. v. Kartar Singh 

(Dead) by LRs. and Others 10 , a two Judge Bench of the Hon"ble 

Supreme Court observed that in the absence of any proof of 

custom, indisputably the Hindu Law would apply.

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

26. 
As far back as in 1908, in Daya Ram v. Sohel Singh 11 , the 

Chief Court of Punjab while dealing with the true effect of Section 5 

of the Punjab Laws Act, 1872, Robertson, J held as follows; 

"In all cases it appears to me under this Act, it 
lies upon the person asserting that he is ruled in 
regard to a particular matter by custom, to prove that 
he is so governed, and not by personal law, and 
further to prove what the particular custom is. There 
is no presumption created by the clause in favour of 
custom; on the contrary, it is only when the custom is 
established that it is to be the rule of decision. The 
Legislature did not show itself enamored of custom 
rather than law nor does it show any tendency to 
extend the 'principles' of custom to any matter to 
which a rule of custom is not clearly proved to apply. 
It is not the spirit of Customary Law, nor any theory 
of custom or deductions from other customs which is 
to be a rule of decision, but only 'any custom 
applicable to the parties concerned which is not...' 
and it therefore, appears to me clear that when either 

party to a suit sets up 'custom' as a rule of decision, 
it lies upon him to prove the custom which he seeks 
to apply; if he fails to do so Clause (b) of Section 5 of 
the Laws Act applies, and the rule of decision must 
be the personal law of the parties subject to the 
other provisions of the clause." 

(Emphasis supplied) 

27. 
In H.H. Mir Abdul Hussain Khan v. Bibi Sona Dero 12 , the 

question of custom came up for consideration in view of the 

difference in opinions of the Court of first instance and the Court of 

Appeal. The District Court held that the custom was established and 

the Court of the Judicial Commissioner of Sind decided that custom 

was not established. The Appeal arose from the latter decision and 

the Hon"ble Supreme Court inter alia observed as follows; 

"6. ……It is therefore incumbent upon the 
plaintiff to allege and prove the custom on which he 
relies, and it becomes important to consider the 
nature and extent of the proof required. Their 
Lordships have carefully considered the difficulty of 
applying all the strict rules that govern the 
establishment of custom in this country to 
circumstances which find no analogy here. Custom 
binding inheritance in a particular family has long 
been recognised in India (see Soorendronath Roy v. 
Mussamut Heeramonee Burmoneah (1868) 12 M.I.A. 
81, although such a custom is unknown to the law of 

11 (1908) P.R. No.110 1906, F.B. 
12 MANU/PR/0125/1917 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

25 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

this country and is foreign to its spirit. Customs 
affecting descent in certain areas or customs 
affecting-rights of inhabitants of a particular district 
are perhaps the nearest analogies in this country. …… 
……………………………………………………………………………………… 
19. In every case of this kind the burden of 
proof lies heavily upon the plaintiff, and though his 
evidence may consist of a number of striking 
instances in support of his case, it receives a severe 
blow when prominent members of the families 
concerned deny that the custom exists. 
…………………………" 

A reading of this Judgment thus reflects that the Hon"ble Judges 

were aware of the myriad of castes and customs of the country and 

that custom in one family may not necessarily be the custom of 

another family and thereby the lack of uniformity in customs. In 

other words, it is accepted in our country that every family may 

have their own customs but it is for the person asserting it to 

establish that such a custom exists by sufficient proof, as laid down 

in Daya Ram v. Sohel Singh and H.H. Mir Abdul Hussain Khan (supra). 

28. 
In Ujagar Singh v. Jeo 13 the Hon"ble Supreme Court held 

inter alia as follows; 

"13. It therefore appears to us that the ordinary 
rule is that all customs, general or otherwise, have to 
be proved. Under s. 57 of the Evidence Act however 
nothing need be proved of which courts can take 
judicial notice. Therefore it is said that if there is a 
custom of which the courts can take judicial notice, it 
need not be proved. Now the circumstances in which 
the courts can take judicial notice of a custom were 
stated by Lord Dunedin in Raja Rama Rao v. Raja of 
Pittapur I.L.R. (1918) IndAp 148, in the following 
words, "When a custom or usage, whether in regard 
to a tenure or a contract or a family right, is 
repeatedly brought to the notice of the Courts of a 
country, the Courts may hold that custom or usage to 
be introduced into the law without necessity of proof 
in each individual case." When a custom has been so 
recognised by the courts, it passes into the law of the 
land and the proof of it then becomes unnecessary 
under s. 57(1) of the Evidence Act. It appears to us 
that in the courts in the Punjab the expression 
"general custom" has really been used in this sense, 
namely, that a custom has by repeated recognition by 
courts, become entitled to judicial notice as was said 
in Bawa Singh v. Mt. Taro A.I.R. 1951 Simla 239 and 

13 MANU/SC/0187/1959 


RFA No.10 of 2017

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

Sukhwant Kaur v. Balwant Singh A.I.R. 1951 Simla 
242.. 
…………………………………………………………………………………… 
30. It was then said that in the plaint it had 
been admitted by the respondent that there was a 
general custom as alleged by the appellant and so no 
proof of that general custom was required in this 
case. We do not think this contention is justified. No 
doubt in her plaint the respondent referred to a 
custom entitling her to succeed and termed it a 
special custom. We are unable to read the reference 
to a special custom as amounting to an admission of a 
general custom or its terms. 
…………………………………………………………………………………… 
41. As we have earlier said this observation was 
approved by the Judicial Committee in Abdul Hussain 
Khan v. Bibi Sona Dero I.L.R.(1917) IndAp 10. In 
Fatima Bibi v. Shah Nawaz I.L.R. (1920) Lah. 98., a 
case to which we have earlier referred, the Court 
allowed the plaintiff's sisters, who had based their 
claim on custom and not on the personal law, to fall 
back on Mohammedan law, the personal law of the 
parties, on their failure to establish the custom, no 
custom against them having been proved by the 
collaterals. There are a number of other authorities, 

to which it is not necessary to refer, in which 
personal law was resorted to when no custom on 
either side was established. We agree that is the 

correct view to take. We therefore think that even if 
the respondent had been unable to prove the custom 
in her favour she is entitled to succeed in the suit on 
the basis of the personal law of the parties, namely, 
the Hindu law." 

(Emphasis supplied) 

It thus follows that where custom is not established, the personal 

Law of the parties becomes applicable. 

29. 
To be fair to the Plaintiffs, it was not their averment in 

the pleadings that their family had established customs for 

Succession. The statement, as already reflected above, came to be 

extracted in cross-examination in which both Plaintiffs made 

identical statements viz.; 

"………….It is true that I belonged(sic) to the 
Brahmin community and we follow our own traditions 
and customs as per the said community. It is true 
that I am not aware of the word Mitakshara School 
and I cannot say what it stands for. ……………" 

However, as seen from the text of Halsbury (supra) and the catena 

of ratiocination referred to above, if a person claims governance by 

custom, he is to prove it to enable the Courts to apply it, failing 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

27 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

which the personal Law of the parties will be applicable. Ironically, 

from the evidence on record neither have the Plaintiffs been able to 

establish by furnishing any evidence, the customs followed either in 

their community or specifically in their family nor has the Defendant 

No.1, for her part, been able to show any Law of the land which 

confers rights on her to acquire her husband"s property. 

30. 
Assuming that the reference made by the Defendant 

No.1 was to the Sikkim Succession Act, 2008, it may pertinently be 

pointed out here that a Division Bench of this High Court in Basanti 

Rai and Ors. v. State of Sikkim and Ors. 14 was considering the legality 

and validity of the said Statute issued vide Notification 

No.22/LD/P/2008, dated 24.07.2008, of the Law Department, 

Government of Sikkim. In the said Writ Petition, the State 

Government in its Return, clearly stated that the Act is only on 

paper and has not yet been notified, as required, to bring the same 

into force and contended that the Petition was premature. This 

Court, on examining the reply filed by the State-Respondents, vide 

its Order, dated 31.07.2017, concluded as follows; 

"4. ……that the Sikkim Succession Act, 2008 is 

not yet enforced, the same having not been notified 
as yet. Consequently, Orders, if any, passed by the 
Authorities, in terms of the provisions of the Sikkim 
Succession Act, 2008, are declared null and void ab 
initio. Examination of the validity of an enactment, 
which is nonexistent, is not required, as it is pre-

mature. ……" 

31. 
In the absence of any established custom of the parties 

pertaining to Succession, any State enactment occupying the field 

and the absence of personal Law, the quandary therefore would now 

be how the matter is to be adjudicated upon. At this juncture, it is 

thus imperative that we refer to the ratiocination of Sonam Topgyal 

14 2017 SCC OnLine Sikk 123

Bhutia v. Gompu Bhutia 15 , decided on 14.06.1979, by a Division 

Bench of this High Court, comprising of M.S. Gujral, C.J. and A.M. 

Bhattacharjee, J. The Court was concerned with a matter relating to 

Wills and whether Buddhists in Sikkim can legally make 

testamentary disposition. It was also specified that though this point 

was not taken up by any of the parties in their pleadings or 

otherwise but had cropped up during the hearing of the Appeal. The 

Court was of the opinion that the question would go to the root of 

the matter and was of general public importance in Sikkim as there 

was no judicial pronouncement of the Court or any other Court on 

this point. It was observed therein as follows; 

"9. There is no doubt that in Sikkim, there is, as 

yet, no statutory law authorising testamentary 
disposition. But as will appear from the unchallenged 
evidence of the witnesses appearing before us, in 
practice Wills had been and have been recognised, 
acted upon and given effect to in the Courts of Sikkim 
as valid modes of post-mortem disposition of 
properties and witnesses Sarki Bhutia, Karma Pintso 
Bhutia and T.D. Densapa have also referred to several 
instances of the execution of Will by Sikkimese-
Buddhists. The question before us is whether Wills in 
Sikkim can be regarded to be valid and legal without 
any legislative provision to that effect. The Shastric 
Hindu Law did not recognise testamentary disposition 
and statutory provisions had to be made by and under 
the provisions of the Hindu Wills Act, 1870, 
empowering the Hindus to make Wills. Buddhism also 
favoured intestacy and as pointed out by the Privy 
Council in Dwe Maung v. Khoo Haung Shein (AIR 
1925 PC 29 at p. 31), according to "the strict 
Buddhist view" "intestacy is compulsory". As the 
personal laws of the Hindus and Buddhists did not 
recognise testamentary disposition, doubts have 
arisen as to whether the Hindus and Buddhists in 
Sikkim can validly make Wills in the absence of 
legislative provisions. 
…………………………………………………………………………………… 

26. But though there is no legislation in Sikkim 
relating to Wills, the Courts in Sikkim have followed 
and applied the provisions of the Indian Succession 
Act, 1925 in all matters relating to Wills including 
granting of Probates and Letters of Administration. 
The question, therefore, is whether the provisions 

15 AIR 1980 Sikk 33 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

29 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

relating to Wills in the Indian Succession Act, 1925, 
which have never been formally adopted in or 
extended to Sikkim by any formal legislative authority 
are to be regarded as laws in force in Sikkim? 
Salmond has defined law as a body of principles 
recognised 
and 
applied 
by 
the 
State 
in 
the administration of Justice and as to consist of "of 
the rules recognised and acted on by Courts of 
justice". Holland has defined law as "a rule of external 
human action enforced by a Sovereign political 
authority." Therefore, the provisions relating to Wills 
in the Indian Succession Act, 1925, having so long 
been "recognised" "applied" and "acted on" by the 
Courts of justice in Sikkim in the administration of 
justice in matters relating to Wills, are also to be 
regarded as Laws in force in Sikkim. 
27. In other words the statutory laws relating to 
Wills as contained in the Indian Succession Act, 1925 
have, as a result of their continuous and systematic 
recognition and application by the Courts in Sikkim, 
become the non-statutory laws of Sikkim. Law does 
not and need not always flow formally or directly from 
a legislative authority. For otherwise, personal laws, 
customary laws, common laws or even precedents 
cannot be regarded as laws. Reference in this 
connection may be made to a recent decision of 
Sikkim High Court in Asharam Agarwala v. Union of 
India, (reported in 1978 Sikkim LJ 18) where it has 
been held that though the Arbitration Act, 1940 has 
never been formally made applicable in Sikkim, yet 
the provisions of the said Act, having so long been 
recognised, applied and acted upon by the Courts of 
Justice in Sikkim in the administration of justice in 
matters relating to Arbitration, are to be regarded as 
laws in force in Sikkim, though not as direct statutory 
laws. In dealing with the question as to whether such 
non-statutory laws could or can also create 
jurisdictions for the Courts to entertain applications, 
appeals and other proceedings under the said Act, it 
has been observed as hereunder:-
"If as already noted, Courts in Sikkim have all 
along not only applied the provisions of the 
Arbitration Act in between the parties to 
arbitration but have also applied the provisions 
relating to entertainment of all applications and 
appeals as provided in the said Act, then the 
latter provisions also, as a result of application 
and recognition by Courts, became the laws in 
force within the meaning of Article 371-F(K) of 
the Constitution whereunder all laws in force in 
Sikkim immediately before the commencement 
of the Constitution (Thirty-Sixth Amendment) 
Act, 1975, shall continue in force until amended 
or repealed by a competent Legislature or other 
competent authority. In other words, if by and 
under the Laws of Sikkim, though not statutory, 
the Courts had been exercising the jurisdiction to 
entertain applications relating to arbitration 
matters and also appeals therefrom, such laws 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

30 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

and jurisdiction have also continued and shall 
continue in force." 
28. Following this decision, I would hold that not 
only the provisions relating to the execution, 
interpretation or effect of Wills in the Indian 
Succession Act, 1925, but all the provisions therein 
relating to Wills including the provisions relating to 
grants of Probate and Letters of Administration and 
also appeals and other proceedings therefrom have 
become the laws of Sikkim. ……" 

32. 
On the same lines, in Bishnu Kala Karki Dholi and Others v. 

Bishnu Maya Darjeeni, Civil First Appeal No.8 of 1976, decided earlier 

on, viz. 06.03.1978 by the same Bench of this High Court, the two 

questions requiring determination in the Appeal were, whether a 

mortgager is entitled to file a Suit and to obtain a decree for 

redemption of mortgage, where a Deed of mortgage is invalid for 

want of registration and, if not, whether the mortgager is entitled in 

such a Suit to a decree for recovery of possession on proof of title. 

Speaking for the Court, Justice A.M. Bhattacharjee while considering 

and observing that the Transfer of Property Act had not been 

extended and enforced in the State of Sikkim then, held as follows; 

"9. ………The observation quoted above should be 
read with the observation of the Supreme Court in the 
above noted decision in Namdeo v. Narmada Bai (AIR 
1953 Supreme Court 228 at p. 230) quoted 
hereinbelow:-
"It is axiomatic that the Courts must apply 
the principles of justice, equity and good 
conscience to transactions which come up 
before them for determination even though 
the statutory provisions of the Transfer of 
Property Act are not made applicable to 
these transactions. It follows therefore that 
the provisions of the Act which are but a 
statutory recognition of the rules of justice, 
equity and good conscience also governs 
those transfers." 
And when so read will lead to the conclusion that 
even though the Transfer of Property Act does not 
formally apply in Sikkim, the Courts in Sikkim, in 
discharging their paramount duty to act in the 
absence of statutory provisions, according to the 
principles of justice, equity and good conscience 
should reasonable(sic) and properly apply the 
principles contained in Section 60 of the Transfer of 
Property Act relating to redemption of mortgage and 
unenforceability of any clog on the right of 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

31 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

redemption. This is what was also done by the 
Rajasthan High Court in Dev Karan v. Murarilal (ILR 
1958 Rajasthan 811) in a case arising from the 
former State of Alwar before the extension of the 
Transfer of Property Act thereto and this decision has 
been affirmed by the Supreme Court in Murarilal v. 
Devkaran (AIR 1965 SC 225) and relying in the 
observations made therein at page 231, I would hold 
that it would be reasonable to assume that the Civil 
Courts established in Sikkim, like Civil Courts all over 
India, were and are required to administer justice 
according to the principles of equity and justice where 
there was or is no specific statutory provision to deal 
with the question before them and, therefore, it would 
be just and proper to apply the principles contained in 
Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act relating to 
the right of redemption and clog on the equity of 
redemption." 

33. 
In Jas Bahadur Rai v. Putra Dhan Rai, 1978 (3) Sikkim Law 

Journal, decided on 29.07.1978, the same Bench of this High Court, 

while considering whether the provisions of the Indian Easements 

Act, 1882, should be applied in Sikkim sans extension or 

enforcement of the Law, in the absence of any corresponding Law 

on the point, in Sikkim, held as follows; 

"3. The Indian Easements Act, 1882, was never 
formally adopted in Sikkim prior to its incorporation in 
the Union of India; nor the same has been extended 
to Sikkim by any notification under Article 371-F (n) 
of the Constitution of India or otherwise; and neither 
there was nor there is any corresponding statutory 
law relating to easement or licence in force in Sikkim. 
But when a point for decision was not covered by the 
provision of any law in force in Sikkim, the Courts in 
Sikkim, from long before its incorporation in the Union 
of India, have followed the principles of laws in force 
in India in deciding such a point, if such principles 
appeared to them to be based on or in consonance 
with the principles of justice, equity and good 
conscience. If this is characterized as making of laws 
by Courts, it may be pointed out that the very same 
thing was done by the Courts in India during the 
early British period when legislative laws in India were 
scanty and the Courts in India freely followed and 
adopted the principles of the English law in deciding 
points not covered by the provisions of the Indian 
laws in force. As is well-known, India was then a 
country which was almost empty of legislative laws 
and the void was to a great extent filled up by Courts 
through their decisions by importing the principles of 
English law, both common and statutory. 
4. ………………………………………………………………… 
5. The principles contained in the Section quoted 
above are no doubt based on justice, equity and good 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

32 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

conscience as has been held by the Division Bench of 
the Allahabad High Court in Mathuri versus Bhola 
Nath (AIR 1934 Allahabad 517) and the principles of 
this section have been applied in those parts of India 
where this Easements Act does not expressly extend 
and apply. As I have already pointed out, the Courts 
in Sikkim have freely applied the provisions of Indian 
Laws in cases not specifically covered by the laws in 
Sikkim, if the relevant provisions of the Indian laws 
appeared -to them to be consonant with the 
principles of equity and justice. In my view, therefore, 
the provisions of Section 60, Indian Easements Act, 
1882 can be invoked and should be applied in Sikkim 
in the absence of any corresponding law in Sikkim on 
the point. I would repeat that if this amounts to 
making of laws by Courts, the Courts in Sikkim will 
have to continue to do so until the field is occupied or 
is substantially occupied by specific laws. ………" 

34. 
In the decision of Durga Prasad Pradhan v. Palden Lama, 

Second Appeal No.1 of 1980, decided on 03.06.1981, the Division 

Bench of this High Court while considering the submissions of 

Counsel for the Respondent that the Specific Relief Act of 1963 had 

not been extended to Sikkim and therefore did not apply to Sikkim, 

held as follows; 

"5. ………………It is true that the Specific Relief 
Act, 1963, does not apply in Sikkim and there is no 
statutory law in Sikkim on this subject. But it is now 
beyond doubt that even if an enactment does not 
extend and apply to any area ex proprio vigore, but 
the enactment contains provisions which are statutory 
embodiment of the rules of equity and justice, such 
provisions have been, are and may be applied by the 
Courts to transactions beyond such area, in the 
absence of any law operating therein. ……" 

35. 
It may also be recounted here that Justice A.M. 

Bhattacharjee, J in his notes sent to the Law Commission of Sikkim, 

reported in 1978 (3) Sikkim Law Journal, at Page 4, wrote as follows; 

"………………………………… 

The provisions of the Hindu Law and the 
Mahomedan Law having been so long applied, 
recognised, administered, enforced and acted upon by 
the State and its Judicial Organ, the Courts of Sikkim, 
the provisions so applied became laws in Sikkim and 
have continued as laws under the principle enunciated 
in those Privy Council and Supreme Court cases and 
have actually been continued as laws under the 
provisions of Clause (k) of Article 371F of the 
Constitution 
whereunder 
"all 
laws 
in 
force 
immediately before the applinted(sic) day in the 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

33 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

territories comprised in the State of Sikkim or any 
part thereof shall continue to be in force therein until 
amended or repealed by a competent Legislature or 
other competent authority." The provisions of the 
Hindu Law and the Mahomedan Law, therefore, to the 
extent they have been applied, recognised, 
administered, enforced and acted upon by the Courts 
in Sikkim before its incorporation in the Union of 
India, still continue as laws in force under the 
mandate of Article 371F (k). ……………………… 
I am, therefore, of opinion that notwithstanding 
the absence of any statutory provisions making Hindu 
Law and Mahomedan Law applicable to Hindus and 
Mahomedans in Sikkim, the provisions of Hindu Law 
and Mahomedan Law would apply to Hindus and 
Mahomedans of Sikkim to the extent those have been 
applied, recognised, administered, enforced and acted 
upon by the Courts of Sikkim prior to its incorporation 
in the Union of India. …………………………" 

36. 
Relying on the various ratio referred to hereinabove and 

on the bedrock of the reasoning thereon, it is evident that where 

there is no existing old Law on a particular subject in Sikkim or 

where the Law is scanty or inadequate, the Courts in Sikkim also 

being Courts of equity, justice and good conscience, have to turn to 

the Laws of the country. It is but apposite to notice that the Courts 

in Sikkim, even prior to being part of the Indian Union have followed 

principles of Law in force in India if the principles were based on 

justice, equity and good conscience, as already reflected in the 

plethora of ratio of this High Court referred to above. In Jas Bahadur 

Rai (supra), it may be reiterated that it was observed as follows; 

"5.……In my view, therefore, the provisions of 

Section 60, Indian Easements Act, 1882 can be 
invoked and should be applied in Sikkim in the 
absence of any corresponding law in Sikkim on the 

point. I would repeat that if this amounts to making 
of laws by Courts, the Courts in Sikkim will have to 

continue to do so until the field is occupied or is 

substantially occupied by specific laws. ……" 

(Emphasis supplied) 

Considering that the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, 

has not been extended or enforced in the State, nor does any 

corresponding Statute occupy the field in the State, it would, in the 

circumstances be just and proper to look to and apply the principles 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

34 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

contained in the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, for the purposes of 

considering matters relating to Succession in Sikkim, for persons to 

whom it applies as personal Law. 

37. 
The parties are Hindu Brahmins. This is not disputed. 

Their father Devi Prasad divided the property amongst his three 

sons contemporaneously which was consented to by all without any 

objection. As under the Mitakshara Law, the father i.e. Devi Prasad 

had the power to divide the family property during his lifetime and 

exercised his power, as evident from Exhibit "A" which is admitted 

to by all parties, thus, for all intents and purposes, it can be gauged 

that their family was following the principles of the Mitakshara 

School of Hindu Law. The above discussions soundly answers the 

first question settled for determination by this Court. 

38. 
Now to address the second question flagged, under the 

Mitakshara School of Hindu Law, each son and now daughters vide 

the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, in Section 6, are 

coparceners in their own right and upon birth, take an equal interest 

in the ancestral property, whether movable or immovable. Thus, 

being entitled to a share, they can seek partition. If they do so, the 

effect in Law is not only a separation of the father from the sons but 

a separation inter se, the consent of the sons is not necessary for 

the exercise of that power. However, no Hindu father joined with his 

sons and governed by the Mitakshara Law although vested with the 

power to partition the property can make a partition of the joint 

family property by Will. In Kalyani (Dead) by Lrs. v. Narayanan and 

Others 16 , the Hon"ble Supreme Court has propounded this principle. 

Once partition is complete, the property then becomes the separate 

16 1980 Supp SCC 298 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

35 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

property of each of the coparceners, however, in the hands of the 

son, the property will be ancestral property and the natural or 

adopted son of that son will take interest in it and be entitled to it 

by survivorship and joint family property. [See Mullah's Hindu Law, 

22 nd Edition, Chapter XII]. The Hon"ble Supreme Court in C.N. 

Arunachala Mudaliar v. C.A. Muruganatha Mudaliar and Another 17 

considered the question as to where a Hindu, instead of requiring 

his self-acquired or separate property to go by descent, makes a 

gift of it to his son, or bequeaths it to him by Will, whether such 

property is the separate property of the son or whether it is 

ancestral in the hands of the son as regards his male and female 

issues. It was observed that if there are no clear words describing 

the kind of interest intended to be given, the Court would have to 

collect the intention from the language of the document, taken 

along with the surrounding circumstances in accordance with the 

established cannons of construction. 

39. 
It is apparent from the records, that the parties are in 

agreement that the property partitioned amongst the Plaintiffs and 

the deceased Bal Krishna, were ancestral properties. Late Devi 

Prasad, during his lifetime, vide Exhibit "A," partitioned all movable 

and immovable property amongst his three sons, the Plaintiffs being 

his sons from his first wife and Bal Krishna being the son from his 

second wife, the Defendant No.1. He set aside some property for 

himself during the said partition, for his sustenance during his 

lifetime, known in common local parlance as "jiwni." Admittedly, 

Exhibit "A" was prepared by Devi Prasad in his full consciousness 

and consented to by his three sons, duly witnessed by the 

17 AIR 1953 SC 495 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

36 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

Panchayat and the village elders, who also affixed their signatures 

on the document along with the Plaintiffs. On partition, the share of 

Devi Prasad became his separate property, and he was free to 

dispose it off as he thought fit including bequeathing it by a Will. 

Exhibit "A" is thus, not only a Deed of Partition but a testamentary 

disposition for the "jiwni" property of Devi Prasad. On pain of 

repetition, it may be stated that vide Exhibit "A," Devi Prasad laid 

down conditions viz. "father"s "jiwni" share would go to the son who 

would look after and perform death rites." It needs to be clarified 

here that he has not mentioned "parents" as claimed by the 

Defendant No.1 and Devi Kala Sharma, guardian of Defendant No.4, 

in their evidence. In the scheme of Exhibit "A," no reference has 

been made to Defendant No.1 save to the effect that when the 

partition was executed, the "sons" were referred to as the "sons of 

first wife" and "sons of second wife" and not by their own names. 

On this aspect, in Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance 

and Investment Co. Ltd. And Others 18 , it was inter alia observed as 

under; 

"33. Interpretation must depend on the text and 

the context. They are the bases of interpretation. One 
may well say if the text is the texture, context is what 
gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are 
important. That interpretation is best which makes 
the textual interpretation match the contextual. A 
statute is best interpreted when we know why it was 
enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be 
read, first as a whole and then section by section, 
clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. 
If a statute is looked at, in the context of its 
enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker, 
provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, 
clauses, phrases and words may take colour and 
appear different than when the statute is looked at 
without the glasses provided by the context. …… No 
part of a statute and no word of a statute can be 
construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed 

18 (1987) 1 SCC 424 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

37 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

so that every word has a place and everything is in its 
place. ……" 

Further, in Anwar Hasan Khan v. Mohd. Shafi and Others 19 , the Hon"ble 

Supreme Court inter alia held thus; 

"8. ...... It is a cardinal principle of construction 

of a statute that effort should be made in construing 
its provisions by avoiding a conflict and adopting a 
harmonious construction. The statute or rules made 
thereunder should be read as a whole and one 
provision should be construed with reference to the 
other provision to make the provision consistent with 
the object sought to be achieved." 

The testamentary disposition of Devi Prasad of course, in no way, 

can be described as a Statute, nevertheless the principles 

enunciated above for interpretation, may well be adopted for the 

purposes of interpreting the relevant portion of Exhibit "A." Thus, on 

the anvil of the said principles, a careful scrutiny of Exhibit "A" 

indubitably establishes that Devi Prasad was referring to himself 

only and none else for the purposes of the conditions laid down in 

the testamentary disposition. 

40. 
While further considering Exhibit "A," it is evidently an 

unregistered document. The Sikkim State General Department 

Notification No.385/G, dated 11.04.1928, requires all documents 

such as mortgage and Sale Deeds and "other important documents" 

and Deeds to be registered and will not be considered valid unless 

they are duly registered. Nevertheless, it is now no more res integra 

that the Courts can look into unregistered documents more so, if it 

is a family settlement. The Hon"ble Supreme Court in Thulasidhara 

and Another v. Narayanappa and Others 20 held inter alia as follows; 

"9.4……… The High Court has refused to look 

into the said document and/or consider document 
dated 23-4-1971 (Ext. D-4) solely on the ground that 
it requires registration and therefore as it is 
unregistered, the same cannot be looked into.

20 (2019) 6 SCC 409 


RFA No.10 of 2017

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

However, 
as 
observed 
by 
this 
Court 
in Kale [Kale v. Director of Consolidation, (1976) 3 
SCC 119] that such a family settlement, though not 
registered, would operate as a complete estoppel 
against the parties to such a family settlement. ………… 
9.5. As 
held 
by 
this 
Court 
in Subraya 
M.N. [Subraya M.N. v. Vittala M.N., (2016) 8 SCC 705 
: (2016) 4 SCC (Civ) 163] even without registration a 
written 
document 
of 
family 
settlement/family 
arrangement can be used as corroborative evidence 
as explaining the arrangement made thereunder and 
conduct of the parties. In the present case, as 
observed hereinabove, even the plaintiff has also 
categorically admitted that the oral partition had 
taken place on 23-4-1971 and he also admitted that 3 
to 4 panchayat people were also present. However, 
according to him, the same was not reduced in 
writing. Therefore, even accepting the case of the 
plaintiff that there was an oral partition on 23-4-
1971, the document, Ext. D-4 dated 23-4-1971, to 
which he is also the signatory and all other family 
members are signatory, can be said to be a list of 
properties partitioned. Everybody got right/share as 
per the oral partition/partition. Therefore, the same 
even can be used as corroborative evidence as 
explaining the arrangement made thereunder and 
conduct of the parties. Therefore, in the facts and 
circumstances of the case, the High Court has 
committed a grave/manifest error in not looking into 
and/or not considering the document Ext. D-4 dated 
23-4-1971." 

The Law having been thus settled, Exhibit "A" reveals the family 

arrangement pertaining to partition of the ancestral properties as 

well as bequeathment by Will. 

41. 
It would now be relevant to consider and address the 

contesting arguments of the parties regarding the care given by the 

Plaintiffs to their deceased father. The averments in the Plaint at 

Paragraph 22 "G" reveal as follows; 

"That, the Plaintiffs had taken care of their 
father during his lifetime and never performed death 
rites under duress. The Plaintiffs had also provided 
financial, medical and all types of help those are given 
by son(sic) to their father late D.P. Dahal during his 
lifetime." 

The Plaintiffs" contention and evidence is that the Plaintiff No.1 was 

driven out of the main house in 1983-84 with a "khukuri" by his 

father and step mother. Notwithstanding such treatment, he took 

care of his father by replacing the thatched roof of the main house 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

39 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

with GCI sheets and extending all financial and other relevant help. 

The Defendant No.1 asserted that the two points raised above were 

never pleaded and it is settled Law that evidence cannot be adduced 

beyond the pleadings. Beneficial reference on this count is made to 

M. Chinnasamy (supra) relied on by Defendant No.1, wherein it was 

held inter alia as follows; 

"42. With respect, we are not in a position to 
endorse the views taken therein in their entirety. 
Unfortunately, the decision of a larger Bench of this 
Court in Jagjit Singh [AIR 1966 SC 773] had not been 
noticed therein. Apart from the clear legal position as 
laid down in several decisions, as noticed 
hereinbefore, there cannot be any doubt or dispute 
that only because a re-counting has been directed, it 
would not be held to be sacrosanct to the effect that 
although in a given case the court may find such 
evidence to be at variance with the pleadings, the 
same must be taken into consideration. It is now 

well-settled principle of law that evidence adduced 
beyond the pleadings would not be admissible nor 
can any evidence be permitted to be adduced which 
is at variance with the pleadings. The court at a later 
stage of the trial as also the appellate court having 
regard to the rule of pleadings would be entitled to 
reject the evidence wherefor there does not exist any 
pleading." 

(Emphasis supplied) 

In Union of India v. Ibrahim Uddin and Another (supra), the Hon"ble 

Supreme Court observed inter alia as under; 

"85.6. The court cannot travel beyond the 

pleadings as no party can lead the evidence on an 
issue/point not raised in the pleadings and in case, 
such evidence has been adduced or a finding of fact 
has been recorded by the court, it is just to be 

ignored. Though it may be a different case where in 
spite of specific pleadings, a particular issue is not 
framed and the parties having full knowledge of the 
issue in controversy lead the evidence and the court 
records a finding on it. ………………" 

(Emphasis supplied) 

42. 
In light of the established position of Law, the Plaintiffs" 

evidence, as well as those of their witnesses with regard to the 

instance of the Plaintiff No.1 being chased out by his father and step 

mother with a "khukuri" and replacement by him of the thatched 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

40 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

roof of his main house, being over and above the averments in his 

pleadings, is rejected and disregarded in totality by this Court. 

43. 
However, the pleadings of the Plaintiffs do also contain 

the averment that they had provided financial, medical and other 

assistance to their father as expected of sons. I now examine the 

proof thereof. 

44. 
Plaintiffs No.1 and 2 both deposed that during their 

father"s visits to their respective houses, they gave him money for 

medicine and clothing, apart from which they also took him for 

medical treatment to Doctors. PW Kunta Maya Dahal, relative of the 

Plaintiffs, supported their evidence, her evidence found 

substantiation in the evidence of PW7 Tanka Maya Adhikari, the 

blood sister of the Plaintiffs. PW Laxuman Nepal and PW Ram 

Chandra Koirala, both known to the Plaintiffs and their father, were 

witness to the Plaintiffs visiting their father during his illness and 

stated as much. A perusal of the cross-examination of Plaintiffs No.1 

and 2 reveal that no questions were put to them in cross-

examination to test the veracity of their statements pertaining to 

extension of financial help to their father and taking him to the 

Doctor, save to the extent that they did not furnish documentary 

evidence of such facts. With regard to the second condition in 

Exhibit "A" i.e. "perform death rites," both Plaintiffs deposed that 

they had performed their father"s death rites and rituals voluntarily. 

This evidence was buttressed by the deposition of PW Kunta Maya 

Dahal, PW3 Man Bahadur Kharka, PW 7 Tanka Maya Adhikari, PW 

Laxuman Nepal (son of Krishna Lall Nepal), PW Ram Chandra 

Koirala and PW6 Krishna Prasad Sapkota. Both PW3 Man Bahadur 

Kharka and PW6 Krishna Prasad Sapkota admitted to being illiterate

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

but no questions were put to them in cross-examination to test their 

knowledge or otherwise of the contents of their evidence-in-chief 

nor was any effort made by Defendant No.1 and Defendant No.4 to 

gauge as to whether they had each been explained the contents of 

Exhibit 17 and Exhibit 18, their respective Evidence-on-Affidavit. It 

was also the admission of both witnesses that the contents were in 

"English" and they did not know what it stated but the contents of 

the documents were not translated for their benefit during cross-

examination. Omnibus and vague questions put to the witnesses 

from rural backgrounds, in cross-examination, is not only 

unacceptable but such questions, in no way, demolish the evidence-

in-chief. In this context, apposite reference may be made to Shivaji 

Sahabrao Bobade and Another v. State of Maharashtra 21 wherein the 

Hon"ble Supreme Court observed inter alia as follows; 

"8. Now to the facts. The scene of murder is 
rural, the witnesses to the case are rustics and so 
their behavioural pattern and perceptive habits have 
to be judged as such. The too sophisticated 
approaches familiar in courts based on unreal 
assumptions about human conduct cannot obviously 
be applied to those given to the lethargic ways of our 
villages. When scanning the evidence of the various 
witnesses we have to inform ourselves that variances 
on the fringes, discrepancies in details, contradictions 
in narrations and embellishments in inessential parts 
cannot militate against the veracity of the core of the 
testimony provided there is the impress of truth and 
conformity to probability in the substantial fabric of 
testimony delivered. ……" 

45. 
It therefore transpires that the rustic background and 

education of the witnesses viz. PW3 and PW6 were not taken into 

consideration by the learned Defence Counsel when the questions 

were put to them in cross-examination. Notwithstanding such a 

circumstance, even if the evidence of PW3 and PW6 are to be 

disregarded, the claim of the Plaintiffs that they had extended

42 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

monetary assistance to their father, spent time with him by visiting 

him when he was unwell and both of them having performed the 

death rites of their late father, could not be said to be untrue, the 

evidence of the Plaintiffs and their two witnesses having stood 

resolute under cross-examination on these two counts. In fact, even 

the evidence of DW2 Tika Devi Sharma, witness for Defendant No.1, 

reveals that both Plaintiffs used to visit the main house in intervals 

and they behaved cordially with their father and Defendant No.1, 

while Laxuman Nepal (son of Jai Narayan Nepal), witness for the 

Defendant No.4, admitted that the Plaintiffs performed the death 

rites of their father voluntarily. It may be observed here that taking 

care of parents cannot be construed only as financial assistance 

rendered, time spent with parents is also to be given the credit it 

deserves. 

46. 
Defendant No.1, for her part, denied the claims of the 

Plaintiffs that they had contributed financially towards the treatment 

of Devi Prasad as, according to her, only she and her son Bal 

Krishna, bore all required expenses, even to the extent of having 

taken loans. Exhibit D4/A, dated 16.08.2001 and Exhibit D4/B, 

dated 23.09.2001, i.e. documents purportedly establishing loan 

taken by her son for her husband"s treatment from Bishnu 

Khatiwada and Laxuman Nepal (son of Jai Narayan Nepal), were 

strongly relied upon by her. No documents were furnished to 

establish the decade long illness of Devi Prasad or his bedridden and 

convalescent condition. No explanation ensued as to why Exhibit 

D4/A and Exhibit D4/B were not furnished before the learned trial 

Court before the remand of the matter. The scribe of the said 

documents were also not produced as witnesses either by the 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

43 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

Defendant No.1 or the Defendant No.4 and although DW1 Laxuman 

Nepal ventured to state that Bal Krishna was the scribe of Exhibit 

D4/B, no handwriting of Bal Krishna was furnished for comparison. 

The credibility of these documents, in my considered opinion, is 

suspect. Reliance on the ratio of Kiran Limboo (supra) and on the 

provisions of Section 67 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, in fact, 

goes against the Defendant No.1 as no witness has proved the 

contents of Exhibit D4/A and Exhibit D4/B. 

47. 
Although, DW2 Tika Devi Sharma made an effort to 

support the evidence of the Defendant No.1, however, under cross-

examination, buckled and admitted that the Plaintiffs used to visit 

the main house at intervals and behave cordially with her parents. 

According to her, there was no quarrel between her father and the 

Plaintiffs on the execution of Exhibit "A." The evidence of DW Dol 

Nath Gautam can scarcely be relied on considering that when the 

partition was affected in 1985, he was eleven years old and could 

have had no personal knowledge of events that took place then. 

DW2 Dhan Maya Adhikari, the half sister of the Plaintiffs, supported 

the evidence of Defendant No.1, her evidence withstood cross-

examination. DW Punya Prasad Adhikari, known to the Plaintiffs and 

their father as well as the Defendant No.1, brought a new twist to 

the tale by stating in his evidence that the Plaintiffs were 

disgruntled with the family partition which he had learnt from Devi 

Prasad and therefore the Plaintiffs and their father did not share 

cordial relations. He supported the evidence of Defendant No.1 that 

only she and her son took care of Devi Prasad and performed the 

death rites, however, later he admitted that no issue was raised by 

any of the sons relating to the shares allotted and that the Plaintiffs 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

44 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

had performed the thirteenth day funeral rites of their father. His 

evidence is therefore vacillating with regard to the conduct of the 

Plaintiffs in the context of execution of Exhibit "A" as reflected supra 

and cannot be considered reliable. DW4 Ramesh Kumar Dahal is the 

son of Plaintiff No.1, born in 1982. He failed to give any substantive 

evidence pertaining to the case save to the extent that his parents 

are separated and that Bal Krishna had participated in the 

"Anthyesthi Kriya" (death rites) of his grandfather. 

48. 
For the Defendant No.4, DW1 Laxuman Nepal (son of Jai 

Narayan Nepal), known to the Plaintiffs and their father and the 

Defendants No.1 and 4, had no knowledge of the relations between 

the Plaintiffs and their father. He, however, admitted that the 

Plaintiffs performed the death rites of their father voluntarily. 

According to him, vide Exhibit D4/B, dated 23.09.2001, he loaned 

Rs.20,000/-(Rupees twenty thousand) only, to Bal Krishna. Exhibit 

D4/B is an unregistered document. It does not mention the interest 

amount nor does it mention that the interest amount would be fixed 

subsequently on non-payment of the principle amount, thus the 

contents are rather nebulous for a loan document. The only witness 

to Exhibit D4/B is the elder sister of Bal Krishna, Devi Kala Sharma. 

The entire circumstances of the document having been furnished 

only after the matter was sent back on remand and produced before 

the learned trial Court with Bal Krishna"s sister as the sole witness, 

lends suspicion to it. Considering the belated appearance of the 

document and lack of proof thereof, it is reiterated that it appears to 

have been manufactured for the purposes of the instant matter and 

cannot be relied upon.

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

49. 
Madhav Prasad Adhikari examined as witness No.2 for 

Defendant No.4, was also a witness for Defendant No.1. In his 

evidence as witness for Defendant No.1, he stated that he is the 

maternal uncle of late Devi Prasad. Contrarily, in his evidence as 

witness for Defendant No.4, he stated that Devi Prasad was his 

maternal uncle. Relevantly, in Paragraph "5" of his evidence as 

witness for Defendant No.1, he has stated that the Plaintiffs being 

satisfied with the respective shares that they received, in full 

consent, scribed their signature on the said Partition Deed. 

Conversely, as witness for the Defendant No.4, in Paragraph "3" of 

his evidence, he stated that he had learnt from late Devi Prasad 

that both the Plaintiffs did not share good relations with him as they 

were unhappy with the family partition and after the said partition, 

they had discarded their father and had very sour relations with his 

entire family. The witness appears to be confused with regard to 

how he was related to Devi Prasad added to which, his inconsistent 

and ambivalent evidence reflected hereinabove makes him an 

unreliable and untrustworthy witness. His evidence thereby merits 

no reliance. 

50. 
DW3 Tika Devi Sharma, was witness for Defendant No.1 

and also appeared as witness for the Defendant No.4. She sought to 

establish that Bal Krishna as also her sister Devi Kala, the guardian 

of Defendant No.4, were bona fide Sikkimese Indians and reiterated 

that only Defendant No.1 and her brother looked after their father 

but admitted that she had no documents relating to her father"s 

prolonged ailment and that they were not on talking terms with the 

Plaintiffs. DW4 Bishnu Khatiwada, son-in-law of late Devi Prasad 

being the husband of DW3, also narrated the story of the Plaintiffs 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

46 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

abandoning their parents after voluntarily leaving the main house 

and identified Exhibit D4/A as the receipt for a sum of Rs.50,000/-

(Rupees fifty thousand) only, taken by Bal Krishna from him, for his 

father"s treatment. The cross-examination of this witness revealed 

that he was a Bus conductor in the SNT Department and in 2001, 

his monthly salary was around Rs.15,000/-(Rupees fifteen 

thousand) only, besides which he had two School going sons and a 

wife to support. He was unaware as to who had scribed Exhibit D4/A 

and did not state its contents although he identified it as a "Money 

Receipt" and his signature on it. Admittedly, he was not on speaking 

terms with the Plaintiffs and did not share good relations with them. 

His evidence of having loaned Rs.50,000/-(Rupees fifty thousand) 

only, to Bal Krishna has to be taken with a pinch of salt as he was 

earning Rs.15,000/-(Rupees fifteen thousand) only, per month as 

the sole bread winner in his family comprising of his wife and two 

School going sons. Mere marking and exhibiting of documents is not 

proof of its contents. His evident inimical relations with the Plaintiffs 

and lack of proof of Exhibit D4/A, renders his evidence unreliable. 

DW Devi Kala Sharma, half sister of the Plaintiffs, is the guardian of 

the Defendant No.4. She too asserted that the family of Devi Prasad 

is governed by the Law of the land and not by the Mitakshara 

School of Hindu Law. According to her, the Plaintiffs are signatories 

to Exhibit "A" and they have already acted upon the Partition Deed. 

She further stated that Bal Krishna and Defendant No.1 looked after 

Devi Prasad and she was aware of this fact as she helped them, 

being a Staff Nurse at the Central Referral Hospital, Tadong. From 

there, he was taken to Siliguri for further treatment. After he 

passed away, the Plaintiffs were forced to come to the main house 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

47 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

and perform the death rites. According to her, the "jiwni" land had 

been kept by her father for her mother"s welfare and he had sold a 

piece of land to meet her (witness"s) educational expenses. While 

considering her evidence, it is clear that she is now making an 

endeavour to insert a tangential angle to the case of the Defendant 

No.1 by stating that the "jiwni bari" was kept for her mother"s 

welfare. Her deposition is evidently an attempt to protect her 

mother (Defendant No.1) and ensure that she gets the property 

although Exhibit "A" specifically mentions the conditions on which 

the son(s) of Devi Prasad would get the "jiwni" property. In tandem 

with the evidence of Defendant No.1, this witness has also stated 

that the conditions in the Partition Deed are that the son "look after 

the parents and also perform their death rites." This is an erroneous 

interpretation of the document as already discussed in detail above. 

No mention of either "mother" or "parents" has been made in the 

document neither was any witness of the Plaintiffs, Defendant No.1 

or Defendant No.4, confronted with the contents of the document to 

explain or expound this portion. She denied all suggestions put to 

her with regard to manufacturing of the documents exhibited and 

stated that the Plaintiff No.1 had not been maintaining his first wife. 

This is contrary to the evidence of DW4 Ramesh Kumar Dahal, the 

son of the Plaintiff No.1, who stated under cross-examination that 

his father pays maintenance to his mother after she had filed a 

Maintenance Case in the Court in 1998. Her evidence, therefore, 

cannot be accepted in its totality in view of the exacerbations she 

has made with regard to the interpretation of Exhibit "A" and that 

the "jiwni bari" was for her mother"s welfare. 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

48 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

51. 
The foregoing evidence, thus, establishes that the 

Plaintiffs did assist their father financially whenever he visited them 

and they also visited him at intervals, behaved cordially with him as 

also with the Defendant No.1 and were seen to be with their father 

when he fell ill. The weight of the evidence furnished by the parties 

tilts in favour of the Plaintiffs notwithstanding the fact that they 

were living apart from him and were involved in running homes for 

their own separate families as against the ambivalent and vacillating 

evidence of the witnesses of the Defendant No.1 and Defendant 

No.4, as already discussed. Bal Krishna had the advantage of living 

with his parents and it is not contested that he took care of them by 

virtue of such a circumstance. The fact that the Plaintiffs along with 

Bal Krishna, performed the death rites of their father withstood all 

cross-examination and, in any event, the Defendant No.1 and her 

witnesses have also admitted this fact. I have to agree with the 

observation of learned Senior Counsel for the Plaintiffs that no son 

or daughter worth their salt would keep an account book of the 

expenditure made towards maintaining or taking care of their 

parents. It would indeed be an abhorrent circumstance sufficient to 

arouse indignation in any person. Devi Prasad evidently made no 

complaints to any witness of nonchalant or callous attitude of the 

Plaintiffs towards him. 

52. 
In this context, the learned trial Court while deciding 

Issue No.7, was of the opinion that the Plaintiffs were unable to 

substantiate their claims of having taken care of their father during 

his lifetime by any documentary proof thereof. The evidence of PW 

Laxuman Nepal and PW Ram Chandra Koirala were found to be 

unreliable as according to the learned trial Court, these witnesses 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

49 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

had only made bald claims with regard to the Plaintiffs having taken 

care of Devi Prasad when he was unwell. The learned trial Court 

desired "corroboration from worthy evidence," however, it was not 

specified as to what the "worthy evidence" was to comprise of. The 

learned trial Court had concluded that although the Plaintiffs had 

performed the death rites of their father, however, they had not 

taken care of their father during his lifetime. In the light of the 

evidence on record and the foregoing discussions already discussed 

by me, I am unable to bring myself to agree with the finding of the 

learned trial Court in Issue No.7. 

53. 
While deciding Issue No.2, the learned trial Court relied 

heavily on the evidence of Defendant No.1 and DW4 Bishnu 

Khatiwada, the witness for Defendant No.4, Exhibit D4/A, the 

unregistered Money Receipt, the evidence of Laxuman Nepal (son of 

Jai Narayan Nepal) and Exhibit D4/B. Learned trial Court was 

impressed with the production of Exhibit D4/A and Exhibit D4/B 

despite the fact that these documents had been filed rather 

belatedly, only after the matter having been sent back on remand, 

thereby raising doubts about the authenticity of the documents. The 

reasoning of the learned trial Court at Paragraph "43" of the 

impugned Judgment inter alia was that, 

"43. …………The Plaintiffs on the other hand were 
already staying separately from Late Devi Prasad 
Dahal and once the partition took place the severance 
of joint status, even if the same were to be assumed, 
would also be deemed to have taken place. Once it is 
held so, even if there was no banda patra/ 
testamentary disposition above the "jiwni land" of Late 
Devi Prasad Dahal (which became his separate 
property after the partition) would devolve on his 
undivided son (Late Bal Krishna Dahal) to the 
exclusion of his divided sons (Plaintiffs)……………… 
…………………………Raghavachariar in his Hindu Law, 
Second Edition, Page 444 states that where a father 
was joint at the time of his death with some only of 
his sons, the others having already separated from 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

50 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

him, those who remained joint with him, whether they 
were sons born before or after the partition, succeed 
to the whole property, whether ancestral or self-
acquired, to the exclusion of the divided sons. ……" 

54. 
The learned trial Court concluded that this seems to be 

the settled position under the Mitakshara Law which solely governed 

the Hindus in the State during the year 2001 when Devi Prasad had 

died. I have to disagree with this finding and the interpretation 

given to the above position of Law as stated by Raghavachariar in 

view of the fact that after the partition had taken place vide Exhibit 

"A," as already discussed supra, the father had his own share in the 

property which thus, was his separate property. Bal Krishna also 

received his separate share. Consequently, Devi Prasad was free to 

decide how his share would be given away after his passing viz. by 

the testamentary disposition, on the conditions therein being 

fulfilled. The reasoning that the share of Devi Prasad would devolve 

on his undivided son Bal Krishna despite him having received his 

share, is an erroneous interpretation of the concerned Law. Merely 

because Bal Krishna continued to live in the main house with the 

father did not vest this circumstance with the legal connotation that 

he was joint with the father, as Exhibit "A," with clarity states that 

all the sons were given properties and they had separated and the 

father had kept "jiwni" land for himself. I am inclined to agree with 

the arguments canvassed by learned Senior Counsel for the 

Plaintiffs in this context wherein it was stated that the observation 

of the learned trial Court regarding Hindu Law by Raghavachariar is 

totally misconceived and out of context. 

55. 
The learned trial Court, also discussed the provisions of 

the Sikkim Succession Act, 2008, and held that the Act is applicable 

to all Sikkimese who possess Sikkim Subject Certificate and die 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

51 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

intestate. He further opined that although the Defendant No.1 had 

denied that she and the Plaintiffs were governed by the Mitakshara 

School of Hindu Law, in fact, till 2008 the Hindus in Sikkim were 

solely governed by the said Law. 

56. 
The above statement leads to the conclusion that the 

learned trial Court was of the opinion that in fact the Mitakshara 

School of Hindu Law governed the Hindus in the State till 2008. The 

Sikkim Succession Act, 2008, as already discussed, never saw the 

light of day. Hence, the reliance of the learned trial Court on a non 

est Statute is erroneous. 

57. 
While deciding Issues No.4, 5, 6 and 10, the learned 

trial Court, in Paragraph "45" of the impugned Judgment, observed 

inter alia as under; 

"45. ……Strictly speaking, the Defendants No.1 & 
4 cannot therefore claim any share on the basis of the 
concerned "banda patra" and the question of their 
having gotten any share vide the said "banda patra" 
also does not arise. However, it may be mentioned 
here that while Late Devi Prasad Dahal had died 
during September 2001 Late Bal Krishna Dahal died in 
the year 2010. On the death of Late Devi Prasad 
Dahal, as discussed above, it was Late Bal Krishna 
Dahal who was entitled to get, and did acquire, his 
father"s "jiwni land" and therefore he is to be regarded 
as being the owner of the "jiwni land" till he expired in 
the year 2010. When he died intestate in the year 
2010, which is seen to be the case here, the Sikkim 
Succession Act, 2008, which as discussed earlier is 
applicable to persons possessing Sikkim Subject 
Certificate/Certificate of Identification(COI) and those 
who are descendants of Sikkim Subject Certificate 
holder identified through COI, had already come into 
force in the State of Sikkim and was/is applicable 
throughout the State(in cases where a person dies 
intestate after its enactment). ……" 

The learned trial Court, invoking the provisions of Section 5 of the 

Sikkim Succession Act, 2008, and Note II appended to Section 2 

and the provisions of Section 6 of the said Act, concluded that the 

Defendant No.1 and Defendant No.4 would be eligible to inherit the 

properties left behind by Bal Krishha, including the "jiwni" land. 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

52 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

58. 
In the first instance, I have to disagree with the finding 

of the learned trial Court vide which he has divided the entire 

property of Bal Krishna including the "jiwni" land between 

Defendant No.1 and Defendant No.4, for the reason that the Issues 

under discussion do not deal with the separate property of Bal 

Krishna. The passing away of Bal Krishna if intestate, entitles the 

Defendant No.1 to a share in his properties in view of the provisions 

of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, however, this is not the Issue in 

the instant matter and discussions thereof stand truncated here. 

Issues No.4 and 5 revolve around the "jiwni" land and Issue No.6 is 

not even relevant for the disposal of the present Suit as the claim of 

the Plaintiffs is confined to the "jiwni" land in terms of Exhibit "A". 

There is no ambiguity in the conditions laid down by Devi Prasad in 

Exhibit "A", the intention has to be collected from the language of 

the document as observed in C.N. Arunachala Mudaliar supra. 

59. 
With regard to Issues No.8 and 9, the Plaintiffs could 

not have raised the Issues before the learned trial Court and ought 

to have approached the correct Forum if they were of the opinion 

that the Certificate of Guardianship had been obtained fraudulently. 

Consequently, I am in agreement with the findings of the learned 

trial Court on these Issues. 

60. 
While disagreeing with the view of the learned trial 

Court on Issues No.1, 3 and 11, it is clear from the evidence before 

the Court that the Plaintiffs, having fulfilled both requisite conditions 

of Exhibit "A," are entitled along with Defendant No.4, the daughter 

of their half brother Bal Krishna, to a share each of the "jiwni" land. 

61. 
Now addressing question No.3 framed hereinabove, the 

Defendant No.1 has staked a claim to fifty per cent of the properties 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

53 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

recorded in the name of her late husband by virtue of being his 

second wife and having cared for him, during his lifetime. Devi 

Prasad did not make any provision for the Defendant No.1 in his 

separate property i.e. the "jiwni" land by arranging for a life estate 

for her. He did not die intestate. Had Devi Prasad died intestate, 

then in terms of Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, a 

share of her husband"s property would have devolved upon her, she 

being a Class I heir as per the Schedule to Section 8 of the Act. 

62. 
In Sadhu Singh (supra) relied on by the Defendant No.1, 

the Hon"ble Supreme Court dealt with the provisions of Section 8, 

Section 14(1) and Section 30 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. 

One Ralla Singh had a wife Isher Kaur. They had no children. Ralla 

Singh executed a Will on 07.10.1968 and died on 19.03.1977. His 

widow Isher Kaur on 21.01.1980, purported to gift the property in 

favour of a Gurdwara. The Appellant (Sadhu Singh) filed a Suit 

challenging the Deed of Gift and also prayed for recovery of 

possession after the death of Isher Kaur. According to the Appellant, 

under the Will of Ralla Singh, Isher Kaur took only a life estate and 

the properties were to vest in the Appellant and his brother. She 

had no right to gift the property to the Gurdwara under the terms of 

the Will under which she took the properties. She was bound by the 

terms of the bequest. Isher Kaur and the Gurdwara contended that 

the property received by her on the death of her husband was as his 

heir and it was taken by her absolutely and she was competent to 

deal with the property. It was pleaded that in any event Section 

14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act entitled her to deal with the 

property as an absolute owner. The Appellant countered that Isher 

Kaur, having taken the property under the disposition of her 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

54 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

husband, was bound by its terms and she had only a life estate and 

no competence to donate the property. It was a case to which 

Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act applied and the limitation 

on right imposed by the Will was binding on Isher Kaur. Her estate 

could not get enlarged under Section 14(1) of the Act. The trial 

Court held that the Will executed by the Appellant was not genuine 

and dismissed the Suit holding that Isher Kaur had taken the 

property absolutely on the death of her husband as an heir and 

under the circumstances she was entitled to donate the property to 

the Gurdwara. The lower Appellate Court, on Appeal by the 

Appellant, held that the Will propounded by the Appellant was found 

to be the last Will and Testament of Ralla Singh and was a valid 

execution and upheld it. Thus, the trial Court decree was reversed 

and the Suit decreed. The Gurdwara was in Second Appeal before 

the High Court which reversed the decision of the first Appellate 

Court. The Hon"ble Supreme Court while citing various other 

decisions in the matter, set aside the Judgment and Decree of the 

High Court and passed a Decree in favour of the original Plaintiff for 

recovery of possession of the property from the Gurdwara, the 

donee from Isher Kaur, and anyone claiming under or through it, on 

the strength of his title and to hold it for himself and his brother. 

The Hon"ble Supreme Court while considering the ratio of the 

Second Appeal, held as follows; 

"3. ……What it has presumably held is that Isher 
Kaur had pre-existing right in the property and 
consequently the limitation placed on her rights in the 
will, could not prevail in view of Section 14(1) of the 
Hindu Succession Act. It did not bear in mind that the 

property was the separate property or self-acquired 
property of Ralla Singh and his widow, though she 
might have succeeded to the property as an absolute 
and sole heir if Ralla Singh had died intestate on 19-
3-1977, had no pre-existing right as such. The widow 
had, at best, only a right to maintenance and at best 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

55 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

could have secured a charge by the process of court 
for her maintenance under the Hindu Adoptions and 
Maintenance Act in the separate property of her 
husband. May be, in terms of Section 39 of the 
Transfer of Property Act, she could have also 
enforced the charge even as against an alienee from 
her husband. Unlike in a case where the widow was 
in possession of the property on the date of the 
coming into force of the Act in which she had a pre-
existing right at least to maintenance, a situation 
covered by Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession 
Act, if his separate property is disposed of by a Hindu 
male by way of testamentary disposition, placing a 
restriction on the right given to the widow, the 
question whether Section 14(2) would not be 
attracted, was not considered at all by the High 
Court. 

It proceeded as if the ratio of V. 
Tulasamma [(1977) 3 SCC 99 : (1977) 3 SCR 261] 
would preclude any enquiry in that line." 

(Emphasis supplied) 

The Hon"ble Supreme Court, while referring to the ratio of V. 

Tulassama and Others v. Sesha Reddy (Dead) by L.Rs. 22 concluded that 

on the wording of Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act and the 

context of the decision, the ratio would apply only when a female 

Hindu is possessed of the property on the date of the Act under 

semblance of a right, whether it be a limited or a preexisting right 

to maintenance in lieu of which she was put in possession of the 

property. The Hon"ble Supreme Court also held therein; 

"13. An owner of property has normally the right 
to deal with that property including the right to devise 
or bequeath the property. He could thus dispose it of 
by a testament. Section 30 of the Act, not only does 
not curtail or affect this right, it actually reaffirms that 
right. Thus, a Hindu male could testamentarily 

dispose of his property. When he does that, a 
succession under the Act stands excluded and the 

property passes to the testamentary heirs. Hence, 
when a male Hindu executes a will bequeathing the 
properties, the legatees take it subject to the terms of 
the will unless of course, any stipulation therein is 
found invalid. Therefore, there is nothing in the Act 
which affects the right of a male Hindu to dispose of 
his property by providing only a life estate or limited 
estate for his widow. The Act does not stand in the 
way of his separate properties being dealt with by him 
as he deems fit. His will hence could not be 
challenged as being hit by the Act."

22 (1977) 3 SCC 99 


RFA No.10 of 2017

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

The Court went on to refer to the decision in Ramachandra Shenoy 

and Another v. Mrs. Hilda Brite and Others 23 . The ratio therein 

observed; 

"14. ……It is one of the cardinal principles of 
construction of wills that to the extent that it is legally 
possible effect should be given to every disposition 
contained in the will unless the law prevents effect 
being given to it. ……" 

That, the Court has to attempt a harmonious construction to give 

effect to all terms of the Will if it is in any manner possible. 

63. 
This sets to rest the rights of Defendant No.1 with 

regard to the land that she is in occupation of being the "jiwni" land. 

Defendant No.1 was not possessed of the property under the 

semblance of a right, whether limited or for the purposes of 

maintenance. Suffice it to state here that the "jiwni" land is to 

descend in terms of the testamentary disposition of Exhibit "A" and 

the Defendant No.1, as also all other parties to the Suit, are bound 

by the terms of the bequest. 

64. 
While considering the decisions of the Hon"ble Supreme 

Court and various High Courts relied on by the Defendant No.1, it is 

worth mentioning here that the ratio in Karedla Parthasaradhi (supra) 

is not relevant for the present purposes as it deals with a Hindu 

male having died intestate and the Defendant therein asserting that 

she was his legally married wife and thereby entitled to his house 

after his death being the Class I heir of her husband. While 

considering the reliance made on Ganduri Koteshwaramma and 

Another v. Chakiri Yanadi and Another 24 and Vineeta Sharma (supra), it 

is worth noticing that the Defendant No.1, after averring rather 

vaguely that she was governed by the Law of the land, has taken a 

23 AIR 1964 SC 1323 
24 (2011) 9 SCC 788 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

57 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

U-turn and placed reliance on the ratio (supra) which are centred 

around the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, and contrary to the stance 

taken by her. No reasons have been extended for such reliance 

which thereby requires no consideration. 

65. 
Next, it may be clarified here that in a civil dispute the 

standard of proof extends to a "preponderance of probability" and 

not "beyond a reasonable doubt," as canvassed by learned Counsel 

for the Defendant No.1. The latter is the standard required for proof 

in a criminal case against an accused. The argument of learned 

Counsel for the Defendant No.1 contending that the Plaintiffs have 

to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt is therefore rejected. 

Anar Devi and Others (supra) relied on by the Defendant No.1 being a 

Suit for partition of notional share of the deceased father in a 

coparcenary property, is not relevant to the issue at hand. The 

argument of learned Counsel for the Defendant No.1 that the Suit is 

only for declaration cannot be countenanced as the prayers in the 

Plaint reveal otherwise. 

66. 
In light of the foregoing discussions and the reasons set 

forth by me, I cannot bring myself to agree with the observations 

and findings of the learned trial Court on the Issues settled by it for 

determination, save in Issues No.8 and 9, as already discussed. 

67. 
In conclusion, it follows that; 

(i) 
In the absence of any statutory provision dealing with 

Succession in the State and as the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, has 

not been extended and enforced in the State but considering that 

the Courts in Sikkim have applied the provisions of the Laws of the 

country where the Laws in Sikkim are inadequate or do not cover a 

specific area, it stands to reason that the provisions of the Hindu 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

58 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

Succession Act, 1956, can be invoked and applied for the purposes 

of determining matters relating to Succession in Sikkim, involving 

parties to whom the personal Law is applicable, till specific Laws 

occupy the field. 

(ii) 
The Sikkim Succession Act, 2008, is not a notified Act 

and being non est no reliance can be placed on it. 

(iii) 
The Plaintiffs and late Bal Krishna are entitled to an 

equal share each of the "jiwni" land of late Devi Prasad as described 

in the Schedule to the Plaint and are also entitled to take steps with 

regard to their respective shares. Defendant No.4 being the 

daughter of Bal Krishna would be entitled to his share of the "jiwni" 

property. 

(iv) 
The question of Defendant No.1 being entitled to the 

"jiwni" property does not arise at all sans any such intention of Devi 

Prasad in Exhibit "A" and the provisions of Law. 

68. 
The contention of the Defendant No.1 that the Suit is 

barred by limitation is not tenable as it is clear that the cause of 

action arose only after the issuance of the impugned Order by the 

Defendant No.2, dated 03.11.2010. 

69. 
The prayer of the Plaintiffs seeking a declaration that 

Bal Krishna predeceased his father has no legs to stand as the 

evidence on record establishes that Devi Prasad passed away in 

"2001" and Bal Krishna was witnessed performing his father"s death 

rites. Evidence also reveals that Bal Krishna died in "2010," no 

evidence to the contrary was furnished by the Plaintiffs. 

70. 
Similarly, as no evidence was led on the averment of 

the Plaintiffs that the Defendant No.1 had claimed before the 

Defendant No.2 that Bal Krishna had left behind two sons and the 


RFA No.10 of 2017 

59 

Nil Kumar Dahal and Another vs. Indira Dahal and Others 

existence of a daughter was never pleaded, it requires no further 

discussion. Besides, by filing the Amended Plaint and impleading the 

Defendant No.4 as a party, they have recognized the daughter of 

Bal Krishna as his legal heir. 

71. 
The prayer that the Defendant No.4 not being a son of 

Devi Prasad, had no right, title and interest over the "jiwni" land, is 

correct to that extent as it does not fulfill the specific conditions set 

out in Exhibit "A," however she is the legal heir and successor of Bal 

Krishna and thereby entitled to his share. 

72. 
The prayer seeking a declaration that the Defendant 

No.1 is a Nepal citizen and that the Guardianship Certificate of Devi 

Kala Sharma was obtained fraudulently, deserves no consideration. 

If the Plaintiffs are aggrieved by such a circumstance, they are to 

approach the correct Forum. 

73. 
The impugned Order of the Defendant No.2, dated 

03.11.2010, is hereby declared as null, void and non est and is 

quashed and set aside, having been issued without jurisdiction. 

74. 
Appeal allowed to the extent above and disposed of 

accordingly. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of. 

75. 
No order as to costs. 

76. 
Copy of this Judgment be sent to the learned trial Court 

for information. 

77. 
Records of the learned trial Court be remitted forthwith.
