JUDGMENT 

(04.06.2018) 

Bhaskar Raj Pradhan, J 

1. 
The death is homicidal. It is also gruesome. Multiple and 

gaping chop wounds on the back of the neck, below the skull 

with a sharp, moderately heavy weapon have done away with a 

young human life of barely 27 years in the prime of his youth. 

The heinous act was committed inside a temporary shed in the 


2 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

compound of one Padam Kumar Rai (P.W.5) in which the 

deceased and Suren Rai (Respondent), another "lumberjack", 

hired by him were residing till the night of the incident. The 

evidence of the brutal act is smeared all over the temporary 

shed. Dark coloured round collared 'T' shirt of the deceased 

with cuts over the neck and the right side of shoulder stained 

with blood and more at the back and aluminium GIS sheet 

walls of the temporary shed with a spray of blood. There is no 

quarrel about the aforesaid facts and also stands proved by 

cogent evidence. 

2. 
The day before the incident, past sunset, at around 8.00 

p.m. on 23.05.2013, the version of the altercation between 

Suren Rai and the deceased regarding the deceased's mobile 

which had gone missing would be complained about by Suren 

Rai to Padam Kumar Rai. This was at the house of Padam 

Kumar Rai, a little distance from the temporary shed, but 

within his compound, where the gruesome act would take 

place. As requested, Padam Kumar Rai would, a little later 

after 8.00 p.m., visit the temporary shed and find Suren Rai 

having his meal and the deceased sitting close by. Padam 

Kumar Rai would inquire about the mobile and admonition 

both Suren Rai and the deceased not to quarrel about trifles 

and look for the mobile instead. Padam Kumar Rai would 

return to his house. Suren Rai would shortly follow. Padam 


3 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Kumar Rai would again ask Suren Rai if the mobile was found. 

Suren Rai would, thereafter, leave Padam Kumar Rai's house. 

Thereafter, Padam Kumar Rai would retire to bed as it would 

be raining heavily. There is also no dispute about the aforesaid 

facts which also stands proved by cogent evidence. Padam 

Kumar Rai would depose and prove these facts and is 

admitted by Suren Rai. 

3. 
What happened thereafter till the next morning is 

unknown, save the disclosure and the confessional statement 

of Suren Rai recorded under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence 

Act, 1872 and Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 

(Cr.P.C.) respectively and the last scene theory pressed by the 

Prosecution, it is pleaded. 

4. 
The next morning at around 6.00 a.m. on 24.05.2013, 

much after the first rays of the sun would illuminate 

Okherbotey, Padam Kumar Rai would notice something 

unusual. Smoke was not coming out of the temporary shed as 

usual. He would find it curious and walk to the temporary 

shed from his house to discover the cadaver of the deceased in 

a sleeping position covered with a blanket and the tell-tale 

signs of the gruesome act smeared all over. These facts also 

stand proved by the evidence of Padam Kumar Rai. 

5. 
At 8.45 a.m., the same morning, a written complaint 

(exhibit-12) by Padam Kumar Rai received by the Naya Bazar 


4 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Police Station in West Sikkim would lead to the registration of 

the First Information Report (FIR) (exhibit-13) and set in 

motion the investigation taken up by Police Inspector, Mr. 

Chewang D. Bhutia, Investigating Officer (P.W.10) alleging that 

Suren Rai had done away with the deceased and absconded. 

The same day, Suren Rai would be apprehended from 

Karmatar School ground in the neighbouring State of West 

Bengal by two Police Officers, Constable Topden Lepcha 

(P.W.6) and Home Guard, Yamnath Sharma (P.W.7) and 

brought to the Naya Bazar Police Station to face justice. These 

facts also stand proved by the Prosecution. The arrest of Suren 

Rai is also not an issue. 

6. 
The deceased was Monit Rai, the dead "lumberjack" and 

temporary shed-mate of Suren Rai, the then accused, and now 

acquitted and a free man. These facts also stands proved by 

the prosecution. 

7. 
When the Investigating Officer would visit the crime 

scene it would still be fresh with evidence, both physical and 

biological, of the gruesome incident the night before. On 

24.05.2013 at 1100 hours the Investigating Officer would seize 

blood stained red/white/pink printed quilt; blood stained old 

while 'T' shirt with "Pirelli" printed on it; one pair of blood 

stained old blue slipper; one pair of red blood stained slipper; 

one faded black cap with "Chattanooga"; one light brown 


5 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Adidas track pant; one blue 'T' shirt with "Adventure Tour" 

printed on it and one light green 'T' shirt with "Angry Birds" 

printed on it through Property Seizure Memo (exhibit-16) in 

the presence of two witnesses Bhadrey Bishwakarma (P.W.8) 

and Dhiraj Rai (P.W.9). The seizures vide Property Seizure 

Memo (exhibit-16) also stands proved by the Investigating 

Officer and the two seizure witnesses named above. 

8. 
On 24.05.2013 at 1115 hours the Investigating Officer 

would further seize white/green/grey old sleeping bag with 

blood stain; plastic mat with blood stain (red and green); 

controlled sample of blood collected from place of occurrence 

in a glass container; controlled sample of mud collected from 

the place of occurrence in a plastic container; one plastic 

profile mat (black) with blood stain; one blood stained jute 

sack with "M.P." printed on it through Property Seizure Memo 

(exhibit-18) from the place of occurrence in the presence of two 

witnesses, Bhadrey Bishwakarma and Dhiraj Rai. The seizure 

vide Property Seizure Memo (exhibit-18) would also be proved 

by the Investigating Officer and the two seizure witnesses 

named above. 

9. 
On the same day i.e 24.05.2013 at half an hour past mid 

noon, the Investigating Officer would forward Suren Rai to the 

Medical Officer stationed at the Jorethang-Primary Health 

Center (PHC) for his medical examination. Dr. S. N. Adhikari 


6 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

(P.W.1) would then examine him and record his observation in 

the Medical Report (exhibit-1). However, in the said Medical 

Report of Suren Rai, Dr. S. N. Adhikari would endorse:-

"Suren Rai, 27 years s/o Dhan Bdr. Rai r/o Karmatar 
(W.B.). As stated by accused, he has assaulted on Monit 
Rai of same place with 'khukuri' which leads to death of 
the victim at the place of occurrence (Zoom/West 
Sikkim)." 

10. Dr. S. N. Adhikari in his deposition before the Trial Court 

however, would not expound about the extra judicial 

confession recorded in the Medical Report and only state that 

on examination of Suren Rai, there was no complaint or 

injuries and that he was physically and mentally sound and fit 

for custody. We would not be confident about the purported 

extra-judicial confession because the truth of what was 

scribed by Dr. S. N. Adhikari in the Medical Report would not 

be brought forth in his oral testimony and it was made whilst 

in custody of the police and thus clearly barred by Section 26 

of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. 

11. On 24.05.2013 at 1245 hours the Investigating Officer 

would seize three wearing apparels of Suren Rai, i.e., blood 

stained black 'T' shirt with "Marshall" printed on it, blue faded 

blood stained jeans pant with 'Salsa' printed on the inner side 

and one faded blue blood stained underwear with "Jookey" 

written on it through property seizure memo (exhibit-19) from 

Suren Rai at Naya Bazar Police Station in the presence of two 


7 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

witnesses, Bhadrey Bishwakarma and Dhiraj Rai. The seizure 

vide Property Seizure Memo (exhibit-19) would be proved by 

the Investigating Officer and the two seizure witnesses named 

above. The Investigating Officer would specifically depose that 

the police escort party produced Suren Rai at Naya Bazar, 

Police Station on 24.05.2013 at 1245 hours, after completion 

of medical examination and seize the said wearing apparels 

from the possession of Suren Rai. The defence wouldn't be 

able to tarnish this deposition. At 1250 hours thereafter the 

Investigating Officer would arrest Suren Rai at the Naya Bazar 

Police Station where he would be produced by Constable 

Topden Lepcha and Home Guard Yamnath Sharma. 

12. It is said; Suren Rai confessed to his crime, made a 

disclosure statement (exhibit-14) which would be recorded 

under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, before the 

Investigating Officer at 1255 p.m. on 24.5.2013, in the 

presence of two independent witnesses and signed the same 

stating that he had hidden the "khukuri" near Padam Kumar 

Rai's residence and he could show it to the police. The 

confession to the Investigating Officer and the disclosure 

statement are highly contested. 

13. The same May midsummer afternoon on 24.05.2013 at 

1325 hours the alleged weapon of offence, an 18 inch long 

"khukuri", the traditional curved machete and the symbol of 


8 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

the Nepalese/Gorkha communities' valour, would also be 

recovered from an open space just outside the kitchen window 

within the compound of Padam Kumar Rai, unfortunately, 

allegedly used for the dastardly act. The Property Seizure 

Memo (exhibit-15) would be proved by the Investigating Officer 

and two seizure witnesses, Bhadrey Bishwakarma and Dhiraj 

Rai and the said "khukuri" identified by them. However, both 

the said seizure witnesses would state that the alleged 

"khukuri" was lying in an open place which could be easily 

seen by everyone. The prosecution case as deposed by the 

Investigating Officer that the recovery of the "khukuri" was 

pursuant to the disclosure statement would, therefore, be 

contested by the defence as being tainted. 

14. On 06.06.2013 an application (exhibit-7) would be made 

by the Investigating Officer to the Learned Judicial Magistrate, 

West District at Gayzing (P.W.3) with a request to record the 

confessional statement of Suren Rai under Section 164 Cr.P.C. 

as he volunteers to depose about the facts with regard to the 

case. 

15. The Learned Judicial Magistrate would put preliminary 

questions (exhibit-8) to Suren Rai after he was brought to the 

Court on 06.06.2013 at 13.30 hours by one Krishna Bahadur 

Rai from the District Jail Namchi, which was recorded and 

later proved during trial, through the Learned Judicial 


9 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Magistrate. As many as 16 questions would be put to Suren 

Rai by the Learned Judicial Magistrate. 

16. The Learned Judicial Magistrate, thereafter, would give 

four days time for reflection to Suren Rai informing him that 

he should not mix around with the police or any other person 

and accordingly would send him to jail and direct him to 

appear on 10.06.2013 at 10.00 a.m. 

17. Suren Rai would be produced on 10.06.2013 before the 

Learned Judicial Magistrate after which he would be placed in 

custody of the staff of the Learned Judicial Magistrate and the 

Head Constable would be directed to leave the Court premises. 

On being satisfied that there were no policemen in the Court 

and chamber from where the Court could be seen or heard, 

the Learned Judicial Magistrate would put six questions to 

Suren Rai, record the memorandum of statement of the 

accused (exhibit-9) in compliance of Section 164 Cr.P.C., 

explain to Suren Rai that he was not bound to make any 

statement before her, record her satisfaction that the 

statement was voluntary and the fact that it was made in her 

presence and thereafter record the confession of the then 

accused, Suren Rai, under Section 164 Cr.P.C. on 10.06.2013 

(exhibit-10). The said confession would read as under:-

"At the relevant time I was working at Zoom, West 

Sikkim in the house of one Padma, I was given the job of 

cutting firewood along with one Manit Rai. We both are 


10 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

permanent residents of Karmatar, Darjeeling, West Bengal 

and were at Zoom for the work. 

On the relevant day, I drank some alcohol with Manit 

Rai at our temporary shed at around 2100 hours at Zoom, 

West Sikkim and we were little intoxicated and the said Manit 

Rai went out. Around 2130 hours, while I was still at my 

temporary shed, Manit Rai returned back and he had drank 

more alcohol outside and started provoking me into a fight for 

no reason. He also hurled a khukuri at me to kill me, however 

I dodged myself from that, after which I took the khukuri from 

him and stabbed him at the back of his neck thrice and 

stayed there for about an hour. At the time he was still alive. 

Thereafter I ran off towards Naya Bazar and the next 

day at about 0830 hours, the police apprehended me." 

18. The investigation of the case which would commence on 

25.04.2013 would result in a final report dated 22.07.2013 

within barely three months of the incident and a Sessions trial 

Case would be registered on 26.08.2013. Supplementary 

charge-sheets would however, be filed only on 01.10.2015. The 

first supplementary charge-sheet would relate to blood 

collected in a glass container seized from the place of 

occurrence on 24.05.2013 vide Property Seizure Memo 

(exhibit-18), controlled sample gauge piece with blood stains of 

the deceased, black hair samples having blood stains of the 

deceased, black hair samples of the deceased, six black hair 

strands of Suren Rai and blood sample of Suren Rai collected 

vide requisition dated 06.06.2013 (exhibit-11). The evidence 

collected and seized on 03.07.2013 would be sent to CFSL, 


11 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Kolkatta for DNA comparison and analysis and vide expert 

opinion dated 03.08.2015 under the signature of Dr. Anil 

Kumar Sharma, Deputy Director (Biology) and Scientist 'D', 

from CFSL Kolkata (P.W.11) the result would be placed before 

the Court. The other supplementary charge-sheet would relate 

to the soil sample collected from the place of occurrence, blood 

stained "khukuri" seized vide Property Seizure Memo (exhibit-

15), blood stained black 'T' shirt with "Marshall" printed on it, 

blood stained faded blue jeans pant with "Salsa" printed on it 

and blood stained underwear with "Jookey" printed on it all 

seized on 24.05.2013 from the possession of Suren Rai vide 

Property Seizure Memo (exhibit-19). The expert opinion dated 

08.09.2015 (exhibit-26) would also be placed before the Court. 

The expert who gave the said opinion would be one Dr. P. Paul 

Ramesh from CFSL, Kolkata. The expert would not be 

examined. However, the expert opinion would be exhibited by 

the Investigating Officer without a protest by the defence. 

19. These seizures of the biological as well as physical 

evidence and the expert opinions would reveal disturbing and 

unfortunate situation. The seizures and collection of blood 

samples and hair samples would take place on 24.05.2013 

and 06.06.2013. The seized evidence would be forwarded and 

received by the CFSL, Kolkatta on 24.07.2013. The CFSL, 

Kolkatta would keep these evidences till 17.03.2015 and 


12 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

10.07.2015 and finally give its opinion on 29.06.2015 and 

25.07.2015 during which period material evidence collected 

would degrade to such an extent that the experts examining 

them would not be able to decipher the evidence completely. 

20. The truth of what transpired that rainy night when a 

young 27 year old youth lost his life and that too by multiple 

assaults below the skull and on the neck would be accessible 

to the Investigating Officer within the confines of the little 

temporary shed strewn with evidence which had the 

propensity to narrate the gruesome story. The voiceless cry for 

justice of the deceased could have been heard from the blood 

soaked clothes, GIS sheets, profile mat, jute sack, slippers, 

track pants and the quilt recovered and seized. An 

investigative mind with a determination to do justice and seek 

the truth would do so from each of these evidences. The 

Investigating Officer should be mindful of what is commonly 

known as "Locard's Principle" formulated by Dr. Edmond 

Locard. Simply put it is: "Every contact leaves a trace". This 

principle explained means that the perpetrator of a crime will 

bring something into the crime scene and leave with 

something from it and that both can be used as forensic 

evidence. We would believe that forensic evidence and not 

limited to finger prints alone would be available at the scene of 

crime, which, it is quite obvious, the perpetrator had not even 


13 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

bothered to tamper. The scene of crime and in this case the 

little temporary shed, immediately sanitized from any outside 

interference, would be a place where the perpetrator would 

have stepped, touched and been in physical contact with the 

material objects available and therefore, rich with both 

biological and physical evidence. The biological evidence like 

blood and hair seen at this place of occurrence and seized are 

required to be not only preserved carefully and scientifically 

but also examined in right earnest to come to a definite 

conclusion before time chooses to erode the evidence and fog 

the vision. Those inanimate objects would have witnessed 

silently the gruesome act and could serve as witnesses to the 

perpetrator committing homicide. Similarly, the scene of crime 

ought to be scanned for finger print and foot prints which 

would obviously be available. The physical evidence would 

never lie or commit perjury or forget. The Investigating 

agencies human failure alone in finding it, preserving it and 

studying it would allow it to remain inanimate and voiceless. 

We would believe that the forensic evidence would be 

decipherable with the use of scientific methods and 

technology. We would desire, nay implore the State to 

introduce and make available to the investigative agencies 

new, updated scientific methods and technologies for forensic 

examination although we are certain that we would not err 

even if we were to adjure the State to do so. This was a little 


14 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

diversion, much necessitated by the facts of this case, now 

back to the facts. 

21. Suren Rai would be charged for manslaughter. The trial, 

however, would result in acquittal of Suren Rai. The State is 

aggrieved by the Impugned Judgment dated 29.02.2016 of the 

Learned Sessions Judge, West Sikkim at Gyalshing 
in 

Sessions Trial Case No. 06 of 2014. 

22. The Appeal is therefore, against acquittal. The 

presumption of innocence in favour of Suren Rai from the 

lodging of the FIR till judgment day is now fortified. If the view 

adopted by the Trial Court is a reasonable one in the 

conclusion reached by it and had its ground well set out on 

the materials on record, numerous precedents from the 

Supreme Court would say-the acquittal may not be interfered 

with. 

23. There being no eye witness to the crime the present case 

is based on circumstantial evidence. The law, to prove a case 

on circumstantial evidence, is also well settled. The 

circumstances from which the conclusion of the guilt is to be 

drawn must be fully established. The facts so established 

should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of 

Suren Rai and no other. The circumstances should be of 

conclusive nature and should exclude every possible 

hypothesis except that it is Suren Rai and Suren Rai alone 


15 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

who is guilty of murder. The chain of evidence must be so 

complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the 

conclusion consistent with the innocence of Suren Rai and the 

Court must be judicially confident that it is Suren Rai who is 

guilty and the heinous act has been perpetrated by him and 

none other. 

24. The question, so vital, to be answered by the Trial Judge 

was whether on the fateful intervening night of 23.05.2013 

and 24.05.2013 did Suren Rai assault the deceased Monit Rai 

with the "khukuri" and murder him? 

25. The solitary charge for murder was framed on 

23.05.2014 and in the trial that ensued, 11 witnesses would 

be examined by the prosecution. The statement of the then 

accused, Suren Rai, on his examination under Section 313 

Cr.P.C. to explain the various incriminating circumstances 

appearing in the evidence against him, would be conducted on 

30.07.2015 and 16.02.2016 in the end of which Suren Rai 

would plead innocence and state that he had not committed 

the offence. Suren Rai would also resile from his confessional 

statement. 

26. The judgement of acquittal by the Learned Sessions 

Judge is based on the Trial Courts judicial analysis on four 

pivotal issues. The Learned Sessions Judge would not believe 

the prosecution version of the recording of the disclosure 


16 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

statement (exhibit-14) purportedly under Section 27 of the 

Indian Evidence Act, 1872 in the presence of two witnesses 

and the subsequent recovery of the alleged weapon of offence, 

the "khukuri", vide Property Seizure Memo (exhibit-15). The 

Learned Session Judge would also not believe the last scene 

theory put-forth by the prosecution. The judicial confession of 

Suren Rai made before the Learned Judicial Magistrate would 

be disregarded. The evidence of Padam Kumar Rai, the 

employer of both the deceased and Suren Rai, the 

"lumberjacks" and in whose compound the gruesome act was 

committed would not also inspire confidence in the Learned 

Sessions Judge due to which the Learned Sessions Judge 

would hold the evidence of Padam Kumar Rai, Bhadrey 

Bishwakarma and Dhiraj Rai "totally doubtful". 

27. The Learned Sessions Judge would believe the 

explanation given by Suren Rai in his statement under Section 

313 Cr.P.C. by which he would state that due to the 

continuous harassment and threat by the deceased he had left 

for Karmatar around 8.30 p.m. on 23.05.2013. 

28. It was the same night that the deceased was mercilessly 

hacked to death. This is well established. 

29. The burden of proof so heavily set on the prosecution to 

prove every ingredient of the alleged offence of murder would 

be held not satisfied and the Learned Sessions Judge would 


17 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

find that the gap between the deceased last seen alive by 

Padam Kumar Rai and his finding the dead body the next 

morning was so wide that the trial Court could not rule out the 

possibility of a third person coming in between. A purported 

confession of Suren Rai to the Investigating Officer would also 

not be believed and thus Suren Rai would be held not guilty 

and acquitted of the solitary charge of murder. 

30. We have meticulously examined the evidences, oral and 

documentary, as well as the impugned judgment. This is a 

case of a brutal murder. This is also a case in which Suren Rai 

has been acquitted by the trial Court. The able assistance 

rendered by Mr. Karma Thinlay Namgyal, the Additional Public 

Prosecutor and Mr. B. Sharma, Senior Advocate, appearing for 

the Respondent are well appreciated. The various judicial 

pronouncements of the Supreme Court relied upon by the 

Learned Counsels have guided our judgment in the present 

case. 

31. The Learned Sessions Judge would hold that the death 

was homicidal and proved by the medical evidence. Dr. O. T. 

Lepcha, (P.W.2) the Medico Legal Specialist at the S.T.N.M. 

Hospital, Gangtok has coherently and convincingly proved his 

Autopsy Report (exhibit-2). 

32. It was the deceased who succumbed to the multiple 

wounds by a sharp, moderately heavy weapon in the 


18 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

intervening night of 23.05.2013 and 24.05.2013 in the 

temporary shed in which the deceased and Suren Rai were 

residing within the premises owned by Padam Kumar Rai and 

the subsequent recovery of the dead body of the deceased are 

also proved by the evidence of Padam Kumar Rai, the evidence 

of the Investigating Officer, inquest witnesses Bhadrey 

Bishwakarma and Dhiraj Rai proving the Inquest Report 

(exhibit-20) of the inquest conducted on 24.05.2013, the 

evidence of Dr. O. T. Lepcha and the Autopsy Report (exhibit-

2) and the Dead Body Challan (exhibit-3) proved by Dr. O. T. 

Lepcha. The FIR proved by Padam Kumar Rai corroborates the 

above facts. The photographs marked (exhibit-21) (collectively) 

captures and freezes the Investigating Officers first memory of 

the scene of crime evidencing the heinous act upon the 

deceased, when he exhibits the same during his deposition. 

33. The arrest of Suren Rai from Karmatar by two Police 

Officers Constable, Topden Lepcha and Home Guard, Yamnath 

Sharma on 24.05.2015 would be proved by their evidence as 

well as the arrest Memo (exhibit-24) proved by the 

Investigating Officer. The Learned Sessions Judge would find 

fault in the failure of the prosecution to examine any witness 

from Karmatar or any evidence as to what time the accused 

reached Karmatar. The Learned Sessions Judge would 

consequently doubt the entire evidence of the prosecution 


19 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

witnesses. Constable Topden Lepcha would depose that on 

24.05.2010 at around 9.00 a.m. as per the instructions given 

by the Station House Officer, Naya Bazar Police Station he and 

Home Guard Yamnath Sharma went to Karmatar to 

apprehend Suren Rai, met him at the Karmatar School 

ground, apprehended him and brought him to Naya Bazar 

Police Station. In cross-examination Constable Topden Lepcha 

would state that it would take 10 to 15 minutes to reach 

Karmatar from Naya Bazar Police Station and 30 to 35 

minutes from the place of occurrence. Padam Kumar Rai 

would depose that Suren Rai left his house after 8.00 p.m. on 

23.05.2013. Suren Rai would himself explain in his statement 

under Section 313 Cr.P.C. that he left for Karmatar at 8.30 

p.m. on 23.05.2013. It is thus clear that Suren Rai would 

have reached Karmatar 30 to 35 minutes thereafter. The 

failure of the prosecution to examine any witness from 

Karmatar, which could be for any number of reasons ought 

not to have distracted the focus of the Learned Sessions Judge 

to see whether from the evidence available the prosecution had 

been able to establish their case. In re: Raja v. State of 

Haryana 1 the Supreme Court would hold:-

"13. ....... It is well settled in law that non-examination of 
material witness is not a mathematical formula for discarding the 
weight of the testimony available on record, if the same is natural, 
trustworthy and convincing ......"

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

34. All other circumstances having been cogently proved by 

the prosecution, the four pivotal issues examined by the 

Learned Special Judge are required to be reconsidered in the 

present appeal within the parameters of settled law of 

appreciation of appeal against acquittal. If the evidence 

produced and proved gives rise to a strong suspicion but does 

not conclusively prove the guilt, Suren Rai's acquittal is to be 

upheld. If the evidence produced and proved gives rise to two 

probable conclusions one in favour of Suren Rai and the other 

against, even then Suren Rai's acquittal is to be upheld. 

Judicial Confession 

35. On 06.06.2013 the Investigating Officer vide a 

communication (exhibit-7) would appraise the Learned 

Judicial Magistrate that Suren Rai was arrested on 

24.05.2013 and sent to judicial custody on the same date and 

further that Suren Rai "volunteers to depose facts with regard 

to the instant case in the Hon'ble Court of law." 
The 

Investigating Officer, therefore, would request the Learned 

Judicial Magistrate to record the statement of Suren Rai under 

Section 164 Cr.P.C. The said application would be examined 

by the Learned Judicial Magistrate on the same date. On 

06.06.2013 itself, Suren Rai, having been brought before the 

Learned Judicial Magistrate at 1330 hours, would be placed in 


21 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

custody of peon Dhrona Sharma and the police would be 

directed to leave the premises. Having satisfied herself that 

there was no policeman in the Court or in any place where the 

proceedings could be seen or heard except the peon, not 

concerned in the investigation of the crime, as necessary to 

guard the witness, the Learned Judicial Magistrate would put 

16 questions to Suren Rai to ensure the voluntariness of the 

confession to be recorded. It would be explained to Suren Rai 

that she was a Magistrate and had no concern with the police. 

Suren Rai would be asked whether he had any complaint of ill 

treatment against the police or other person responsible for 

bringing him to the Court. Suren Rai would reply with a "no". 

Suren Rai would be asked whether he consented to be 

examined by the Learned Judicial Magistrate. He would reply 

in the affirmative. Suren Rai would be asked if he wished to 

make any statement. He would again reply in the affirmative. 

Suren Rai would be specifically asked whether he wanted to 

consult an advocate of his choice before proceeding any 

further. He would reply with a "no". Suren Rai would be 

informed that he was not bound to make a statement or there 

is no compulsion that he should make a statement. He would 

say he understood the information. Suren Rai would also be 

informed that if he made a statement it would be taken down 

and may be used against him as evidence. He would say he 

understood the information. Suren Rai would be asked 


22 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

whether the police or any other person threatened him to 

make a statement. He would say "no". Suren Rai would be 

asked whether the police or anyone else promised him that 

lesser punishment would be awarded if he made a statement 

or that he would be acquitted. Suren Rai would state "no they 

have not told me anything like that". Suren Rai would be asked 

whether the police or any other person had given him any 

allurement to make a statement and the reply would be a "no". 

Suren Rai would be specifically asked if he was under 

pressure of the police to make statement under Section 164 

Cr.P.C. and the reply would again be a "no". Suren Rai would 

be asked if he still desired to make a statement and the reply 

would be a "yes". When asked when it first occurred to him 

that he should make the statement and why did it occur to 

him to do so, Suren Rai would reply: "immediately after I was 

arrested and realized that I had made a mistake". When asked 

why he was making a statement, Suren Rai would state: 

"because I had committed the offence". Suren Rai would be 

specifically asked whether he was making the statement 

voluntarily, Suren Rai would reply with a "yes". Finally, Suren 

Rai would be informed that he was given four days time for 

reflection. He would also be told not to keep in touch with the 

police. On being asked whether he understood the same he 

would reply with a "yes". Accordingly, Suren Rai would be 

given four days time for reflection and sent to jail with 


23 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

personnel with a direction to appear before the Learned 

Judicial Magistrate on 10.06.2013 at 10 a.m. 

36. The aforesaid details culled out from the record of the 

questionnaires put to Suren Rai amply and substantially fulfil 

the requirements of Section 164 (2) of Cr.P.C. Complete and 

adequate examination seems to have been undertaken by the 

Learned Judicial Magistrate to satisfy herself regarding the 

voluntariness of the statement of Suren Rai to be recorded. 

37. On 10.06.2013 Suren Rai would be produced by a Head 

Constable from the District Jail. He would be placed in 

custody of the Learned Judicial Magistrate's staff and the 

Head Constable from the District Jail would be directed to 

leave the Court premises. The Learned Judicial Magistrate 

would satisfy herself that there was no policeman in the Court 

and chamber from where the Court could be seen or heard. 

Thereafter, the Learned Judicial Magistrate would inform 

Suren Rai that she was a Magistrate and had no connection 

with the police. Suren Rai would be asked whether he 

understood the said fact to which he would reply with a "yes". 

Suren Rai would once again be asked whether he had any 

complain of ill treatment by the police and the answer would 

be a "no". Suren Rai would be asked whether he was induced, 

coerced, promised or advised by the police to make a 

statement and the answer would be a "no". Suren Rai would 


24 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

be asked whether the statement he offered to make was 

induced by any harsh treatment and if so by whom and the 

answer would be a "no". Suren Rai would be informed that he 

was a free agent and not bound to make any statement. He 

would also be informed that it is open to him to make 

statement before her or not. Suren Rai would answer that he 

had understood the information. Suren Rai would be asked 

whether he still desired to make a statement after having been 

given four days of reflection time to think about it and the 

reply would be: "yes, since I have committed the offence, I 

desire to make my statement." The Learned Judicial 

Magistrate, thereafter, would explain to the accused that he is 

not bound to make any statement before her. The Learned 

Judicial Magistrate would believe that the statement was made 

voluntarily. 
Having 
satisfied 
herself 
regarding 
the 

voluntariness of the statement, the Learned Judicial 

Magistrate would record the confessional statement after 

which the mandate of Section 164 (4) and 281 of Cr.P.C. would 

be complied with. Memorandum of the statement of the 

accused recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. would be 

prepared and signed by both the Learned Judicial Magistrate 

as well as the accused as required. However, the statement of 

Suren Rai would be recorded in the "form for recording 

deposition" and the details of Suren Rai, the Magistrate 

recording the deposition, the date of the deposition, the name 


25 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

of the person deposing, his father's name, age, village would be 

duly filled which would read thus:-

"FORM FOR RECORDING DEPOSITION 

The deposition of accused Suren Rai for the Court taken on Oath 
solemn affirmation before me Subarna Rai, Judicial Magistrate, West 
Sikkim at Gyalshing on this the 10 th day of June, 2013 

My name is Suren Rai 

My father's name is Dhan Bahadur Rai, 

I am aged about 27 yrs. 

My home is at village Karmatar, Darjeeling, West 
Bengal 

I reside at present at village Karmatar, Darjeeling, West Bengal 
where I am a labourer." 

38. The Learned Judicial Magistrate would be examined and 

she would depose that she had been satisfied that Suren Rai 

had understood the nature of the proceeding and he was 

willing to give his statement voluntarily despite knowing that it 

would be used against him. The Learned Judicial Magistrate 

would also depose that the contents of the confession so 

recorded was read over and explained to Suren Rai in Nepali 

and admitted by him to be his true statement. The Learned 

Judicial Magistrate would also be cross-examined by the 

defence when she would state that she had not informed the 

accused about free legal aid before recording his confession 

under Section 164 Cr.P.C. The defence would take a denial 

that the statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. was voluntarily. 

No question would be asked, as sought to be raised in the 

present appeal, on the issue of purported administration of 


26 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

oath on Suren Rai, in the manner detailed above, before 

recording his confession. 

39. As we would find that the issue of administration of oath 

on an accused before recording a confession raised important 

question to be judicially answered, a reference would be made 

vide Order dated 03.07.2017 to the Full Court. The Full Court 

would render its judgment dated 10.03.2018 answering all the 

three questions referred. 

40. From the perusal of the records it is quite clear that the 

mandate of Section 164 and 281 of Cr.P.C. had been 

substantially complied with by the Learned Judicial Magistrate 

before recording the confession. The Learned Sessions Judge 

would, however, hold that Suren Rai would explain in a 

statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. that he had expressed 

his desire to make the statement on being pressurised by the 

Investigating Officer. The Learned Sessions Judge would also 

hold that the statement recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. 

is not a substantive piece of evidence and could be used only 

to corroborate the statement of the witnesses or to contradict 

them. On the said two grounds, the Learned Sessions Judge 

would not rely upon the confession. 

41. The Full Bench of this Court vide its judgment dated 

10.03.2018 in re: State of Sikkim v. Suren Rai would hold:-


27 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

""Confessions" are one species of the genus "admission" 

consisting of a direct acknowledgement of guilt by an accused 

in a criminal case. "Confessions" are thus "admissions" but all 

admissions are not confessions. A confession can be acted 

upon if the Court is satisfied that it is voluntary and true. 

Judgment of conviction can also be based on confession if it is 

found to be truthful, deliberate and voluntary and if clearly 

proved. An unambiguous confession, as held by the Supreme 

Court, if admissible in evidence, and free from suspicion 

suggesting its falsity, is a valuable piece of evidence which 

possess a high probative force because it emanates directly 

from the person committing the offence. To act on such 

confessions the Court must be extremely vigilant and 

scrutinize every relevant factor to ensure that the confession is 

truthful and voluntary. Although the word confession has not 

been defined in the Evidence Act, 1872 the Privy Council in re: 

Pakala Narayanaswami v. King Emperor has clearly laid 

down that a confession must either admit in terms the offence, 

or at any rate substantially all the facts which constitute the 

offence. As abundant caution the Courts have sought for 

corroboration of the confession though. As per Taylor's 

Treaties on the law of Evidence, Vol. I a confession is 

considered highly reliable because no rational person would 

make admission against his own interest prompted by his 

conscience to tell the truth. If the Court finds that the 

confession was voluntary, truthful and not caused by any 

inducement, threat or promise it gains a high degree of 

probability. To insulate such confession from any extraneous 

pressure affecting the voluntariness and truthfulness the laws 

have provided various safeguards and protections. A 

confession is made acceptable against the accused 

fundamental right of silence. A confession by hope or promise 

of gain or advantage is equally unacceptable as a confession 

by reward or immunity, by force or fear or by violence or 

threat. As held by the Supreme Court in re: Navjot Sandhu 

(supra) the authority recording the confession at the pre-trial 

stage must address himself to the issue whether the accused 

has come forward to make the confession in an atmosphere 


28 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

free from fear, duress or hope of some advantage or reward 

induced by the person in authority. It is therefore, the solemn 

duty of the authorities both investigating agencies as well as 

Courts to ensure, before acting on such confession, that the 

same is safe to be acted upon and that there is no element of 

doubt that the confession is voluntary and truthful and not 

actuated by any inducement, threat or promise from any 

quarter. To do so the Magistrate must create an atmosphere 

and an environment which would allow voluntary confession 

induced by nothing else but his conscience to speak the truth 

and confess the crime. In deciding whether a particular 

confession attracts the frown of Section 24 of the Evidence 

Act, the question has to be considered from the point of view of 

the confessing accused as to how the inducement, threat or 

promise proceeding from a person in authority would operate 

in his mind." 

42. 
The Supreme Court in re: Subramania Goundan v. State 

of Madras 2 would hold:-

"14. The next question is whether there is 
corroboration of the confession since it has been retracted. A 
confession of a crime by a person, who has perpetrated it, is 
usually the outcome of penitence and remorse and in normal 
circumstances is the best evidence against the maker. The 
question has very often arisen whether a retracted confession 
may form the basis of conviction if believed to be true and 
voluntarily made. For the purpose of arriving at this conclusion 
the court has to take into consideration not only the reasons 
given for making the confession or retracting it but the 
attending facts and circumstances surrounding the same. It 
may be remarked that there can be no absolute rule that a 
retracted confession cannot be acted upon unless the same is 
corroborated materially." 

43. In re: Aloke Nath Dutta v. State of W.B. 3 the Supreme Court 

would hold: 

2 AIR 1958 SC 66 


29 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

"113. The value of a retracted confession is now well known. 

The court must be satisfied that the confession at the first instance 

is true and voluntary. (See Subramania Goundan v. State of Madras 

[AIR 1958 SC 66 : 1958 Cri LJ 238] and Pyare Lal Bhargava v. State 

of Rajasthan [AIR 1963 SC 1094 : (1963) 2 Cri LJ 178] .) 

114. Caution and prudence in accepting a retracted 

confession is an ordinary rule. (See Puran v. State of Punjab (I) [AIR 

1953 SC 459 : 1953 Cri LJ 1925] .) Although if a retracted 

confession is found to be corroborative in material particulars, it may 

be the basis of conviction. (Balbir Singh v. State of Punjab [AIR 1957 

SC 216 : 1957 Cri LJ 481] ) 

115. We may notice that in 1950s and 1960s corroborative 

evidence in "material particulars" was the rule. (See Puran [AIR 

1953 SC 459 : 1953 Cri LJ 1925] , Balbir Singh [AIR 1957 SC 216 : 

1957 Cri LJ 481] and Nand Kumar v. State of Rajasthan [(1963) 2 

Cri LJ 702 (SC)] .) A distinctiveness was made in later years in 

favour of "general corroboration" or "broad corroboration". (See for 

"General Corroboration" -State of Maharashtra v. Bharat 

Chaganlal Raghani [(2001) 9 SCC 1 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 377] ; "General 

trend of Corroboration" -Jameel Ahmed v. State of Rajasthan 

[(2003) 9 SCC 673 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 1853] and "Broad Corroboration" 

-Parmananda Pegu v. State of Assam [(2004) 7 SCC 779 : 2004 

SCC (Cri) 2081 : AIR 2004 SC 4197] .) 

116. Whatever be the terminology used, one rule is almost 

certain that no judgment of conviction shall be passed on an 

uncorroborated retracted confession. The court shall consider the 

materials on record objectively in regard to the reasons for 

retraction. It must arrive at a finding that the confession was truthful 

and voluntary. Merit of the confession being the voluntariness and 

truthfulness, the same, in no circumstances, should be 

compromised. We are not oblivious of some of the decisions of this 

Court which proceeded on the basis that conviction of an accused on 

the basis of a retracted confession is permissible but only if it is 

3 (2007) 12 SCC 230 


30 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

found that retraction made by the accused was wholly on a false 

premise. (See Balbir Singh [AIR 1957 SC 216 : 1957 Cri LJ 481] .) 

117. There cannot, however, be any doubt or dispute that 

although retracted confession is admissible, the same should be 

looked at with some amount of suspicion -a stronger suspicion 

than that which is attached to the confession of an approver who 

leads evidence in the court." 

44. It would be apposite to point out that Suren Rai had 

voluntarily given his confession before the Learned Magistrate 

before whom he candidly stated that he wanted to make the 

confession because he had committed the offence. Various 

opportunities would be provided by the Learned Judicial 

Magistrate in the form of questions inquiring about any direct 

or indirect pressure, influence, hope or lure from the police or 

anyone else to Suren Rai and on each such occasion he would 

candidly reply with an emphatic "no". The confession was 

recorded by the Learned Judicial Magistrate on 10.06.2013. 

The charges were framed on 23.05.2014. 11 witnesses were 

examined including the Investigating Officer during the trial. 

On the closure of evidence, the examination of Suren Rai, as 

an accused, would be conducted on 30.07.2015 and 

16.02.2016 more than a year after the framing of charges 

against him. Suren Rai sought to retract his confession only at 

the time of recording his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. 

The reason, Suren Rai would assign, for retracting his 

confession is that he made his confession being pressurised by 


31 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

the Investigating Officer. There are no specific details of how 

the Investigating Officer exerted pressure on Suren Rai in his 

explanation. The Investigating Officer was cross-examined by 

the defence. There is not even a denial of having confessed 

before the Learned Judicial Magistrate in the cross-

examination of the Investigating Officer. If there was any kind 

of pressure exerted by the Investigating Officer due to which 

Suren Rai would volunteer to give his confession to the 

Learned Judicial Magistrate it was incumbent upon the 

defence to cross-examine the Investigating Officer regarding 

the specific details of the alleged pressure exerted by him to 

elicit the truth of the allegation, which was not done. In his 

subsequent examination under Section 313 Cr.P.C. the 

Respondent would also be asked: "3. As per P.W.3, after 

recording the statement same was read over and explained to 

you which was admitted by you to be true and correct. Exhibit 

10 is your statement recorded by her under Section 164 Cr.P.C. 

What have you to say?" The Respondent would answer: "It is 

true". In view of the same it is unequivocally clear that the 

allegation of the confession not being voluntarily and made 

only after pressure was exerted by the Investigating Officer 

was an afterthought of the defence far too late in the day to 

invoke any further and deeper consideration. However, as 

adverted before, since an issue of substantial importance that 

oath having been administered the confession must be 


32 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

discarded had been raised by Mr. B. Sharma this Court would 

refer the issue before the Full Bench. A Full Bench of this 

Court in re: State of Sikkim v. Suren Rai (supra) would inter-alia 

hold:-

"126. It is also evident that on examination of Section 
164(5) Cr.P.C. administering of oath to an accused while 
recording confession without anything more may lead to an 
inference that the confession was not voluntary. However, 
there could be stray cases in which the confessions had been 
recorded in full and complete compliance of the mandate of 
Section 164 and 281 Cr.P.C and that the confession was 
voluntary and truthful and no oath may have been actually 
administered but inspite of the same the confession was 
recorded in the prescribed form for recording deposition or 
statement of witness giving an impression that oath was 
administered upon the accused. If the Court before which such 
document is tendered finds that it was so, Section 463 Cr.P.C 
would be applicable and the Court shall take evidence of non-
compliance of Section 164 and 281 Cr.P.C. to satisfy itself that 
in fact it was so and if satisfied about the said fact is also 
satisfied that the failure to record the otherwise voluntary 
confession was not in the proper form only and did not injure 
the accused the confession may be admitted in evidence. We 
answer the second question accordingly." 

45. Admittedly this issue was not raised before the trial 

Court. Admittedly again no questions were asked to the 

Learned Judicial Magistrate who recorded the confession 

about the administration of oath nor any explanation sought. 

The record of the confession clearly reflects that the confession 

was recorded in the "Form for recording deposition". The issue 

not having been raised specifically before the Court it is 

evident that the Court has not taken evidence under Section 

463 Cr.P.C. After the Full Bench of this Court rendered his 

judgment on the issue of administration of oath to an accused 

the matter would be listed for hearing to give an opportunity to 


33 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

the Appellant as well as the Respondent to make submissions 

on the effect of the said judgment. At the said hearing held on 

11.04.2018 Mr. Karma Thinlay would submit that a bare 

perusal of the confession recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. 

makes it clear that oath was not actually administered upon 

the Respondent and the words "taken on oath solemn 

affirmation" was part of a pre-typed "form or recording 

deposition" and as such in view of paragraph 126 of the said 

judgment rendered by the Full Bench of this Court it would be 

important to remit the matter to the Court of the Learned 

Sessions Judge for the limited purpose of taking evidence of 

non-compliance of Section 164 and 281 Cr.P.C. On hearing 

the parties this Court would direct that the case papers be 

remitted to the Court of the Learned Sessions Judge for 

examining whether oath was actually administered upon the 

Respondent by the Learned Magistrate while recording his 

confession. The Learned Sessions Judge would re-examine the 

Learned Magistrate now Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, 

giving an opportunity to the Respondent to cross-examine the 

Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate and thereafter give further 

opportunity to the Respondent to explain the circumstances 

under Section 313 Cr.P.C. pursuant to which the records 

would be placed before this Court. The Appellant as well as the 

Respondent would be re-heard on 30.05.2018. Mr. Karma 

Thinley would submit that the evidence of the Learned Chief 


34 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Judicial Magistrate would make it evident that oath was in fact 

not administered upon the Respondent and the confessional 

statement was voluntary. Mr. B. Sharma to the contrary would 

submit that in view of the judgement of the Full Bench of this 

Court the Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate stated that she 

had not actually administered oath although the records of the 

examination would reveal that oath was actually administered. 

He would further submit that in view of the documentary 

evidence which records that oath was administered there was 

no question of taking oral evidence and the said oral evidence 

would thus have little evidentiary value. He would draw the 

attention of this Court to Sections 91 and 94 of the Evidence 

Act, 1872. Mr. B. Sharma's submission on exclusion of oral 

evidence is in ignorance of Section 463 Cr.P.C. A perusal of the 

cross-examination of the Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate 

would disclose that the defence had not cross-examined her on 

the allegation made before us that her evidence was the result 

of the judgment of the Full Bench which is impermissible. 

Ambiguities, 
peculiarities 
in 
expression 
and 
the 

inconsistencies between the written words and the existing 

facts can also be explained by intrinsic evidence. The 

deposition of the Learned Magistrate dated 26.04.2018 makes 

it abundantly clear that oath had in fact not been 

administered upon the Respondent while recording the 


35 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

confession. It is thus quite evident that this Court must 

examine the confession statement. 

Disclosure statement (Exhibit 14) 

46. The disclosure statement dated 24.05.2013 is recorded in 

Nepali. It is signed by Suren Rai, the Investigating Officer and 

two witnesses, Bhadrey Biswakarma and Dhiraj Rai. The 

Investigating Officer has proved his signature thereon. So have 

the two witnesses. 

47. The disclosure statement of Suren Rai states that on the 

night of 23.05.2013 he and the deceased had a fight after 

which he took out the "khukuri" he had and hit him from 

behind after which Suren Rai hid the "khukuri" close to the 

house of Padma "kopa" (grandfather in the Rai language). 

Suren Rai also stated that he could show the "khukuri" to the 

police in the presence of witnesses. 

48. 
Both Bhadrey Bishwakarma and Dhiraj Rai have 

deposed that on 24.05.2013 one Police Personnel of Naya 

Bazar Police Station recorded the statement of Suren Rai 

wherein he stated that he has concealed the weapon of offence 

i.e., "khukuri" near the house of Padam Kumar Rai. The said 

two witnesses also deposed that the disclosure statement was 

the statement given by Suren Rai. The said two witnesses also 

deposed about how Suren Rai took the Police Personnel and 


36 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

them near the house of Padam Kumar Rai and the subsequent 

discovery of the "khukuri" at his instance. However, during 

their cross-examination they stated that the disclosure 

statement was prepared by the Police only after the Suren Rai 

was asked by the police to make statement regarding the 

weapon of offence. The Learned Sessions Judge would take 

exception of the fact that the said two witnesses deposed that 

the disclosure statement was prepared by the police only after 

Suren Rai was asked to make a statement. This exception, to 

our mind is not correct as merely asking an accused to make a 

statement without anything more cannot lead to any negative 

inference. However, the said two witnesses would also state 

that the statement was not voluntary. The said two witnesses 

were not declared hostile on this aspect and cross-examined 

by the prosecution. The prosecution is bound by their evidence 

that the disclosure statement was not voluntary. 

49. The submission of the defence found favour with the 

Learned Sessions Judge who would hold the disclosure 

statement not proved. On perusal of the depositions of the 

seizure witnesses it is seen that both of them deposed that the 

disclosure statement was not the voluntary statement of Suren 

Rai. 

50. The question which therefore falls for consideration is 

whether a disclosure statement is required to be voluntary? 


37 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

51. Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 provides:-

"27. How much of information received from 
accused may be proved.-Provided that, when any fact is 
deposed to as discovered in consequence of information 
received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody 
of a police officer, so much of such information, whether it 
amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact 
thereby discovered, may be proved." 

52. Section 25 and 26 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 are 

also important for the purpose of understanding Section 27 

thereof and thus reproduced herein below:-

"25. Confession to police officer not to be proved.-
No confession made to a police officer, shall, be proved as 
against a person accused of any offence." 

"26. Confession by accused while in custody of 
police not to be proved against him. No confession made 
by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer, 
unless it be made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, 
shall be proved as against such person. 

Explanation.-In this section "Magistrate" does not 
include the head of a village discharging magisterial functions 
in the Presidency of Fort St. George or elsewhere, unless such 
headman is a Magistrate exercising the powers of a 
Magistrate under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1882 (10 of 
1882)." 

53. Sir John Beaumont, in re: Pulukuri Kottaya and others v. 

The King Emperor 4 would hold that Section 27 of the Indian 

Evidence Act, 1872 seems to be based on the view that if a fact 

is actually discovered in consequence of information given, 

some guarantee is afforded thereby that the information was 

true, and accordingly can be safely allowed to be given in 

evidence.

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

54. In re: State of Maharashtra v. Damu 5 , the Supreme Court 

would hold: 

"35. The basic idea embedded in Section 27 of the 
Evidence Act is the doctrine of confirmation by subsequent 
events. The doctrine is founded on the principle that if any fact 
is discovered in a search made on the strength of any 
information obtained from a prisoner, such a discovery is a 
guarantee that the information supplied by the prisoner is 
true. The information might be confessional or non-inculpatory 
in nature, but if it results in discovery of a fact it becomes a 
reliable information. Hence the legislature permitted such 
information to be used as evidence by restricting the 
admissible portion to the minimum. It is now well settled that 
recovery of an object is not discovery of a fact envisaged in the 
section. The decision of the Privy Council in Pulukuri Kottaya 
v. Emperor is the most quoted authority for supporting the 
interpretation that the "fact discovered" envisaged in the 
section embrace the place from which the object was 
produced, the knowledge of the accused as to it, but the 
information given must relate distinctly to that effect." 

55. The only portion of the disclosure statement which is 

admissible is the statement of Suren Rai that he had hidden 

the "khukuri" near the house of Padma Kumar Rai and he can 

show the same to the police in the presence of witnesses which 

is covered by Section 27 of the Evidence Act, 1872. The rest of 

the disclosure statement is in-admissible, being confessional 

and prohibited by Section 25 and 26 of the Indian Evidence 

Act, 1872. 

56. In re: Pulukuri Kottaya (supra) the Privy Council would 

hold: 

"S. 27, which is not artistically worded, provides 
an exception to the prohibition imposed by the preceding 
section and enables certain statements made by a 
person in police custody to be proved. The condition 

5 (2000) 6 SCC 269 


39 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

necessary to bring the section into operation is that the 
discovery of a fact in consequence of information 
received from a person accused of any offence in the 
custody of a Police officer must be deposed to, and 
thereupon so much of the information as relates 
distinctly to the fact thereby discovered may be proved. 
The section seems to be based on the view that if a fact 
is actually discovered in consequence of information 
given, some guarantee is afforded thereby that the 
information was true, and accordingly can be safely 
allowed to be given in evidence; but clearly the extent of 
the information admissible must depend on the exact 
nature of the fact discovered to which such information 
is required to relate. Normally the section is brought into 
operation when a person in police custody produces 
from some place of concealment some object, such as a 
dead body, a weapon, or ornaments, said to be 
connected with the crime of which the informant is 
accused. Mr. Megaw, for the Crown, has argued that in 
such a case the "fact discovered" is the physical object 
produced, and that any information which relates 
distinctly to that object can be proved. Upon this view 
information given by a person that the body produced is 
that of a person murdered by him, that the weapon 
produced is the one used by him in the commission of a 
murder, or that the ornaments produced were stolen in 
a dacoity would all be admissible. If this be the effect of 
S. 27, little substance would remain in the ban imposed 
by the two preceding sections on confessions made to 
the police, or by persons in police custody. That ban 
was presumably inspired by the fear of the legislature 
that a person under police influence might be induced to 
confess by the exercise of undue pressure. But if all that 
is required to lift the ban be the inclusion in the 
confession of information, relating to an object 
subsequently produced, it seems reasonable to suppose 
that the pursuasive powers of the police will prove equal 
to the occasion, and that in practice the ban will lose its 
effect. On normal principles of construction their 
Lordships think that the proviso to S. 26, added by S. 
27, should not be held to nullify the substance of the 
section. ............................................" 

57. It is not the case of the defence that Suren Rai did not 

make the disclosure statement or that he did not sign on it. 

However, the defence would contend that the disclosure 

statement was not given by Suren Rai "voluntarily". Bhadrey 

Bishwakarma and Dhiraj Rai have clearly deposed that the 

disclosure statement was not given "voluntarily". 


40 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

58. In re: State of Maharashtra v. Suresh 6 the Supreme Court 

would hold: 

"26. We too countenance three possibilities when an 

accused points out the place where a dead body or an 

incriminating material was concealed without stating that it 

was concealed by himself. One is that he himself would have 

concealed it. Second is that he would have seen somebody 

else concealing it. And the third is that he would have been 

told by another person that it was concealed there. But if the 

accused declines to tell the criminal court that his knowledge 

about the concealment was on account of one of the last two 

possibilities the criminal court can presume that it was 

concealed by the accused himself. This is because the 

accused is the only person who can offer the explanation as to 

how else he came to know of such concealment and if he 

chooses to refrain from telling the court as to how else he 

came to know of it, the presumption is a well-justified course 

to be adopted by the criminal court that the concealment was 

made by himself. Such an interpretation is not inconsistent 

with the principle embodied in Section 27 of the Evidence Act." 

59. Relying upon the Judgment of the Supreme Court 

reported in re: Raja (supra) (paragraph 15 to 
17) and 

emphasizing on the use of the word "obtained" Mr. Karma 

Thinlay, would argue that the disclosure statement does 

not 
necessary 
have 
to 
be 
voluntary. The relevant 

paragraphs of the said judgment are extracted herein below:-

"15. Another circumstance that has been proven is 

about the recovery of knife, bloodstained clothes 

and the ashes of the burnt blanket. The seizure 

witnesses Sukha PW 7 and Nanak PW 9 have 

6 (2000) 1 SCC 471 


41 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

proven the seizure. It is submitted by the learned 

counsel for the appellant that the police had 

recorded the confessional statement of the 

appellant-accused at the police 
custody and 

thereafter, as alleged, had 
recovered certain 

things which really do not render any assistance to 

the prosecution, for the confession recorded before 

the police officer is inadmissible. That apart, the 

accused had advanced the plea that the articles 

and the weapon were planted by the investigating 

agency. 

16. To appreciate the said submission in proper 

perspective, we may profitably reproduce a 

passage from State of U.P. v. Deoman Upadhyaya 6 

:AIR p. 1129, para 7) 

"7.. ... The expression, 'accused of any 

offence' in Section 27, as in Section 25, is 

also descriptive of the person concerned i.e. 

against a person who is accused of an 

offence. 
Section 27 renders provable 

certain statements made by him while he 

was in the custody of a police officer. 

Section 27 is founded on the principle that 

even though the evidence relating to 

confessional or other statements made by a 

person, whilst he is in the custody of a 

police officer, is tainted and therefore 

inadmissible, if the truth of the information 

given by him is assured by the discovery of 

a fact, it may be presumed to be untainted 

and is therefore declared provable insofar 

as it distinctly relates to the fact thereby 

discovered. Even though Section 27 is in 

the form of a proviso to Section 26, the two 

sections do not necessarily deal with the 

evidence of the same character. The ban 

imposed by Section 26 is against the proof 


42 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

of confessional statements. Section 27 is 

concerned with the proof of information 

whether it amounts to a confession or not, 

which leads to discovery of facts. By 

Section 27, even if a fact is deposed to as 

discovered in consequence of information 

received, only that much of the information 

is admissible as distinctly relates to the 

fact discovered." 

"17. In State of Maharashtra v. Damu [State of 

Maharashtra v. Damu, (2000) 6 SCC 269 : 2000 

SCC (Cri) 1088], while dealing with the 

fundamental facet of Section 27 of the Evidence 

Act, the Court observed that the basic idea 

embedded in the said provision is the doctrine of 

confession by subsequent events, which is founded 

on the principle that if any fact is discovered in a 

search made on the strength of any information 

obtained from a prisoner, such a discovery is a 

guarantee that the information supplied by the 

prisoner is true. It further stated that the 

information might be confessional or non-

inculpatory in nature, but if it results in discovery 

of a fact it becomes a reliable information and, 

therefore, 
the 
legislature 
permitted 
such 

information to be used as evidence by restricting 

the admissible portion to the minimum….." 

[Emphasis supplied] 

60. In re: State of Maharashtra v. Damu (supra) after the arrest 

of accused no. 3 therein, he would tell the Investigating Officer 

that the dead body of the deceased was thrown in the canal. 

The said statement was not found admissible as the dead body 

was not recovered. On reconsideration the Supreme Court 


43 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

would find that pursuant to the said statement and the offer 

made by the said accused that he would point out the spot, he 

was taken to the spot and there the Investigating Officer found 

a broken piece of glass lying on the ground which was picked 

up by him. A motorcycle was also recovered from the house of 

accused no. 2 and its tail lamp was found broken and one 

piece missing. The broken piece of glass recovered on the 

ground from the spot pointed out by accused no. 3 was placed 

on the broken situs of the tail lamp of the motorcycle it fitted 

the space and the Investigating Officer had no doubt that the 

said glass piece was originally part of the tail lamp of that 

motorcycle. It is in this context that the Supreme Court would 

hold what was reproduced in re: Raja (supra) in paragraph 17 of 

the said judgment. The Supreme Court was not called upon to 

examine whether a disclosure statement was required to be 

voluntary. 

61. In re: Selvi v. State of Karnataka 7 the Supreme Court 

would hold: 

"133...... However, Section 27 of the Evidence Act 

incorporates the "theory of confirmation by subsequent facts" 

i.e. statements made in custody are admissible to the extent 

that they can be proved by the subsequent discovery of facts. 

It is quite possible that the content of the custodial statements 

could directly lead to the subsequent discovery of relevant 

facts rather than their discovery through independent means. 

Hence such statements could also be described as those 

7 (2010) 7 SCC 263 


44 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

which "furnish a link in the chain of evidence" needed for a 

successful prosecution. This provision reads as follows: 

"27. How much of information received from accused 
may be proved.-Provided that, when any fact is 
deposed to as discovered in consequence of information 
received from a person accused of any offence, in the 
custody of a police officer, so much of such information, 
whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates 
distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be 
proved." 

134. This provision permits the derivative use of 

custodial statements in the ordinary course of events. In 

Indian law, there is no automatic presumption that the 

custodial statements have been extracted through compulsion. 

In short, there is no requirement of additional diligence akin to 

the administration of Miranda [16 L Ed 2d 694 : 384 US 436 

(1965)] warnings. However, in circumstances where it is 

shown that a person was indeed compelled to make 

statements while in custody, relying on such testimony as 

well as its derivative use will offend Article 20(3)." 

[Emphasis supplied] 

62. The word "voluntarily" has not been defined in the Cr. 

P.C. Section 2 (y) Cr.P.C. however, provides: 

"(y). Words an expressions used herein and not defined but 
defined in the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) have the 
meanings respectively assigned to them in that Code." 

63. Section 39 of the IPC provides: 

"39. "Voluntarily".-A person is said to cause an effect 
"voluntarily" when he causes it by means whereby he 
intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of 
employing those means, he knew or had reason to believe to 
be likely to cause it." 

64. The word "involuntary" has been defined in the Black's 

Law Dictionary, 10 th Edition to mean: 


45 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

"Involuntary, adj.(15c) Not resulting from a free and 
unrestrained choice; not subject to control by the will." 

65. The Supreme Court in re: Rammi alias Rameshwar v. State 

of M.P. 8 would hold: 

"11. Regarding the recovery of weapons, the prosecution 

could utilise statements attributed to the accused on the basis 

of which recovery of certain weapons was affected. Section 27 

of the Evidence Act permits so much of information which lead 

to the discovery of a fact to be admitted in evidence. Here the 

fact discovered by the police was that the accused had hidden 

the bloodstained weapons. In that sphere what could have 

been admitted in evidence is only that part of the information 

which the accused had furnished to the police officer and 

which led to the recovery of the weapons. 

12. True, such information is admissible in evidence 

under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, but admissibility alone 

would not render the evidence, pertaining to the above 

information, reliable. While testing the reliability of such 

evidence the court has to see whether it was voluntarily stated 

by the accused." 

[Emphasis supplied] 

66. A Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court, as far 

back as in the year 1961, would clearly hold in re: State of 

Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghat 9 held:-

"(13) ........ It was held by this court that S. 27 of the Evidence 

Act did not offend Art. 14 of the Constitution and was, 

therefore, 'intra vires'. But the question whether it was 

unconstitutional because it contravened the provisions of cl. (3) 

of Art. 20 was not considered in that case. That question may, 

therefore, be treated as an open one. The question has been 

8 (1999) 8 SCC 649 

9 AIR 1961 SC 1808 


46 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

raised in one of the cases before us and has, therefore, to be 

decided. The information given by an accused person to a 

police officer leading to the discovery of a fact which may or 

may not prove incriminatory has been made admissible in 

evidence by that section. If it is not incriminatory of the person 

giving the information, the question does not arise. It can arise 

only when it is of an incriminatory character so far as the giver 

of the information is concerned. If the self incriminatory 

information has been given by an accused person without any 

threat, that will be admissible in evidence and that will not be 

hit by the provisions of cl. (3) of Art. 20 of the Constitution for 

the reason that there has been no compulsion. It must, 

therefore, be held that the provisions of S. 27 of the Evidence 

Act are not within the prohibition aforesaid, unless compulsion 

had been used in obtaining the information." 

[Emphasis supplied] 

67. A Division Bench of this Court also had occasion to 

examine whether a disclosure statement under Section 27 of 

the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 was required to be voluntary 

and in re: Kishore Thapa v. State of Sikkim 10 would hold: 

"14. As can be seen from the above, Section 27 is an 

exception made to Section 25 and 26 in as much as the 

information received from a person accused of an 

offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of 

such information, as relates distinctly to the facts 

thereby discovered may be which proved. In other 

words, subject to the provisions contained in Sections 

24, 25 and 26, information disclosed by a person, 

whether it amounts to confession or not, would be 

relevant only the factum of discovery and nothing more. 

However, the pre-condition for a statement to be 

10 2010 SCC OnLine Sikk 10 


47 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

admissible under Section 27 is that it should have been 

made voluntarily bereft of threat or coercion." 

[Emphasis supplied] 

68. Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 makes 

information received from a person accused of any offence 

even if in the custody of Police Officer and whether it amounts 

to confession or not admissible to the extent it relates 

distinctly to the fact thereby discovered in consequence of 

information received from the said person. 

69. The question raised in the present case is not merely 

whether the recording of a disclosure statement in the custody 

of police officer is inadmissible but whether the recording of a 

disclosure statement in the custody of police officer and 

admittedly made not voluntarily is admissible in evidence. In 

view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in re: State of 

Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghat (supra), Selvi v. State of Karnataka 

(supra), Rammi alias Rameshwar v. State of M.P (supra) and the 

Division Bench of this Court in re: Kishore Thapa v. State of 

Sikkim (supra), it is unequivocally clear that the disclosure 

statement is required to be voluntary in order to be 

admissible. Involuntariness has an element of compulsion 

which has been held prohibited although the mere recording of 

the disclosure statement in the custody of police would not 


48 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

make it inadmissible. The disclosure statement, therefore, is 

required to be kept out of consideration. 

Seizure of Khukuri (vide Exhibit-15). 

70. 
The Learned Sessions Judge would hold: "As per the 

evidence of the witnesses the articles were seized by the police 

from open place, accessible to all." The Learned Sessions 

Judge would further hold: "the evidence of witnesses does not 

connect the accused with seizure articles i.e. M.O.XIV. There are 

contradiction in the evidence of PW-9, Exhibit-14 and Exhibit-

15." M.O.XIV was the "khukuri". Bhadrey Bishwakarma and 

Dhiraj Rai would depose, in cross-examination, that the 

alleged "Khukuri" was lying in an open place and everyone 

could clearly see the place where alleged "khukuri" was lying. 

Surely, it could not be a logical argument that merely because 

the "khukuri", was found in an open space it was not 

admissible in evidence or in all crimes, the criminals would be 

well advised not to hide the weapon of offence and leave it in 

open spaces. The Supreme Court in Anter Singh v. State of 

Rajasthan 11 would hold:-

"10. ............. Though recovery from an open space may 

not always render it vulnerable, it would depend upon the 

factual situation in a given case and the truthfulness or 

otherwise of such claim. ............"

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

71. In re: Yakub Abdul Razak Memon v. State of Maharashtra 12 

the Supreme Court would hold: 

"1706. In State of H.P. v. Jeet Singh [(1999) 4 SCC 370 

: 1999 SCC (Cri) 539] this Court dealt with the issue of 

recovery from the public place and held: (SCC p. 377, para 21) 

"21. The conduct of the accused has some 

relevance in the analysis of the whole circumstances 

against him. PW 3 Santosh Singh, a member of the 

Panchayat hailing from the same ward, said in his 

evidence that he reached Jeet Singh's house at 6.15 

a.m. on hearing the news of that tragedy and then 

accused Jeet Singh told him that Sudarshana 

complained of pain in the liver during the early morning 

hours. But when the accused was questioned by the 

trial court under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal 

Procedure, he denied having said so to PW 3 and 

further said, for the first time, that he and Sudarshana 

did not sleep in the same room but they slept in two 

different rooms. Such a conduct on the part of the 

accused was taken into account by the Sessions Court 

in evaluating the incriminating circumstance spoken to 

by PW 10 that they were in the same room on the 

fateful night. We too give accord to the aforesaid 

approach made by the trial court." 

1707. Similarly, in State of Maharashtra v. Bharat 

Fakira Dhiwar [(2002) 1 SCC 622 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 217] , this 

Court held: (SCC p. 629, para 22) 

"22. In the present case the grinding stone was 

found in tall grass. The pants and underwear were 

buried. They were out of visibility of others in normal 

circumstances. Until they were disinterred, at the 

instance of the respondent, their hidden state had 

remained unhampered. The respondent alone knew 

12 (2013) 13 SCC 1 


50 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

where they were until he disclosed it. Thus we see no 

substance in this submission also." 

1708. In view of the above, it cannot be accepted that a 

recovery made from an open space or a public place which 

was accessible to everyone, should not be taken into 

consideration for any reason. The reasoning behind it, is that, 

it will be the accused alone who will be having knowledge of 

the place, where a thing is hidden. The other persons who had 

access to the place would not be aware of the fact that an 

accused, after the commission of an offence, had concealed 

contraband material beneath the earth, or in the garbage. 

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

1793. The submission made by Mr Mushtaq Ahmad, 

learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the 

recovery was made from a public place and, therefore, could 

not be relied upon and cannot be accepted, as it is the 

accused alone on whose disclosure statement the recovery 

was made and it is he alone, who is aware of the place he 

has hidden the same. It cannot be presumed that the other 

persons having access to the place would be aware that some 

accused after the commission of an offence has concealed the 

contraband material beneath the earth or in the garbage. 

1794. In State of H.P. v. Jeet Singh [(1999) 4 SCC 370 : 

1999 SCC (Cri) 539] , this Court held: (SCC p. 378, para 26) 

"26. There is nothing in Section 27 of the 

Evidence Act which renders the statement of the 

accused inadmissible if recovery of the articles was 

made from any place which is 'open or accessible to 

others'. It is a fallacious notion that when recovery of 

any incriminating article was made from a place which 

is open or accessible to others, it would vitiate the 

evidence under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. Any 

object can be concealed in places which are open or 

accessible to others." 


51 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

72. The said Bhadrey Bishwakarma and Dhiraj Rai were re-

examined. They would prove that the "khukuri" was the same 

"khukuri" seized in their presence vide the Property Seizure 

Memo (exhibit-15). 

73. The recovery of the "khukuri" from near the place of 

occurrence as well as its seizure vide Property Seizure Memo 

(exhibit-15) cannot be doubted. It is important that it is not 

the defence case that the "khukuri" recovered from near the 

place of occurrence was planted by the police. Two questions 

still remain to be answered. Firstly whether the prosecution 

has been able to connect the "khukuri" to the crime? Secondly 

whether the Learned Sessions Judges hesitation to rely upon 

the same due to the fact that the seizure witnesses deposed 

that the Property Seizure Memo (exhibit-15) was prepared after 

they were asked to make the statement, is correct? The fact 

that the "khukuri" was seized near the place of occurrence in 

front of the kitchen of Padam Kumar has been proved. The 

existence of the blood stained "khukuri" cannot also be 

doubted merely because the two seizure witnesses stated that 

the said "khukuri" was recovered after the involuntary 

statement of Suren Rai. The Property Seizure Memo (exhibit 

15) would clearly reflect that the said "khukuri" had blood 

stains on it. Dr. O.T. Lepcha would opine that the cause of 

death, to the best of his knowledge and belief, was due to 


52 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

fracture with resection of the spinal cord as a result of a 

sharp, moderately heavy weapon homicidal in nature. The 

Investigating Officer would state that the "khukuri" seized from 

the place of occurrence has been sent to CFSL, Kolkatta for 

analysis and examination and the said report would be 

received and placed before the Court through supplementary 

charge-sheet. Dr. Anil Kumar Sharma, would depose that the 

said "khukuri" with large reddish brown stain on the metallic 

part with wooden handle contained in a sealed cloth packet 

was received by him. He would depose that a portion of the 

"khukuri" was examined for the presence of human blood by 

Tetramethyl Benzidine and anti-human Haemoglobin test and 

human blood could be detected therein. The aforesaid 

evidences would cogently and clearly prove that the "khukuri" 

with suspected blood stains had been seized from near the 

place of occurrence and the said "khukuri" was found, in fact, 

to be stained with human blood. The CFSL, Report (exhibit-26) 

would also record the examination of "One metallic knife with 

wooden handle stated to be khukuri of length 18 inches 

approx". Unfortunately, the genetic profiles from the blood 

stains on the "khukuri" could not be developed after repeated 

experiments which could be due to minute and/or highly 

degraded DNA material. In re: Raja (supra) the Supreme Court 

would observe:-


53 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

"19. Another circumstance which has been taken note of by 
the High Court is that the bloodstained clothes and the weapon, the 
knife, were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory. The report 
obtained from the laboratory clearly shows that bloodstains were 
found on the clothes and the knife. True it is, there has been no 
matching of the blood group. However, that would not make a 
difference in the facts of the present case. The accused has not 
offered any explanation as to how the human blood was found on 
the clothes and the knife. In this regard, a passage from John 
Pandian v. State [John Pandian v. State, (2010) 14 SCC 129 : (2011) 
3 SCC (Cri) 550] is worth reproducing: (SCC p. 153, para 57) 

"57. … The discovery appears to be credible. It has 
been accepted by both the courts below and we find no reason 
to discard it. This is apart from the fact that this weapon was 
sent to the forensic science laboratory (FSL) and it has been 
found stained with human blood. Though the blood group 
could not be ascertained, as the results were inconclusive, the 
accused had to give some explanation as to how the human 
blood came on this weapon. He gave none. This discovery 
would very positively further the prosecution case." 

In view of the aforesaid, there is no substantial reason not to 
accept the recovery of the weapon used in the crime. It is also apt to 
note here that Dr N.K. Mittal PW 1, has clearly opined that the 
injuries on the person of the deceased could be caused by the knife 
and the said opinion has gone unrebutted." 

74. Padam Kumar Rai would tell the Court that the police 

also recovered the weapon of offence "khukuri" which was 

given by him to Suren Rai and the deceased for cutting logs. 

This fact is vital. The defence would not deny this statement 

but only assert that the said "khukuri" was not shown to him 

in Court. Although the defence would deny the recovery of 

"khukuri" at the instance of Suren Rai it would assert that the 

said "khukuri" was lying at an open place through the cross-

examination of Bhadrey Bishwakarma and Dhiraj Rai. Both 

the aforesaid witnesses would identify the "khukuri" as the one 

seized under Property Seizure Memo (exhibit-15). The Property 


54 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Seizure Memo (exhibit-15) would be prepared at the place of 

occurrence. 

75. In re: Prithipal Singh v. State of Punjab 13 the Supreme 

Court would hold: 

"Burden of proof under Section 106 

53. In State of W.B. v. Mir Mohammad Omar [(2000) 8 SCC 

382 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 1516 : AIR 2000 SC 2988] this Court held that 

if fact is especially in the knowledge of any person, then burden of 

proving that fact is upon him. It is impossible for the prosecution to 

prove certain facts particularly within the knowledge of the accused. 

Section 106 is not intended to relieve the prosecution of its burden to 

prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. But the 

section would apply to cases where the prosecution has succeeded 

in proving facts from which a reasonable inference can be drawn 

regarding the existence of certain other facts, unless the accused by 

virtue of his special knowledge regarding such facts, failed to offer 

any explanation which might drive the court to draw a different 

inference. Section 106 of the Evidence Act is designed to meet 

certain exceptional cases, in which, it would be impossible for the 

prosecution to establish certain facts which are particularly within 

the knowledge of the accused. (See also Shambhu Nath Mehra v. 

State of Ajmer [AIR 1956 SC 404 : 1956 Cri LJ 794] , Sucha Singh v. 

State of Punjab [(2001) 4 SCC 375 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 717 : AIR 2001 

SC 1436] and Sahadevan v. State [(2003) 1 SCC 534 : 2003 SCC 

(Cri) 382 : AIR 2003 SC 215] .)" 

76. Under Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 

when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any 

person, the burden of proving the fact is upon him. The only 

person who could throw light on how the "khukuri" which was 

admittedly given to Suren Rai and the deceased by Padam 

13 (2012) 1 SCC 10 


55 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Kumar Rai was found blood stained with human blood in the 

open space near the place of occurrence, is Suren Rai, since 

the other was hacked to death. No such explanation is 

forthcoming. 

77. The Learned Sessions Judge would hesitate to rely upon 

the seizure of the "khukuri" vide Property Seizure Memo 

(exhibit-15) due to discrepancy in the time in the said memo, 

the disclosure statement and the evidence of Dhiraj Rai who 

stated that the alleged "khukuri" was seized about 10 a.m. The 

disclosure statement would be recorded at Naya Bazar Police 

Station. Disclosure statement would record the date of 

recording the disclosure as 24.05.2013 and the time 1255 hrs. 

The Property Seizure Memo (exhibit-15) would record the place 

of seizure as "in front of the kitchen of Shri Padam Kumar Rai's 

residence" at "Okherbotey, Zoom, West Sikkim", the date of 

seizure as 24.05.2013 and the time as 1325. The disclosure 

statement being recorded at Naya Bazar and the seizure of the 

"khukuri" having taken place at Okherbotey there was bound 

to be difference in the time. Dhiraj Rai in his cross-

examination, however, would state: "Alleged khukuri and other 

material exhibits were seized at about 10 a.m. on the relevant 

day". The evidence of Dhiraj Rai would be recorded on 

19.05.2015. 


56 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

78. In re: State of U.P. v. Santosh Kumar 14 the Supreme Court 

would hold: 

"24. In any criminal case where statements are recorded after 

a considerable lapse of time, some inconsistencies are bound to 

occur. But it is the duty of the court to ensure that the truth prevails. 

If on material particulars, the statements of prosecution witnesses 

are consistent, then they cannot be discarded only because of minor 

inconsistencies." 

79. The Supreme Court in re: Om Prakash v. State of 

Haryana 15 would hold: 

"Every small discrepancy or minor contradictions which may 

erupt in the statements of a witness because of lapse of time, 

keeping in view the educational and other background of the 

witness, cannot be treated as fatal to the case of the prosecution. 

The court must examine the statement in its entirety, correct 

prospective and in light of the attendant circumstances brought on 

record by the prosecution." 

80. We are of the view that the minor discrepancy of the 

exact time of recovery of the "khukuri" is explainable and can 

be overlooked. The time of seizure as provided by Dhiraj Rai 

was an approximate time and not an exact time that too after 

a gap of two years. Thus, although we are hesitant to rely 

upon the disclosure statement because it has been said to be 

involuntary, the recovery of the blood stained "khukuri" from 

the front of the kitchen of Padam Kumar Rai's residence and 

close to the place of occurrence which was within the holding 

14 (2009) 9 SCC 626 

15 (2011) 14 SCC 309 


57 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

of Padam Kumar Rai cannot be doubted. Further, the failure of 

Suren Rai to explain how the "khukuri" given to him and the 

deceased would be found blood stained in an open place close 

to the place of occurrence admittedly occupied by him and the 

deceased till the night before provides a vital link to the chain 

of circumstances. More so when Suren Rai failed to deny the 

fact that the said "khukuri" had been given to him and the 

deceased for cutting logs by Padam Kumar Rai when 

specifically put to him by the Learned Sessions Judge at the 

time of his examination under Section 313 Cr.P.C. 

Evidence of Padam Kumar Rai, Bhadrey Bishwakarma and 
Dhiraj Rai. 

81. The Learned Sessions Judge would hold that: "On deep 

consideration of the evidence of P.W.5, P.W.8 and P.W.9, their 

presence become totally doubtful. If they were present together 

at the P.O. then why P.W.5 did not know about the statement 

made by the accused." The solitary reason on which the 

Learned Sessions Judge would brush aside the evidence of the 

three witnesses was on the above ground. Padam Kumar Rai 

would be the sole witness present in the vicinity where the 

crime was committed and therefore not only a natural witness 

but also a vital witness. Bhadrey Bishwakarma and Dhiraj Rai 

would be witnesses to the purported disclosure statement, 

seizures, as well as the inquest. Padam Kumar Rai in cross-


58 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

examination would state: "It is true that accused person did not 

confess anything before me. It is true that I cannot say what 

statement was given by the accused before the police. It is true 

that Dhiraj Rai and Bhadrey Bishwakarma Panchayat Member 

were accompanying me throughout the investigation process on 

24.05.2013." (Emphasis supplied). It was not the case of the 

prosecution that Suren Rai confessed before Padam Kumar 

Rai. Padam Kumar Rai was not a witness to the disclosure 

statement or any confessional statement. Padam Kumar Rai 

would clearly depose that he cannot say what statement was 

given before the police by Suren Rai. The disclosure statement 

would be purportedly recorded in the presence of Bhadrey 

Bishwakarma and Dhiraj Rai at the Naya Bazar Police Station 

and not at the place of occurrence i.e. Okherbotey, Zoom, West 

Sikkim. Both the witnesses would clearly state that the 

disclosure statement was made by Suren Rai in their 

presence. It is a completely different matter that we hesitate to 

rely upon the disclosure statement because of the fact that 

both the said witnesses would state that it was not voluntary. 

Bhadrey Bishwakarma in cross-examination would state that: 

"one Padam Kr. Rai was with us on the relevant day." Bhadrey 

Bishwakarma would not be asked whether Padam Kr. Rai was 

near him when Suren Rai confessed. Dhiraj Rai would not 

even be asked about the presence of Padam Kumar Rai. In 

such circumstances, it is quite evident the defence was trying 


59 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

to steal a march by the afore-quoted general statement of 

Padam Kumar Rai obviously made on the suggestion of the 

defence. On examination of the depositions of the said three 

witnesses in its entirety, correct prospective and in light of the 

attendant circumstances brought on record by the prosecution 

we are of the view that the same are consistent and brooks no 

hesitation to receive them in evidence. 

Last seen theory 

82. In re: Mohibur Rehman v. State of Assam 16 the Supreme 

Court would hold that there must be a close proximity 

between the events of accused last seen together with 

deceased and the factum of death. This was a case in which 

the dead body was recovered 14 days after the date on which 

the deceased was last seen in the company of the accused. 

83. In re: Sahadevan v. State 17 the Supreme Court would hold: 

"19. The last circumstance relied on by the courts 

below pertains to the stand taken by the appellants in the trial 

as to parting company with Vadivelu. Here we must notice 

that as discussed hereinabove, the prosecution has 

established the fact that Vadivelu was seen in the company of 

the appellants from the morning of 5-3-1985 till at least 5 p.m. 

on the same day, when he was brought to his house and 

thereafter his dead body was found in the morning of 6-3-

1985. Therefore, it has become obligatory on the appellants to 

satisfy the court as to how, where and in what manner 

16 (2002) 6 SCC 715 

17 (2003) 1 SCC 534 


60 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Vadivelu parted company with them. This is on the principle 

that a person who is last found in the company of another, if 

later found missing, then the person with whom he was last 

found has to explain the circumstances in which they parted 

company. In the instant case the appellants have failed to 

discharge this onus. In their statement under Section 313 

CrPC they have not taken any specific stand whatsoever. In 

the evidence of PW 25, it is elicited that on 5-3-1985 in the 

afternoon when Vadivelu was produced before the said 

witness, he after interrogation allowed Vadivelu to go, but 

then it is found from his evidence that he instructed A-1 to 

keep a watch over Vadivelu. In such circumstances, it was 

incumbent upon A-1 to have explained to the court in what 

circumstances they parted company. He has not given any 

explanation in this regard. On the contrary, the prosecution 

has established the fact that on the very day at about 5 p.m., 

Vadivelu was brought to the house of PW 1 by the appellants 

which was seen by PW 5. This part of the evidence of PW 5 

has gone unchallenged in the cross-examination and, 

therefore, we will have to proceed on the basis that, what is 

stated by PW 5 in this regard is true. If that be so, the 

prosecution has established the fact that on 5-3-1985 at 5 

p.m. Vadivelu was still in the company of these appellants 

and, therefore, in the absence of any specific explanation from 

the appellants in this regard, and in view of the other 

incriminating circumstances against the appellants having 

been proved by the prosecution, an adverse inference will 

have to be drawn against these appellants as to their part in 

the missing of Vadivelu. At this point, it may be relevant to 

note that though no specific stand has been taken by the 

appellants as to their parting company with Vadivelu, in their 

statement under Section 313 CrPC, it is seen from the 

evidence of PWs 1 and 5 that A-1 told the said witnesses on 

the night intervening between 5-3-1985 and 6-3-1985 that 

Vadivelu had escaped from the police station when he was 

allowed to sleep in the verandah of the police station. This 

explanation given by A-1 to PW 1 which was also heard by 

PWs 5 and 14, clearly shows that the same is totally false 


61 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

and obviously was an excuse made by the appellants to 

conceal the true facts and, therefore, this circumstance of A-1 

making a false statement to PW 1 can also be taken as a 

circumstance against the appellants, in establishing the 

appellants' guilt. This Court in more than one case has held, 

that if the prosecution, based on reliable evidence, establishes 

that the missing person was last seen in the company of the 

accused and was never seen thereafter, it is obligatory on the 

accused to explain the circumstances in which the missing 

person and the accused parted company. (See Joseph v. State 

of Kerala [(2000) 5 SCC 197 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 926] .) Therefore, 

we are in agreement with the finding of the courts below that 

Circumstance 7 also stands established against the 

appellants." 

[Emphasis supplied] 

84. The Supreme Court in re: Shyamal Ghosh v. State of W.B. 18 

would hold: 

"73. Application of the "last seen theory" requires a 

possible link between the time when the person was last seen 

alive and the fact of the death of the deceased coming to light. 

There should be a reasonable proximity of time between these 

two events. This proposition of law does not admit of much 

excuse but what has to be seen is that this principle is to be 

applied depending upon the facts and circumstances of a 

given case. This Court in para 21 of Yusuf case [(2011) 11 

SCC 754 : (2011) 3 SCC (Cri) 620] while referring to Mohd. 

Azad v. State of W.B. [(2008) 15 SCC 449 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 

1082] and State v. Mahender Singh Dahiya [(2011) 3 SCC 109 

: (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 821] , held as under: (Yusuf case [(2011) 

11 SCC 754 : (2011) 3 SCC (Cri) 620] , SCC pp. 760-61) 

"21. The last seen theory comes into play where 

the time gap between the point of time when the 

18 (2012) 7 SCC 646 


62 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

accused and the deceased were last seen alive and 

when the deceased is found dead is so small that 

possibility of any person other than the accused being 

the author of the crime becomes impossible. (Vide Mohd. 

Azad v. State of W.B. [(2008) 15 SCC 449 : (2009) 3 

SCC (Cri) 1082] and State v. Mahender Singh Dahiya 

[(2011) 3 SCC 109 : (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 821] .)" 

74. The reasonableness of the time gap is, therefore, of 

some significance. If the time gap is very large, then it is not 

only difficult but may even not be proper for the court to infer 

that the accused had been last seen alive with the deceased 

and the former, thus, was responsible for commission of the 

offence. The purpose of applying these principles, while 

keeping the time factor in mind, is to enable the court to 

examine that where the time of last seen together and the time 

when the deceased was found dead is short, it inevitably 

leads to the inference that the accused person was 

responsible for commission of the crime and the onus was on 

him to explain how the death occurred." 

[Emphasis supplied] 

85. In re: Dharam Deo Yadav v. State of U.P. 19 the Supreme 

Court would hold: 

"19. It is trite law that a conviction cannot be recorded 

against the accused merely on the ground that the accused 

was last seen with the deceased. In other words, a conviction 

cannot be based on the only circumstance of last seen 

together. The conduct of the accused and the fact of last seen 

together plus other circumstances have to be looked into. 

Normally, last seen theory comes into play when the time gap, 

between the point of time when the accused and the deceased 

were seen last alive and when the deceased is found dead, is 

so small that the possibility of any person other than the 

accused being the perpetrator of the crime becomes 

19 (2014) 5 SCC 509 


63 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

impossible. It will be difficult in some cases to positively 

establish that the deceased was last seen with the accused 

when there is a long gap and possibility of other persons 

coming in between exists. However, if the prosecution, on the 

basis of reliable evidence, establishes that the missing person 

was seen in the company of the accused and was never seen 

thereafter, it is obligatory on the part of the accused to explain 

the circumstances in which the missing person and the 

accused parted company. Reference may be made to the 

judgment of this Court in Sahadevan v. State [(2003) 1 SCC 

534 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 382] . In such a situation, the proximity 

of time between the event of last seen together and the 

recovery of the dead body or the skeleton, as the case may be, 

may not be of much consequence. PWs 1, 2, 3, 5, 9 and 10 

have all deposed that the accused was last seen with Diana. 

But, as already indicated, to record a conviction, that itself 

would not be sufficient and the prosecution has to complete 

the chain of circumstances to bring home the guilt of the 

accused." 

[Emphasis supplied] 

86. In the present case the evidence of Padam Kumar Rai 

would clearly prove that Suren Rai was last seen with the 

deceased in the temporary shed a little latter after 8.00 p.m. 

on 23.05.2013. The dead body of the deceased was then 

discovered by Padam Kumar Rai the very next day on 

24.05.2013 at 6.00 a.m. barely ten hours later in the 

temporary shed in which, admittedly, both the deceased and 

Suren Rai were last residing together. In fact it is even the 

defence case that Suren Rai was with the deceased till 8.30 

p.m. on 23.05.2013. Suren Rai would admit in his statement 

under Section 313 Cr.P.C. that he was with the deceased at 


64 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

the place of occurrence till 8.30 pm on 23.05.2013. Padam 

Kumar Rai would clearly depose that after Suren Rai left his 

house he went off to sleep as it was raining. This is an 

important fact. The defence would not even attempt to deny 

this fact. The defence would not be able to tarnish Padam 

Kumar Rai's deposition. In fact through Padam Kumar Rai's 

cross-examination the defence would assert that Suren Rai 

had appeared before Padam Kumar Rai at around 8.30 p.m. 

The only person who was present in the vicinity of the place of 

occurrence was Padam Kumar Rai. However, from the 

evidence adduced it is certain that Padam Kumar Rai was 

asleep when the crime was perpetrated. The defence would not 

even try to point a needle of suspicion towards Padam Kumar 

Rai and suggest instead, in his cross-examination, that there 

was "some other person" in the temporary shed of Suren Rai 

and the deceased. The only person who could have named the 

said "some other person" is Suren Rai as the other is dead. It is 

quite obvious that this is a false defence. The fact that when 

Suren Rai left the house of Padam Kumar Rai it would be 

raining and Padam Kumar Rai would go to sleep was 

specifically put to Suren Rai by the Learned Sessions Judge 

and in reply thereof Suren Rai in his statement under Section 

313 Cr.P.C. would admit it to be true. It is evident that there is 

proximity of both time and place in the present case. The time 

gap between the point of time when Suren Rai and the 


65 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

deceased was seen together and deceased alive then and when 

the deceased was found dead within a period of just about 10 

hours, all of it in the middle of the rainy night at a remote 

village-Okherbotey, Zoom, West Sikkim, is so small that the 

possibility of any other person other than Suren Rai being the 

perpetrator of the crime would become impossible. It is also 

admitted that immediately prior to the death of the deceased 

there was a quarrel between the deceased and Suren Rai. 

87. It is trite that the circumstance of last seen together 

cannot by itself form the basis of holding the accused guilty of 

the offence. 
However, where the other links would be 

satisfactorily made out and the circumstances would point to 

the guilt of the accused, the circumstance of last seen together 

and absence of explanation would provide an additional link 

which would complete the chain. 

88. 
The Learned Sessions Judge would rely upon the 

statement of Padam Kumar Rai in cross-examination to hold 

that his statement does not lend full support to the 

prosecution case. The said statement is:-

"………It is true that when the accused appeared before me at 
around 8.30 pm at my house and thereafter, I cannot say whether 
he left towards his temporary shed or somewhere else." 

89. 
The evidence of Padam Kumar Rai would establish that 

on the fateful night of 23.05.2013 Suren Rai and the deceased 


66 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

were together after 08.00 pm at the temporary shed in which 

both Suren Rai and the deceased, admittedly, were residing till 

the fateful day. Padam Kumar Rai would also state that after 

he met the deceased and Suren Rai in the temporary shed, he 

returned home and "Suren Rai came following me". In cross-

examination, Padam Kumar Rai would thus concede that he 

could not say whether Suren Rai went towards his temporary 

shed or somewhere else. It would be because of this statement 

of Padam Kumar Rai that the Learned Sessions Judge would 

find it unsafe to rely on the last seen theory. What Padam 

Kumar Rai said was absolutely truthful; how could he have 

known where Suren Rai went after they parted? The Learned 

Sessions Judge was required to examine what happened after 

they parted instead of dismissing the last seen theory, which 

in fact, was even admitted by Suren Rai in his statement 

under Section 313 Cr.P.C. Being last seen with the deceased, 

Suren Rai had sought to explain under what circumstances he 

had parted ways with the deceased who had been residing 

with him till that fateful night in his statement under Section 

313 Cr.P.C. The relevant questions and answers are 

reproduced herein:-

"Q.No.14. It is in the evidence of PW-5 Shri Padam Kr. Rai that he 
knows you. He is a resident of Zoom. At the relevant time, you were 
hired by him to work as a lumberjack at his house. Along with you, 
deceased Monit Rai also worked with you. About 100 meters away 
from his house, you and the deceased had build a temporary shed 


67 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

with plastic and GIS sheets and the same could be seen from the 
Veranda of his house. 

What have you to say? 

Ans. It is true. 

Q.No.15. PW-5 deposed that on 23.05.2013, around 8 pm, you came 
to his house and requested him to pacify the deceased Monit Rai as 
he was provoking you into a fight regarding his mobile phone. He 
told you that he will be coming later and after some time, he went 
to your temporary shed and saw that you were having your meal 
and deceased Monit Rai was sitting inside the temporary shed. He 
asked both of you about the matter and he was told that deceased 
Monit Rai had misplaced his mobile phone and was blaming for it. 

What have you to say? 

Ans. It is true. 

Q.No.16. PW-5 deposed that he told both of you, not to fight over 
such things and look for the mobile phone as it could be misplaced 
somewhere and could be found later. Accordingly, he went to his 
house and you came following him and he again asked you whether 
you found the mobile phone. Thereafter, you left his house and it 
started raining heavily he went to sleep. 

What have you to say? 

Ans. It is true. 

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

Q.No.58. Do you have any statements to make in your defense? 

Ans:-I am innocent and I did not commit any offence. I humbly 
submitted that on the relevant night when I requested the 
complainant twice for settlement of dispute between me and the 
deceased (Monit Rai) but the complainant did not take positive steps 
and I was continuously harassed and threatened by the deceased 
Monit Rai to kill and due to the fear I left for Karmatand around 8.30 
pm on 23.05.2013 and as such, I have no knowledge about the 
murder of the deceased Monit Rai." 

90. Section 313 Cr.P.C is an important section of the Code of 

Criminal Procedure. Section 313 Cr.P.C requires the Court to 

put questions to the accused for the purpose of enabling the 

accused "personally" to explain any circumstances appearing 


68 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

in the evidence against him. The section enables a direct 

interaction between the Court and the accused for the sole 

purpose of allowing the accused to provide his explanation to 

each and every incriminating circumstance appearing in the 

evidence. The statement is not to be taken on oath which is 

prohibited under sub-section (3) thereof. The accused shall not 

render himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer 

such questions, or by giving false answers to them. The 

answers, however, given by the accused may be taken into 

consideration in such enquiry or trial, and put in evidence for 

or against him in any other enquiry into, or trial for, any other 

offence which such answers may tend to show that he had 

committed. Under Section 313 Cr.P.C the accused has a duty 

to furnish explanation in his statement regarding any 

incriminating material that has been produced against him. It 

is not sufficient compliance with the section to generally ask 

the accused what he has to say after having heard the 

prosecution evidence. Every material circumstance must be 

questioned separately. Providing fair, proper and sufficient 

opportunity to the accused to explain the circumstances 

appearing against him should be the whole object of the Court 

in compliance with Section 313 Cr.P.C. The Court must be 

particularly sensitive when the accused is ignorant or illiterate 

and may not understand the language of Court. The questions 

must be simple and understandable even to an illiterate and 


69 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

ignorant of the law. Preferably the Court should avoid using 

legal language and keep the questions simple especially while 

dealing with people who are uneducated, illiterate, ignorant or 

simple. The question should be short and each new 

incriminating fact must be separately put to the accused. If 

the accused is unable to understand the language of the 

Court, the Court must translate the question in the language 

understood by the accused. It is obligatory on the accused 

while being examined to furnish explanation with respect to 

incriminating circumstances against him and the Court is 

duty bound to note such explanation even in a case of 

circumstantial evidence. Section 313 Cr.P.C. was enacted for 

the benefit of the accused. 

91. It is trite that in a case like the present one where the 

various links as stated above have been satisfactorily made 

out and the circumstances point to the appellant as the 

probable assailant, with reasonable definiteness and in 

proximity to the deceased as regards time and situation, his 

failure to offer any explanation, which if accepted, though not 

proved, would afford a reasonable basis for a conclusion on 

the entire case consistent with his innocence, such absence of 

explanation or false explanation would itself be an additional 

link which completes the chain. 


70 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

92. The failure of the accused to offer any explanation in his 

Section 313 Cr.P.C. statement alone would not be sufficient to 

establish the charge against the accused. The Court can, 

however, rely on a portion of the statement of the accused and 

find him guilty in consideration of other evidence against him. 

The accused has a right to maintain silence during 

examination 
or 
completely 
deny 
the 
incriminating 

circumstance but in such an event adverse inference could be 

drawn against him. 

93. Suren Rai has accepted as true substantially all the 

deposition of Padam Kumar Rai till Suren Rai left the house of 

Padam Kumar Rai on the fateful night. In fact in his 

explanation to what transpired after Suren Rai left the house 

of Padam Kumar Rai, Suren Rai would state that since Padam 

Kumar Rai did not take positive steps to settle the dispute 

between him and the deceased and as he was continuously 

harassed and threatened by the deceased to kill, due to fear, 

he left for Karmatar around 08.30 pm on 23.05.2013. Suren 

Rai's explanation, however, does not inspire confidence. 

Admittedly, Suren Rai was there at the scene of crime till 

08.30 pm on 23.05.2013. Suren Rai also admits his arrest the 

very next day. Suren Rai's arrest at Karmatar is cogently 

proved by the evidence of two Police Officers, Constable 

Topden Lepcha and Home guard Yamnath Sharma on 


71 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

24.05.2015 as well as the arrest Memo (exhibit-24) proved by 

the Investigating Officer. At the time of the arrest on 

24.05.2013 at 1245 hours it would be proved that three 

wearing apparels had been seized from Suren Rai in the 

presence of Dhiraj Rai and Bhadrey Biswakarma when he was 

brought from Karmatar to Naya Bazar Police Station. 

94. 
The aforesaid three items were seized vide Property 

Seizure Memo (exhibit-19) duly signed by the Investigating 

Officer as well as the aforesaid two witnesses. The defence, 

quite clearly, would not be able to demolish the aforesaid 

seizure. The Investigating Officer, Dhiraj Rai and Bhadrey 

Biswakarma would cogently prove it. 

95. Suren Rai, however, would provide no explanation to this 

circumstance appearing against him, although, he would be 

the only person who would have been able to explain the same 

when the question is put to him. Suren Rai would simply deny 

it by saying: "it is not true" when the specific circumstance is 

put to him by the Learned Sessions Judge under Section 313 

Cr.P.C. The said three wearing apparels seized vide property 

seizure memo (exhibit-19) were sent for forensic examination 

to CFSL, Kolkata for its examination. The Investigating Officer 

also collected blood sample of Suren Rai vide requisition letter 

(exhibit-11). The result of the forensic examination would be 

placed before the Court through Dr. Anil Kumar Sharma who 


72 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

would prove the Forensic Examination Report dated 

29.06.2015 (exhibit-25). 

96. 
The Forensic Examination Report (exhibit-26) would 

opine about the said three wearing apparels seized from the 

possession of Suren Rai at the Naya Bazar Police Station vide 

Property Seizure Memo (exhibit-19). The result of the 

examination would reflect that the soil particles found in the 

blue faded jeans of Suren Rai seized after his arrest were 

found to be similar to the sample soil particles collected from 

the place of occurrence seized vide (exhibit-18). The Forensic 

Examination Report dated 29.06.2015 (exhibit-25) would 

opine that human blood could be detected in the said wearing 

apparels seized from Suren Rai. It would also be opined that 

the blood stains in the black T-shirt and the blue jeans pant 

were of Suren Rai. Suren Rai would be examined by Dr. S. N. 

Adhikari at PHC Jorethang, South Sikkim on 24.05.2013 at 

12.40 p.m. His examination would reveal that Suren Rai had 

no injuries. The Learned Sessions Judge would observe that: 

"If there was such fight between the accused and the deceased 

one day prior to the incident, the accused would have sustained 

some injury". It is not necessary that in every fight there must 

be injury sustained by both the parties. However, what is vital 

is that it would be proved that at the time of his arrest Suren 

Rai was in possession of his blood stained wearing apparels 


73 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

which would also be seized. It was incumbent upon Suren Rai 

to explain how he was in possession of his blood stained 

wearing apparels on 24.05.2013, the day of his arrest, when 

he clearly denied any physical brawl between him and the 

deceased in the intervening night of 23.05.2013 and 

24.05.2013 when admittedly they had quarrelled over a mobile 

phone. In re: Gajanan Dashrath Kharate v. State of 

Maharashtra 20 the Supreme Court would hold: 

"13. As seen from the evidence, appellant Gajanan and 

his father Dashrath and mother Mankarnabai were living 

together. On 7-4-2002, mother of the appellant-accused had 

gone to another Village Dahigaon. The prosecution has proved 

presence of the appellant at his home on the night of 7-4-

2002. Therefore, the appellant is duty-bound to explain as to 

how the death of his father was caused. When an offence like 

murder is committed in secrecy inside a house, the initial 

burden to establish the case would undoubtedly be upon the 

prosecution. In view of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, there 

will be a corresponding burden on the inmates of the house to 

give cogent explanation as to how the crime was committed. 

The inmates of the house cannot get away by simply keeping 

quiet and offering no explanation on the supposed premise 

that the burden to establish its case lies entirely upon the 

prosecution and there is no duty at all on the accused to offer. 

On the date of the occurrence, when the accused and his 

father Dashrath were in the house and when the father of the 

accused was found dead, it was for the accused to offer an 

explanation as to how his father sustained injuries. When the 

accused could not offer any explanation as to the homicidal 

death of his father, it is a strong circumstance against the 

accused that he is responsible for the commission of the crime.

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

14. In Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v. State of Maharashtra 

[Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v. State of Maharashtra, (2006) 10 

SCC 681 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 80] , it was held as under: (SCC 

pp. 694-95, para 22) 

"22. Where an accused is alleged to have 

committed the murder of his wife and the prosecution 

succeeds in leading evidence to show that shortly 

before the commission of crime they were seen together 

or the offence takes place in the dwelling home where 

the husband also normally resided, it has been 

consistently held that if the accused does not offer any 

explanation how the wife received injuries or offers an 

explanation which is found to be false, it is a strong 

circumstance which indicates that he is responsible for 

commission of the crime. In Nika Ram v. State of H.P. 

[Nika Ram v. State of H.P., (1972) 2 SCC 80 : 1972 SCC 

(Cri) 635] it was observed that the fact that the accused 

alone was with his wife in the house when she was 

murdered there with "khukhri" and the fact that the 

relations of the accused with her were strained would, 

in the absence of any cogent explanation by him, point 

to his guilt. In Ganeshlal v. State of Maharashtra 

[Ganeshlal v. State of Maharashtra, (1992) 3 SCC 106 : 

1993 SCC (Cri) 435] the appellant was prosecuted for 

the murder of his wife which took place inside his 

house. It was observed that when the death had 

occurred in his custody, the appellant is under an 

obligation to give a plausible explanation for the cause 

of her death in his statement under Section 313 CrPC. 

The mere denial of the prosecution case coupled with 

absence of any explanation was held to be inconsistent 

with the innocence of the accused, but consistent with 

the hypothesis that the appellant is a prime accused in 

the commission of murder of his wife. In State of U.P. v. 

Ravindra Prakash Mittal [State of U.P. v. Ravindra 

Prakash Mittal, (1992) 3 SCC 300 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 642] 

the medical evidence disclosed that the wife died of 


75 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

strangulation during late night hours or early morning 

and her body was set on fire after sprinkling kerosene. 

The defence of the husband was that the wife had 

committed suicide by burning herself and that he was 

not at home at that time. The letters written by the wife 

to her relatives showed that the husband ill-treated her 

and their relations were strained and further the 

evidence showed that both of them were in one room in 

the night. It was held that the chain of circumstances 

was complete and it was the husband who committed 

the murder of his wife by strangulation and accordingly 

this Court reversed the judgment of the High Court 

acquitting the accused and convicted him under Section 

302 IPC. In State of T.N. v. Rajendran [State of T.N. v. 

Rajendran, (1999) 8 SCC 679 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 40] the 

wife was found dead in a hut which had caught fire. 

The evidence showed that the accused and his wife 

were seen together in the hut at about 9.00 p.m. and 

the accused came out in the morning through the roof 

when the hut had caught fire. His explanation was that 

it was a case of accidental fire which resulted in the 

death of his wife and a daughter. The medical evidence 

showed that the wife died due to asphyxia as a result 

of strangulation and not on account of burn injuries. It 

was held that there cannot be any hesitation to come to 

the conclusion that it was the accused (husband) who 

was the perpetrator of the crime." 

Same view was reiterated by this Court in State of Rajasthan 

v. Parthu [State of Rajasthan v. Parthu, (2007) 12 SCC 754: 

(2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 507]." 

97. Under Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 

Suren Rai was required to discharge the burden of proving the 

said fact especially within his knowledge. Suren Rai has 

offered no such explanations. The presence of blood stains in 


76 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Suren Rai's wearing apparels seized at the time of his arrest 

shortly after the crime is surely a circumstance against him 

which remained unexplained. The cumulative effect of the 

admitted fact of the quarrel between Suren Rai and the 

deceased, the fact that Suren Rai failed to explain the 

incriminating circumstance of human blood in his wearing 

apparels seized at the time of his arrest on 24.05.2013 itself, 

the fact that Suren Rai made a false defence of an unknown: 

"some other person", the impossibility of: "some other person" 

or even Padam Kumar Rai being even a suspect along with the 

fact that Suren Rai was admittedly last seen with the deceased 

at 8.30 p.m. in the temporary shed i.e. the place of occurrence 

on 23.05.2013 and in spite of all these Suren Rai would offer 

no reasonable explanation would itself be the additional vital 

link in the chain of circumstances against Suren Rai all of 

which, as stated above, had been cogently established. 

98. The evidence produced by the prosecution and tested by 

a detailed and intrusive cross-examination by the defence has 

cogently established the following circumstances against 

Suren Rai:-

(i) Suren Rai and the deceased had been hired by Padam 

Kumar Rai to work as "lumberjacks" at his premises at 

Zoom. 

(ii) 
Suren Rai and the deceased had built a temporary shed with 

plastic and GIS sheets close to Padam Kumar Rai's house. 


77 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

(iii) 
On 23.05.2013 around 8 p.m. Suren Rai went to Padam 

Kumar Rai's house and requested him to pacify the deceased 

as he was provoking him into a fight regarding his mobile 

phone. This circumstance provides the animus nocendi or 

the intention to harm for Suren Rai to commit the offence. 

(iv) 
Padam Kumar Rai visited the temporary shed after sometime 

and found Suren Rai and the deceased together inside the 

temporary shed. The deceased was alive then. 

(v) 
A little while later, Suren Rai came to the house of Padam 

Kumar Rai who asked him about the mobile. It was raining 

heavily that night. Suren Rai left Padam Kumar Rai's house 

after which Padam Kumar Rai went off to sleep. This was the 

time when Suren Rai was last seen. 

(vi) 
Next morning at 6 a.m. when Padam Kumar Rai discovered 

the dead body of the deceased and the GIS sheet used to 

make the temporary shed splattered with blood, Suren Rai 

was not there without informing his hirer, Padam Kumar Rai. 

(vii) The FIR was lodged by Padam Kumar Rai on 24.05.2013 at 

8.45 a.m. to 9 a.m. 

(viii) Suren Rai was arrested from Karmatar School ground, 

Darjeeling and brought to the Naya Bazar Police Station on 

24.05.2013 and formally arrested at the Naya Bazar Police 

Station at 1250 hrs. 

(ix) 
At the time of his arrest three wearing apparels of Suren Rai, 

all of them blood stained, were seized by the Investigating 

Officer. The blood stains on the said wearing apparel were 

found to be that of Suren Rai on forensic examination. Save 

a bald denial, Suren Rai failed to provide a convincing 

explanation to his blood in his wearing apparels including 

his underwear. If there was no physical brawl Suren Rai had 

got into there was no reason for the blood to be found. 

(x) 
The soil particles found in the blue jean pant seized from 

Suren Rai after his arrest matched the soil particles from the 

place of occurrence. 


78 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

(xi) 
After the arrest of Suren Rai a blood stained "khukuri" which 

was give to Suren Rai and the deceased was recovered from 

outside the kitchen of Padam Kumar Rai close to the 

temporary shed where the deceased suffered:-(1) multiple 

gaping chop wounds over the back of the neck situated 

below the skull involving the neck and the back; (2) chop 

wound 12 x 2 cm x bone situated over the posterior aspect of 

neck, 1.8 cms behind the right ear involving the scalp, bone 

and direct downward and outward; (3) chop wound 11 x 2 

cms, 1.8 cms below the first injury directed downwards 

involving skin muscle and second and third cervical 

vertebrae; (4) chop wound, 21 x 2.8 cms situated at 2.5 cms 

below injury No. 2 and extended up to the lower angle of 

mandible. The wound involved the skin, muscle, vessels and 

the spinal cord, which clean cut with fracture of second 

cervical vertebrae; (5) Spindal shaped injury 15 x 4.5 cms x 

bone covering the right shoulder with underline fracture of 

shoulder joint and; (6) Spindal shaped injury 2 x 1.5 cms 

involving skin, muscle and bone over the right upper back 

situated 4.5 cms below and middle to injury No.5. The 

medical opinion opined that the cause of death was due to 

fracture and resection of the spinal cord as a result of a 

sharp, moderately heavy weapon homicidal in nature. 

(xii) The failure of Suren Rai to convincingly explain the 

circumstances appearing in evidence against him including 

the fact that admittedly he was last seen with the deceased 

at around 8:30 p.m. on 23.05.2013 barely 10 hours before 

the dead body of the deceased was discovered and the blood 

being noticed and proved on his wearing apparels seized at 

the time of the arrest after 6 hours 45 minutes of the 

discovery of the dead body of the deceased brutally hacked to 

death. 

99. This is a case of circumstantial evidence as said before. 

We have re-examined the entire case and marshalled the 

evidence and documents on record. We are constrained to hold 


79 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

that the Learned Sessions Judges conclusion and the 

consequential judgment of acquittal is not at all a possible or 

plausible view. Each of the other circumstances, as held 

above, having been conclusively proved by the prosecution, we 

are of the view that the only gap in the chain of circumstances 

has been conclusively filled by the aforesaid evidence and 

circumstances. The factum of Suren Rai being last seen 

together with the deceased, the blood on his wearing apparels, 

soil particles in his blue jeans pant matching the soil at the 

place of occurrence, the recovery of human blood stained 

"khukuri", definitely a sharp, moderately heavy weapon (which 

has been cogently proved to have caused the death of the 

deceased) given by Padam Kumar Rai to Suren Rai and the 

deceased for cutting wood on 24.05.2013 from near the place 

of occurrence itself are strong circumstances against Suren 

Rai directly connecting him to the crime. Suren Rai's failure to 

convincingly explain the incriminating circumstances as above 

including the factum of his being last seen together, together 

with the fact that there was a short gap would eventually lead 

to the inference that Suren Rai was responsible for the crime 

against the deceased and it was incumbent upon Suren Rai to 

explain how the death occurred. His failure to do so fortifies 

our conclusion of guilt of Suren Rai. There is no one else in the 

same circumstance with even a remote possibility of the same 

motive. All the proved facts are consistent only with the 


80 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

hypothesis of the guilt of Suren Rai and no other. The 

circumstances are of conclusive nature and exclude every 

possible hypothesis except that it is Suren Rai and Suren Rai 

alone who is guilty of the crime. The chain of evidence is 

complete. We, thus, hold that the view adopted by the Learned 

Sessions Judge is not a reasonable one in the conclusion 

reached by it and does not have its ground well set out on the 

materials on record. The judgment passed by the Learned 

Sessions Judge acquitting Suren Rai is not only unreasonable 

but palpably wrong, manifestly erroneous and demonstrably 

unsustainable. 

100. The confessional statement of Suren Rai would disclose 

that Suren Rai and the deceased would consume alcohol in 

their temporary shed at around 2100 hours. They would get a 

little intoxicated. The deceased would go out for a while and 

return after having consumed more alcohol and start 

provoking Suren Rai into a fight. The deceased would then 

hurl a "khukuri" at him. Suren Rai would believe that this 

assault was to kill him. Suren Rai would dodge himself, take 

the "khukuri" from the deceased and use it to give three fatal 

blows on the neck of the deceased. Suren Rai would stay in 

the temporary shed for half an hour more till which time the 

decease would be still alive and thereafter he would run off 

towards Naya Bazar.

101. Section 96 IPC, 1860 provides:-

"96. Things done in private defence. -Nothing is an 

offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private 

defence.'' 

102. Section 97 IPC, 1860 provides:-

"97. Right of private defence of the body and of 

property.-Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions 

contained in section 99, to defend-

First.-His own body, and the body of any other person, 

against any offence affecting the human body; 

Secondly.-The property, whether movable or immovable, of 

himself or of any other person, against any act which is an 

offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or 

criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, 

robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.'' 

103. Section 99 IPC, 1860 provides:-

"99. Acts against which there is no right of private 

defence.-There is no right of private defence against an act 

which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or 

of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by a public 

servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though 

that act, may not be strictly justifiable by law. 

There is no right of private defence against an act which 

does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of 

grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction 

of a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his 

office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by 

law. 


82 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

There is not right of private defence in cases in which 

there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public 

authorities. 

Extent to which the right may be exercised.-The right of 

private defence in no case extends to the inflicting of more 

harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. 

Explanation 1.-A person is not deprived of the right of 

private defence against an act done, or attempted to be done, 

by a public servant, so such, unless he knows or has reason 

to believe, that the person doing the act is such public servant. 

Explanation 2.-A person is not deprived of the right or 
private defence against an act done, or attempted to be done, 
by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has 
reason to believe, that the person doing the act is acting by 
such direction, or unless such person states the authority 
under which he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless 
he produces such authority, if demanded.'' 

104. Section 100 IPC, 1860 provides:-

"100. When the right of private defence of the body 

extends to causing death.-The right of private defence of the 

body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last 

preceding section, to the voluntary causing of death or of any 

other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the 

exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter 

enumerated, namely:--

First.--Such an assault as may reasonably cause the 

apprehension that death will otherwise be the consequence of 

such assault; 

Secondly.--Such an assault as may reasonably cause the 

apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the 

consequence of such assault; 

Thirdly.--An assault with the intention of committing rape; 

Fourthly.--An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural 

lust; 


83 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Fifthly.--An assault with the intention of kidnapping or 

abducting; 

Sixthly.--An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a 

person, under circumstances which may reasonably cause him 

to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the 

public authorities for his release. 

[Seventhly.--An act of throwing or administering acid or an 

attempt to throw or administer acid which may reasonably 

cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the 

consequence of such act.]'' 

105. Section 102 IPC, 1860 provides:-

"102. Commencement and continuance of the right of 

private defence of the body.-The right of private defence of 

the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of 

danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit 

the offence though the offence may not have been committed; 

and it continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the 

body continues.'' 

106. In re: Laxman Singh v. Poonam Singh 21 the Supreme Court 

would hold:-

"6. The only question which needs to be considered is the 

alleged exercise of the right of private defence. Section 96 IPC 

provides that nothing is an offence which is done in the 

exercise of the right of private defence. The section does not 

define the expression "right of private defence". It merely 

indicates that nothing is an offence which is done in the 

exercise of such right. Whether in a particular set of 

circumstances, a person acted in the exercise of the right of 

private defence is a question of fact to be determined on the 

21 

(2004) 10 SCC 94 


84 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

facts and circumstances of each case. No test in the abstract 

for determining such a question can be laid down. In 

determining this question of fact, the court must consider all 

the surrounding circumstances. It is not necessary for the 

accused to plead in so many words that he acted in self-

defence. If the circumstances show that the right of private 

defence was legitimately exercised, it is open to the court to 

consider such a plea. In a given case the court can consider it 

even if the accused has not taken it, if the same is available to 

be considered from the material on record. Under Section 105 

of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (in short "the Evidence Act"), 

the burden of proof is on the accused, who sets off the plea of 

self-defence, and, in absence of proof, it is not possible for the 

court to presume the truth of the plea of self-defence. The court 

shall presume the absence of such circumstances. It is for the 

accused to place necessary material on record either by 

himself adducing positive evidence or by eliciting necessary 

facts from the witnesses examined for the prosecution. An 

accused taking the plea of the right of private defence is not 

required to call evidence; he can establish his plea by 

reference to circumstances transpiring from the prosecution 

evidence itself. The question in such a case would be a 

question of assessing the true effect of the prosecution 

evidence, and not a question of the accused discharging any 

burden. Where the right of private defence is pleaded, the 

defence must be a reasonable and probable version satisfying 

the court that the harm caused by the accused was necessary 

for either warding off the attack or for forestalling the further 

reasonable apprehension from the side of the accused. The 

burden of establishing the plea of self-defence is on the 

accused and the burden stands discharged by showing 

preponderance of probabilities in favour of that plea on the 

basis of the material on record. (See Munshi Ram v. Delhi 

Admn. [AIR 1968 SC 702 : 1968 Cri LJ 806] , State of Gujarat 

v. Bai Fatima [(1975) 2 SCC 7 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 384 : AIR 1975 

SC 1478] , State of U.P. v. Mohd. Musheer Khan [(1977) 3 SCC

85 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

635 : AIR 1979 SC 577] .) Sections 100 to 101 define the 

extent of the right of private defence of body. If a person has a 

right of private defence of body under Section 97, that right 

extends under Section 100 to causing death if there is 

reasonable apprehension that death or grievous hurt would be 

the consequence of the assault. The oft-quoted observation of 

this Court in Salim Zia v. State of U.P. [(1979) 2 SCC 648 : 

1979 SCC (Cri) 568 : AIR 1979 SC 391] runs as follows: (SCC 

p. 654, para 9) 

"It is true that the burden on an accused person to 

establish the plea of self-defence is not as onerous as the one 

which lies on the prosecution and that while the prosecution is 

required to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the 

accused need not establish the plea to the hilt and may 

discharge his onus by establishing a mere preponderance of 

probabilities either by laying basis for that plea in the cross-

examination of prosecution witnesses or by adducing defence 

evidence." 

The accused need not prove the existence of the right of 

private defence beyond reasonable doubt. It is enough for him 

to show as in a civil case that the preponderance of 

probabilities is in favour of his plea." 

107. In view of the categorical confession of Suren Rai that it 

was he who had assaulted the deceased thrice with a 

"khukuri" after he was provoked to a fight and hurled the 

"khukuri" at him by the deceased, although Mr. B. Sharma has 

raised the plea of private defence during the hearing of the 

present appeal as an alternative argument, it is considered 

necessary to examine the same. 


86 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

108. In re: Darshan Singh v. State of Punjab 22 the Supreme 

Court would hold: 

"58. The following principles emerge on scrutiny of the 

following judgments: 

(i) Self-preservation is the basic human instinct and is duly 

recognised by the criminal jurisprudence of all civilised 

countries. All free, democratic and civilised countries recognise 

the right of private defence within certain reasonable limits. 

(ii) The right of private defence is available only to one who is 

suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an 

impending danger and not of self-creation. 

(iii) A mere reasonable apprehension is enough to put the right 

of self-defence into operation. In other words, it is not 

necessary that there should be an actual commission of the 

offence in order to give rise to the right of private defence. It is 

enough if the accused apprehended that such an offence is 

contemplated and it is likely to be committed if the right of 

private defence is not exercised. 

(iv) The right of private defence commences as soon as a 

reasonable apprehension arises and it is coterminous with the 

duration of such apprehension. 

(v) It is unrealistic to expect a person under assault to 

modulate his defence step by step with any arithmetical 

exactitude. 

(vi) In private defence the force used by the accused ought not 

to be wholly disproportionate or much greater than necessary 

for protection of the person or property. 

(vii) It is well settled that even if the accused does not plead 

self-defence, it is open to consider such a plea if the same 

arises from the material on record. 

22 (2010) 2 SCC 333 


87 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

(viii) The accused need not prove the existence of the right of 

private defence beyond reasonable doubt. 

(ix) The Penal Code confers the right of private defence only 

when that unlawful or wrongful act is an offence. 

(x) A person who is in imminent and reasonable danger of 

losing his life or limb may in exercise of self-defence inflict any 

harm even extending to death on his assailant either when the 

assault is attempted or directly threatened." 

109. Padam Kumar Rai would clearly depose that Suren Rai, 

at around 8.00 p.m. on 23.05.2013, would request him to 

pacify the deceased as he was provoking him into a fight 

regarding his mobile phone. Padam Kumar Rai would also 

depose that Suren Rai had come following him to his house 

after he had gone to the temporary shed and told them not to 

fight and look for the mobile instead, when he would ask 

Suren Rai whether the mobile had been found. The fact that 

the deceased had lost his mobile and was blaming Suren Rai 

for it is evident from the deposition of Padam Kumar Rai. The 

fact there was an altercation between the deceased and Suren 

Rai is also evident. We have found that the confession to be 

true and voluntary. We have also found that the retraction was 

an afterthought and had no basis. The judicial confession of 

Suren Rai discloses that the deceased had provoked him to a 

fight. This confessional statement corroborates the evidence of 

Padam Kumar Rai that Suren Rai had complained to him 


88 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

about the deceased provoking him to a fight. Although we are 

aware that a retracted confession if found to be corroborative 

in material particulars it may be the basis of conviction we are 

also alive to the rule that no judgment of conviction shall be 

passed on an uncorroborated retracted confession. We are also 

alive to the rule that although retracted confession is 

admissible, the same should be looked at with some amount of 

suspicion-a stronger suspicion then that which is attached to 

the confession of an approver who leads evidence in the Court. 

In the circumstances, we examine the confession for the 

limited purpose of examining the alternative plea of Mr. B. 

Sharma of the right of private defence. Suren Rai in his 

confession would state that the deceased, after provoking him 

to a fight, had hurled the "khukuri" at him with the intention 

to kill him. Suren Rai would also state in his confession that 

he took the "khukuri" from the deceased. It is evident that, 

therefore, the "khukuri" was no longer with the deceased. 

110. The Supreme Court in re: Buta Singh v. State of Punjab 23 

would hold: 

"A person who is apprehending death or bodily injury cannot 

weigh in golden scales on the spur of the moment and in the heat of 

circumstances, the number of injuries required to disarm the 

assailant who are armed with weapons. In moments of excitement 

and disturbed mental equilibrium it is often difficult to expect the 

parties to preserve composure and use only so much force in 

retaliation commensurate with the danger apprehended to him. 

23 (1991) 12 SCC 612 


89 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

Where assault is imminent by use of force, it would be lawful to 

repel the force in self-defence and the right of private defence 

commences, as soon as the threat becomes so imminent. Such 

situations have to be pragmatically viewed and not with high-

powered spectacles or microscopes to detect slight or even marginal 

overstepping. Due weightage has to be given to, and hypertechnical 

approach has to be avoided in considering what happens on the 

spur of the moment on the spot and keeping in view normal human 

reaction and conduct, where self-preservation is the paramount 

consideration. But, if the fact situation shows that in the guise of 

self-preservation, what really has been done is to assault the 

original aggressor, even after the cause of reasonable apprehension 

has disappeared, the plea of right of private defence can legitimately 

be negative. The court dealing with the plea has to weigh the 

material to conclude whether the plea is acceptable. It is essentially 

a finding of fact." 

111. Dr. O. T. Lepcha who conducted the post-mortem would 

find six anti-mortem injuries on the deceased as stated above. 

Each of the said injuries are severe and in the neck region. 

Section 102 of IPC provides that the right of private defence of 

the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of 

danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit 

the offence though the offence may not have been committed; 

and it continues as long as such apprehension of danger to 

the body continues. The moment Suren Rai had taken the 

"khukuri" from the deceased the threat was over. It may be 

true that in the spur of the moment, and in view of the 

provocation, the attempted assault by the deceased with a 

"khukuri" and his apprehension of the imminent danger on his 


90 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

life, Suren Rai may have taken the "khukuri" and assaulted 

the deceased. It is true that it is unrealistic to expect a person 

under assault to modulate his defence step by step with an 

arithmetical exactitude. However, the multiple and severe anti-

mortem injuries on the deceased coupled with the fact that 

Suren Rai after commission of the act ran away from the scene 

of the crime even while the deceased would be still alive 

makes it unequivocally clear that Suren Rai had exceeded his 

right of self defence. 

112. Section 299 IPC, 1860 provides:-

"299. Culpable homicide.-Whoever causes death by 
doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the 
intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause 
death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to 
cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide." 

113. Section 300 IPC, 1860 provides:-

"300. Murder.-Except in the cases hereinafter 

excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the 

death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, 

or-

(Secondly) -If it is done with the intention of causing 

such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause 

the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or-

(Thirdly) -If it is done with the intention of causing 

bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to 

be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to 

cause death, or-

(Fourthly) -If the person committing the act knows 

that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all 


91 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to 

cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for 

incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as 

aforesaid." 

Exception 1.-When culpable homicide is not 

murder.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, 

whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and 

sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave 

the provocation or causes the death of any other person by 

mistake or accident. 

The above exception is subject to the following 

provisos:-

(First) -That the provocation is not sought or 

voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or 

doing harm to any person. 

(Secondly) -That the provocation is not given by 

anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant 

in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. 

(Thirdly) -That the provocation is not given by 

anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private 

defence. 

Explanation.-Whether the provocation was grave and 

sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to 

murder is a question of fact 

Exception 2.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the 

offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private 

defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him 

by law and causes the death of the person against whom he 

is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and 

without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary 

for the purpose of such defence. Illustration Z attempts to 

horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt 

to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A 

believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent 


92 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not 

committed murder, but only culpable homicide. 

Exception 3.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the 

offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant 

acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the 

powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an 

act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and 

necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public 

servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death 

is caused. 

Exception 4.-Culpable homicide is not murder if it is 

committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat 

of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender 

having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual 

manner. Explanation.-It is immaterial in such cases which 

party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. 

Exception 5.-Culpable homicide is not murder when 

the person whose death is caused, being above the age of 

eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with 

his own consent." 

114. In re: Suresh Singhal v. State (Delhi Administration) 24 the 

Supreme Court would examine the case in which the accused 

had exceeded the right of private defence. In the said case the 

accused, Suresh Singhal was sought to be strangulated by the 

deceased. Suresh Singhal would reach for his revolver, upon 

which the deceased would release him and turn around to run 

away. At this point the accused would shoot him, either still 

lying down or having got up. The Supreme Court would hold 

that the accused had reasonably apprehended danger to his 

24 (2017) 2 SCC 737 


93 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

life on being strangulated which would be reasonable 

apprehension to put the right of self defence into operation. In 

such situation on the face of imminent and reasonable danger 

of losing life or limb the accused may in exercise of self defence 

inflict any harm even extending to death on his assailant. The 

Supreme Court would find that the accused had been put in 

such a position. The Supreme Court would, however, hold that 

the accused had exceeded the power given to him by law in 

order to defend himself although the exercise of the right was 

in good faith, in his own defence and without premeditation. 

The Supreme Court would, thus, hold that the homicide does 

not amount to murder in view of exception 2 of Section 300 

IPC, 1860 and that the homicide falls within exception 4 of 

Section 300 IPC, 1860 and does not amount to murder. In 

such circumstances the Supreme Court would hold:-

"32. In these circumstances, we are of the view that Suresh 

Singhal is undoubtedly guilty of causing death to Shyam Sunder 

with the intention of causing death or of causing such bodily injury 

as is likely to cause death and therefore guilty of the offence under 

Section 304 IPC. We are informed that the appellant has already 

undergone a sentence of 13½ years as on date. We thus sentence 

him to the period already undergone." 

115. In re: Naveen Chandra v. State of Uttaranchal 25 the 

Supreme Court would examine a situation where the accused 

would while exercising his right of private defence, exceeded by 

25 (2009) 16 SCC 449 


94 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

continuing attacks after threat to life had seized. The Supreme 

Court would draw the distinction between the first and the 

fourth exception of Section 300 IPC thus: 

"12. "17. The Fourth Exception of Section 300 IPC covers acts 

done in a sudden fight. The said exception deals with a case of 

prosecution (sic provocation) not covered by the First Exception, after 

which its place would have been more appropriate. The exception is 

founded upon the same principle, for in both there is absence of 

premeditation. But, while in the case of Exception 1 there is total 

deprivation of self-control, in case of Exception 4, there is only that 

heat of passion which clouds men's sober reason and urges them to 

deeds which they would not otherwise do. There is provocation in 

Exception 4 as in Exception 1; but the injury done is not the direct 

consequence of that provocation. In fact, Exception 4 deals with 

cases in which notwithstanding that a blow may have been struck, 

or some provocation given in the origin of the dispute or in whatever 

way the quarrel may have originated, yet the subsequent conduct of 

both parties puts them in respect of guilt upon equal footing. A 

'sudden fight' implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. 

The homicide committed is then clearly not traceable to unilateral 

provocation, nor in such cases could the whole blame be placed on 

one side. For if it were so, the exception more appropriately 

applicable would be Exception 1. 

18. The help of Exception 4 can be invoked if death is caused 

(a) without premeditation; (b) in a sudden fight; (c) without the 

offender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or 

unusual manner; and (d) the fight must have been with the person 

killed. To bring a case within Exception 4, all the ingredients 

mentioned in it must be found. It is to be noted that the 'fight' 

occurring in Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC is not defined in IPC. It 

takes two to make a fight. Heat of passion requires that there must 

be no time for the passions to cool down and in this case, the parties 

had worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal 

altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat between two and 

more persons whether with or without weapons. It is not possible to 


95 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

enunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a 

sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and whether a quarrel is 

sudden or not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts of 

each case. For the application of Exception 4, it is not sufficient to 

show that there was a sudden quarrel and there was no 

premeditation. It must further be shown that the offender has not 

taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. The 

expression 'undue advantage' as used in the provision means 

'unfair advantage'. 

19. Where the offender takes undue advantage or has acted 

in a cruel or unusual manner, the benefit of Exception 4 cannot be 

given to him. If the weapon used or the manner of attack by the 

assailant is out of all proportion, that circumstance must be taken 

into consideration to decide whether undue advantage has been 

taken. In Kikar Singh v. State ofRajasthan [(1993) 4 SCC 238 : 1993 

SCC (Cri) 1156 : AIR 1993 SC 2426] it was held that if the accused 

used deadly weapons against the unarmed man and struck a blow 

on the head it must be held that by using the blows with the 

knowledge that they were likely to cause death he had taken undue 

advantage. In the instant case blows on vital parts of unarmed 

persons were given with brutality. The abdomens of two deceased 

persons were ripped open and internal organs had come out. In view 

of the aforesaid factual position, Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC has 

been rightly held to be inapplicable." 

The above position was highlighted in Babulal Bhagwan 

Khandare v. State of Maharashtra [(2005) 10 SCC 404 : 2005 SCC 

(Cri) 1553] , at SCC pp. 410-11, paras 17-19. 

13. Considering the background facts in the backdrop of the 

legal principles as set out above, the inevitable conclusion is that 

Fourth Exception to Section 300 IPC does not apply" 

116. In re: Naveen Chandra (supra) was a case in which the 

Trial Court had convicted the accused under Section 302 IPC 

and awarded the death sentence which led to a reference 


96 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

before the High Court for confirmation in terms of Section 366 

Cr.P.C. The High Court converted the death sentence to life 

imprisonment partly allowing the appeal. The case would 

relate to an altercation between two sets of family members. It 

was alleged that the appellant before the Supreme Court, 

Naveen Chandra rushed and injured the deceased on his head 

with a "khukuri". When the Appellant would be asked to spare 

the deceased the Appellant would attack the said persons too 

and injured them. The deceased would succumb to his injuries 

on the spot. 

117. We find that the deceased had blamed Suren Rai for the 

loss of his mobile. We also find that the deceased had more 

than once provoked Suren Rai. Considering the confession of 

Suren Rai it seems that the deceased had provoked Suren Rai 

into a fight and hurled a "khukuri" at him on which Suren Rai 

had grabbed the "khukuri" from him and assaulted the 

deceased multiple times and severely which caused the death 

of the deceased. There was reasonable apprehension of danger 

to Suren Rai's life which would put the right of self defence 

into operation giving him the right to inflict any harm even 

extending to death. The multiple and gaping chop wounds on 

the back of the neck, below the skull causing the six severe 

anti-mortem injuries with the "khukuri", a sharp moderately 

heavy weapon and his running away whilst the deceased was 


97 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

still alive makes us firmly believe that Suren Rai exceeded the 

power given to him by law in order to defend himself although 

the exercise of the right, quite clearly, was done whilst 

deprived of the power of self control by grave and sudden 

provocation in his own defence and without premeditation. 

The homicide therefore does not amount to murder in view of 

exception 1 of Section 300 IPC, 1860. We are of the view that 

Suren Rai is guilty of causing death of the deceased with the 

intention of causing death or of causing such bodily injury as 

is likely to cause death and therefore guilty of the offence 

under Section 304 IPC, 1860. Resultantly, Suren Rai is 

convicted for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting 

to murder under paragraph 1 of Section 304 IPC, 1860. The 

appeal against conviction is allowed. The acquittal of the 

Respondent vide impugned judgment dated 29.02.2016 passed 

by the Learned Sessions Judge, West Sikkim at Gyalshing is 

set aside. 

118. As this Court is reversing a judgment of acquittal in 

favour of the Respondent and convicting him we deem it 

appropriate to grant a hearing to the Respondent on the 

quantum of sentence. Accordingly the Respondent shall be 

produced before this Court on 11.06.2018 and heard on the 

quantum of sentence. 


98 

Crl. Appeal No. 17 of 2016 
State of Sikkim vs. Suren Rai 

119. Certified copies of this judgment shall be furnished free 

of cost to the Respondent and also forwarded to the Court of 

the Learned Sessions Judge, West Sikkim at Gyalshing 

forthwith.
